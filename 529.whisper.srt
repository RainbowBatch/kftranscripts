2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,920
I love knowledgefight.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,960
I love knowledgefight.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,080
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.

Red alert, red alert, red alert.

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Need, need money.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,040
Red alert, red alert, red alert.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,360
Andy and Kansas, Andy and...

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,640
Stop it.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,280
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,520
It's time to pray.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,320
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,360
Hello Alex, I'm a system caller and I'm a huge fan.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I love your world.

I love you.

I love you.

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Hey everybody!

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Welcome back to Knowledge Right, I'm Dan.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm Jordan!

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,040
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Alex Jones.

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Jordan.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Dan!

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Jordan.

32
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
I have a quick question for you.

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
What's up?

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
What's your bright spot today?

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
My bright spot today, Jordan, is something interesting.

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
I learned something.

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Indeed.

38
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
I was unaware of this.

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,640
Is that your first time in a long time learning something?

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
I listen to Alex a lot, so yes.

41
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Yeah, that's what I thought.

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Yeah, I haven't learned shit from that guy.

43
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,640
I learned something that honestly I had every reason to know before, and I don't know why

44
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,800
I didn't quite frankly, but as it turns out, I only know when things come to our P.O. box

45
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,760
because I get an alert from the store.

46
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Sure.

47
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,240
Where the box is.

48
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,800
They don't send you alerts when letters come.

49
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Oh!

50
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,720
I didn't know that, and unless the person who's giving you the packages checks the mailbox,

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
you'll never know.

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
That's not fair!

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
No.

54
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
That's not fair!

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,240
I found a bunch of letters in there the last time I went to pick up packages, and also

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,220
we're way behind on zapping up the mailbag, so we'll get around to opening some of that

57
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,800
up in the near future, but on the last trip I went down there, I got to these letters,

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,400
and I got a particularly amazing letter from someone who I just want to call Dr. Justin.

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
That's what I was going to say.

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Dr. Justin to protect everyone's anonymity and their privacy.

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,160
I feel like this letter is delayed because I have no idea when things come into the mailbox,

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
but it was just amazing.

63
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,160
It doesn't get more us than to not know when mail is.

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,080
Just an amazing letter, and I appreciate it so much, it really meant a lot, and has been

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
so thank you.

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,160
Yeah, no, just tears, just tears, weeping, just non-stop.

67
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,240
Thanks for sharing that letter with us, Dr. Justin, and congratulations on your doctor-ness.

68
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Hell yeah.

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,640
How about you?

70
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,360
My bright spot, Dan, is I have finally finished my two months long project, and I'm done with

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Taylor Swift.

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Okay.

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
For good.

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
It's over.

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
You've listened to the whole catalog.

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,920
I've listened to every one of her albums, and I'm done.

77
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm pretty proud of myself.

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
How do you feel?

79
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Fine.

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,640
Yeah, I expected that was probably the answer.

81
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,120
I've intentionally not read anything you've written about Taylor Swift because I don't

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
want to get mad at you.

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Of course.

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
I've never read just this before.

85
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,600
I don't want to pick a fight.

86
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,760
I don't want to be like, look, I love blank space.

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't want to talk about it.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sure.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I understand.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,320
I mean, it's unfair.

91
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
I wasn't trying to pick a fight.

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,520
I was trying to go so far over the top, no one could possibly imagine that I would be

93
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
fighting.

94
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,920
At a certain point, I insisted that the guy who wrote Bloodsport was the writer of one

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
of her songs.

96
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Do you understand?

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,080
I'm not going for realism here.

98
00:03:53,080 --> 00:04:01,480
I think the audience wants to know what your next extended exercise in misogyny will be.

99
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,880
Maybe a bunch of articles about Mariah Carey not being as good as everyone thinks.

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,920
Well, that would just be impossible because Mariah Carey is exactly as good as everyone

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
thinks, Dan.

102
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,360
Maybe the next series could be about Pink.

103
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,640
Now you're just finding people you're defensive about now.

104
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,200
I like Mariah Carey.

105
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,540
Everybody likes Mariah Carey.

106
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Everybody likes Pink.

107
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
I don't know.

108
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,960
I've met some Pink haters in my life.

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
That's fair.

110
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,920
Well, congratulations on finishing a project.

111
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
It's over with.

112
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Yes.

113
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm proud of myself.

114
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Yes.

115
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Let's not talk about it again.

116
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Ever again.

117
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,680
Jordan, something we are going to talk about is Alex Jones today.

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Oh yeah.

119
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,160
You're going to be talking about the February 8th, 2021 Blackjack episode.

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,600
No, I'm not even, I didn't even have a chance.

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,580
I was watching your lips move and I was like, boo, and you had already finished.

122
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,040
When you see a pro like me, everything happens in slow motion.

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,440
So no matter how many times I sit there and think in my head, I know he's about to say

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
the date.

125
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm still caught by surprise every time.

126
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,120
It's also not quite fair because I can just keep talking.

127
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Yes, that's true.

128
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I can say 21 Blackjack.

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Yes.

130
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,320
I can say it as one word almost even.

131
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,120
You're playing at a disadvantage, but I'm also very good at it.

132
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Yeah, exactly.

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,380
There's the double whammy.

134
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
This is Monday.

135
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,800
We're talking about the day after the Super Bowl.

136
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Right.

137
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
There'll be some thoughts on that.

138
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I imagine so.

139
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,920
Oh, Nelly, are there some thoughts on that?

140
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Oh boy.

141
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,480
But more importantly, I think there's a big broad push that Alex is engaging in that I

142
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,760
think will be the direction of his content in the near future.

143
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,880
And before we get down to business on that episode, Jordan, let's take a moment to say

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
thanks to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Oh, that's a great idea.

146
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,160
So first, Commie Wizzo.

147
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Thank you so much.

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
You are now a policy wonk.

149
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm a policy wonk.

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
Thank you very much, Commie Wizzo.

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,200
I've never seen The Room.

152
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,880
That's a, well, he wrote The Mark's Room, I believe.

153
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Oh yeah, it could be.

154
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,400
Have you ever, have you ever seen The Room?

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Mm-hmm.

156
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,200
Yeah, I think everybody but me has.

157
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
It's very funny.

158
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Yeah, that's why I don't want to see it.

159
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
I understand.

160
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,720
It'll actually make you sad and you won't like it.

161
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,880
You will not appreciate it.

162
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,600
You'll be like, this guy was trying so hard and it's a bad movie.

163
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,080
I don't know if I will.

164
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't like everything that I've seen surrounding it and so I'm not interested in what germinated

165
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,140
all of these plants.

166
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,140
That's fair.

167
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
That's fair.

168
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,000
Anyway, Lady the Dog runs the simulation.

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you so much.

170
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You are now a policy wonk.

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm a policy wonk.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,440
Thank you very much, Lady the Dog.

173
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Thank you.

174
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,080
Next, Biggles Dictates a Letter.

175
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Thank you so much.

176
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
You are now a policy wonk.

177
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm a policy wonk.

178
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,360
Thank you very much, Biggles.

179
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Thank you.

180
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,560
Next, Ima Holler Back Girl.

181
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Thank you so much.

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
You are now a policy wonk.

183
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm a policy wonk.

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Thank you very much.

185
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,200
Don't you write a series about Gwen Stefani being bad.

186
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I might.

187
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Actually, she...

188
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Alright.

189
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,160
Next, Tomorrow's Warm Flat Seltzer.

190
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Thank you so much.

191
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
You are now a policy wonk.

192
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
I'm a policy wonk.

193
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
Thank you very much.

194
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Thank you so much.

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,720
Next, Joined Just to Ask What the Hell Do You Have Against Accountants?

196
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,680
We're Not All Oogie Boogie Sympathizers.

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Thank you so much.

198
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
You are now a policy wonk.

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm a policy wonk.

200
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Thank you very much.

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
I believe that's a question for you, George.

202
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
I didn't know that.

203
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
I'm speaking as a former accountant.

204
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
I don't have anything against accountants.

205
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,280
I don't have anything against accountants.

206
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,260
I'm just saying that you can't be both an accountant and a boogie boy.

207
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,480
I feel like that's right.

208
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
You can be a boogie boarder.

209
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Well, that's...

210
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
See?

211
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Of course.

212
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
And you'd be a cool accountant.

213
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Yeah.

214
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
It might be very cool for an accountant.

215
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,640
Then finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated

216
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Level.

217
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I appreciate that very much.

218
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
So, Introskipping Joe.

219
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Thank you so much.

220
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
You are now a technocrat.

221
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,920
And Grim Squeaker.

222
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Thank you so much.

223
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
You are now a technocrat.

224
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
I'm a policy wonk.

225
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Crikey, mate.

226
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
That's fantastic.

227
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Have yourself a brew.

228
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
How's your 401k doing, bro?

229
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,000
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
Let's just get down to business.

231
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

232
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,440
Why you pimps so good?

233
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,080
My neck is freakishly large.

234
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,000
I declare info war on you.

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,260
Ah, yes.

236
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,520
Thank you so much, Joe, who skips the intro, and Grim Squeaker.

237
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Yes.

238
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Thank you very much to the both of you.

239
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,920
Jordan, did you watch the Super Bowl?

240
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
I did not.

241
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,520
And I'm grateful for it.

242
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Mm-hmm.

243
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Did you?

244
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
I saw some tweets.

245
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
And then, because of this episode, I watched the Halftime Show.

246
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Oh, yeah.

247
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
And I didn't watch that either.

248
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Mm-hmm.

249
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
I did not.

250
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,080
Although, I did hear that Weeknd did stuff off House of Balloons in the fucking...

251
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
What does that mean?

252
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,120
House of Balloons was his first little EP that came out.

253
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Oh, probably.

254
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
And it is...

255
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
He had a lot of...

256
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
He did a lot of songs.

257
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
It was...

259
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,760
Yeah, that one was, like, really dark and just basically about doing coke and fucking

260
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
the whole time.

261
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,480
Well, there's that song, like, I can't feel my face when I'm with you.

262
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
That was about drugs, right?

263
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
That's all about drugs.

265
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
That's what I thought.

266
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
I don't know that to be true.

267
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I just think I've heard that somewhere.

268
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Yeah.

269
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah, he did that for sure.

270
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Yeah.

271
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Cool.

272
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,480
And then, uh, Starboy, except, like, the chorus of that is...

273
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Was Daph Monk there?

274
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,800
No, they were not, and I think some people were mad about that.

275
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Yeah, well, I would be.

276
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,680
But the chorus is, I'm a motherfucking Starboy.

277
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,840
He is a motherfucking Starboy.

278
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,160
You can't say that in the Superboy.

279
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Yes, you can.

280
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Why not?

281
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,800
So you have to say, I'm a Starboy.

282
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
This sucks.

283
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh, man.

284
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,360
Uh, I watched that halftime show, and we'll get to that at the end of this episode a little

285
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
bit.

286
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,480
But the only thing I was thinking was, like, I can't believe that The Weeknd is this big

287
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
of a star.

288
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah.

289
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Like, I'm nothing against it.

290
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
He seems like a talented guy.

291
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
He's great.

292
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,880
But just, like, I'm so disconnected from pop culture that I'm, like, wow.

293
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,160
There's no surprise guests.

294
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,080
There's no, like, I remember the days of halftime shows when it's, like, one star is not enough.

295
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Five people.

296
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Five different bands.

297
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,480
Aerosmith's gonna be there.

298
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Metallica's gonna play a duet with Katy Perry, who gives a fuck.

299
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,240
In Sync is gonna come out of the floor.

300
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Exactly.

301
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
And then Nelly's gonna parachute in.

302
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
Shit comes out of the floor at the Super Bowl.

303
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
That's math.

304
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Yeah.

305
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
And it was just The Weeknd.

306
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
It was a fine performance.

307
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
I didn't like all the songs.

308
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,560
I think maybe some were a little bit boring, but, hey, I'm not the target demo.

309
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,960
You didn't write nine different installments of something about it, so you're fine.

310
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,640
Although, give me time.

311
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,600
Your turn next, buddy.

312
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,720
So yeah.

313
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
That's about all I saw.

314
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,960
I guess I saw a little, like, a couple of, like, choice plays, like at Mahomes Pass where

315
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
he was falling.

316
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
Pretty amazing stuff.

318
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,840
I don't know, I don't really have any strong feelings about it.

319
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,080
The game, I guess I'm from Missouri, so I should love the Chiefs.

320
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
I have some friends who really like the Chiefs, so good for them.

321
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
All right.

322
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Yeah.

323
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Anyway.

324
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,040
We start with Alex in an out of context drop.

325
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,840
That is a rare situation where I'm going to give you a little question ahead of time about

326
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,480
this out of context drop.

327
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,160
He's telling somebody to burn in hell, and I'd like you to try and guess who he wants

328
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
to burn in hell.

329
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
All right.

330
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
That is a lot.

331
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
No, you have to guess.

332
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Oh, before?

333
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Yes.

334
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,600
I thought you were going to guess, okay.

335
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Let's see.

336
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,360
And this is after the Super Bowl.

337
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,000
I am going to go with, why not Bill Gates?

338
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,720
You're going to burn in hell, Springsteen, burn in hell.

339
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Nope.

340
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Bruce Springsteen's going to burn in hell.

341
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,240
Did he just find out that Bruce Springsteen doesn't like the far right?

342
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,320
Did he just learn that Born in the USA- I was going to say, did he just find out about

343
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Born in the USA?

344
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
He might have.

345
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,820
He did not like that commercial.

346
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,720
Someone explained the song to me, and now I'm mad.

347
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,520
He resented the commercial, I guess it was a General Motors commercial, where Bruce Springsteen

348
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,920
was doing some voiceover talking about how there's a church in the middle of Kansas,

349
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,400
right in the middle of America.

350
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,320
It's hard to get to the middle, but it's like-

351
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Oh boy.

352
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Oh boy.

353
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,480
That somehow that pissed off Alex to the point where Bruce Springsteen's going to burn in

354
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
hell.

355
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
All right.

356
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Everybody should burn their Jeeps.

357
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Okay.

358
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
I'm fine with that.

359
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Whatever.

360
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Anyway.

361
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,320
There's never less carbon in the atmosphere to burn your Jeep.

362
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,280
But Alex thinks we need all the carbon.

363
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Oh, that's true.

364
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,120
So, we start off the show, and Alex is in the exact mode that I like him to be in.

365
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,720
This is when I know, okay, this show's going to be weird.

366
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Okay.

367
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,000
I tend to get up here on air and get really excited and cover a lot of news and still

368
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,040
kind of not get to all the points I really want to break down, so I'm going to try my

369
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,000
best here today to just be calm and we'll see how long that lasts and just cover all

370
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,080
of this, but it is becoming extremely, extremely clear exactly what is going on and what is

371
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
unfolding.

372
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Now-

373
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Uh-huh.

374
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:51,320
Let me just, I can't do the show right now, I just can't do it, I got to reset, I got

375
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
to go rebroadcast.

376
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,200
I mean, this is all just too heavy, this is all too insane, this is all too serious, and

377
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,600
I just need people to know that this is not a game, okay?

378
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Okay.

379
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Okay.

380
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I'm coming out of the gates, a lot of energy, and then within a minute, I can't do this.

381
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I can't do this.

382
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Fuck it, ah shit.

383
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,240
Look, we're going to focus, we're going to calm down, I'm just going to get through this.

384
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
I quit.

385
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,760
I am not going to be here for any longer, I'm done.

386
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Fuck this.

387
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
I got to get out of here.

388
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,080
He doesn't actually go to rebroadcast, but he does play some special reports.

389
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
So funny.

390
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,520
But not before teasing a little bit of what's coming up on the show.

391
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Sure.

392
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,000
And I learned something interesting because of his tease.

393
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay.

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,040
The writer is going to be in studio with us, he's a great author and researcher and knows

395
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
his stuff.

396
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,600
He's done more deep research on the globalist end game than even I have because-

397
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Did he make a movie about it?

398
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,960
I did most of my research 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, because I already

399
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,200
know their operation, but he studies it going back as well, hundreds of years, but then

400
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,360
on their current stuff.

401
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,980
So I kind of use him as a Reader's Digest with his show and the things he does to go

402
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,320
hear him boil down these books he's reading like every day, new ones, where they're going

403
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,620
to just tear us apart and put us in camps and brain damage us and sterilize us and they're

404
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,880
just foaming at the mouth like satanic piranhas.

405
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,960
It's hard for me to read their stuff, but he does it and then boils it down.

406
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,980
Alex could have probably just said it's hard for him to read.

407
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,280
It is hard for me to read is all I heard in that sentence.

408
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,760
So yeah, apparently Alex doesn't read primary sources anymore, but pretends to pretty extensively

409
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
on air.

410
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,640
I can't read all this stuff, I just accept Jay Dyer.

411
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,760
You can't say yesterday I do all my own research and then say today I can't really do any research

412
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,400
so I just read this guy.

413
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Yeah.

414
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
That's not fair.

415
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,320
And then I accept whatever interpretations he apparently has about primary sources that

416
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,700
he probably didn't read either.

417
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Are you kidding me?

418
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,080
This man claims to read a book a day.

419
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,000
How could I not take everything he says at face value, Dan?

420
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Certainly.

421
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Ah!

422
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So I got excited.

423
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,160
I'm like, Jay Dyer, alright, I can't wait to assess you.

424
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,680
I've heard him bit on the show before, he's boring and stupid, but I was like, well, alright,

425
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,960
I'll get excited for that.

426
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,680
Alex is in a bad mood.

427
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,720
He clearly wants to storm off the show.

428
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Oh yeah.

429
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,640
He's got this guy coming up that I think I can sink my teeth into and instead Alex just

430
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,680
like he plays a special report about Marjorie Taylor Greene and like it's this weird, weird

431
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,240
thing where John Bowne, one of Alex's employees, is trying to make an argument that Marjorie

432
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:42,400
Taylor Greene having these committee appointments taken away is somehow a purge of all conservatives.

433
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Yes.

434
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,800
And it seems like a dumb argument to make.

435
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
It seems like a bad.

436
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Oh yeah.

437
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,300
Because what you're doing is essentially equating whatever you believe in and your rhetoric

438
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,560
with her and if you believe, if you want to, if you want to make that association you're

439
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
more than welcome to.

440
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Yeah.

441
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
That's a losing argument.

442
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,840
It might not work well.

443
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,320
And then like this argument extends to like what we need to do is we need to get them

444
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,680
off of their committees.

445
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Okay.

446
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
And it's like, all right, go try.

447
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Fine.

448
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah.

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's called being politically active.

450
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,920
If you want to start a petition.

451
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,220
You can, you can do that.

452
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
You can vote.

453
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
We vote on things.

454
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
Call your legislature.

455
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Yeah.

456
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,220
Just go say vote.

457
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Not hard.

458
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Yeah.

459
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
This is a dumb video.

460
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Anyway, I got bored with that.

461
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,760
What I'm always not bored with is there's some more commercials.

462
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Okay.

463
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,120
Uh, last episode we talked about Alex's commercials and it was a big hit and I thought we need

464
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,720
a little more of a taste of these commercials.

465
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,920
I have a question cause I have not heard of any really standout commercials, Dan from

466
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
the Superbowl.

467
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,720
I think we won.

468
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,920
I think we had the best commercials of a Superbowl Sunday.

469
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Yeah.

470
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Yeah.

471
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,200
I think, um, can't think of whatever, like an advertising publication, but that, that

472
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,120
I think they would give the crown to Alex.

473
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I think they would have to.

474
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Yeah.

475
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Better than that Oatly commercial.

476
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Better than the Bruce Springsteen commercial.

477
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
What are you talking about?

478
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Oh, there's a small town.

479
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,120
No, look, there's a small town.

480
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,320
That's how you do the line reading.

481
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,440
This commercial might take the cake.

482
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Okay.

483
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
I think it's my favorite.

484
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
All right.

485
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
I have to warn you.

486
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Teasing it big.

487
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,800
Jordan, it's four minutes long.

488
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,460
That's not a commercial.

489
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,120
This is a special report then.

490
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:32,200
It goes all over the place and it is so mopey and it's very, it's a bummer.

491
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Okay.

492
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,820
So it was four years ago.

493
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:42,160
I was in a custody battle with my ex wife and her lawyers were trying to introduce a

494
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:51,040
video of me like 10 years ago and I dressed up like the joker to do an anti Prozac ad.

495
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,760
I said, Oh, kids take your Prozac.

496
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:59,120
You'll see pretty colors and act all crazy because the inserts of the Prozac class of

497
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,400
drugs, anti-depressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors admit it increases suicide risk

498
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,800
and all sorts of the problems.

499
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,240
And so my lawyer at a hearing that I wasn't even at said, uh, he's playing with joker

500
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,120
there just like Jack Nicholson isn't really the joker.

501
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,840
That's not really Alex Jones.

502
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,800
This was actually a defense of introducing any video of Alex on info wars.

503
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,000
The lawyer's argument was that he's a performance artist.

504
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,680
Now he did say that it would be like compare like saying that Jack Nicholson is playing

505
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
the joker.

506
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Correct.

507
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,200
But it wasn't just about a specific video that Alex is referencing where he does have

508
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
joker makeup on.

509
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,840
He's trying to conflate those two things.

510
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,200
But yeah, I was like, Whoa, this is like the first minute of this commercial.

511
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm really struggling with the commercial aspect of this.

512
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
We'll get to it.

513
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,400
Many commercials begin with, of course, I was in a custody battle four years ago.

514
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Four years ago.

515
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Four years ago.

516
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
I was in a custody battle.

517
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,880
My lawyer said something weird and uh, so that one wasn't, that one didn't surprise

518
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
me at all.

519
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,400
Uh, in order for me to not have my kids taken away from me, my lawyer need to make a really,

520
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:14,960
uh, really desperate argument to keep my public persona out of court so I wouldn't have to

521
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,520
answer for why I scream about how my enemies are demons and literal devils and how I'm

522
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
a psychic.

523
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,520
And I wouldn't have to answer any questions about that because I'm a performance artist,

524
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,840
but technically I don't want you, my audience to think that because then the sales pitch

525
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
won't work.

526
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,240
But anyway, have you tried Tom?

527
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,280
That's a preamble to a great commercial.

528
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Yes.

529
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Yeah.

530
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,360
And I got turned into Jones admits he's a character in court.

531
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,320
Well, I'm the opposite of a character.

532
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
I am.

533
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,800
I stand for him, I stand for how I stand.

534
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,680
I'm the most unscripted person out there.

535
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,800
That said, when I do research and I'm getting ready to do a video and I'm getting ready

536
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:02,160
to break something down, I wouldn't call it performance anxiety.

537
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,560
Instead of getting butterflies, when I get in front of a crowd, I get really hyper and

538
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
then I have all these ideas and things I want to say.

539
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,280
So I move really, really fast and sometimes you can lose all the key information and how

540
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
fast I'm moving.

541
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:24,680
But if you slowed it all down and search engine, each thing I talked about, it's all huge stuff

542
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:32,760
like world government, new world order, eugenics, agenda 21, agenda 2030, the human biological

543
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,120
diversity assessment, 2002, 1992.

544
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,520
I mean, all these things open Pandora's boxes, but, but see, I'm already getting excited.

545
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,960
We are not two minutes in.

546
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
This is not a commercial.

547
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,200
This is a voicemail on his like ex-wife's phone.

548
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,240
This is a voicemail.

549
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,040
This is something that he sent to somebody drunk at like 3 AM.

550
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Okay.

551
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,360
Listen, I'm four years ago.

552
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
All right.

553
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,620
I was in a custody battle.

554
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,320
First minute is about the custody battle stuff and how I'm real.

555
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
I'm real man.

556
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
100% real.

557
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Second minute.

558
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:14,280
Sometimes I get real excited and I just yell shit where it's time to deliver information.

559
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,880
I kind of forget what I'm doing probably because I'm on drugs.

560
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,200
If you would like to rerecord your message, please begin again at the dial tone.

561
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Let me, the time I have here, just be really straight with all this.

562
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,560
A part of me wants to not be able to continue on at this level because my body's exhausted.

563
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:41,760
My spirit's not, and I talk about all these incredible things that have happened.

564
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,560
People can now see that I wasn't exaggerating.

565
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
I wasn't lying.

566
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,680
We're in a corrupt, psychotic, anti-human world government that wants to bankrupt us

567
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,880
and make us really poor control our lives.

568
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Sure.

569
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,160
And there's this paradox where people say, well, Jones, you've got so much credibility

570
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
now.

571
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
You need to continue on.

572
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I do want to continue on.

573
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,120
It's just that I can't continue on because they took all my sponsors, took most of my

574
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,640
taking away.

575
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,040
And I've had to rely basically purely on people buying products at mfullwarestore.com.

576
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,600
So I had a lister today on the Friday show called this.

577
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
That was a great time for a plug.

578
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
I wish you'd do more and expand your network.

579
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,520
Look, I'm not complaining, but I spent about half my time trying to raise money.

580
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,200
I'd rather be on air fighting the globalists instead of trying to raise money.

581
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,680
I don't like coming to you either.

582
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,440
I'm a proud person at a certain point.

583
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,720
But look, we're all proud people.

584
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,400
The point is if you, what is happening in this fight, there's no reason for that.

585
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Things happen.

586
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
There's no reason for that.

587
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,120
You have to understand that we're all proud people.

588
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,960
You can do whatever you want and they've really helped a lot of people.

589
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
They're high quality.

590
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,720
No matter what the product is, they're all excellent.

591
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,920
And on top of it, our mission is absolutely clear.

592
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:06,560
And so I understand that it's kind of passé now because I was like, okay, Jones told

593
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
us all this.

594
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
It came true.

595
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Okay.

596
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Thank you, Jones.

597
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
What do we do?

598
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Well, we have to continue fighting into the future.

599
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,080
So it's really up to you whether we stay on air or not.

600
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,600
It's up to you whether we're able to reach out to new people.

601
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,000
So I know you already know all this stuff, but think about the new people and then just

602
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,620
understand how important it is.

603
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,840
You buy products at m4store.com.

604
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,020
They're amazing products that make your life better and they fund the M4, a 360 win.

605
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,360
So think about where we are and what you've done in front of this operation.

606
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:40,160
In advertising classes, they could break down how this is an effective call to action.

607
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,880
Here's what I'm seeing in my mind's eye.

608
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,620
End of season one of Mad Men, Don Draper is looking at that carousel and he's thinking,

609
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,960
I'm going to say everything Alex Jones is saying in this one right here.

610
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,300
Hey, look, I'm not telling you what to do.

611
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,480
You can not buy a Kodak.

612
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,240
Look, if you don't want to see these pictures, that's up to you.

613
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,960
I mean, we all like seeing pictures, but some people don't.

614
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I mean, that's fine.

615
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,560
I'm a proud man.

616
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:14,000
To a certain point, so many qualifications, so many constant like, listen, you don't have

617
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,880
to do this.

618
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:24,160
I heard that and I thought, who is in charge of quality control?

619
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,240
I don't know.

620
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,520
Who's in charge of like any of that could have gone?

621
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Here's what you could have done.

622
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,500
Are you so desperate for something to be four minutes long to fit like in a break?

623
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
The only explanation.

624
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,660
Yeah, because there was a lot of fat in there.

625
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,440
There was not a lot of substance and you know what you can do?

626
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,700
You can edit the video.

627
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,340
None of it at the end relates to what he said at the beginning.

628
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,200
At no point in time in his call to action, please go buy from Infowars store.

629
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,320
Do you need the added context of four years ago he was in a custody battle?

630
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,840
Nor do you need the second minute.

631
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,560
You don't need any.

632
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Just cut it out.

633
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Yeah.

634
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Cool.

635
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,680
I think he's having problems with employment.

636
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,200
I think maybe he does not have the most capable hands on deck.

637
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,600
I think maybe he has very few hands period.

638
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
So we get in this next clip here.

639
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,920
We get to Alex getting actually down to business and you know I think that you see him complaining

640
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,640
about Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton and straight but we also see what I think is going

641
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,640
to be the direction moving forward and how Alex is going to try and cope with the end

642
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,720
of the Trump season I guess and the only way I can express it really is I feel like we're

643
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,760
back in 2009.

644
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:58,160
And they are projecting the union psychology of the shadow onto you period.

645
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,120
You think Maxine Waters likes her evil ugly ass?

646
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
No.

647
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
What?

648
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,640
You think Nadler likes his evil ugly ass?

649
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
No.

650
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,840
You think Hillary likes her evil twisted butt?

651
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
No.

652
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
Maybe?

653
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,720
But she projects it on you because these people are not retrospective and they cannot look

654
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,040
within themselves.

655
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Introspective.

656
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Wow.

657
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Alex.

658
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,560
Knowing thyself is the highest order.

659
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Alex.

660
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Then you can know God.

661
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Alex.

662
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Once you know yourself.

663
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Alex.

664
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,440
But if you don't know yourself you don't know anything.

665
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,400
Know thyself first.

666
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,060
These people do not know who they are.

667
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,440
They don't even know where they came from or where they're going.

668
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,160
They just want to pull down everything good.

669
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,000
So just as night follows day and day follows night they are preparing massive false flags

670
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,280
in this country to blame us and they're going to try to move against us and they're going

671
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,080
to do it because they never got in trouble for all the things they did before.

672
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,440
Because the corrupt lawyer run justice department is so full of pedophiles and corrupt people

673
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,200
they literally existentially want to make a run at the American gun owner and the American

674
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,840
Christian and they're going to do it.

675
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,440
There's an overwhelming sense on this episode of feeling like exactly like the narratives

676
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
of 2009.

677
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Yeah.

678
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
They're coming for your guns.

679
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Guns.

680
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,400
They're coming for a false flag to make us look bad.

681
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Totally.

682
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:25,080
It's just it was exhausting on a certain level because it was just like I feel like we've

683
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,280
been here before.

684
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Yeah.

685
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,400
And if you were somebody who was listening to his show like I don't understand how you

686
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,920
wouldn't be like hey you've played this song before.

687
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Yeah.

688
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Yeah.

689
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Well I mean you know Fox News is going hard on hating immigrants now too so everybody's

690
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,880
trying to step back and be like remember when we could just be racist for fun?

691
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Come on guys.

692
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
This is going well.

693
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Yeah.

694
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,120
I think that there's a difference with Alex though and that is that he's playing this

695
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,120
game that he played before with the same intensity before and it didn't come true before.

696
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,400
True.

697
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,600
So or what if he just said it did?

698
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,560
Yeah I guess that is an option.

699
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,680
So it's going to be psych warfare.

700
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,040
They're going to false flag.

701
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Of course.

702
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
We've seen it all.

703
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,520
The warrior run Justice Department is so full of pedophiles and corrupt people they literally

704
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,120
existentially want to make a run at the American gun owner and the American Christian and they're

705
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,800
going to do it but they're going to do it first through psychological operations and

706
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,380
it's going to be bad.

707
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,660
It's going to be rough and you better get yourselves ready for it and you better know

708
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,120
what the different scenarios are that are going to unfold out of this and I'll cover

709
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,560
it all when we come back.

710
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,440
Separately.

711
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
We're not going to be on the air unless we have your support plus we've got great products

712
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,400
that everybody already needs.

713
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,080
You just did four minutes of a rambling nonsense commercial.

714
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,600
Sure but I mean that commercial was great.

715
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Did you hear that?

716
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,880
That was what 10 seconds tops?

717
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
It goes on from there.

718
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Oh well there we go.

719
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Never mind.

720
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
There's a bit I'm not playing for you.

721
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Damn it.

722
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Where he talks about winter sun being awesome.

723
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Okay.

724
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,760
But yeah I mean like you know you have this false flags are absolutely coming.

725
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,320
They're all going to take a run at the gun owners and Christians.

726
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,440
They hate all that is good and you know hey we got good products.

727
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,640
It's just classic ad pivot business.

728
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,520
It's just not fair.

729
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,560
They just shouldn't be allowed to just be like okay these past four years we had a grand

730
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,760
old time, ran rough shot all over your bullshit, killed a lot of people and destroyed essentially

731
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,080
anybody's faith in democracy.

732
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,320
Anyways we're going to go back to just being mad about regular stuff now.

733
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Is that fine?

734
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,800
We're just going to do what we did back then.

735
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,640
You guys seem to like us more back then right?

736
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,040
We're going to crawl in a little hole.

737
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,080
The angry tea party type us again.

738
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,680
Oh I don't like immigrants.

739
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,920
Hey doesn't everybody like the stakes being lower I guess?

740
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,600
Well yeah everything has pretend deescalated.

741
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,520
Like I thought Biden was the devil.

742
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,880
He was the devil.

743
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,320
I thought the whole idea of him getting into office was an existential threat to literally

744
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,000
everybody because he's controlled by China which is controlled by the devil and also

745
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,680
the devil's controlling a whole bunch of other things.

746
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,840
But like Alex reveals how he and his staff talk about Biden and it's like you wouldn't

747
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,680
talk this way if you actually thought he was the devil.

748
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,960
And so I remember on that same conversation on January 8th with some of my crew, some

749
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,160
of the managers, they said well don't be too down Alex.

750
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,880
You know once Trump's out and everybody doesn't think everything's fine we'll have even more

751
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,560
listeners because people are going to hate Biden.

752
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,680
And I said you mark my words as soon as that inauguration is over and Biden's sworn in

753
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:53,640
up there people are actually going to give up and they're going to actually fall away

754
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
to a great extent.

755
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,580
That's OK because we've got a bigger number than we had 20 years ago or even 10 years

756
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:04,120
ago or even five years ago but all the sunshine patriots aren't winter soldiers they're not

757
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
going to be involved.

758
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:11,840
They wanted to be part of the fantasy but it doesn't matter.

759
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,480
So Alex and his managers have a conversation and the conversation goes along the lines

760
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,240
of they think it's going to be good for business that Biden's in office and Alex says no people

761
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,220
are going to lose interest.

762
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,440
That's the way they're talking about this behind the scenes that's how they're processing

763
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
this.

764
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,960
Whether or not this is good for business it has nothing to do with their pretend nonsense

765
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,480
about Biden being the fucking devil.

766
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,080
All that is performance.

767
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,200
Anybody who thinks otherwise is I mean deluded.

768
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,280
Now at the same time there is a real world implication of a lot of this stuff and that's

769
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:53,400
where this discussion of how there's false flags coming up where that becomes really

770
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,560
important and I have some thoughts about that.

771
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Guaranteed.

772
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,220
100 percent confirmed.

773
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,360
They've done it before.

774
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,520
They stand to gain from it.

775
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,900
They have a history of doing it.

776
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,120
They have the means they have the motive and they are now pre-programming at a level I

777
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,120
haven't ever seen even before 9-11 even before Oklahoma City even before other events that

778
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,320
right wingers are going to engage in terror attacks mass shootings bombings everywhere

779
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,440
and then anyone that's pro-America or anyone that's pro-gun or anyone that's pro-life is

780
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:36,200
a terrorist and they're going to try to get the general

781
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,080
public then in mass the same ones that wear the mask the same ones that do what they're

782
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:48,720
told to then literally in a Maoist revolution not work with us not talk to us and actually

783
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,680
physically attack us and they've already beta tested the whole thing.

784
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:59,320
When Alex talks like this generally what you should take away from that is he recognizes

785
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,720
that he and his entire information economy their information space have made things too

786
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
hot.

787
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Yep.

788
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,800
They've got things too hot and stuff's gonna bubble over and they need a preemptive justification

789
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,480
and narrative for it.

790
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,000
That is all you need to hear when Alex says I guarantee false flags are coming.

791
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,880
That means hey Trump has an impeachment trial starting on Tuesday there's probably going

792
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,720
to be some fucked up shit that ends up happening.

793
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:34,080
Our people have been radicalized to the point of no return thinking that he had the election

794
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,000
stolen from him a narrative that I have been instrumental in pushing and we need to make

795
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,600
sure that all this is fake if it does happen.

796
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Yeah.

797
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,080
It's very sad.

798
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:52,200
It's not just sad it's I mean perhaps not legally criminal but at the very least morally

799
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
debased.

800
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Yes.

801
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Yeah.

802
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I would say so.

803
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,600
And it's woefully transparent too.

804
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,640
When you watch enough of him and you see these behavioral patterns it just becomes really

805
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,720
obvious that I'm not saying that like Stuart Rhodes called him and said I know someone's

806
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
gonna do something.

807
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
No no no yeah.

808
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,160
That would be conspiratorial and very irresponsible to suggest.

809
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,960
But I think that Alex knows well enough to read you know the signs that are out there.

810
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,200
I would suggest that it's more just chatter.

811
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,680
Alex is Alex is plugged into enough chatter where you're like a lot of this is too hot

812
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,520
I can see you somebody out there doing something.

813
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,600
He claims he reads the comments on Info Wars.

814
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah exactly.

815
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
So that should be some indication of the public temperature.

816
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Some people are talking.

817
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Yeah yeah exactly.

818
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,120
If he even does that.

819
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
Right.

820
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,660
But even if you don't like you don't even need to go that far to say chatter you could

821
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:45,320
just say like look at the scenario look at the world look at what's happening.

822
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,800
Look at what just happened a few weeks ago.

823
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Sure.

824
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Yeah.

825
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
There was a bombing on Christmas morning.

826
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Yeah.

827
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Yeah.

828
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Yeah.

829
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh yeah.

830
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,520
Anyway I think that that is what's going on and that is the big push that I was talking

831
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,720
about being like what Alex's content and his stuff is going to be moving forward.

832
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,400
It's going to be a lot of that like return to 2009 and then really really stress that

833
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,080
there's a fault there's false flags coming and that's just to do preemptive damage control

834
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,520
for people in those pro-Trump communities should anyone take violent action.

835
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Absolutely.

836
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,600
So all the other moves in the past that the globalist have made all just leading up to

837
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,880
this move.

838
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,220
This move right now.

839
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
This one.

840
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,880
This is a false flag that will lead to the civil war that will lead to dominoes.

841
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,660
I have a quick question before we go any further.

842
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,000
What happened to Plan B?

843
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,800
He didn't say that.

844
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Oh.

845
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,680
And Harrison Smith doesn't work at influence.

846
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Well shit.

847
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,960
In case you don't realize it they're making their big move all the other moves were probes

848
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,900
all the other moves were tests all the other moves were just beta.

849
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,600
This is the main assault.

850
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,400
They're going to blow up federal buildings they're going to shoot up colleges churches

851
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
schools malls.

852
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Then why didn't you tell us that all the other ones.

853
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,760
They're going to dump chemical weapons in lakes in reservoirs they're just going to

854
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,240
be terror attack on terror attack as the globalist chai combat combine takes America down and

855
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,840
causes a civil war.

856
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah so all the other everything was prelude.

857
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,400
All of the other ones all of the ones that I have screamed at you for 25 years being

858
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,960
the most important ones that have ever happened it turns out all of them were just probes?

859
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Yeah.

860
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Alright.

861
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,640
Curious Minds might ask is it possible that you're wrong this time too?

862
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,280
No no no no he's only been wrong every time for 25 years.

863
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,240
Is it possible that you have a currency bias that you think whatever is happening now is

864
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,400
literally the most important thing?

865
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Could be.

866
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,960
So the dominoes Jordan are essentially false flag tips over right?

867
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Sure.

868
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,960
And then it goes off and then it's used to make patriots and right wingers look bad so

869
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,920
the public turns against them.

870
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,440
Do we need help with that?

871
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,080
Seems redundant after the storming of the Capitol.

872
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,760
I think we already did it.

873
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,080
So that goes down and then there's a civil war but the civil war is only to like collapse

874
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,600
the United States.

875
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Sure.

876
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
And then death camps.

877
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Okay.

878
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,000
This is all meant to trigger the civil war that's the goal so the false flag triggers

879
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,080
the war on American patriots that triggers the civil war and the breakup of the country

880
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,040
and the end of the dollar which they plan to have done in a year.

881
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,780
And Biden's the symbol of the dying old America who will carry it out he will then step down

882
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,000
once America collapses.

883
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,800
We're about one year out from the end of the country completely.

884
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,440
Well that seems unfair.

885
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,020
We're a year away from death camps.

886
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,320
You just get to step down after you've destroyed the country there's no like fanfare he's just

887
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,040
like I'm out of here guys.

888
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,440
I mean I'm sure it wouldn't be you know the smoothest exit.

889
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,840
Listen folks I got a cabin I'm gonna get out of here.

890
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
I gotta go.

891
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
I gotta go.

892
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
This place is a shithole by the way.

893
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,260
Um yeah I think this is nonsensical and it's also deeply irresponsible to tell your already

894
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,020
terrified and paranoid and gullible ass audience that you're a year away from death camps because

895
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,200
of fucking Joe Biden.

896
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,280
Why in God's name would somebody bother with a false flag whenever you just said that you're

897
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,540
a year away from death camps so you should be out and out being like we gotta terrorize

898
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,600
these people otherwise we're gonna be in a death camp.

899
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:46,160
I mean yeah it's you know terrorist edging mixed with terrorist pre-rationalization and

900
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
denial.

901
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Absolutely.

902
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,400
But there's other folks in the past who have had death camps and Alex is a scholar on the

903
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
matters.

904
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
I disagree.

905
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:04,920
Hitler got into power in 1933 he wasn't sending people to death camps until 1942.

906
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Oh.

907
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
He was sending people to prison.

908
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Oh wow.

909
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
First he took the job.

910
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Holy shit.

911
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,440
He wouldn't let them have businesses put them in ghettos but that's how this works.

912
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,400
So Alex doesn't know anything about Hitler's rise to power as he fully demonstrated a couple

913
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,560
episodes back but this attempt at rewriting Holocaust history is really upsetting.

914
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,920
Yeah this is not good.

915
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,160
According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum quote the first concentration camps

916
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,720
in Germany were established soon after Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933.

917
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,880
After the Night of Long Knives the purge of the SA that took place between June 30th and

918
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,880
July 2nd 1934 Hitler assigned Heinrich Himmler to formalize the system of camps that was

919
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,020
going on.

920
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:52,360
The camps that were primarily for the purpose fully of extermination did come later but

921
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,760
even if you want to give Alex the most generous interpretation possible Operation T4 started

922
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,440
in January 1940 which is aimed at the systematic killing of people with disabilities in Germany.

923
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,320
Alex's claim that the Nazis weren't sending people to death camps until 1942 is probably

924
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,640
just him knowing that that's the year that Operation Reinhard began when the Nazis attempted

925
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,880
to kill all the Jews in Poland.

926
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,440
There's a larger picture that he's unaware of or weirdly ignoring and this should be

927
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,600
another signifier that Alex has absolutely no idea about the reality of world history

928
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,320
nor does he have any respect for majorly traumatizing and traumatic world events.

929
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,560
He should never be taken seriously as claiming to know anything.

930
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,520
Yeah yeah no and it's not just that he's and it's not even like he wants to remain ignorant

931
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,480
or he doesn't want to learn things it's that he actively wants to go out of his way to

932
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,200
learn and propagate things that did not happen in order to justify his bullshit now so anything

933
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,720
he says about history is said entirely to be like it's totally okay for me to do whatever

934
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,160
I want today has nothing to do with anything.

935
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,960
Yeah it's and it's false depictions of yeah of like very very serious things and it's

936
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,000
I mean that's disgusting that's just wild yeah fuck him fuck him so you know how Hillary

937
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,400
Clinton projects her shadow her Jungian shadow on people she doesn't like her butt is that

938
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,640
an important thing that I've heard her and Nadler and Maxine Waters all don't like their

939
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,280
but they don't like their butts so they project this Jungian shadow on you so they think that

940
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,120
you're bad because that's their Jungian shadow that they see on you but that's really them

941
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,720
for Alex to say somebody else is projecting it's it's very rude well Alex he admits it

942
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,160
he projects his shadow on people too okay good and that's why he thinks that everybody

943
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,760
else is good at fucking oh I project my shadow on people I think people are powerful and

944
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,600
amazing and have incredible ideas and are have an incredible sexual prowess and amazing

945
00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:00,740
dynamics and are just meant to build civilizations and and love freedom and justice but I've

946
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:08,120
learned not to project what I believe and who I am on to others I can only hope now

947
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:17,560
I love myself we know I have written a poem of myself to myself yeah there are no snakes

948
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,560
under your bed I have learned not to project myself onto others I can only hope that everyone

949
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,960
is as good at sex as me there is nothing wrong with masturbating you are very good at sex

950
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,960
you do not masturbate at all what a doofus what a fine moron yeah unreal so now now

951
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,760
we get to one of my favorite types of moments and I think it's this is let's let's just

952
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:47,880
really like boil down his projection his understanding of Jungian shadows yeah comes down to Maxine

953
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,160
Waters doesn't like her butt I have a huge dick I think metaphorical butt no I know I

954
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,080
understand but metaphorically speaking Alex is literally talking about his sexual prowess

955
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,880
he is literally talking about his sexual prowess with Maxine Waters it was just the butt you

956
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,060
know she doesn't like her stinking butt she hates her butt I love my dick it's a metaphor

957
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:13,240
with one it's literal with the other maybe it is so this next clip is my favorite kind

958
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,320
of shit this is where Alex I think kind of forgets what he's talking about sure forgets

959
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,240
he's on air then tells an incredibly depressing story and a story that makes him look pretty

960
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,680
bad he does not kill another dog no no no dog killing okay good I want to take your

961
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:38,600
calls and listen listen like coming to somebody and saying hey you need to go home we just

962
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:48,080
got a call you're not answering your phone your dad just got killed in a car wreck or

963
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:57,880
I don't like getting a call and going and telling a family member hey grandma's dead

964
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:05,040
this was already really confusing as as a jumping off point but hold hold on hold on

965
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,560
to your horse all right he doesn't like bad news doesn't like to give it doesn't like

966
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:16,040
to get it doesn't like to do it it's unfortunate gotcha

967
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:25,160
but it's our job to do this and if we're not honest yeah I had to see my grandmother in

968
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:31,280
probably six months my dad's mom gosh I guess she's been gone my son was two years old he's

969
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:42,920
18 now so I guess she's been gone a year and a half old like 17 plus years so close and

970
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,120
I called my dad that afternoon before she died the next day and I said we got to go

971
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,360
see me ma he goes you know funny you said that I feel like we need to go see her and

972
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,960
then I was on coast to coast am till like four in the morning and my dad got there like

973
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,040
seven he said let's go I was laying there on the bed came to my house I said back then

974
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,320
I was younger I couldn't get out of bed when I was tired now I didn't have no problem doing

975
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,000
it preparing myself to get up instantly and I said no no no and I went finally got up

976
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,840
and I had a beer for breakfast and I had one more for dessert because I was really tired

977
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:24,360
and only had like two hours sleep what is happening I'm just joking and then I got in

978
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,840
the car on Rabiness Texas and 30 minutes before I get there he calls and says I just got there

979
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:38,000
when she died and you missed it see so there's that invisible internet that the enemy knows

980
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,680
about spiritual and they are so pissed they want to control it they don't they'll never

981
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:49,400
dominate us what the fuck is going on man so let me break down that story because first

982
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,200
of all he wasn't joking when he said he was drunk absolutely not get the fuck out of here

983
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,440
just realized that like oh this looks really bad shouldn't have said I drank a beer at

984
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,960
seven whoops and then another one for dessert and then another one for dessert and then

985
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:10,960
I drove Jesus Christ what is happening I mean the real the real like headline of that story

986
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,560
is I missed saying goodbye to my grandma because I was drinking in the morning well you could

987
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,000
say that that's the answer to that because your dad was there at the house he was he

988
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,160
got there on time but you decided to stick around and have a drink while beers yeah before

989
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,480
you drive yeah in the morning looks bad Alex it doesn't look good no just don't tell stories

990
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,780
like that don't tell stories at all no and I don't know how this connects to an invisible

991
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,240
internet that everybody has I guess he thinks that because they got it they were like let's

992
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:49,880
go visit her and then she died coincidentally and they were like oh we just got this psychic

993
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:57,080
idea that she was going to die soon yeah but again even if that's true yeah Alex you were

994
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,880
up and you just drank beer in the morning and then drove to visit her this is a story

995
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:11,280
about you ignoring psychic powers it would be yeah yeah yeah it would be a story about

996
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,800
you believing that your psychic powers were less important than your desire to have a

997
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,520
breakfast beer I gotta listen listen I I had a rough one I stayed up till four I gotta

998
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,040
drink a Guinness in the morning to get going yeah look George Norie was chewing my ear

999
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:32,660
off last night exactly talking about ghosts or something oh my god so anyway that was

1000
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:39,480
a little bit weird yeah but now we get into what I'm gonna call Alex's main breakdown

1001
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,160
of the Super Bowl okay okay I forgot the Super Bowl happened yeah he doesn't talk about the

1002
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,200
halftime show or any of that stuff nearly as much as you might think wow because there's

1003
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,060
another thing it's too obviously satanic there's a no I don't think so there's just another

1004
00:47:54,060 --> 00:48:01,400
thing that's a little more important okay and that's Alex is racism so Tom Brady won

1005
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:10,100
his seventh Super Bowl and they're just calling him a cross between Hercules and Apollo he's

1006
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:17,120
being worshipped but again it's only a game at the end of the day but we understand that

1007
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,080
human competition and human striving is what makes us great so in a way it's very wholesome

1008
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,500
men competing against each other women competing against each other but on to this they add

1009
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:33,760
all the globalism they add the propaganda they add the anti-family the racial separation

1010
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,080
messages what so they know you hunger for this competition oh what now and then they

1011
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:49,220
show the so-called black quarterback oh what now the Kansas team the Kansas City team oh

1012
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:54,720
what now this is about as wide as I am and the media says it's racist that Tom Brady

1013
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:04,120
won oh that means Ronald McDonald's black too he's got curly hair oh boy oh boy oh boy

1014
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:10,760
it is absolutely not racist that Tom Brady won what that was was racist oh yeah Alex

1015
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,800
while Alex once again has put on one of his famous hats that is the I get to decide people's

1016
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:24,320
race hat yeah yeah suppose wow wow this is this is ugly it goes on quite a while that's

1017
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,400
wild so the media didn't say that the game was racist Alex is just pointing to a bunch

1018
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,400
of anonymous people on Twitter who posted jokes about a black quarterback losing during

1019
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,880
Black History Month and then pretending that it's a serious argument the media is making

1020
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,800
I grant that a lot of people rightly don't like Tom Brady because he's a dick but this

1021
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,680
angle that Alex is taking is stupid it's based on literally nothing and it's deeply deeply

1022
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:53,960
racist very racist it gets so much worse yeah if you are if you are like oh I hate it when

1023
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:01,520
the media points out racism in the wrong way right but your defense of that is to get more

1024
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,840
racist huh I don't think the first part happened at all and I think you just want an excuse

1025
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,720
to be racist I think it feels that I feel it feels a lot like that it feels like you

1026
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,360
just really don't like black quarterbacks because of one Colin Kaepernick and so any

1027
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,240
chance you have to be like oh the media blows whatever yeah I think that's oversimplifying

1028
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,640
it because we could you can even greater oversimplify and just say Alex is a fucking huge racist

1029
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,640
wow there's definitely that it's not even about Kaepernick it pre-existed that that

1030
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,260
is true that is true and also it has to do with vegetables sure all of it is the attempt

1031
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:47,600
to project onto anything and everything going on racial division remember AOC said don't

1032
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:58,720
grow cauliflower she saw cauliflower growing at a New York community garden and she said

1033
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,920
it's white cauliflower is from Africa you dumb monster what does it matter what color

1034
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,720
it is whether it's purple or black or brown or green or red if it tastes good as nutritious

1035
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:17,760
but that's total mental illness ladies and gentlemen we've talked about this before but

1036
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,160
just because it's relevant here's the full quote quote what I love too is growing plants

1037
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,300
that are culturally familiar to the community it's so important so that's really how you

1038
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,760
do it right that's such a core component of the green new deal is having all these projects

1039
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,100
make sense in a cultural context and it's an area that we get the most pushback on because

1040
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,680
people say why do you need to do that that's too hard but when you really think about it

1041
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,120
when someone's saying it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca instead of

1042
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,340
I don't know cauliflower or something what you're doing is taking a colonial approach

1043
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:54,660
to environmentalism that's why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist

1044
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:59,200
movements because they come with a colonial lens on them yeah this is not about cauliflower

1045
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,600
being white it has nothing to do with that but see one the thing the reason that I read

1046
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,840
that quote again even though we've talked about this is because you wouldn't cover this

1047
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,680
that way you wouldn't cover this the way Alex is covering it unless you had a vested interest

1048
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,200
in trying to create a white victimhood argument for your racist audience to enjoy yeah and

1049
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,760
that's kind of exactly what he's doing with the Super Bowl too and it's bad I mean it's

1050
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:34,220
real bad it's hard not to look at all of these things because it's it's so awful how these

1051
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:40,360
people think of just like oh there's no way that this thing could be racist that's just

1052
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:45,400
silly you're just making a mountain out of a molehill you know but if you actually just

1053
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,400
listen to what people are saying and then look into it you can find like the tiniest

1054
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,720
things are built on a fucking mountain of racism yeah and if you look into it if you

1055
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,580
would be interested and if you would be curious about it you might find holy shit there's

1056
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,400
racism under all this stuff that I would think oh the penny you think the penny's racist

1057
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:12,400
and you probably look into it and it fucking is you know like it's that kind of shit and

1058
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,960
it might not be but you should take people's word and like it'd be interesting yeah I don't

1059
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:24,280
know I think I think that a lot of folks are guilty of this I mean it's the sound biting

1060
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:33,800
of of culture and information transfer sure but the people do it out of laziness sometimes

1061
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,760
and out of racism sometimes yeah and a bunch of other motivations but never forget you

1062
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,460
can do it both ways yeah yeah so but I think and the intersection there is that Alex is

1063
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,520
racist and he's also super lazy because he's really just reading a Paul Joseph Watson article

1064
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:56,640
because Paul Joseph Watson knows that his audience eats this stuff up so they like the

1065
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,060
thing that I kept thinking while I was listening to this is like these dicks thought this was

1066
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:07,320
worth their time I saw Paul Joseph Watson article this morning at info wars.com saying

1067
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,920
Tom Brady winning Super Bowl is racist oh this is a joke so I read about 20 tweets by

1068
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,680
black people saying it I didn't believe it I went to their accounts they were serious

1069
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:22,760
and I read hundreds more ooh they said it's so insulting he beat a black man there was

1070
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,640
a lot of black men helped Tom Brady win that Super Bowl and I'm telling you they were black

1071
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,520
folks whoa the quarterback I guess it's a gimmick kind of like who's the leader one

1072
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,960
of the founders of Black Lives Matter he's totally white what is happening got that other

1073
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,760
white lady said she was black and she said have one drop of African in her I mean what

1074
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,280
are we doing this is insane do you think you're winning because you know Brady had at least

1075
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,520
like a half white team with the New England Patriots oh god it's white people winning

1076
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,360
but is his Buccaneers teams almost all black what the hell does it even matter what color

1077
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:05,760
he is but this is the mental illness I thought the tweets had to be a joke but it's all about

1078
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,280
the fact that he wasn't ashamed of President Trump who was a fan before he was president

1079
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:19,040
you seem to be the one who's upset you seem very upset very upset ridiculously over-the-top

1080
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,560
upset and pretty racist very race and then once they slaughtered him I didn't even watch

1081
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,520
the end of it because it was just such a collapse by the other team and they're like look the

1082
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:37,720
black quarterbacks losing dude that other quarterback had whiter skin than I do I just

1083
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:43,480
I'll curl my hair and say I'm black oh it doesn't even matter it's like what the hell

1084
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,280
does that have to do with anything what color a quarterback is it's actually it's how good

1085
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,120
they play why if Tom Brady was a black guy he would be just as famous or probably more

1086
00:55:52,120 --> 00:56:00,080
so and I would still think he was an amazing quarterback I see I challenge personal successes

1087
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:07,120
not just like oh my skin's pink but that's mental illness ladies and gentlemen talk about

1088
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:13,320
colors I like there's nobody green my dad knows that he gave me a green watch maybe

1089
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:20,000
I'm a Martian I mean I got a purple shirt on folks and I like purple people like eggplant

1090
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,840
this is mental illness ladies and gentlemen I got a black microphone what does that mean

1091
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,480
I like how it looks what's back in the day nobody had black microphones everybody copies

1092
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,800
me don't know what's going on anymore I don't know what's happening what was that what was

1093
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:41,520
that I don't know if your uncle started at a certain point you put rolls in your uncle's

1094
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,720
mouth to keep him from talking I would I am honestly confused by his idea that everyone's

1095
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:50,920
ripping him off with black microphone I'm just I just don't know I think that it's that

1096
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,600
is all just about rush used to have a gold microphone and Alex is trying to like be like

1097
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:00,160
I was different sure something I don't know that's that's a startlingly racist thing that

1098
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:08,760
he's oh wow yeah and now he goes back to complete comparing Mahomes to Sean King and Rachel

1099
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:16,440
Dolezal and man this is just this is it's not good no it's not good but I know you all

1100
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:24,060
know that but it's the way they project yeah what's that idiot's name Sean King no African

1101
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:29,320
blood I mean just look at him boy takes on identity of black people so you can raise

1102
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,800
hundreds of millions of dollars and then who's the other lady the blonde haired lady that

1103
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:40,860
like frizzes her hair out and puts puts what's her name Rachel dolls are yeah I mean it's

1104
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:48,080
sick folks it's absolutely sick and it's mentally ill but but I'm digressing I'm almost out

1105
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:54,320
of time this segment I wanted to illustrate let's just keep rolling it Tom Brady knows

1106
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,440
that it's not as bad as the flu or pneumonia knows that it's a hoax refuses to wear his

1107
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:05,700
mask at the beginning after the game and they're so mad and he did that on purpose that makes

1108
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:11,160
me like Tom Brady way more than the fact that he is the greatest of all time no doubt in

1109
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:17,160
the NFL he's now the greatest of all time not being a coward like the other white dude

1110
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,960
posing as a black dude on the other team that got his ass ran over maybe if you'd had a

1111
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:30,480
black quarterback you would have not lost I got some real black quarterbacks and another

1112
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,600
quarterbacks great that right there is the tell that Alex is racist trolling oh yeah

1113
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,960
that right there when he's laughing is like other quarterbacks actually pretty you know

1114
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:45,400
he's pretty good that's the that is the signifier but my point is me like throwing passes when

1115
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,960
he's being tackled that people are catching yeah I mean look at this ladies and gentlemen

1116
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,360
there's Rachel dozell or whatever the hell her name is but this is all the global is

1117
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:59,840
trying to get us to in-fight with each other yeah there's the quarterback and I mean you

1118
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:05,920
know he's look at that look at that hair he's getting that curled folks he's in there hours

1119
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:13,420
a week getting it all like that so he can say he's black what was his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaddy

1120
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:18,620
black this is where we realize that Alex doesn't realize that Mahomes dad was a professional

1121
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:25,200
baseball player yeah yeah he's not very interested in that this is now this is wildly racist

1122
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:32,560
to a to adjust just I'm amazed that you can keep going I feel like you already nailed

1123
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,600
your racism and you you're done you know like he said he might as well just be like I don't

1124
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,480
believe anybody's black if I don't want them to and then you're done Alex is white you

1125
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,640
finished Alex is white insecurity and his white identity got it really alarmed by people

1126
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,680
making jokes about Mahomes losing during Black History Month and the only way that he could

1127
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,040
deal with that is to do an outrageously racist segment on his show yeah that goes on and

1128
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:06,080
on and on where he tries to be the arbiter of saying that he's not actually even black

1129
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:14,400
yeah to what end is this I am confused yeah I am very confused by um I don't know just

1130
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,840
the continued existence of the universe in a certain to a certain extent you know like

1131
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,800
part of me is like I don't understand how this country has made it as long as it has

1132
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:28,180
if it is rewarded this moron so much you know like there's there's a fundamental confusion

1133
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:35,240
I get from listening to this of just like how who why what are we doing I don't know

1134
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:41,920
what are we doing so Alex plays a clip of Joe Biden has he had a little message before

1135
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,620
the Super Bowl see that's what sorry sorry I have to this is what I this is what got

1136
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:51,240
to me this is what I realized was screwing with my head apologies for interrupting sure

1137
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:57,920
and derailing this entire problem where I'm fired I get it no problem I I remember something

1138
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:07,360
important happening right now that a sophisticated news political show would talk about and that

1139
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:14,860
is not Tom Brady at depth it's the president that he thinks is God is being impeached have

1140
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:20,680
you like is there anything have you seen my home's hair though Alex needs to talk about

1141
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:26,720
it you can't be that mad about the devil being the president so Biden gave a little bit of

1142
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,400
a little message you're right in a moment of silence for the people lost to COVID-19

1143
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:39,000
yeah at the Super Bowl and Alex has a video of it where it sounds like people are booing

1144
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,800
Biden sure it's unclear if this video is authentic because there are other videos that don't

1145
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:52,420
really have you know there's like some applause and then some crowd noise sure but who cares

1146
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:57,700
yeah I don't give a fuck I don't remember Alex reporting about how everyone booed the

1147
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:02,680
shit out of Trump no that baseball game no that wasn't a big deal so anyway I don't care

1148
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,040
but he does cover that and he's like ah look at this guy getting booed and then he gets

1149
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:13,100
into his analysis of the commercials mostly just the Springsteen commercial it's Bruce

1150
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:18,620
Springsteen riding around like he's John Wayne he supports taking your guns he supports breaking

1151
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:23,480
it he supports transgender stuff in the bathrooms of your kids he hates Trump look it up oh

1152
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,760
but now he's the good guy gonna bring you together he's Bruce Springsteen he's the spirit

1153
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,200
of America here is this disgustingly condescending ad

1154
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:44,880
four years ago I was in the middle of a custody battle there's a chapel in Kansas standing

1155
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:54,840
on the exact center of the lower 48 it never closes all are more than welcome more companies

1156
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:02,200
here in the middle I don't care for that ad myself but I don't think Alex has any right

1157
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:10,080
to complain or critique commercials no it's uh it's a little bit uh obnoxious so Alex

1158
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,400
had you know he said he's going to take some calls and so he gets around to it but he comes

1159
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,440
in from break and the uh the the board op or maybe whoever it is tries them with a little

1160
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:34,200
bit of Elvis oh so we are just counting down here counting down oh is this Elvis let's

1161
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:40,960
hear a little bit of this we're counting down to the false flag next hour I'm gonna premiere

1162
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,640
the proof of them coming for you and me he doesn't at least you know they're coming little

1163
01:03:47,640 --> 01:04:00,240
less talk a little more action wrong so I guess that's what the left wants to give us

1164
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,440
emergency alert bubbles preparing massive false flags so pretext for soviet-style purge

1165
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:13,080
watch live and just watch it all happen so this Elvis song that is not a little more

1166
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:18,080
a little less conversation a little more action it's just let yourself go yeah this gets Alex

1167
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,120
into a little bit of a mood and he starts rambling you know he's been mad about black

1168
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,560
people and white people playing football so it's nice to listen to music whoever white

1169
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,920
man stealing black people's music it's nice yeah and that makes Alex that makes him want

1170
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,600
to kill I mean the shotgun shack in the middle of the woods my lady listen to this

1171
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:53,520
real tight enjoy yourself and baby don't fight I'm gonna stop being bad I'm not gonna drink

1172
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:59,280
any I'm joking oh let ourselves go in a war too that gonna be fun a little bit still war

1173
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:06,240
kind of the same type of deal isn't it whoa what's going on nobody's scared no more except

1174
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:15,320
those people that are dying when the killers come when the killers come when the dying

1175
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:22,200
starts when the praying to mommy starts don't look like the left's much ready for a war

1176
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:27,800
but they sure want one cuz they ain't ever been in one all right now they're gonna play

1177
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,400
that old bumper music that's how I like me some Elvis I apologize for ranting here we

1178
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,160
got Catherine we got Pastor Sam we got Harry we got Tyler we got Terry we got Kevin we

1179
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:43,960
got Steve we got James we got Chris we got Mike and Russell we got 20-something callers

1180
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,640
and I said I want seven on that board because I don't want to keep people on hold but let's

1181
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:55,600
just go to them now while we sit here waiting for that big old juicy false flag terror attack

1182
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,320
so they can start that civil war and break this country up real nice I think Alex might

1183
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:06,840
have had a meeting with somebody in the bathroom yeah yeah that's yeah buddy got a little bit

1184
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:20,280
of a little pep in his step so he takes so his first caller is a guy who calls in all

1185
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:25,520
the time named Pastor Sam and one of the things that I find really interesting about Alex's

1186
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:31,000
techniques with callers is he creates false conflict with them often whenever they disagree

1187
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,240
with him on like a minute point he'll create a false fight with them to sort of frame their

1188
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:42,040
position in a certain way that he can respond to that doesn't allow the nuance of the the

1189
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:48,260
matter to be dealt with in this case Alex had made some comments about how you know

1190
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:52,840
if the gun confiscators come you don't want to be at home you don't want to start a fight

1191
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,560
with the police because that's you know that's how the whole civil war is going to start

1192
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,120
if you end up doing that no you got to target the the high level globalist sure sure sure

1193
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:10,080
sure and Pastor Sam's position is more like if they're coming to take our guns then it's

1194
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:16,440
it's already past the point you would think and and and that nuance is dangerous for Alex

1195
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:23,720
to have because it hurt his brain well and it would it would it requires that his actual

1196
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:29,400
positions sound a lot more like aggressively and immediately violent than he wants them

1197
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:35,500
to and then he thinks can be profitable so he starts a fight but don't worry we got patriots

1198
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:40,560
think it's time for war too Pastor Sam I see you strongly disagree with me this is not

1199
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:46,240
the time to lie down you know Pastor Sam I didn't say lie down I said if the cops are

1200
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,720
coming to confiscate guns at your house it's a good idea to not be waiting for them and

1201
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,960
kill them because they've been brainwashed I get it a certain point it's going to start

1202
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:02,040
up here but uh well it's not lying down I'm saying the target isn't the police so if they

1203
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:08,880
get the police to come for our guns I'm a big boy I'm a smart boy then I would want

1204
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,920
to go after which I'm not saying do the actual people that were running the show nice save

1205
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:20,080
there you call that lying down tell me Pastor Sam how to be a man tell me how to do it well

1206
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,920
I know you said to dispense with the niceties but first I'm going to tell you tell me how

1207
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:29,180
to be a man Sam I'm going to tell you that I love you and that I'm a prayer partner for

1208
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,740
what you're doing and I I've followed you for 20 years yeah so Alex is he's created

1209
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:40,000
this tone that is completely artificial with this call so there's no hope of any point

1210
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,360
actually being discussed and there isn't it just goes nowhere that sounds about right

1211
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:51,080
yep uh so he goes to another call and this person has a very very easy to answer question

1212
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:57,420
okay Catherine in Canada you're on the air welcome hi there hi Alex how are you I'm

1213
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:02,200
all right go ahead welcome okay I want to make a point about the January 6th event for

1214
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,840
all these people that think there was just Trump supporters for five years there was

1215
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:12,080
a counter protest at every Trump event I just want to ask these people that want to explain

1216
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:18,120
from people where was their counter protest that day people in those communities felt

1217
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,560
very strongly that it would be too dangerous yeah they dissuaded people from taking part

1218
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,520
because they didn't want people to more people to be killed yeah they were like hey stay

1219
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:33,860
away these people are violent Trump supporters might kill people at this thing and then they

1220
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:39,720
were roundly mocked and then Trump supporters killed people at that thing so yeah I mean

1221
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:45,320
it's a question it's a super easy to answer question yes this is not the first time that

1222
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:51,720
this has happened there were greatly diminished counter protesting that happened at the gun

1223
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:57,480
rally in Virginia yeah the the one that Alex went to and they tried to be very insightful

1224
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:04,800
at in the sighting at not insightful yeah yeah that that happens sometimes the counter

1225
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:13,300
protest folk I believe prioritize safety they like to live yeah and and a lot of times those

1226
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:18,960
people will be a little bit more responsible and in the case of January 6th there was pretty

1227
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,300
pretty consistent messaging that I saw from people that that I'm aware of that this is

1228
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:30,060
not a good thing to go counter demonstrate what I'd like to know what I'd like to know

1229
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:35,320
is where were the counter protesters at the thing that we said was going to be a violent

1230
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,560
display of our power yeah the implication of course is that they were mixed in the crowd

1231
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,240
of course but that's all bullshit so I you know Alex is yelling doing this fake fighting

1232
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:51,320
with his calls and I'm like this guy is fucked up I think he's I think he's doing speed yeah

1233
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,800
it's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads and I get overly excited agree people ask me all

1234
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,140
the time they go Jones are you on cocaine or you want meth yeah are you so excited why

1235
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:08,080
are you starting another ad if people are always asking you if you're on drugs there's

1236
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:14,520
a decent chance you're on drugs oh and when you go on Joe Rogan's show and Joe Rogan

1237
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,320
asks you about how you told him that you have a problem with Adderall well that's a little

1238
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:25,060
bit well that one's a little bit more like the pictures are starting the pictures starting

1239
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:30,460
to come into focus yeah we had a real rough start of this show and now the energy is flying

1240
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:35,960
high yeah that's so almost like someone took something yeah it's all because usually as

1241
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,840
you work throughout the day you get more tired you know and maybe I and I've had this happen

1242
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,160
before Dan have you ever been working for like six hours right yeah and you know you

1243
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,400
got some more work to do but right around that six hours you're just so tired and you

1244
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:55,960
could just really use a pick-me-up you know sure so you go get a cup of coffee or you

1245
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,400
go into the bathroom and you snort some rails you do what you gotta do to make it through

1246
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,800
the last two hours dad I'm not saying that that is the case but I'm really coming around

1247
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,320
on the idea that he's on drugs yeah like it just it makes a lot of sense and I think the

1248
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:17,160
fact that Rogan asked him that question really really makes me a bit more open to the idea

1249
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,960
because why would Rogan bring that up if it wasn't something that Alex had brought up

1250
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,740
with him and it's and it sounded like it was coming from a place of genuine concern as

1251
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:30,320
well passion yes friendship yep yep hey I don't want you to keep hurting yourself man

1252
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:38,600
yeah yeah and yeah and there we are and Alex keeps saying that everybody insists he's on

1253
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,600
drugs everybody keeps saying that I'm taking these two drugs that I consistently write

1254
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,540
you know and it's just like oh yeah I take a little coke and a little meth but you do

1255
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:51,640
a little bit of each that way you don't have to do as much look give me a cup I'm pissing

1256
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:56,720
it now um so I got like I told you at the beginning of this I got really excited because

1257
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,700
Alex said he's gonna have Jay Dyer on yes and they're gonna talk this guy is the guy

1258
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:06,440
who's the primary source reader right and all this I immediately lost all respect oh

1259
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,920
no what would you call this period of time we're in right now I think it's pretty clear

1260
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,800
they're getting they're saying patriots are terrorists they're gonna arrest us all we're

1261
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,280
about to stage terror attacks clearly they're getting ready to stage terror attacks in my

1262
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:23,000
view do you agree with that and what would you call this period of time we're in and

1263
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,160
what are you doing to get ready for it because every few generations goes through some real

1264
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:32,040
tyranny we're about to go through a big one this is the age of transition right this is

1265
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:38,080
their phraseology for how we go from the way things were during this Christian period of

1266
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:44,160
the age of you know Pisces the age of the fish to the Aquarian Age which is what Blavatsky

1267
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:48,440
right one of the esoteric philosophers that the elite always like to look to she called

1268
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:53,360
this the externalization of the hierarchy holy shit go tell Carrie Cassidy about it

1269
01:13:53,360 --> 01:14:05,880
no shit oh god now my worldview is based on this woman from the 1830s who thought she

1270
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,760
could do magic Jesus and my fear that other people have learned to do magic from her you

1271
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,200
know the problem that I'm having look he's a moron that's to be expected the problem

1272
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:23,080
that I'm having is Jay Dyer is a great DJ name it's such a great DJ name yeah I would

1273
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:29,680
love to be Jay Dyer that's so good you know Jay Dilla is great Jay Dyer is great it'd

1274
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:35,120
be awesome to have a collaboration with his ghost because apparently Jay Dyer believes

1275
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,840
that those ghosts can talk to oh yeah oh yeah yeah Edgar Casey can connect me with DJs of

1276
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:48,520
the past through David Wilcock spirit you do not need to do any voices yeah you don't

1277
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:57,800
need to do scratching on the record okay so this next clip Jordan I don't really care

1278
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,800
about him and Dyer's interview it is dumb yeah no I've already whenever you start when

1279
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,820
you start with Helena Blavatsky I'm out yeah I'm out yeah that's yeah that's kind of a

1280
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:12,600
rule of mine you can have fun conversations with friends about these sorts of things and

1281
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:17,080
you know we can we can talk about stuff but when you want to make me scared of your big

1282
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:23,200
bad guy enemies and and insist that they follow the teachings of Helena Blavatsky yeah I'm

1283
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:28,760
out that's like that's one step further than if somebody's like you know the Unabomber did

1284
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:35,200
make some good points though I'm just look I know there's stuff you know I think it's

1285
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,920
a little more fun because at least there's magic involved that's true anyway so Alex

1286
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:48,240
gets to talking about Trump a little bit here and he says something that I find unacceptable

1287
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:52,860
okay if you listen to this clip and you understand what Alex is saying the last five years of

1288
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:58,680
Alex's life have been wrong uh-huh they've been meaningless yes and Alex has been an

1289
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:04,400
instrumental part of the globalist plan to bring in tyranny does he know that I think

1290
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,700
Trump meant well he was a nationalist he knew America was being screwed over but that the

1291
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:14,160
establishment let him win he did win by landslide four years ago because they knew they could

1292
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:21,360
run circles around him and use him to energize the left to basically commit any crime and

1293
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,720
then support a total police state and abandon any values they had and I think that's clearly

1294
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:32,720
evident now from from my perspective that at a sophisticated level we were all all played

1295
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:40,160
wow so you are a useful idiot exactly like you claimed you were not to a guy three days

1296
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:46,840
ago yeah I mean there's there's really no other way to interpret that because I mean

1297
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,560
I guess the left wouldn't have been turned into whatever this is that would facilitate

1298
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:57,340
tyranny if Clinton had won sure so I guess the only way to reach the point where actual

1299
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:01,720
tyranny could happen Trump had to win right and Alex has said many many times that Trump

1300
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:06,640
wouldn't have won if it wasn't for info it does seem like that and that would also heavily

1301
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:13,440
imply that Roger Stone is working for the globalist Alex to hell yeah you know be this

1302
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:19,800
bully pulpit for Trump yeah I'm you know what I could believe that or maybe Alex is making

1303
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,560
all of this stuff up Dan yeah Alex is making all this stuff he might just be making it

1304
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:28,160
all up yeah he's just spitballing and nothing he says means anything but if he were being

1305
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:33,600
serious he would then have to the next thought should be and I should shut up yeah because

1306
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,840
you quit yeah because clearly I make all the wrong decisions that laid us to this but this

1307
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,880
is my fault in the last half a decade I have been leading you to tyranny exactly state

1308
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:48,120
and I've made multiple documentaries with police state in the title I'm supposed to

1309
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:53,700
know better exactly and not just that but you followed me to get to where we are meaning

1310
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:58,360
I am the reason that we are where we are and I am a bad leader and you should not follow

1311
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:02,640
me anymore now four years ago I was going through a divorce oh okay well now I'm back

1312
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:11,400
on your side are you selling anything uh maybe wait around for three minutes we'll find out

1313
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:18,320
we'll see we'll see look we got one last clip here okay and it's like I think everybody

1314
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,460
kind of expected there to be more talk about the Super Bowl halftime show as opposed to

1315
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:29,500
Alex just being racist sure but that's every time when you think he's gonna zig he zogs

1316
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:34,840
that's what he does um so he uh he talks about the halftime show a tiny bit with Jay Dyer

1317
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:41,640
and like this clip is just titled stupid talk about halftime show because this is stupid

1318
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:46,000
but you were mentioning to me did you see that halftime show and I I don't normally

1319
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,520
watch Super Bowl because I knew Tom Brady wouldn't be wearing a mask I know I like him

1320
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:55,260
I watched it they're all wearing a skull mask they're subhuman but the one guy has speech

1321
01:18:55,260 --> 01:19:00,000
and they all like puppets do what he says this was very sick at a subconscious level

1322
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,760
it means you are robots in a fascist event you are skeletons you are dead I control you

1323
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:12,760
exactly a lot of things going on here symbolically speaking it began with this choir of robots

1324
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,480
drones right so everybody's up in the in the choir with the weekend guy they're singing

1325
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,960
and they're all just sort of doing what they're like you know puppets like they're they're

1326
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:27,880
on a marionette right I just my response to all of this kind of conversation is like if

1327
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:32,120
you guys are just high kicking around like a hacky sack and this is the conversation

1328
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:40,240
you want to have great but if you're adults on a presumably grown-up news world events

1329
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:45,800
radio show that you very seriously this is unbecoming yeah this kind of conversation

1330
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:53,960
is laughably stupid oh oh oh you're all drones and only the weekend has a voice yeah and

1331
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:59,880
the only people who should be allowed to publicly discuss the semiotics of this event would

1332
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,520
be somebody it would be like Umberto Eco who could be like I'm gonna put this in the context

1333
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,820
of all of this others but even then it's a fucking Super Bowl halftime show guys go go

1334
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:14,500
to bed here's the thing go to bed here's the thing that I want to ask as a rhetorical question

1335
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:21,120
but I also want an answer these types of things have been going on forever talking about the

1336
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:26,720
symbology of halftime shows and the show ology of these music videos and all this shit yeah

1337
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:32,880
I want to know these motherfuckers people like Jay Dyer they pretend that they study

1338
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,780
this stuff uh-huh that it's like an actual field of totally of information I want concrete

1339
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:45,040
examples of things that they've known in advance because of these symbols that they read in

1340
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:54,680
music videos and halftime show Dan I would love it's all around you what the evidence

1341
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,920
look out your window Dan see that's why that's the halftime that's why I wanted it to be

1342
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,360
retort that's the Super Bowl halftime show I just want I just want to know what magical

1343
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:08,400
like psychic revelations you get from oh also they took off the masks in the second song

1344
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:15,200
in the performance oh but who cares oh who cares yeah I just I find this stuff really

1345
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:20,580
dumb I used to really enjoy reading blogs that would talk about like people have cover

1346
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:29,320
in one eye yeah sign of the Illuminati yeah when I was young yeah and I all the time has

1347
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:34,620
any how many Super Bowl halftime shows are even memorable and none of them for their

1348
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:43,240
semiotics Janet Jackson exactly that was not the semiotics of what she was wearing no the

1349
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,840
Prince hologram won a couple years ago wasn't there that was kind of bad yeah right yeah

1350
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:56,560
that's it who gives a shit about the halftime show it's a thing we talk about people like

1351
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:03,080
Alex care a lot it's a thing we talk about every year for a day and then we're done just

1352
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:08,720
let's just not talk about it for that day I think that there's a lot of potential for

1353
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:13,800
like interesting performance I think that you know God bless people who you know really

1354
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:21,160
really try choreographers are great and I think that I'm just aged out of the point

1355
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:25,200
where I can get too excited about a lot of the musical acts but I can still appreciate

1356
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:29,320
like I get it you know like I can watch the weekend's performance I can be like this is

1357
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:33,200
not necessarily for me it's not my favorite thing but I get it look at him performing

1358
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:40,200
the hell out of it sure yeah yeah it's it's fodder for people who have a tough time coming

1359
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:45,720
up with things to talk about and for people like Alex who just need to be mad at something

1360
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:50,800
and the Super Bowl is such a perfect thing in that wheelhouse for Alex because you have

1361
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:57,720
the like sublimating of mail drives to war that he can complain about whatever symbology

1362
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:04,720
is on the halftime show he can complain about and apparently the race of people and whether

1363
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:10,480
or not they constitute being black according to Alex Jones which is fucking disgraceful

1364
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:16,280
that is that is really disqualifying as like allowed in polite society ever again yeah

1365
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,360
like you should be shunned like that that deserves a shunning it would be interesting

1366
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:26,500
for someone to like sit down and try to explain to Alex exactly why that display was so flagrantly

1367
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,960
racist yeah but I don't think he would understand I don't think it's possible I think he just

1368
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:36,200
needs a good universal shunning everybody's shunned him I think most people have gotten

1369
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:42,320
that message I think so too we need some more though Dan let's raise up the shunning sure

1370
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:48,000
so alright we reached the end of this episode and Alex apparently did not enjoy the Super

1371
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,340
Bowl yeah and I thought we were gonna get to the impeachment trial stuff today but because

1372
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:59,600
it was Tuesday it got started sure that will come on the Friday episode we'll check in

1373
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,240
see how Alex is handling all that stuff but I do think that this this episode is important

1374
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:11,920
to go over because of the incredible racism Wow and because of the clear turn towards

1375
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,440
really aggressively being like false flags are coming they are coming yeah coming I guarantee

1376
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:21,360
they're going to happen yeah and you can't read that any other way than preemptive damage

1377
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:27,000
control when it's coming from someone like Alex someone who is so invested in terrorist

1378
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,760
edging yep and we'll be back on Friday to discuss impeachment business indeed we will

1379
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,400
do I understand you were watching it today because I saw some tweets yeah I had some

1380
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:43,380
fun uh Bruce Castor is I mean that was one of the most fundamentally disgraceful things

1381
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:49,360
I've ever seen in my entire life bad argumentation no no argumentation just rambling gotta call

1382
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:55,400

1385
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:15,440
come Barnes walking down oh man all the senators socially distance and he's high-fiving each

1386
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:22,560
Republican just runs up to him Barnes kicks him in the gut gives him a stunner yeah absolutely

1387
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:28,320
absolutely but Larry Klayman coming from the sting spot and drops down right on top about

1388
