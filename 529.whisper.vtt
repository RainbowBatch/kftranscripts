N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.920
I love knowledgefight.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.960
I love knowledgefight.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.080
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.480
Red alert, red alert, red alert.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.480
Need, need money.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.040
Red alert, red alert, red alert.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.360
Andy and Kansas, Andy and...

00:44.360 --> 00:45.640
Stop it.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.280
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.520
It's time to pray.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.320
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.360
Hello Alex, I'm a system caller and I'm a huge fan.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.360
I love your world.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
Knowledgefight.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight.com.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
I love you.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.360
I love you.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.360
Hey everybody!

01:00.360 --> 01:01.360
Welcome back to Knowledge Right, I'm Dan.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
I'm Jordan!

01:02.360 --> 01:05.040
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
Alex Jones.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.040
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
Jordan.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
Dan!

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
Jordan.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
I have a quick question for you.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
What's up?

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.040
My bright spot today, Jordan, is something interesting.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
I learned something.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
Indeed.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.040
I was unaware of this.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.640
Is that your first time in a long time learning something?

01:18.640 --> 01:19.640
I listen to Alex a lot, so yes.

01:19.640 --> 01:20.640
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.640
Yeah, I haven't learned shit from that guy.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.640
I learned something that honestly I had every reason to know before, and I don't know why

01:27.640 --> 01:35.800
I didn't quite frankly, but as it turns out, I only know when things come to our P.O. box

01:35.800 --> 01:38.760
because I get an alert from the store.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.760
Sure.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.240
Where the box is.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.800
They don't send you alerts when letters come.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
Oh!

01:46.800 --> 01:52.720
I didn't know that, and unless the person who's giving you the packages checks the mailbox,

01:52.720 --> 01:53.880
you'll never know.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.880
That's not fair!

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
No.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
That's not fair!

01:56.880 --> 02:03.240
I found a bunch of letters in there the last time I went to pick up packages, and also

02:03.240 --> 02:09.220
we're way behind on zapping up the mailbag, so we'll get around to opening some of that

02:09.220 --> 02:13.800
up in the near future, but on the last trip I went down there, I got to these letters,

02:13.800 --> 02:19.400
and I got a particularly amazing letter from someone who I just want to call Dr. Justin.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.400
That's what I was going to say.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.400
Dr. Justin to protect everyone's anonymity and their privacy.

02:25.400 --> 02:32.160
I feel like this letter is delayed because I have no idea when things come into the mailbox,

02:32.160 --> 02:33.160
but it was just amazing.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.160
It doesn't get more us than to not know when mail is.

02:36.160 --> 02:43.080
Just an amazing letter, and I appreciate it so much, it really meant a lot, and has been

02:43.080 --> 02:44.080
so thank you.

02:44.080 --> 02:49.160
Yeah, no, just tears, just tears, weeping, just non-stop.

02:49.160 --> 02:55.240
Thanks for sharing that letter with us, Dr. Justin, and congratulations on your doctor-ness.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
Hell yeah.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.640
How about you?

02:57.640 --> 03:04.360
My bright spot, Dan, is I have finally finished my two months long project, and I'm done with

03:04.360 --> 03:05.360
Taylor Swift.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.360
Okay.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.360
For good.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.360
It's over.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.360
You've listened to the whole catalog.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.920
I've listened to every one of her albums, and I'm done.

03:12.920 --> 03:13.920
I'm pretty proud of myself.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.920
How do you feel?

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
Fine.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.640
Yeah, I expected that was probably the answer.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.120
I've intentionally not read anything you've written about Taylor Swift because I don't

03:23.120 --> 03:24.120
want to get mad at you.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.120
Of course.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.120
I've never read just this before.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.600
I don't want to pick a fight.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.760
I don't want to be like, look, I love blank space.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.000
I don't want to talk about it.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Sure.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I understand.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.320
I mean, it's unfair.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.760
I wasn't trying to pick a fight.

03:39.760 --> 03:44.520
I was trying to go so far over the top, no one could possibly imagine that I would be

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
fighting.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.920
At a certain point, I insisted that the guy who wrote Bloodsport was the writer of one

03:49.920 --> 03:50.920
of her songs.

03:50.920 --> 03:51.920
Do you understand?

03:51.920 --> 03:53.080
I'm not going for realism here.

03:53.080 --> 04:01.480
I think the audience wants to know what your next extended exercise in misogyny will be.

04:01.480 --> 04:06.880
Maybe a bunch of articles about Mariah Carey not being as good as everyone thinks.

04:06.880 --> 04:11.920
Well, that would just be impossible because Mariah Carey is exactly as good as everyone

04:11.920 --> 04:12.920
thinks, Dan.

04:12.920 --> 04:17.360
Maybe the next series could be about Pink.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.640
Now you're just finding people you're defensive about now.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.200
I like Mariah Carey.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.540
Everybody likes Mariah Carey.

04:23.540 --> 04:24.540
Everybody likes Pink.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.540
I don't know.

04:25.540 --> 04:26.960
I've met some Pink haters in my life.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.960
That's fair.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.920
Well, congratulations on finishing a project.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.920
It's over with.

04:30.920 --> 04:31.920
Yes.

04:31.920 --> 04:32.920
I'm proud of myself.

04:32.920 --> 04:33.920
Yes.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
Let's not talk about it again.

04:34.920 --> 04:35.920
Ever again.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.680
Jordan, something we are going to talk about is Alex Jones today.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.680
Oh yeah.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.160
You're going to be talking about the February 8th, 2021 Blackjack episode.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.600
No, I'm not even, I didn't even have a chance.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.580
I was watching your lips move and I was like, boo, and you had already finished.

04:48.580 --> 04:53.040
When you see a pro like me, everything happens in slow motion.

04:53.040 --> 04:58.440
So no matter how many times I sit there and think in my head, I know he's about to say

04:58.440 --> 04:59.440
the date.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.920
I'm still caught by surprise every time.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.120
It's also not quite fair because I can just keep talking.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.120
Yes, that's true.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.120
I can say 21 Blackjack.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.120
Yes.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.320
I can say it as one word almost even.

05:11.320 --> 05:14.120
You're playing at a disadvantage, but I'm also very good at it.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.120
Yeah, exactly.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.380
There's the double whammy.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.380
This is Monday.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.800
We're talking about the day after the Super Bowl.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.800
Right.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
There'll be some thoughts on that.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.800
I imagine so.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.920
Oh, Nelly, are there some thoughts on that?

05:23.920 --> 05:24.920
Oh boy.

05:24.920 --> 05:30.480
But more importantly, I think there's a big broad push that Alex is engaging in that I

05:30.480 --> 05:35.760
think will be the direction of his content in the near future.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.880
And before we get down to business on that episode, Jordan, let's take a moment to say

05:38.880 --> 05:40.880
thanks to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.880
Oh, that's a great idea.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.160
So first, Commie Wizzo.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.160
Thank you so much.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.160
You are now a policy wonk.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.160
I'm a policy wonk.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.520
Thank you very much, Commie Wizzo.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.200
I've never seen The Room.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.880
That's a, well, he wrote The Mark's Room, I believe.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.880
Oh yeah, it could be.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.400
Have you ever, have you ever seen The Room?

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
Mm-hmm.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.200
Yeah, I think everybody but me has.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.200
It's very funny.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.200
Yeah, that's why I don't want to see it.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.200
I understand.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.720
It'll actually make you sad and you won't like it.

06:05.720 --> 06:06.880
You will not appreciate it.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.600
You'll be like, this guy was trying so hard and it's a bad movie.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.080
I don't know if I will.

06:13.080 --> 06:19.000
I don't like everything that I've seen surrounding it and so I'm not interested in what germinated

06:19.000 --> 06:20.140
all of these plants.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.140
That's fair.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.140
That's fair.

06:22.140 --> 06:26.000
Anyway, Lady the Dog runs the simulation.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Thank you so much.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
You are now a policy wonk.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm a policy wonk.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.440
Thank you very much, Lady the Dog.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.440
Thank you.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.080
Next, Biggles Dictates a Letter.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.080
Thank you so much.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.080
You are now a policy wonk.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.120
I'm a policy wonk.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.360
Thank you very much, Biggles.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.360
Thank you.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.560
Next, Ima Holler Back Girl.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.560
Thank you so much.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
You are now a policy wonk.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
I'm a policy wonk.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
Thank you very much.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.200
Don't you write a series about Gwen Stefani being bad.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.200
I might.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
Actually, she...

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
Alright.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.160
Next, Tomorrow's Warm Flat Seltzer.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.160
Thank you so much.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.160
You are now a policy wonk.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
I'm a policy wonk.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.160
Thank you very much.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.160
Thank you so much.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.720
Next, Joined Just to Ask What the Hell Do You Have Against Accountants?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.680
We're Not All Oogie Boogie Sympathizers.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.680
Thank you so much.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.680
You are now a policy wonk.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.680
I'm a policy wonk.

07:04.680 --> 07:05.680
Thank you very much.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
I believe that's a question for you, George.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
I didn't know that.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.680
I'm speaking as a former accountant.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.680
I don't have anything against accountants.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.280
I don't have anything against accountants.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.260
I'm just saying that you can't be both an accountant and a boogie boy.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.480
I feel like that's right.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.480
You can be a boogie boarder.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.480
Well, that's...

07:19.480 --> 07:20.480
See?

07:20.480 --> 07:21.480
Of course.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.480
And you'd be a cool accountant.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
Yeah.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.480
It might be very cool for an accountant.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.640
Then finally, I'd like to say thank you to a couple of people who donated on Elevated

07:27.640 --> 07:28.640
Level.

07:28.640 --> 07:29.640
I appreciate that very much.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.760
So, Introskipping Joe.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.760
Thank you so much.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
You are now a technocrat.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.920
And Grim Squeaker.

07:33.920 --> 07:34.920
Thank you so much.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.920
You are now a technocrat.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
I'm a policy wonk.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.920
Crikey, mate.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.920
That's fantastic.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.920
Have yourself a brew.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.560
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:41.560 --> 07:44.000
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.440
Let's just get down to business.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.520
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.440
Why you pimps so good?

07:49.440 --> 07:51.080
My neck is freakishly large.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.000
I declare info war on you.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.260
Ah, yes.

07:55.260 --> 07:58.520
Thank you so much, Joe, who skips the intro, and Grim Squeaker.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
Yes.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.520
Thank you very much to the both of you.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.920
Jordan, did you watch the Super Bowl?

08:01.920 --> 08:02.920
I did not.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.520
And I'm grateful for it.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.520
Mm-hmm.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.520
Did you?

08:06.520 --> 08:07.520
I saw some tweets.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.800
And then, because of this episode, I watched the Halftime Show.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
Oh, yeah.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.280
And I didn't watch that either.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.280
Mm-hmm.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.280
I did not.

08:14.280 --> 08:18.080
Although, I did hear that Weeknd did stuff off House of Balloons in the fucking...

08:18.080 --> 08:19.080
What does that mean?

08:19.080 --> 08:22.120
House of Balloons was his first little EP that came out.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
Oh, probably.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
And it is...

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
He had a lot of...

08:25.120 --> 08:26.120
He did a lot of songs.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
It was...

08:28.120 --> 08:31.760
Yeah, that one was, like, really dark and just basically about doing coke and fucking

08:31.760 --> 08:32.760
the whole time.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.480
Well, there's that song, like, I can't feel my face when I'm with you.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.480
That was about drugs, right?

08:35.480 --> 08:36.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.480
That's all about drugs.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.480
That's what I thought.

08:38.480 --> 08:39.480
I don't know that to be true.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.480
I just think I've heard that somewhere.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.480
Yeah.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.480
Yeah, he did that for sure.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.480
Yeah.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.480
Cool.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.480
And then, uh, Starboy, except, like, the chorus of that is...

08:47.480 --> 08:48.480
Was Daph Monk there?

08:48.480 --> 08:49.800
No, they were not, and I think some people were mad about that.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.800
Yeah, well, I would be.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.680
But the chorus is, I'm a motherfucking Starboy.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.840
He is a motherfucking Starboy.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.160
You can't say that in the Superboy.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.160
Yes, you can.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.160
Why not?

08:58.160 --> 09:00.800
So you have to say, I'm a Starboy.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
This sucks.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
Oh, man.

09:02.800 --> 09:07.360
Uh, I watched that halftime show, and we'll get to that at the end of this episode a little

09:07.360 --> 09:08.360
bit.

09:08.360 --> 09:12.480
But the only thing I was thinking was, like, I can't believe that The Weeknd is this big

09:12.480 --> 09:13.480
of a star.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.480
Yeah.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.480
Like, I'm nothing against it.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.480
He seems like a talented guy.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.480
He's great.

09:17.480 --> 09:21.880
But just, like, I'm so disconnected from pop culture that I'm, like, wow.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.160
There's no surprise guests.

09:24.160 --> 09:29.080
There's no, like, I remember the days of halftime shows when it's, like, one star is not enough.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
Five people.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
Five different bands.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.480
Aerosmith's gonna be there.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.440
Metallica's gonna play a duet with Katy Perry, who gives a fuck.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.240
In Sync is gonna come out of the floor.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
Exactly.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.240
And then Nelly's gonna parachute in.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.680
Shit comes out of the floor at the Super Bowl.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.680
That's math.

09:44.680 --> 09:45.680
Yeah.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
And it was just The Weeknd.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.680
It was a fine performance.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.680
I didn't like all the songs.

09:50.680 --> 09:55.560
I think maybe some were a little bit boring, but, hey, I'm not the target demo.

09:55.560 --> 09:59.960
You didn't write nine different installments of something about it, so you're fine.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.640
Although, give me time.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.600
Your turn next, buddy.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.720
So yeah.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.720
That's about all I saw.

10:07.720 --> 10:12.960
I guess I saw a little, like, a couple of, like, choice plays, like at Mahomes Pass where

10:12.960 --> 10:13.960
he was falling.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:14.960 --> 10:15.960
Pretty amazing stuff.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.840
I don't know, I don't really have any strong feelings about it.

10:18.840 --> 10:23.080
The game, I guess I'm from Missouri, so I should love the Chiefs.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.080
I have some friends who really like the Chiefs, so good for them.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.080
All right.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.080
Yeah.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
Anyway.

10:29.080 --> 10:35.040
We start with Alex in an out of context drop.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.840
That is a rare situation where I'm going to give you a little question ahead of time about

10:38.840 --> 10:40.480
this out of context drop.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.160
He's telling somebody to burn in hell, and I'd like you to try and guess who he wants

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
to burn in hell.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
All right.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
That is a lot.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.160
No, you have to guess.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
Oh, before?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.160
Yes.

10:51.160 --> 10:56.600
I thought you were going to guess, okay.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
Let's see.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.360
And this is after the Super Bowl.

10:59.360 --> 11:06.000
I am going to go with, why not Bill Gates?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.720
You're going to burn in hell, Springsteen, burn in hell.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.720
Nope.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.720
Bruce Springsteen's going to burn in hell.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.240
Did he just find out that Bruce Springsteen doesn't like the far right?

11:15.240 --> 11:19.320
Did he just learn that Born in the USA- I was going to say, did he just find out about

11:19.320 --> 11:20.320
Born in the USA?

11:20.320 --> 11:21.320
He might have.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.820
He did not like that commercial.

11:22.820 --> 11:25.720
Someone explained the song to me, and now I'm mad.

11:25.720 --> 11:33.520
He resented the commercial, I guess it was a General Motors commercial, where Bruce Springsteen

11:33.520 --> 11:37.920
was doing some voiceover talking about how there's a church in the middle of Kansas,

11:37.920 --> 11:40.400
right in the middle of America.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.320
It's hard to get to the middle, but it's like-

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
Oh boy.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.320
Oh boy.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.480
That somehow that pissed off Alex to the point where Bruce Springsteen's going to burn in

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
hell.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
All right.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.480
Everybody should burn their Jeeps.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.480
Okay.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.480
I'm fine with that.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.480
Whatever.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.480
Anyway.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.320
There's never less carbon in the atmosphere to burn your Jeep.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.280
But Alex thinks we need all the carbon.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.280
Oh, that's true.

12:00.280 --> 12:05.120
So, we start off the show, and Alex is in the exact mode that I like him to be in.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.720
This is when I know, okay, this show's going to be weird.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.720
Okay.

12:08.720 --> 12:15.000
I tend to get up here on air and get really excited and cover a lot of news and still

12:15.000 --> 12:19.040
kind of not get to all the points I really want to break down, so I'm going to try my

12:19.040 --> 12:25.000
best here today to just be calm and we'll see how long that lasts and just cover all

12:25.000 --> 12:34.080
of this, but it is becoming extremely, extremely clear exactly what is going on and what is

12:34.080 --> 12:35.080
unfolding.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.080
Now-

12:36.080 --> 12:37.080
Uh-huh.

12:37.080 --> 12:51.320
Let me just, I can't do the show right now, I just can't do it, I got to reset, I got

12:51.320 --> 12:53.320
to go rebroadcast.

12:53.320 --> 12:58.200
I mean, this is all just too heavy, this is all too insane, this is all too serious, and

12:58.200 --> 13:01.600
I just need people to know that this is not a game, okay?

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
Okay.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
Okay.

13:03.600 --> 13:09.600
I'm coming out of the gates, a lot of energy, and then within a minute, I can't do this.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.600
I can't do this.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.600
Fuck it, ah shit.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.240
Look, we're going to focus, we're going to calm down, I'm just going to get through this.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.240
I quit.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.760
I am not going to be here for any longer, I'm done.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.760
Fuck this.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.760
I got to get out of here.

13:20.760 --> 13:24.080
He doesn't actually go to rebroadcast, but he does play some special reports.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.080
So funny.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.520
But not before teasing a little bit of what's coming up on the show.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.520
Sure.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.000
And I learned something interesting because of his tease.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Okay.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.040
The writer is going to be in studio with us, he's a great author and researcher and knows

13:36.040 --> 13:37.040
his stuff.

13:37.040 --> 13:43.600
He's done more deep research on the globalist end game than even I have because-

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
Did he make a movie about it?

13:44.600 --> 13:48.960
I did most of my research 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, because I already

13:48.960 --> 13:54.200
know their operation, but he studies it going back as well, hundreds of years, but then

13:54.200 --> 13:56.360
on their current stuff.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.980
So I kind of use him as a Reader's Digest with his show and the things he does to go

14:00.980 --> 14:05.320
hear him boil down these books he's reading like every day, new ones, where they're going

14:05.320 --> 14:09.620
to just tear us apart and put us in camps and brain damage us and sterilize us and they're

14:09.620 --> 14:12.880
just foaming at the mouth like satanic piranhas.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.960
It's hard for me to read their stuff, but he does it and then boils it down.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.980
Alex could have probably just said it's hard for him to read.

14:18.980 --> 14:23.280
It is hard for me to read is all I heard in that sentence.

14:23.280 --> 14:28.760
So yeah, apparently Alex doesn't read primary sources anymore, but pretends to pretty extensively

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
on air.

14:29.760 --> 14:34.640
I can't read all this stuff, I just accept Jay Dyer.

14:34.640 --> 14:41.760
You can't say yesterday I do all my own research and then say today I can't really do any research

14:41.760 --> 14:43.400
so I just read this guy.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
Yeah.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.400
That's not fair.

14:45.400 --> 14:51.320
And then I accept whatever interpretations he apparently has about primary sources that

14:51.320 --> 14:52.700
he probably didn't read either.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.700
Are you kidding me?

14:53.700 --> 14:56.080
This man claims to read a book a day.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.000
How could I not take everything he says at face value, Dan?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Certainly.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Ah!

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
So I got excited.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.160
I'm like, Jay Dyer, alright, I can't wait to assess you.

15:05.160 --> 15:09.680
I've heard him bit on the show before, he's boring and stupid, but I was like, well, alright,

15:09.680 --> 15:10.960
I'll get excited for that.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.680
Alex is in a bad mood.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.720
He clearly wants to storm off the show.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.720
Oh yeah.

15:15.720 --> 15:20.640
He's got this guy coming up that I think I can sink my teeth into and instead Alex just

15:20.640 --> 15:28.680
like he plays a special report about Marjorie Taylor Greene and like it's this weird, weird

15:28.680 --> 15:34.240
thing where John Bowne, one of Alex's employees, is trying to make an argument that Marjorie

15:34.240 --> 15:42.400
Taylor Greene having these committee appointments taken away is somehow a purge of all conservatives.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
Yes.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.800
And it seems like a dumb argument to make.

15:44.800 --> 15:45.800
It seems like a bad.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
Oh yeah.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.300
Because what you're doing is essentially equating whatever you believe in and your rhetoric

15:50.300 --> 15:56.560
with her and if you believe, if you want to, if you want to make that association you're

15:56.560 --> 15:57.560
more than welcome to.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
Yeah.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.560
That's a losing argument.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.840
It might not work well.

16:00.840 --> 16:05.320
And then like this argument extends to like what we need to do is we need to get them

16:05.320 --> 16:06.680
off of their committees.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.680
Okay.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.000
And it's like, all right, go try.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Fine.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
That's called being politically active.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.920
If you want to start a petition.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.220
You can, you can do that.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.220
You can vote.

16:18.220 --> 16:19.220
We vote on things.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.220
Call your legislature.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.220
Yeah.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.220
Just go say vote.

16:22.220 --> 16:23.220
Not hard.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.220
Yeah.

16:24.220 --> 16:25.220
This is a dumb video.

16:25.220 --> 16:26.220
Anyway, I got bored with that.

16:26.220 --> 16:29.760
What I'm always not bored with is there's some more commercials.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.760
Okay.

16:30.760 --> 16:36.120
Uh, last episode we talked about Alex's commercials and it was a big hit and I thought we need

16:36.120 --> 16:38.720
a little more of a taste of these commercials.

16:38.720 --> 16:43.920
I have a question cause I have not heard of any really standout commercials, Dan from

16:43.920 --> 16:44.920
the Superbowl.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.720
I think we won.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.920
I think we had the best commercials of a Superbowl Sunday.

16:49.920 --> 16:50.920
Yeah.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
Yeah.

16:51.920 --> 16:56.200
I think, um, can't think of whatever, like an advertising publication, but that, that

16:56.200 --> 16:58.120
I think they would give the crown to Alex.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.120
I think they would have to.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.120
Yeah.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
Better than that Oatly commercial.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.120
Better than the Bruce Springsteen commercial.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.120
What are you talking about?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.720
Oh, there's a small town.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.120
No, look, there's a small town.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.320
That's how you do the line reading.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.440
This commercial might take the cake.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.440
Okay.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.440
I think it's my favorite.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.440
All right.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.440
I have to warn you.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.440
Teasing it big.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.800
Jordan, it's four minutes long.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.460
That's not a commercial.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.120
This is a special report then.

17:25.120 --> 17:32.200
It goes all over the place and it is so mopey and it's very, it's a bummer.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.200
Okay.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.820
So it was four years ago.

17:34.820 --> 17:42.160
I was in a custody battle with my ex wife and her lawyers were trying to introduce a

17:42.160 --> 17:51.040
video of me like 10 years ago and I dressed up like the joker to do an anti Prozac ad.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.760
I said, Oh, kids take your Prozac.

17:52.760 --> 17:59.120
You'll see pretty colors and act all crazy because the inserts of the Prozac class of

17:59.120 --> 18:06.400
drugs, anti-depressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors admit it increases suicide risk

18:06.400 --> 18:08.800
and all sorts of the problems.

18:08.800 --> 18:14.240
And so my lawyer at a hearing that I wasn't even at said, uh, he's playing with joker

18:14.240 --> 18:17.120
there just like Jack Nicholson isn't really the joker.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.840
That's not really Alex Jones.

18:18.840 --> 18:24.800
This was actually a defense of introducing any video of Alex on info wars.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.000
The lawyer's argument was that he's a performance artist.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.680
Now he did say that it would be like compare like saying that Jack Nicholson is playing

18:32.680 --> 18:33.680
the joker.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
Correct.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.200
But it wasn't just about a specific video that Alex is referencing where he does have

18:38.200 --> 18:39.200
joker makeup on.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.840
He's trying to conflate those two things.

18:41.840 --> 18:46.200
But yeah, I was like, Whoa, this is like the first minute of this commercial.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.080
I'm really struggling with the commercial aspect of this.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.080
We'll get to it.

18:50.080 --> 18:54.400
Many commercials begin with, of course, I was in a custody battle four years ago.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.400
Four years ago.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.400
Four years ago.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
I was in a custody battle.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.880
My lawyer said something weird and uh, so that one wasn't, that one didn't surprise

19:00.880 --> 19:01.880
me at all.

19:01.880 --> 19:07.400
Uh, in order for me to not have my kids taken away from me, my lawyer need to make a really,

19:07.400 --> 19:14.960
uh, really desperate argument to keep my public persona out of court so I wouldn't have to

19:14.960 --> 19:19.520
answer for why I scream about how my enemies are demons and literal devils and how I'm

19:19.520 --> 19:20.520
a psychic.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.520
And I wouldn't have to answer any questions about that because I'm a performance artist,

19:23.520 --> 19:27.840
but technically I don't want you, my audience to think that because then the sales pitch

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
won't work.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.240
But anyway, have you tried Tom?

19:31.240 --> 19:34.280
That's a preamble to a great commercial.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.280
Yes.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.280
Yeah.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.360
And I got turned into Jones admits he's a character in court.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.320
Well, I'm the opposite of a character.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.320
I am.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.800
I stand for him, I stand for how I stand.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.680
I'm the most unscripted person out there.

19:49.680 --> 19:55.800
That said, when I do research and I'm getting ready to do a video and I'm getting ready

19:55.800 --> 20:02.160
to break something down, I wouldn't call it performance anxiety.

20:02.160 --> 20:07.560
Instead of getting butterflies, when I get in front of a crowd, I get really hyper and

20:07.560 --> 20:09.560
then I have all these ideas and things I want to say.

20:09.560 --> 20:15.280
So I move really, really fast and sometimes you can lose all the key information and how

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
fast I'm moving.

20:16.280 --> 20:24.680
But if you slowed it all down and search engine, each thing I talked about, it's all huge stuff

20:24.680 --> 20:32.760
like world government, new world order, eugenics, agenda 21, agenda 2030, the human biological

20:32.760 --> 20:38.120
diversity assessment, 2002, 1992.

20:38.120 --> 20:43.520
I mean, all these things open Pandora's boxes, but, but see, I'm already getting excited.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.960
We are not two minutes in.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.400
This is not a commercial.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.200
This is a voicemail on his like ex-wife's phone.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.240
This is a voicemail.

20:53.240 --> 20:57.040
This is something that he sent to somebody drunk at like 3 AM.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.040
Okay.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.360
Listen, I'm four years ago.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.360
All right.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.620
I was in a custody battle.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.320
First minute is about the custody battle stuff and how I'm real.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.320
I'm real man.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.320
100% real.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.320
Second minute.

21:07.320 --> 21:14.280
Sometimes I get real excited and I just yell shit where it's time to deliver information.

21:14.280 --> 21:18.880
I kind of forget what I'm doing probably because I'm on drugs.

21:18.880 --> 21:23.200
If you would like to rerecord your message, please begin again at the dial tone.

21:23.200 --> 21:28.200
Let me, the time I have here, just be really straight with all this.

21:28.200 --> 21:34.560
A part of me wants to not be able to continue on at this level because my body's exhausted.

21:34.560 --> 21:41.760
My spirit's not, and I talk about all these incredible things that have happened.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.560
People can now see that I wasn't exaggerating.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
I wasn't lying.

21:44.560 --> 21:49.680
We're in a corrupt, psychotic, anti-human world government that wants to bankrupt us

21:49.680 --> 21:51.880
and make us really poor control our lives.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.880
Sure.

21:52.880 --> 21:56.160
And there's this paradox where people say, well, Jones, you've got so much credibility

21:56.160 --> 21:57.160
now.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.160
You need to continue on.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.160
I do want to continue on.

22:00.160 --> 22:04.120
It's just that I can't continue on because they took all my sponsors, took most of my

22:04.120 --> 22:05.640
taking away.

22:05.640 --> 22:11.040
And I've had to rely basically purely on people buying products at mfullwarestore.com.

22:11.040 --> 22:14.600
So I had a lister today on the Friday show called this.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
That was a great time for a plug.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.600
I wish you'd do more and expand your network.

22:17.600 --> 22:22.520
Look, I'm not complaining, but I spent about half my time trying to raise money.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.200
I'd rather be on air fighting the globalists instead of trying to raise money.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.680
I don't like coming to you either.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.440
I'm a proud person at a certain point.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.720
But look, we're all proud people.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.400
The point is if you, what is happening in this fight, there's no reason for that.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.400
Things happen.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
There's no reason for that.

22:38.400 --> 22:45.120
You have to understand that we're all proud people.

22:45.120 --> 22:50.960
You can do whatever you want and they've really helped a lot of people.

22:50.960 --> 22:51.960
They're high quality.

22:51.960 --> 22:55.720
No matter what the product is, they're all excellent.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.920
And on top of it, our mission is absolutely clear.

22:58.920 --> 23:06.560
And so I understand that it's kind of passé now because I was like, okay, Jones told

23:06.560 --> 23:07.560
us all this.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.560
It came true.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
Okay.

23:09.560 --> 23:10.560
Thank you, Jones.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.560
What do we do?

23:11.560 --> 23:12.560
Well, we have to continue fighting into the future.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.080
So it's really up to you whether we stay on air or not.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.600
It's up to you whether we're able to reach out to new people.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.000
So I know you already know all this stuff, but think about the new people and then just

23:20.000 --> 23:21.620
understand how important it is.

23:21.620 --> 23:22.840
You buy products at m4store.com.

23:22.840 --> 23:27.020
They're amazing products that make your life better and they fund the M4, a 360 win.

23:27.020 --> 23:30.360
So think about where we are and what you've done in front of this operation.

23:30.360 --> 23:40.160
In advertising classes, they could break down how this is an effective call to action.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.880
Here's what I'm seeing in my mind's eye.

23:43.880 --> 23:49.620
End of season one of Mad Men, Don Draper is looking at that carousel and he's thinking,

23:49.620 --> 23:53.960
I'm going to say everything Alex Jones is saying in this one right here.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.300
Hey, look, I'm not telling you what to do.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.480
You can not buy a Kodak.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.240
Look, if you don't want to see these pictures, that's up to you.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.960
I mean, we all like seeing pictures, but some people don't.

24:02.960 --> 24:03.960
I mean, that's fine.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.560
I'm a proud man.

24:06.560 --> 24:14.000
To a certain point, so many qualifications, so many constant like, listen, you don't have

24:14.000 --> 24:15.880
to do this.

24:15.880 --> 24:24.160
I heard that and I thought, who is in charge of quality control?

24:24.160 --> 24:25.240
I don't know.

24:25.240 --> 24:30.520
Who's in charge of like any of that could have gone?

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
Here's what you could have done.

24:31.520 --> 24:37.500
Are you so desperate for something to be four minutes long to fit like in a break?

24:37.500 --> 24:38.500
The only explanation.

24:38.500 --> 24:42.660
Yeah, because there was a lot of fat in there.

24:42.660 --> 24:47.440
There was not a lot of substance and you know what you can do?

24:47.440 --> 24:49.700
You can edit the video.

24:49.700 --> 24:54.340
None of it at the end relates to what he said at the beginning.

24:54.340 --> 24:58.200
At no point in time in his call to action, please go buy from Infowars store.

24:58.200 --> 25:02.320
Do you need the added context of four years ago he was in a custody battle?

25:02.320 --> 25:04.840
Nor do you need the second minute.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.560
You don't need any.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.560
Just cut it out.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.560
Yeah.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
Cool.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.680
I think he's having problems with employment.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.200
I think maybe he does not have the most capable hands on deck.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.600
I think maybe he has very few hands period.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.600
So we get in this next clip here.

25:23.600 --> 25:29.920
We get to Alex getting actually down to business and you know I think that you see him complaining

25:29.920 --> 25:35.640
about Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton and straight but we also see what I think is going

25:35.640 --> 25:41.640
to be the direction moving forward and how Alex is going to try and cope with the end

25:41.640 --> 25:48.720
of the Trump season I guess and the only way I can express it really is I feel like we're

25:48.720 --> 25:50.760
back in 2009.

25:50.760 --> 25:58.160
And they are projecting the union psychology of the shadow onto you period.

25:58.160 --> 26:01.120
You think Maxine Waters likes her evil ugly ass?

26:01.120 --> 26:02.120
No.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.120
What?

26:03.120 --> 26:05.640
You think Nadler likes his evil ugly ass?

26:05.640 --> 26:06.640
No.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.840
You think Hillary likes her evil twisted butt?

26:08.840 --> 26:09.840
No.

26:09.840 --> 26:10.840
Maybe?

26:10.840 --> 26:14.720
But she projects it on you because these people are not retrospective and they cannot look

26:14.720 --> 26:16.040
within themselves.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.040
Introspective.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.040
Wow.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
Alex.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.560
Knowing thyself is the highest order.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
Alex.

26:23.560 --> 26:24.560
Then you can know God.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.560
Alex.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.560
Once you know yourself.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.560
Alex.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.440
But if you don't know yourself you don't know anything.

26:30.440 --> 26:34.400
Know thyself first.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.060
These people do not know who they are.

26:36.060 --> 26:38.440
They don't even know where they came from or where they're going.

26:38.440 --> 26:43.160
They just want to pull down everything good.

26:43.160 --> 26:48.000
So just as night follows day and day follows night they are preparing massive false flags

26:48.000 --> 26:52.280
in this country to blame us and they're going to try to move against us and they're going

26:52.280 --> 26:56.080
to do it because they never got in trouble for all the things they did before.

26:56.080 --> 27:00.440
Because the corrupt lawyer run justice department is so full of pedophiles and corrupt people

27:00.440 --> 27:05.200
they literally existentially want to make a run at the American gun owner and the American

27:05.200 --> 27:07.840
Christian and they're going to do it.

27:07.840 --> 27:12.440
There's an overwhelming sense on this episode of feeling like exactly like the narratives

27:12.440 --> 27:13.440
of 2009.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.440
Yeah.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.440
They're coming for your guns.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.440
Guns.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.400
They're coming for a false flag to make us look bad.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.400
Totally.

27:19.400 --> 27:25.080
It's just it was exhausting on a certain level because it was just like I feel like we've

27:25.080 --> 27:26.280
been here before.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.280
Yeah.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.400
And if you were somebody who was listening to his show like I don't understand how you

27:30.400 --> 27:34.920
wouldn't be like hey you've played this song before.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.920
Yeah.

27:35.920 --> 27:36.920
Yeah.

27:36.920 --> 27:41.920
Well I mean you know Fox News is going hard on hating immigrants now too so everybody's

27:41.920 --> 27:45.880
trying to step back and be like remember when we could just be racist for fun?

27:45.880 --> 27:46.880
Come on guys.

27:46.880 --> 27:47.880
This is going well.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.880
Yeah.

27:48.880 --> 27:53.120
I think that there's a difference with Alex though and that is that he's playing this

27:53.120 --> 28:00.120
game that he played before with the same intensity before and it didn't come true before.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.400
True.

28:01.400 --> 28:05.600
So or what if he just said it did?

28:05.600 --> 28:08.560
Yeah I guess that is an option.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.680
So it's going to be psych warfare.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.040
They're going to false flag.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.040
Of course.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.040
We've seen it all.

28:14.040 --> 28:18.520
The warrior run Justice Department is so full of pedophiles and corrupt people they literally

28:18.520 --> 28:23.120
existentially want to make a run at the American gun owner and the American Christian and they're

28:23.120 --> 28:27.800
going to do it but they're going to do it first through psychological operations and

28:27.800 --> 28:29.380
it's going to be bad.

28:29.380 --> 28:33.660
It's going to be rough and you better get yourselves ready for it and you better know

28:33.660 --> 28:37.120
what the different scenarios are that are going to unfold out of this and I'll cover

28:37.120 --> 28:39.560
it all when we come back.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.440
Separately.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.960
We're not going to be on the air unless we have your support plus we've got great products

28:44.960 --> 28:47.400
that everybody already needs.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.080
You just did four minutes of a rambling nonsense commercial.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.600
Sure but I mean that commercial was great.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.600
Did you hear that?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.880
That was what 10 seconds tops?

28:56.880 --> 28:57.880
It goes on from there.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.880
Oh well there we go.

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
Never mind.

28:59.880 --> 29:00.880
There's a bit I'm not playing for you.

29:00.880 --> 29:01.880
Damn it.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.880
Where he talks about winter sun being awesome.

29:03.880 --> 29:04.880
Okay.

29:04.880 --> 29:10.760
But yeah I mean like you know you have this false flags are absolutely coming.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.320
They're all going to take a run at the gun owners and Christians.

29:13.320 --> 29:17.440
They hate all that is good and you know hey we got good products.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.640
It's just classic ad pivot business.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.520
It's just not fair.

29:21.520 --> 29:26.560
They just shouldn't be allowed to just be like okay these past four years we had a grand

29:26.560 --> 29:31.760
old time, ran rough shot all over your bullshit, killed a lot of people and destroyed essentially

29:31.760 --> 29:34.080
anybody's faith in democracy.

29:34.080 --> 29:38.320
Anyways we're going to go back to just being mad about regular stuff now.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.320
Is that fine?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.800
We're just going to do what we did back then.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.640
You guys seem to like us more back then right?

29:44.640 --> 29:48.040
We're going to crawl in a little hole.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.080
The angry tea party type us again.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.680
Oh I don't like immigrants.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.920
Hey doesn't everybody like the stakes being lower I guess?

29:54.920 --> 29:58.600
Well yeah everything has pretend deescalated.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.520
Like I thought Biden was the devil.

30:01.520 --> 30:02.880
He was the devil.

30:02.880 --> 30:07.320
I thought the whole idea of him getting into office was an existential threat to literally

30:07.320 --> 30:12.000
everybody because he's controlled by China which is controlled by the devil and also

30:12.000 --> 30:14.680
the devil's controlling a whole bunch of other things.

30:14.680 --> 30:20.840
But like Alex reveals how he and his staff talk about Biden and it's like you wouldn't

30:20.840 --> 30:24.680
talk this way if you actually thought he was the devil.

30:24.680 --> 30:29.960
And so I remember on that same conversation on January 8th with some of my crew, some

30:29.960 --> 30:34.160
of the managers, they said well don't be too down Alex.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.880
You know once Trump's out and everybody doesn't think everything's fine we'll have even more

30:37.880 --> 30:40.560
listeners because people are going to hate Biden.

30:40.560 --> 30:45.680
And I said you mark my words as soon as that inauguration is over and Biden's sworn in

30:45.680 --> 30:53.640
up there people are actually going to give up and they're going to actually fall away

30:53.640 --> 30:54.680
to a great extent.

30:54.680 --> 30:58.580
That's OK because we've got a bigger number than we had 20 years ago or even 10 years

30:58.580 --> 31:04.120
ago or even five years ago but all the sunshine patriots aren't winter soldiers they're not

31:04.120 --> 31:05.680
going to be involved.

31:05.680 --> 31:11.840
They wanted to be part of the fantasy but it doesn't matter.

31:11.840 --> 31:16.480
So Alex and his managers have a conversation and the conversation goes along the lines

31:16.480 --> 31:21.240
of they think it's going to be good for business that Biden's in office and Alex says no people

31:21.240 --> 31:23.220
are going to lose interest.

31:23.220 --> 31:27.440
That's the way they're talking about this behind the scenes that's how they're processing

31:27.440 --> 31:28.440
this.

31:28.440 --> 31:33.960
Whether or not this is good for business it has nothing to do with their pretend nonsense

31:33.960 --> 31:36.480
about Biden being the fucking devil.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.080
All that is performance.

31:38.080 --> 31:43.200
Anybody who thinks otherwise is I mean deluded.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.280
Now at the same time there is a real world implication of a lot of this stuff and that's

31:47.280 --> 31:53.400
where this discussion of how there's false flags coming up where that becomes really

31:53.400 --> 31:56.560
important and I have some thoughts about that.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
Guaranteed.

31:57.560 --> 32:00.220
100 percent confirmed.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.360
They've done it before.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.520
They stand to gain from it.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.900
They have a history of doing it.

32:03.900 --> 32:09.120
They have the means they have the motive and they are now pre-programming at a level I

32:09.120 --> 32:15.120
haven't ever seen even before 9-11 even before Oklahoma City even before other events that

32:15.120 --> 32:21.320
right wingers are going to engage in terror attacks mass shootings bombings everywhere

32:21.320 --> 32:26.440
and then anyone that's pro-America or anyone that's pro-gun or anyone that's pro-life is

32:26.440 --> 32:36.200
a terrorist and they're going to try to get the general

32:36.200 --> 32:41.080
public then in mass the same ones that wear the mask the same ones that do what they're

32:41.080 --> 32:48.720
told to then literally in a Maoist revolution not work with us not talk to us and actually

32:48.720 --> 32:52.680
physically attack us and they've already beta tested the whole thing.

32:52.680 --> 32:59.320
When Alex talks like this generally what you should take away from that is he recognizes

32:59.320 --> 33:04.720
that he and his entire information economy their information space have made things too

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
hot.

33:05.720 --> 33:06.720
Yep.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.800
They've got things too hot and stuff's gonna bubble over and they need a preemptive justification

33:10.800 --> 33:12.480
and narrative for it.

33:12.480 --> 33:18.000
That is all you need to hear when Alex says I guarantee false flags are coming.

33:18.000 --> 33:24.880
That means hey Trump has an impeachment trial starting on Tuesday there's probably going

33:24.880 --> 33:27.720
to be some fucked up shit that ends up happening.

33:27.720 --> 33:34.080
Our people have been radicalized to the point of no return thinking that he had the election

33:34.080 --> 33:39.000
stolen from him a narrative that I have been instrumental in pushing and we need to make

33:39.000 --> 33:42.600
sure that all this is fake if it does happen.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.600
Yeah.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.080
It's very sad.

33:45.080 --> 33:52.200
It's not just sad it's I mean perhaps not legally criminal but at the very least morally

33:52.200 --> 33:53.200
debased.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.200
Yes.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.200
Yeah.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.200
I would say so.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.600
And it's woefully transparent too.

33:58.600 --> 34:03.640
When you watch enough of him and you see these behavioral patterns it just becomes really

34:03.640 --> 34:07.720
obvious that I'm not saying that like Stuart Rhodes called him and said I know someone's

34:07.720 --> 34:08.720
gonna do something.

34:08.720 --> 34:09.720
No no no yeah.

34:09.720 --> 34:14.160
That would be conspiratorial and very irresponsible to suggest.

34:14.160 --> 34:18.960
But I think that Alex knows well enough to read you know the signs that are out there.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.200
I would suggest that it's more just chatter.

34:21.200 --> 34:26.680
Alex is Alex is plugged into enough chatter where you're like a lot of this is too hot

34:26.680 --> 34:28.520
I can see you somebody out there doing something.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.600
He claims he reads the comments on Info Wars.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.600
Yeah exactly.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.120
So that should be some indication of the public temperature.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.120
Some people are talking.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.120
Yeah yeah exactly.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.120
If he even does that.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.120
Right.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.660
But even if you don't like you don't even need to go that far to say chatter you could

34:40.660 --> 34:45.320
just say like look at the scenario look at the world look at what's happening.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.800
Look at what just happened a few weeks ago.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.800
Sure.

34:48.800 --> 34:49.800
Yeah.

34:49.800 --> 34:50.800
There was a bombing on Christmas morning.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.800
Yeah.

34:51.800 --> 34:52.800
Yeah.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.800
Yeah.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.800
Oh yeah.

34:54.800 --> 35:00.520
Anyway I think that that is what's going on and that is the big push that I was talking

35:00.520 --> 35:05.720
about being like what Alex's content and his stuff is going to be moving forward.

35:05.720 --> 35:12.400
It's going to be a lot of that like return to 2009 and then really really stress that

35:12.400 --> 35:18.080
there's a fault there's false flags coming and that's just to do preemptive damage control

35:18.080 --> 35:24.520
for people in those pro-Trump communities should anyone take violent action.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.520
Absolutely.

35:25.520 --> 35:31.600
So all the other moves in the past that the globalist have made all just leading up to

35:31.600 --> 35:32.880
this move.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.220
This move right now.

35:34.220 --> 35:35.220
This one.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.880
This is a false flag that will lead to the civil war that will lead to dominoes.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.660
I have a quick question before we go any further.

35:41.660 --> 35:43.000
What happened to Plan B?

35:43.000 --> 35:44.800
He didn't say that.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.800
Oh.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.680
And Harrison Smith doesn't work at influence.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.680
Well shit.

35:48.680 --> 35:53.960
In case you don't realize it they're making their big move all the other moves were probes

35:53.960 --> 35:58.900
all the other moves were tests all the other moves were just beta.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.600
This is the main assault.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.400
They're going to blow up federal buildings they're going to shoot up colleges churches

36:04.400 --> 36:05.400
schools malls.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.400
Then why didn't you tell us that all the other ones.

36:06.400 --> 36:10.760
They're going to dump chemical weapons in lakes in reservoirs they're just going to

36:10.760 --> 36:16.240
be terror attack on terror attack as the globalist chai combat combine takes America down and

36:16.240 --> 36:17.840
causes a civil war.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.800
Yeah so all the other everything was prelude.

36:20.800 --> 36:27.400
All of the other ones all of the ones that I have screamed at you for 25 years being

36:27.400 --> 36:33.960
the most important ones that have ever happened it turns out all of them were just probes?

36:33.960 --> 36:34.960
Yeah.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.960
Alright.

36:35.960 --> 36:40.640
Curious Minds might ask is it possible that you're wrong this time too?

36:40.640 --> 36:45.280
No no no no he's only been wrong every time for 25 years.

36:45.280 --> 36:50.240
Is it possible that you have a currency bias that you think whatever is happening now is

36:50.240 --> 36:52.400
literally the most important thing?

36:52.400 --> 36:53.400
Could be.

36:53.400 --> 36:59.960
So the dominoes Jordan are essentially false flag tips over right?

36:59.960 --> 37:00.960
Sure.

37:00.960 --> 37:05.960
And then it goes off and then it's used to make patriots and right wingers look bad so

37:05.960 --> 37:07.920
the public turns against them.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.440
Do we need help with that?

37:09.440 --> 37:11.080
Seems redundant after the storming of the Capitol.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.760
I think we already did it.

37:13.760 --> 37:20.080
So that goes down and then there's a civil war but the civil war is only to like collapse

37:20.080 --> 37:21.600
the United States.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.600
Sure.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.600
And then death camps.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.600
Okay.

37:24.600 --> 37:30.000
This is all meant to trigger the civil war that's the goal so the false flag triggers

37:30.000 --> 37:34.080
the war on American patriots that triggers the civil war and the breakup of the country

37:34.080 --> 37:37.040
and the end of the dollar which they plan to have done in a year.

37:37.040 --> 37:41.780
And Biden's the symbol of the dying old America who will carry it out he will then step down

37:41.780 --> 37:43.000
once America collapses.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.800
We're about one year out from the end of the country completely.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.440
Well that seems unfair.

37:47.440 --> 37:50.020
We're a year away from death camps.

37:50.020 --> 37:55.320
You just get to step down after you've destroyed the country there's no like fanfare he's just

37:55.320 --> 37:57.040
like I'm out of here guys.

37:57.040 --> 38:02.440
I mean I'm sure it wouldn't be you know the smoothest exit.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.840
Listen folks I got a cabin I'm gonna get out of here.

38:04.840 --> 38:05.840
I gotta go.

38:05.840 --> 38:06.840
I gotta go.

38:06.840 --> 38:07.840
This place is a shithole by the way.

38:07.840 --> 38:13.260
Um yeah I think this is nonsensical and it's also deeply irresponsible to tell your already

38:13.260 --> 38:19.020
terrified and paranoid and gullible ass audience that you're a year away from death camps because

38:19.020 --> 38:21.200
of fucking Joe Biden.

38:21.200 --> 38:28.280
Why in God's name would somebody bother with a false flag whenever you just said that you're

38:28.280 --> 38:34.540
a year away from death camps so you should be out and out being like we gotta terrorize

38:34.540 --> 38:37.600
these people otherwise we're gonna be in a death camp.

38:37.600 --> 38:46.160
I mean yeah it's you know terrorist edging mixed with terrorist pre-rationalization and

38:46.160 --> 38:47.160
denial.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.160
Absolutely.

38:48.160 --> 38:54.400
But there's other folks in the past who have had death camps and Alex is a scholar on the

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
matters.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.400
I disagree.

38:56.400 --> 39:04.920
Hitler got into power in 1933 he wasn't sending people to death camps until 1942.

39:04.920 --> 39:05.920
Oh.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.920
He was sending people to prison.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.920
Oh wow.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.920
First he took the job.

39:09.920 --> 39:10.920
Holy shit.

39:10.920 --> 39:16.440
He wouldn't let them have businesses put them in ghettos but that's how this works.

39:16.440 --> 39:20.400
So Alex doesn't know anything about Hitler's rise to power as he fully demonstrated a couple

39:20.400 --> 39:24.560
episodes back but this attempt at rewriting Holocaust history is really upsetting.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.920
Yeah this is not good.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.160
According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum quote the first concentration camps

39:30.160 --> 39:35.720
in Germany were established soon after Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933.

39:35.720 --> 39:39.880
After the Night of Long Knives the purge of the SA that took place between June 30th and

39:39.880 --> 39:45.880
July 2nd 1934 Hitler assigned Heinrich Himmler to formalize the system of camps that was

39:45.880 --> 39:47.020
going on.

39:47.020 --> 39:52.360
The camps that were primarily for the purpose fully of extermination did come later but

39:52.360 --> 39:57.760
even if you want to give Alex the most generous interpretation possible Operation T4 started

39:57.760 --> 40:03.440
in January 1940 which is aimed at the systematic killing of people with disabilities in Germany.

40:03.440 --> 40:07.320
Alex's claim that the Nazis weren't sending people to death camps until 1942 is probably

40:07.320 --> 40:11.640
just him knowing that that's the year that Operation Reinhard began when the Nazis attempted

40:11.640 --> 40:13.880
to kill all the Jews in Poland.

40:13.880 --> 40:18.440
There's a larger picture that he's unaware of or weirdly ignoring and this should be

40:18.440 --> 40:22.600
another signifier that Alex has absolutely no idea about the reality of world history

40:22.600 --> 40:27.320
nor does he have any respect for majorly traumatizing and traumatic world events.

40:27.320 --> 40:30.560
He should never be taken seriously as claiming to know anything.

40:30.560 --> 40:37.520
Yeah yeah no and it's not just that he's and it's not even like he wants to remain ignorant

40:37.520 --> 40:42.480
or he doesn't want to learn things it's that he actively wants to go out of his way to

40:42.480 --> 40:49.200
learn and propagate things that did not happen in order to justify his bullshit now so anything

40:49.200 --> 40:54.720
he says about history is said entirely to be like it's totally okay for me to do whatever

40:54.720 --> 40:58.160
I want today has nothing to do with anything.

40:58.160 --> 41:03.960
Yeah it's and it's false depictions of yeah of like very very serious things and it's

41:03.960 --> 41:10.000
I mean that's disgusting that's just wild yeah fuck him fuck him so you know how Hillary

41:10.000 --> 41:16.400
Clinton projects her shadow her Jungian shadow on people she doesn't like her butt is that

41:16.400 --> 41:19.640
an important thing that I've heard her and Nadler and Maxine Waters all don't like their

41:19.640 --> 41:24.280
but they don't like their butts so they project this Jungian shadow on you so they think that

41:24.280 --> 41:29.120
you're bad because that's their Jungian shadow that they see on you but that's really them

41:29.120 --> 41:34.720
for Alex to say somebody else is projecting it's it's very rude well Alex he admits it

41:34.720 --> 41:39.160
he projects his shadow on people too okay good and that's why he thinks that everybody

41:39.160 --> 41:45.760
else is good at fucking oh I project my shadow on people I think people are powerful and

41:45.760 --> 41:52.600
amazing and have incredible ideas and are have an incredible sexual prowess and amazing

41:52.600 --> 42:00.740
dynamics and are just meant to build civilizations and and love freedom and justice but I've

42:00.740 --> 42:08.120
learned not to project what I believe and who I am on to others I can only hope now

42:08.120 --> 42:17.560
I love myself we know I have written a poem of myself to myself yeah there are no snakes

42:17.560 --> 42:22.560
under your bed I have learned not to project myself onto others I can only hope that everyone

42:22.560 --> 42:28.960
is as good at sex as me there is nothing wrong with masturbating you are very good at sex

42:28.960 --> 42:34.960
you do not masturbate at all what a doofus what a fine moron yeah unreal so now now

42:34.960 --> 42:40.760
we get to one of my favorite types of moments and I think it's this is let's let's just

42:40.760 --> 42:47.880
really like boil down his projection his understanding of Jungian shadows yeah comes down to Maxine

42:47.880 --> 42:53.160
Waters doesn't like her butt I have a huge dick I think metaphorical butt no I know I

42:53.160 --> 42:58.080
understand but metaphorically speaking Alex is literally talking about his sexual prowess

42:58.080 --> 43:01.880
he is literally talking about his sexual prowess with Maxine Waters it was just the butt you

43:01.880 --> 43:07.060
know she doesn't like her stinking butt she hates her butt I love my dick it's a metaphor

43:07.060 --> 43:13.240
with one it's literal with the other maybe it is so this next clip is my favorite kind

43:13.240 --> 43:18.320
of shit this is where Alex I think kind of forgets what he's talking about sure forgets

43:18.320 --> 43:25.240
he's on air then tells an incredibly depressing story and a story that makes him look pretty

43:25.240 --> 43:29.680
bad he does not kill another dog no no no dog killing okay good I want to take your

43:29.680 --> 43:38.600
calls and listen listen like coming to somebody and saying hey you need to go home we just

43:38.600 --> 43:48.080
got a call you're not answering your phone your dad just got killed in a car wreck or

43:48.080 --> 43:57.880
I don't like getting a call and going and telling a family member hey grandma's dead

43:57.880 --> 44:05.040
this was already really confusing as as a jumping off point but hold hold on hold on

44:05.040 --> 44:08.560
to your horse all right he doesn't like bad news doesn't like to give it doesn't like

44:08.560 --> 44:16.040
to get it doesn't like to do it it's unfortunate gotcha

44:16.040 --> 44:25.160
but it's our job to do this and if we're not honest yeah I had to see my grandmother in

44:25.160 --> 44:31.280
probably six months my dad's mom gosh I guess she's been gone my son was two years old he's

44:31.280 --> 44:42.920
18 now so I guess she's been gone a year and a half old like 17 plus years so close and

44:42.920 --> 44:47.120
I called my dad that afternoon before she died the next day and I said we got to go

44:47.120 --> 44:53.360
see me ma he goes you know funny you said that I feel like we need to go see her and

44:53.360 --> 44:58.960
then I was on coast to coast am till like four in the morning and my dad got there like

44:58.960 --> 45:04.040
seven he said let's go I was laying there on the bed came to my house I said back then

45:04.040 --> 45:07.320
I was younger I couldn't get out of bed when I was tired now I didn't have no problem doing

45:07.320 --> 45:13.000
it preparing myself to get up instantly and I said no no no and I went finally got up

45:13.000 --> 45:18.840
and I had a beer for breakfast and I had one more for dessert because I was really tired

45:18.840 --> 45:24.360
and only had like two hours sleep what is happening I'm just joking and then I got in

45:24.360 --> 45:29.840
the car on Rabiness Texas and 30 minutes before I get there he calls and says I just got there

45:29.840 --> 45:38.000
when she died and you missed it see so there's that invisible internet that the enemy knows

45:38.000 --> 45:42.680
about spiritual and they are so pissed they want to control it they don't they'll never

45:42.680 --> 45:49.400
dominate us what the fuck is going on man so let me break down that story because first

45:49.400 --> 45:54.200
of all he wasn't joking when he said he was drunk absolutely not get the fuck out of here

45:54.200 --> 45:58.440
just realized that like oh this looks really bad shouldn't have said I drank a beer at

45:58.440 --> 46:02.960
seven whoops and then another one for dessert and then another one for dessert and then

46:02.960 --> 46:10.960
I drove Jesus Christ what is happening I mean the real the real like headline of that story

46:10.960 --> 46:16.560
is I missed saying goodbye to my grandma because I was drinking in the morning well you could

46:16.560 --> 46:22.000
say that that's the answer to that because your dad was there at the house he was he

46:22.000 --> 46:28.160
got there on time but you decided to stick around and have a drink while beers yeah before

46:28.160 --> 46:34.480
you drive yeah in the morning looks bad Alex it doesn't look good no just don't tell stories

46:34.480 --> 46:38.780
like that don't tell stories at all no and I don't know how this connects to an invisible

46:38.780 --> 46:43.240
internet that everybody has I guess he thinks that because they got it they were like let's

46:43.240 --> 46:49.880
go visit her and then she died coincidentally and they were like oh we just got this psychic

46:49.880 --> 46:57.080
idea that she was going to die soon yeah but again even if that's true yeah Alex you were

46:57.080 --> 47:02.880
up and you just drank beer in the morning and then drove to visit her this is a story

47:02.880 --> 47:11.280
about you ignoring psychic powers it would be yeah yeah yeah it would be a story about

47:11.280 --> 47:15.800
you believing that your psychic powers were less important than your desire to have a

47:15.800 --> 47:21.520
breakfast beer I gotta listen listen I I had a rough one I stayed up till four I gotta

47:21.520 --> 47:26.040
drink a Guinness in the morning to get going yeah look George Norie was chewing my ear

47:26.040 --> 47:32.660
off last night exactly talking about ghosts or something oh my god so anyway that was

47:32.660 --> 47:39.480
a little bit weird yeah but now we get into what I'm gonna call Alex's main breakdown

47:39.480 --> 47:45.160
of the Super Bowl okay okay I forgot the Super Bowl happened yeah he doesn't talk about the

47:45.160 --> 47:49.200
halftime show or any of that stuff nearly as much as you might think wow because there's

47:49.200 --> 47:54.060
another thing it's too obviously satanic there's a no I don't think so there's just another

47:54.060 --> 48:01.400
thing that's a little more important okay and that's Alex is racism so Tom Brady won

48:01.400 --> 48:10.100
his seventh Super Bowl and they're just calling him a cross between Hercules and Apollo he's

48:10.100 --> 48:17.120
being worshipped but again it's only a game at the end of the day but we understand that

48:17.120 --> 48:23.080
human competition and human striving is what makes us great so in a way it's very wholesome

48:23.080 --> 48:27.500
men competing against each other women competing against each other but on to this they add

48:27.500 --> 48:33.760
all the globalism they add the propaganda they add the anti-family the racial separation

48:33.760 --> 48:40.080
messages what so they know you hunger for this competition oh what now and then they

48:40.080 --> 48:49.220
show the so-called black quarterback oh what now the Kansas team the Kansas City team oh

48:49.220 --> 48:54.720
what now this is about as wide as I am and the media says it's racist that Tom Brady

48:54.720 --> 49:04.120
won oh that means Ronald McDonald's black too he's got curly hair oh boy oh boy oh boy

49:04.120 --> 49:10.760
it is absolutely not racist that Tom Brady won what that was was racist oh yeah Alex

49:10.760 --> 49:16.800
while Alex once again has put on one of his famous hats that is the I get to decide people's

49:16.800 --> 49:24.320
race hat yeah yeah suppose wow wow this is this is ugly it goes on quite a while that's

49:24.320 --> 49:28.400
wild so the media didn't say that the game was racist Alex is just pointing to a bunch

49:28.400 --> 49:32.400
of anonymous people on Twitter who posted jokes about a black quarterback losing during

49:32.400 --> 49:36.880
Black History Month and then pretending that it's a serious argument the media is making

49:36.880 --> 49:41.800
I grant that a lot of people rightly don't like Tom Brady because he's a dick but this

49:41.800 --> 49:46.680
angle that Alex is taking is stupid it's based on literally nothing and it's deeply deeply

49:46.680 --> 49:53.960
racist very racist it gets so much worse yeah if you are if you are like oh I hate it when

49:53.960 --> 50:01.520
the media points out racism in the wrong way right but your defense of that is to get more

50:01.520 --> 50:05.840
racist huh I don't think the first part happened at all and I think you just want an excuse

50:05.840 --> 50:10.720
to be racist I think it feels that I feel it feels a lot like that it feels like you

50:10.720 --> 50:15.360
just really don't like black quarterbacks because of one Colin Kaepernick and so any

50:15.360 --> 50:20.240
chance you have to be like oh the media blows whatever yeah I think that's oversimplifying

50:20.240 --> 50:25.640
it because we could you can even greater oversimplify and just say Alex is a fucking huge racist

50:25.640 --> 50:29.640
wow there's definitely that it's not even about Kaepernick it pre-existed that that

50:29.640 --> 50:36.260
is true that is true and also it has to do with vegetables sure all of it is the attempt

50:36.260 --> 50:47.600
to project onto anything and everything going on racial division remember AOC said don't

50:47.600 --> 50:58.720
grow cauliflower she saw cauliflower growing at a New York community garden and she said

50:58.720 --> 51:05.920
it's white cauliflower is from Africa you dumb monster what does it matter what color

51:05.920 --> 51:11.720
it is whether it's purple or black or brown or green or red if it tastes good as nutritious

51:11.720 --> 51:17.760
but that's total mental illness ladies and gentlemen we've talked about this before but

51:17.760 --> 51:23.160
just because it's relevant here's the full quote quote what I love too is growing plants

51:23.160 --> 51:27.300
that are culturally familiar to the community it's so important so that's really how you

51:27.300 --> 51:31.760
do it right that's such a core component of the green new deal is having all these projects

51:31.760 --> 51:36.100
make sense in a cultural context and it's an area that we get the most pushback on because

51:36.100 --> 51:40.680
people say why do you need to do that that's too hard but when you really think about it

51:40.680 --> 51:45.120
when someone's saying it's too hard to do a green space that grows yucca instead of

51:45.120 --> 51:49.340
I don't know cauliflower or something what you're doing is taking a colonial approach

51:49.340 --> 51:54.660
to environmentalism that's why a lot of communities of color get resistant to certain environmentalist

51:54.660 --> 51:59.200
movements because they come with a colonial lens on them yeah this is not about cauliflower

51:59.200 --> 52:04.600
being white it has nothing to do with that but see one the thing the reason that I read

52:04.600 --> 52:08.840
that quote again even though we've talked about this is because you wouldn't cover this

52:08.840 --> 52:13.680
that way you wouldn't cover this the way Alex is covering it unless you had a vested interest

52:13.680 --> 52:19.200
in trying to create a white victimhood argument for your racist audience to enjoy yeah and

52:19.200 --> 52:24.760
that's kind of exactly what he's doing with the Super Bowl too and it's bad I mean it's

52:24.760 --> 52:34.220
real bad it's hard not to look at all of these things because it's it's so awful how these

52:34.220 --> 52:40.360
people think of just like oh there's no way that this thing could be racist that's just

52:40.360 --> 52:45.400
silly you're just making a mountain out of a molehill you know but if you actually just

52:45.400 --> 52:50.400
listen to what people are saying and then look into it you can find like the tiniest

52:50.400 --> 52:55.720
things are built on a fucking mountain of racism yeah and if you look into it if you

52:55.720 --> 53:00.580
would be interested and if you would be curious about it you might find holy shit there's

53:00.580 --> 53:05.400
racism under all this stuff that I would think oh the penny you think the penny's racist

53:05.400 --> 53:12.400
and you probably look into it and it fucking is you know like it's that kind of shit and

53:12.400 --> 53:17.960
it might not be but you should take people's word and like it'd be interesting yeah I don't

53:17.960 --> 53:24.280
know I think I think that a lot of folks are guilty of this I mean it's the sound biting

53:24.280 --> 53:33.800
of of culture and information transfer sure but the people do it out of laziness sometimes

53:33.800 --> 53:38.760
and out of racism sometimes yeah and a bunch of other motivations but never forget you

53:38.760 --> 53:44.460
can do it both ways yeah yeah so but I think and the intersection there is that Alex is

53:44.460 --> 53:50.520
racist and he's also super lazy because he's really just reading a Paul Joseph Watson article

53:50.520 --> 53:56.640
because Paul Joseph Watson knows that his audience eats this stuff up so they like the

53:56.640 --> 54:01.060
thing that I kept thinking while I was listening to this is like these dicks thought this was

54:01.060 --> 54:07.320
worth their time I saw Paul Joseph Watson article this morning at info wars.com saying

54:07.320 --> 54:11.920
Tom Brady winning Super Bowl is racist oh this is a joke so I read about 20 tweets by

54:11.920 --> 54:15.680
black people saying it I didn't believe it I went to their accounts they were serious

54:15.680 --> 54:22.760
and I read hundreds more ooh they said it's so insulting he beat a black man there was

54:22.760 --> 54:27.640
a lot of black men helped Tom Brady win that Super Bowl and I'm telling you they were black

54:27.640 --> 54:33.520
folks whoa the quarterback I guess it's a gimmick kind of like who's the leader one

54:33.520 --> 54:36.960
of the founders of Black Lives Matter he's totally white what is happening got that other

54:36.960 --> 54:40.760
white lady said she was black and she said have one drop of African in her I mean what

54:40.760 --> 54:47.280
are we doing this is insane do you think you're winning because you know Brady had at least

54:47.280 --> 54:51.520
like a half white team with the New England Patriots oh god it's white people winning

54:51.520 --> 54:56.360
but is his Buccaneers teams almost all black what the hell does it even matter what color

54:56.360 --> 55:05.760
he is but this is the mental illness I thought the tweets had to be a joke but it's all about

55:05.760 --> 55:10.280
the fact that he wasn't ashamed of President Trump who was a fan before he was president

55:10.280 --> 55:19.040
you seem to be the one who's upset you seem very upset very upset ridiculously over-the-top

55:19.040 --> 55:23.560
upset and pretty racist very race and then once they slaughtered him I didn't even watch

55:23.560 --> 55:28.520
the end of it because it was just such a collapse by the other team and they're like look the

55:28.520 --> 55:37.720
black quarterbacks losing dude that other quarterback had whiter skin than I do I just

55:37.720 --> 55:43.480
I'll curl my hair and say I'm black oh it doesn't even matter it's like what the hell

55:43.480 --> 55:47.280
does that have to do with anything what color a quarterback is it's actually it's how good

55:47.280 --> 55:52.120
they play why if Tom Brady was a black guy he would be just as famous or probably more

55:52.120 --> 56:00.080
so and I would still think he was an amazing quarterback I see I challenge personal successes

56:00.080 --> 56:07.120
not just like oh my skin's pink but that's mental illness ladies and gentlemen talk about

56:07.120 --> 56:13.320
colors I like there's nobody green my dad knows that he gave me a green watch maybe

56:13.320 --> 56:20.000
I'm a Martian I mean I got a purple shirt on folks and I like purple people like eggplant

56:20.000 --> 56:23.840
this is mental illness ladies and gentlemen I got a black microphone what does that mean

56:23.840 --> 56:28.480
I like how it looks what's back in the day nobody had black microphones everybody copies

56:28.480 --> 56:35.800
me don't know what's going on anymore I don't know what's happening what was that what was

56:35.800 --> 56:41.520
that I don't know if your uncle started at a certain point you put rolls in your uncle's

56:41.520 --> 56:45.720
mouth to keep him from talking I would I am honestly confused by his idea that everyone's

56:45.720 --> 56:50.920
ripping him off with black microphone I'm just I just don't know I think that it's that

56:50.920 --> 56:55.600
is all just about rush used to have a gold microphone and Alex is trying to like be like

56:55.600 --> 57:00.160
I was different sure something I don't know that's that's a startlingly racist thing that

57:00.160 --> 57:08.760
he's oh wow yeah and now he goes back to complete comparing Mahomes to Sean King and Rachel

57:08.760 --> 57:16.440
Dolezal and man this is just this is it's not good no it's not good but I know you all

57:16.440 --> 57:24.060
know that but it's the way they project yeah what's that idiot's name Sean King no African

57:24.060 --> 57:29.320
blood I mean just look at him boy takes on identity of black people so you can raise

57:29.320 --> 57:32.800
hundreds of millions of dollars and then who's the other lady the blonde haired lady that

57:32.800 --> 57:40.860
like frizzes her hair out and puts puts what's her name Rachel dolls are yeah I mean it's

57:40.860 --> 57:48.080
sick folks it's absolutely sick and it's mentally ill but but I'm digressing I'm almost out

57:48.080 --> 57:54.320
of time this segment I wanted to illustrate let's just keep rolling it Tom Brady knows

57:54.320 --> 57:59.440
that it's not as bad as the flu or pneumonia knows that it's a hoax refuses to wear his

57:59.440 --> 58:05.700
mask at the beginning after the game and they're so mad and he did that on purpose that makes

58:05.700 --> 58:11.160
me like Tom Brady way more than the fact that he is the greatest of all time no doubt in

58:11.160 --> 58:17.160
the NFL he's now the greatest of all time not being a coward like the other white dude

58:17.160 --> 58:22.960
posing as a black dude on the other team that got his ass ran over maybe if you'd had a

58:22.960 --> 58:30.480
black quarterback you would have not lost I got some real black quarterbacks and another

58:30.480 --> 58:35.600
quarterbacks great that right there is the tell that Alex is racist trolling oh yeah

58:35.600 --> 58:38.960
that right there when he's laughing is like other quarterbacks actually pretty you know

58:38.960 --> 58:45.400
he's pretty good that's the that is the signifier but my point is me like throwing passes when

58:45.400 --> 58:48.960
he's being tackled that people are catching yeah I mean look at this ladies and gentlemen

58:48.960 --> 58:54.360
there's Rachel dozell or whatever the hell her name is but this is all the global is

58:54.360 --> 58:59.840
trying to get us to in-fight with each other yeah there's the quarterback and I mean you

58:59.840 --> 59:05.920
know he's look at that look at that hair he's getting that curled folks he's in there hours

59:05.920 --> 59:13.420
a week getting it all like that so he can say he's black what was his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaddy

59:13.420 --> 59:18.620
black this is where we realize that Alex doesn't realize that Mahomes dad was a professional

59:18.620 --> 59:25.200
baseball player yeah yeah he's not very interested in that this is now this is wildly racist

59:25.200 --> 59:32.560
to a to adjust just I'm amazed that you can keep going I feel like you already nailed

59:32.560 --> 59:37.600
your racism and you you're done you know like he said he might as well just be like I don't

59:37.600 --> 59:42.480
believe anybody's black if I don't want them to and then you're done Alex is white you

59:42.480 --> 59:48.640
finished Alex is white insecurity and his white identity got it really alarmed by people

59:48.640 --> 59:54.680
making jokes about Mahomes losing during Black History Month and the only way that he could

59:54.680 --> 01:00:00.040
deal with that is to do an outrageously racist segment on his show yeah that goes on and

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:06.080
on and on where he tries to be the arbiter of saying that he's not actually even black

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:14.400
yeah to what end is this I am confused yeah I am very confused by um I don't know just

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.840
the continued existence of the universe in a certain to a certain extent you know like

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.800
part of me is like I don't understand how this country has made it as long as it has

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.180
if it is rewarded this moron so much you know like there's there's a fundamental confusion

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:35.240
I get from listening to this of just like how who why what are we doing I don't know

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:41.920
what are we doing so Alex plays a clip of Joe Biden has he had a little message before

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.620
the Super Bowl see that's what sorry sorry I have to this is what I this is what got

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:51.240
to me this is what I realized was screwing with my head apologies for interrupting sure

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.920
and derailing this entire problem where I'm fired I get it no problem I I remember something

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:07.360
important happening right now that a sophisticated news political show would talk about and that

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:14.860
is not Tom Brady at depth it's the president that he thinks is God is being impeached have

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:20.680
you like is there anything have you seen my home's hair though Alex needs to talk about

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.720
it you can't be that mad about the devil being the president so Biden gave a little bit of

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.400
a little message you're right in a moment of silence for the people lost to COVID-19

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:39.000
yeah at the Super Bowl and Alex has a video of it where it sounds like people are booing

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.800
Biden sure it's unclear if this video is authentic because there are other videos that don't

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:52.420
really have you know there's like some applause and then some crowd noise sure but who cares

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:57.700
yeah I don't give a fuck I don't remember Alex reporting about how everyone booed the

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.680
shit out of Trump no that baseball game no that wasn't a big deal so anyway I don't care

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.040
but he does cover that and he's like ah look at this guy getting booed and then he gets

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:13.100
into his analysis of the commercials mostly just the Springsteen commercial it's Bruce

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:18.620
Springsteen riding around like he's John Wayne he supports taking your guns he supports breaking

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:23.480
it he supports transgender stuff in the bathrooms of your kids he hates Trump look it up oh

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.760
but now he's the good guy gonna bring you together he's Bruce Springsteen he's the spirit

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.200
of America here is this disgustingly condescending ad

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:44.880
four years ago I was in the middle of a custody battle there's a chapel in Kansas standing

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:54.840
on the exact center of the lower 48 it never closes all are more than welcome more companies

01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:02.200
here in the middle I don't care for that ad myself but I don't think Alex has any right

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:10.080
to complain or critique commercials no it's uh it's a little bit uh obnoxious so Alex

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.400
had you know he said he's going to take some calls and so he gets around to it but he comes

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.440
in from break and the uh the the board op or maybe whoever it is tries them with a little

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:34.200
bit of Elvis oh so we are just counting down here counting down oh is this Elvis let's

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:40.960
hear a little bit of this we're counting down to the false flag next hour I'm gonna premiere

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:47.640
the proof of them coming for you and me he doesn't at least you know they're coming little

01:03:47.640 --> 01:04:00.240
less talk a little more action wrong so I guess that's what the left wants to give us

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.440
emergency alert bubbles preparing massive false flags so pretext for soviet-style purge

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:13.080
watch live and just watch it all happen so this Elvis song that is not a little more

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:18.080
a little less conversation a little more action it's just let yourself go yeah this gets Alex

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.120
into a little bit of a mood and he starts rambling you know he's been mad about black

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.560
people and white people playing football so it's nice to listen to music whoever white

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.920
man stealing black people's music it's nice yeah and that makes Alex that makes him want

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.600
to kill I mean the shotgun shack in the middle of the woods my lady listen to this

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:53.520
real tight enjoy yourself and baby don't fight I'm gonna stop being bad I'm not gonna drink

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:59.280
any I'm joking oh let ourselves go in a war too that gonna be fun a little bit still war

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:06.240
kind of the same type of deal isn't it whoa what's going on nobody's scared no more except

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:15.320
those people that are dying when the killers come when the killers come when the dying

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:22.200
starts when the praying to mommy starts don't look like the left's much ready for a war

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:27.800
but they sure want one cuz they ain't ever been in one all right now they're gonna play

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.400
that old bumper music that's how I like me some Elvis I apologize for ranting here we

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.160
got Catherine we got Pastor Sam we got Harry we got Tyler we got Terry we got Kevin we

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:43.960
got Steve we got James we got Chris we got Mike and Russell we got 20-something callers

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.640
and I said I want seven on that board because I don't want to keep people on hold but let's

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:55.600
just go to them now while we sit here waiting for that big old juicy false flag terror attack

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.320
so they can start that civil war and break this country up real nice I think Alex might

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:06.840
have had a meeting with somebody in the bathroom yeah yeah that's yeah buddy got a little bit

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:20.280
of a little pep in his step so he takes so his first caller is a guy who calls in all

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.520
the time named Pastor Sam and one of the things that I find really interesting about Alex's

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:31.000
techniques with callers is he creates false conflict with them often whenever they disagree

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.240
with him on like a minute point he'll create a false fight with them to sort of frame their

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.040
position in a certain way that he can respond to that doesn't allow the nuance of the the

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:48.260
matter to be dealt with in this case Alex had made some comments about how you know

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:52.840
if the gun confiscators come you don't want to be at home you don't want to start a fight

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.560
with the police because that's you know that's how the whole civil war is going to start

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:02.120
if you end up doing that no you got to target the the high level globalist sure sure sure

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:10.080
sure and Pastor Sam's position is more like if they're coming to take our guns then it's

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:16.440
it's already past the point you would think and and and that nuance is dangerous for Alex

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:23.720
to have because it hurt his brain well and it would it would it requires that his actual

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:29.400
positions sound a lot more like aggressively and immediately violent than he wants them

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:35.500
to and then he thinks can be profitable so he starts a fight but don't worry we got patriots

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:40.560
think it's time for war too Pastor Sam I see you strongly disagree with me this is not

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:46.240
the time to lie down you know Pastor Sam I didn't say lie down I said if the cops are

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.720
coming to confiscate guns at your house it's a good idea to not be waiting for them and

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:54.960
kill them because they've been brainwashed I get it a certain point it's going to start

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:02.040
up here but uh well it's not lying down I'm saying the target isn't the police so if they

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:08.880
get the police to come for our guns I'm a big boy I'm a smart boy then I would want

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.920
to go after which I'm not saying do the actual people that were running the show nice save

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:20.080
there you call that lying down tell me Pastor Sam how to be a man tell me how to do it well

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.920
I know you said to dispense with the niceties but first I'm going to tell you tell me how

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.180
to be a man Sam I'm going to tell you that I love you and that I'm a prayer partner for

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:34.740
what you're doing and I I've followed you for 20 years yeah so Alex is he's created

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:40.000
this tone that is completely artificial with this call so there's no hope of any point

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.360
actually being discussed and there isn't it just goes nowhere that sounds about right

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:51.080
yep uh so he goes to another call and this person has a very very easy to answer question

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:57.420
okay Catherine in Canada you're on the air welcome hi there hi Alex how are you I'm

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:02.200
all right go ahead welcome okay I want to make a point about the January 6th event for

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.840
all these people that think there was just Trump supporters for five years there was

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:12.080
a counter protest at every Trump event I just want to ask these people that want to explain

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.120
from people where was their counter protest that day people in those communities felt

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.560
very strongly that it would be too dangerous yeah they dissuaded people from taking part

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.520
because they didn't want people to more people to be killed yeah they were like hey stay

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:33.860
away these people are violent Trump supporters might kill people at this thing and then they

01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:39.720
were roundly mocked and then Trump supporters killed people at that thing so yeah I mean

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:45.320
it's a question it's a super easy to answer question yes this is not the first time that

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:51.720
this has happened there were greatly diminished counter protesting that happened at the gun

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:57.480
rally in Virginia yeah the the one that Alex went to and they tried to be very insightful

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:04.800
at in the sighting at not insightful yeah yeah that that happens sometimes the counter

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:13.300
protest folk I believe prioritize safety they like to live yeah and and a lot of times those

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:18.960
people will be a little bit more responsible and in the case of January 6th there was pretty

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.300
pretty consistent messaging that I saw from people that that I'm aware of that this is

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:30.060
not a good thing to go counter demonstrate what I'd like to know what I'd like to know

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:35.320
is where were the counter protesters at the thing that we said was going to be a violent

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.560
display of our power yeah the implication of course is that they were mixed in the crowd

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.240
of course but that's all bullshit so I you know Alex is yelling doing this fake fighting

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:51.320
with his calls and I'm like this guy is fucked up I think he's I think he's doing speed yeah

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.800
it's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads and I get overly excited agree people ask me all

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.140
the time they go Jones are you on cocaine or you want meth yeah are you so excited why

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:08.080
are you starting another ad if people are always asking you if you're on drugs there's

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.520
a decent chance you're on drugs oh and when you go on Joe Rogan's show and Joe Rogan

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.320
asks you about how you told him that you have a problem with Adderall well that's a little

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:25.060
bit well that one's a little bit more like the pictures are starting the pictures starting

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:30.460
to come into focus yeah we had a real rough start of this show and now the energy is flying

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:35.960
high yeah that's so almost like someone took something yeah it's all because usually as

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.840
you work throughout the day you get more tired you know and maybe I and I've had this happen

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:46.160
before Dan have you ever been working for like six hours right yeah and you know you

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.400
got some more work to do but right around that six hours you're just so tired and you

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.960
could just really use a pick-me-up you know sure so you go get a cup of coffee or you

01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:00.400
go into the bathroom and you snort some rails you do what you gotta do to make it through

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.800
the last two hours dad I'm not saying that that is the case but I'm really coming around

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:10.320
on the idea that he's on drugs yeah like it just it makes a lot of sense and I think the

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:17.160
fact that Rogan asked him that question really really makes me a bit more open to the idea

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.960
because why would Rogan bring that up if it wasn't something that Alex had brought up

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.740
with him and it's and it sounded like it was coming from a place of genuine concern as

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:30.320
well passion yes friendship yep yep hey I don't want you to keep hurting yourself man

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:38.600
yeah yeah and yeah and there we are and Alex keeps saying that everybody insists he's on

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.600
drugs everybody keeps saying that I'm taking these two drugs that I consistently write

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.540
you know and it's just like oh yeah I take a little coke and a little meth but you do

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.640
a little bit of each that way you don't have to do as much look give me a cup I'm pissing

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.720
it now um so I got like I told you at the beginning of this I got really excited because

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.700
Alex said he's gonna have Jay Dyer on yes and they're gonna talk this guy is the guy

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:06.440
who's the primary source reader right and all this I immediately lost all respect oh

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.920
no what would you call this period of time we're in right now I think it's pretty clear

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.800
they're getting they're saying patriots are terrorists they're gonna arrest us all we're

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.280
about to stage terror attacks clearly they're getting ready to stage terror attacks in my

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.000
view do you agree with that and what would you call this period of time we're in and

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.160
what are you doing to get ready for it because every few generations goes through some real

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:32.040
tyranny we're about to go through a big one this is the age of transition right this is

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:38.080
their phraseology for how we go from the way things were during this Christian period of

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:44.160
the age of you know Pisces the age of the fish to the Aquarian Age which is what Blavatsky

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.440
right one of the esoteric philosophers that the elite always like to look to she called

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.360
this the externalization of the hierarchy holy shit go tell Carrie Cassidy about it

01:13:53.360 --> 01:14:05.880
no shit oh god now my worldview is based on this woman from the 1830s who thought she

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:11.760
could do magic Jesus and my fear that other people have learned to do magic from her you

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.200
know the problem that I'm having look he's a moron that's to be expected the problem

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:23.080
that I'm having is Jay Dyer is a great DJ name it's such a great DJ name yeah I would

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:29.680
love to be Jay Dyer that's so good you know Jay Dilla is great Jay Dyer is great it'd

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:35.120
be awesome to have a collaboration with his ghost because apparently Jay Dyer believes

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.840
that those ghosts can talk to oh yeah oh yeah yeah Edgar Casey can connect me with DJs of

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:48.520
the past through David Wilcock spirit you do not need to do any voices yeah you don't

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:57.800
need to do scratching on the record okay so this next clip Jordan I don't really care

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.800
about him and Dyer's interview it is dumb yeah no I've already whenever you start when

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.820
you start with Helena Blavatsky I'm out yeah I'm out yeah that's yeah that's kind of a

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:12.600
rule of mine you can have fun conversations with friends about these sorts of things and

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.080
you know we can we can talk about stuff but when you want to make me scared of your big

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.200
bad guy enemies and and insist that they follow the teachings of Helena Blavatsky yeah I'm

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.760
out that's like that's one step further than if somebody's like you know the Unabomber did

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:35.200
make some good points though I'm just look I know there's stuff you know I think it's

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.920
a little more fun because at least there's magic involved that's true anyway so Alex

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:48.240
gets to talking about Trump a little bit here and he says something that I find unacceptable

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.860
okay if you listen to this clip and you understand what Alex is saying the last five years of

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:58.680
Alex's life have been wrong uh-huh they've been meaningless yes and Alex has been an

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:04.400
instrumental part of the globalist plan to bring in tyranny does he know that I think

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.700
Trump meant well he was a nationalist he knew America was being screwed over but that the

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:14.160
establishment let him win he did win by landslide four years ago because they knew they could

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:21.360
run circles around him and use him to energize the left to basically commit any crime and

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:26.720
then support a total police state and abandon any values they had and I think that's clearly

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.720
evident now from from my perspective that at a sophisticated level we were all all played

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:40.160
wow so you are a useful idiot exactly like you claimed you were not to a guy three days

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:46.840
ago yeah I mean there's there's really no other way to interpret that because I mean

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.560
I guess the left wouldn't have been turned into whatever this is that would facilitate

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:57.340
tyranny if Clinton had won sure so I guess the only way to reach the point where actual

01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.720
tyranny could happen Trump had to win right and Alex has said many many times that Trump

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.640
wouldn't have won if it wasn't for info it does seem like that and that would also heavily

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:13.440
imply that Roger Stone is working for the globalist Alex to hell yeah you know be this

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.800
bully pulpit for Trump yeah I'm you know what I could believe that or maybe Alex is making

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.560
all of this stuff up Dan yeah Alex is making all this stuff he might just be making it

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:28.160
all up yeah he's just spitballing and nothing he says means anything but if he were being

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.600
serious he would then have to the next thought should be and I should shut up yeah because

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.840
you quit yeah because clearly I make all the wrong decisions that laid us to this but this

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.880
is my fault in the last half a decade I have been leading you to tyranny exactly state

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.120
and I've made multiple documentaries with police state in the title I'm supposed to

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.700
know better exactly and not just that but you followed me to get to where we are meaning

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.360
I am the reason that we are where we are and I am a bad leader and you should not follow

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.640
me anymore now four years ago I was going through a divorce oh okay well now I'm back

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:11.400
on your side are you selling anything uh maybe wait around for three minutes we'll find out

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:18.320
we'll see we'll see look we got one last clip here okay and it's like I think everybody

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.460
kind of expected there to be more talk about the Super Bowl halftime show as opposed to

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:29.500
Alex just being racist sure but that's every time when you think he's gonna zig he zogs

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:34.840
that's what he does um so he uh he talks about the halftime show a tiny bit with Jay Dyer

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:41.640
and like this clip is just titled stupid talk about halftime show because this is stupid

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.000
but you were mentioning to me did you see that halftime show and I I don't normally

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.520
watch Super Bowl because I knew Tom Brady wouldn't be wearing a mask I know I like him

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:55.260
I watched it they're all wearing a skull mask they're subhuman but the one guy has speech

01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:00.000
and they all like puppets do what he says this was very sick at a subconscious level

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.760
it means you are robots in a fascist event you are skeletons you are dead I control you

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:12.760
exactly a lot of things going on here symbolically speaking it began with this choir of robots

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.480
drones right so everybody's up in the in the choir with the weekend guy they're singing

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.960
and they're all just sort of doing what they're like you know puppets like they're they're

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:27.880
on a marionette right I just my response to all of this kind of conversation is like if

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.120
you guys are just high kicking around like a hacky sack and this is the conversation

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:40.240
you want to have great but if you're adults on a presumably grown-up news world events

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:45.800
radio show that you very seriously this is unbecoming yeah this kind of conversation

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:53.960
is laughably stupid oh oh oh you're all drones and only the weekend has a voice yeah and

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:59.880
the only people who should be allowed to publicly discuss the semiotics of this event would

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.520
be somebody it would be like Umberto Eco who could be like I'm gonna put this in the context

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.820
of all of this others but even then it's a fucking Super Bowl halftime show guys go go

01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:14.500
to bed here's the thing go to bed here's the thing that I want to ask as a rhetorical question

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:21.120
but I also want an answer these types of things have been going on forever talking about the

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:26.720
symbology of halftime shows and the show ology of these music videos and all this shit yeah

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.880
I want to know these motherfuckers people like Jay Dyer they pretend that they study

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.780
this stuff uh-huh that it's like an actual field of totally of information I want concrete

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:45.040
examples of things that they've known in advance because of these symbols that they read in

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:54.680
music videos and halftime show Dan I would love it's all around you what the evidence

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.920
look out your window Dan see that's why that's the halftime that's why I wanted it to be

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.360
retort that's the Super Bowl halftime show I just want I just want to know what magical

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.400
like psychic revelations you get from oh also they took off the masks in the second song

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:15.200
in the performance oh but who cares oh who cares yeah I just I find this stuff really

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.580
dumb I used to really enjoy reading blogs that would talk about like people have cover

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:29.320
in one eye yeah sign of the Illuminati yeah when I was young yeah and I all the time has

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:34.620
any how many Super Bowl halftime shows are even memorable and none of them for their

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:43.240
semiotics Janet Jackson exactly that was not the semiotics of what she was wearing no the

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.840
Prince hologram won a couple years ago wasn't there that was kind of bad yeah right yeah

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:56.560
that's it who gives a shit about the halftime show it's a thing we talk about people like

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:03.080
Alex care a lot it's a thing we talk about every year for a day and then we're done just

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:08.720
let's just not talk about it for that day I think that there's a lot of potential for

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:13.800
like interesting performance I think that you know God bless people who you know really

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:21.160
really try choreographers are great and I think that I'm just aged out of the point

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:25.200
where I can get too excited about a lot of the musical acts but I can still appreciate

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:29.320
like I get it you know like I can watch the weekend's performance I can be like this is

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:33.200
not necessarily for me it's not my favorite thing but I get it look at him performing

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:40.200
the hell out of it sure yeah yeah it's it's fodder for people who have a tough time coming

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.720
up with things to talk about and for people like Alex who just need to be mad at something

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.800
and the Super Bowl is such a perfect thing in that wheelhouse for Alex because you have

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:57.720
the like sublimating of mail drives to war that he can complain about whatever symbology

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:04.720
is on the halftime show he can complain about and apparently the race of people and whether

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:10.480
or not they constitute being black according to Alex Jones which is fucking disgraceful

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:16.280
that is that is really disqualifying as like allowed in polite society ever again yeah

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:20.360
like you should be shunned like that that deserves a shunning it would be interesting

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:26.500
for someone to like sit down and try to explain to Alex exactly why that display was so flagrantly

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.960
racist yeah but I don't think he would understand I don't think it's possible I think he just

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:36.200
needs a good universal shunning everybody's shunned him I think most people have gotten

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:42.320
that message I think so too we need some more though Dan let's raise up the shunning sure

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:48.000
so alright we reached the end of this episode and Alex apparently did not enjoy the Super

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.340
Bowl yeah and I thought we were gonna get to the impeachment trial stuff today but because

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:59.600
it was Tuesday it got started sure that will come on the Friday episode we'll check in

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.240
see how Alex is handling all that stuff but I do think that this this episode is important

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:11.920
to go over because of the incredible racism Wow and because of the clear turn towards

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.440
really aggressively being like false flags are coming they are coming yeah coming I guarantee

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:21.360
they're going to happen yeah and you can't read that any other way than preemptive damage

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:27.000
control when it's coming from someone like Alex someone who is so invested in terrorist

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.760
edging yep and we'll be back on Friday to discuss impeachment business indeed we will

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.400
do I understand you were watching it today because I saw some tweets yeah I had some

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:43.380
fun uh Bruce Castor is I mean that was one of the most fundamentally disgraceful things

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:49.360
I've ever seen in my entire life bad argumentation no no argumentation just rambling gotta call

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:55.400
Barnes randomly just randomly just like hey you know what being a senator is pretty cool

01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:01.280
you know we're we're extraordinary people here you know it'd be great like uh uh uh

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:15.440

Republican just runs up to him Barnes kicks him in the gut gives him a stunner yeah absolutely

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:28.320
absolutely but Larry Klayman coming from the sting spot and drops down right on top about
