N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,160
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,420
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,640
Riddle Earth!

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,800
Riddle Earth!

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,500
I need money.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,820
Riddle Earth!

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,020
Riddle Earth!

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,840
Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice, Stop it.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,120
Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice, It's time to pray.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,480
Andy and Candice, you're on the air.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,560
Thanks for holding.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Hello Alex.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
I am a huge fan.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
I love your room.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Knowledgefight.com, knowledgefight.com.

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Love you.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,120
on knowledgefight.com.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,400
I love you.

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm Dan.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,660
I'm Jordan.

28
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,920
We're a couple dudes that surround technology beverages

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,240
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

30
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,640
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
Jordan.

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,300
Dan.

33
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,140
Jordan.

34
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,980
Quick question for you.

35
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,800
What's your bright spot today?

36
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,960
My bright spot today, Jordan, is mochi.

37
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,560
Ooh.

38
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,960
I've, I got.

39
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640
You've recently discovered mochi.

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Yes.

41
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,300
Yes.

42
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,760
And it is expanded from there.

43
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,080
I am off.

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,400
Next year we will be doing 500 new tastes of mochi.

45
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,220
No.

46
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,060
Oh.

47
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,120
I don't think that would be possible.

48
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,400
It'd be pretty difficult.

49
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,360
But I've tried a number of flavors

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,800
that I've been able to get my hands on.

51
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,540
And man, it's so good.

52
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,200
The thing that was really tough for me

53
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,200
was that I'd heard such startlingly different reviews.

54
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Sure, sure.

55
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,300
It's a divisive dessert.

56
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,140
Very much so.

57
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,540
And I'd worried that I would fall squarely

59
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,480
in the gl-eh category, but I love it.

60
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,160
And it also, I didn't realize it,

61
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,280
but it just takes me back a bit to, like,

62
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,440
things that I had in Hawaii growing up.

63
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,260
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,360
And that makes total sense,

65
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,400
but I didn't think that it would.

66
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Right, right, right, right.

67
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,800
And it's great, I love it.

68
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
So another dessert.

69
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Great, another fucking sweet thing for me to eat.

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,440
Just what we needed.

71
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,000
The audience was like, what other sweet things

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
is Dan gonna become obsessed with?

73
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,280
What will capture Dan's sweet tooth today?

74
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
Fuck.

75
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,160
Good news is people won't be mailing those to you.

76
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,200
No, that is true, thank God.

77
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Next thing you know, shit just comes in dry ice.

78
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,040
Start, start.

79
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,880
Dry ice.

80
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
Damn it!

81
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,440
And then just melted ones.

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,520
So yeah, Mochi, how about you?

83
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,680
Oh, my bright spot this week, Dan, is The Swordsman.

84
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,160
It's a Korean movie that's, I don't know, it's really good.

85
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,080
It's about three swordsmen, they do stuff, it's fantastic.

86
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
So it's swordsmen plural?

87
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
No, the movie is about singular.

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,640
Okay, so it's one of those three.

89
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,960
There are multiple that appear, yes indeed.

90
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,200
So it's like The Highlander,

91
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,800
there's more than one Highlander.

92
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,640
Yeah, absolutely.

93
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
Although there can only be one.

94
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,800
No, there's not more than one Highlander,

95
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,880
there's only one Highlander.

96
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,920
I mean, there are many people who live in the Highlands.

97
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,360
I thought that there was these immortals

98
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,320
and they have to kill each other.

99
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
Sure, of course they do, but the Highlander

100
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
specifically refers to that he's from Scotland.

101
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,960
Oh, that's right, Highlander isn't the group of them.

102
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,400
Yeah, yeah, and obviously as we all know

103
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,960
from just appearance and conversational style alone,

104
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Sean Connery is indeed Egyptian in that movie.

105
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
And the original Bond.

106
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,520
And the original Bond, yes, we have discovered so much today.

107
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,440
Yeah, a lot of education, referencing things we Googled

108
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
just before getting on the show.

109
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,960
So Jordan, today we have an interesting thing to go over.

110
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,840
We're gonna be talking about February 10th and 11th, 2021.

111
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,760
Butt check!

112
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,600
I'll let you have that one.

113
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,720
You let me have that one, you son of a bitch.

114
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Oh.

115
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,880
You son of a bitch.

116
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,040
I was still late,

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,720
cause I was halfway waiting for you to say it first.

118
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,000
I am disappointed in you because you had the open lane

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
and you still stutter stepped.

120
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,240
No, it's like, it's like,

121
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
You thought it was a trap.

122
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,480
It's Anthony Davis in the block, man.

123
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,440
You can feel him coming.

124
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,320
You just know, you're not gonna go for the layup

125
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,840
cause he's gonna swat it away from you.

126
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,160
I decided to hang back and just see what you had.

127
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,080
And then I blew it.

128
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,360
Yeah.

129
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,000
So that is Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

130
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,440
And the reason that I wanted to check in on this

131
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,120
is because of course the Trump impeachment is going on.

132
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,960
Sure.

133
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,480
We'll discuss some feelings about that.

134
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,600
Cause both of us have watched a bit of that.

135
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,440
Yeah.

136
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,280
Weirdly.

137
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,120
Way too much for no reason.

138
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah, I blame you cause I wasn't going to.

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,200
And then you texted me about it and I was like,

140
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,360
well, I'll watch a little bit of this.

141
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,800
And I'm like, oh my God.

142
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,640
It's surprisingly engrossing.

143
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,800
And at the same time, I'm like, this is stupid.

144
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
What am I doing?

145
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
What am I doing?

146
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,960
Very conflicted about watching it

147
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,600
and spending as much time as I have.

148
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,840
But I mean, it feels important.

150
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,720
It should be.

151
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,400
It feels like it's way more important

152
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,680
than people are taking it.

153
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
Yeah.

154
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,920
I think it has a vibe of everyone's like,

155
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,160
this is our second one.

156
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
We've been here before.

157
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
We all know he should have been done in the first one.

158
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
So let's get this over with

159
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
cause these people are fucking nuts.

160
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
We'll talk about some of the specifics and stuff

161
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
once we get into the episode.

162
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
But yeah, it's weird.

163
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Yeah.

164
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,160
So before we get to business on the episode itself,

165
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
let's take a moment, Jordan, to say thank you

166
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,960
to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

167
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,800
Oh, that's a great idea.

168
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,480
So first, Joe asks, thank you so much.

169
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,880
You're now a Policy Wonk.

170
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm a Policy Wonk.

171
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,880
Thanks, Joe.

172
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Thank you.

173
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,760
Next, Connor VG.

174
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,600
Thank you so much.

175
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
You're now a Policy Wonk.

176
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm a Policy Wonk.

177
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,440
Thank you, Connor.

178
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Thank you.

179
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Next, Caroline H.

180
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,200
Thank you so much.

181
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
You're nowa Policy Wonk.

182
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm a Policy Wonk.

183
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,040
Thank you Caroline.

184
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880

Thank you so much. Do you organize those cuz I feel like our last episode was

202
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,320
99% fake joke names and this one just all seemed like normal people I

203
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,220
Prepared a little bit today. Whereas sometimes I will end up it

204
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,000
It changes it varies. I got it depends on how much time I have. Yeah, you're a busy man

205
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,160
Yeah before the episode I need to be better at organizing stuff, but I'm just not yeah now

206
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,040
I read an article recently about how podcasters don't really need to do much work and the money is really good in the job

207
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,740
So yeah, I saw I saw yeah. Yeah, I assume that that's what you're up to

208
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,120
Yep

209
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,440
So Jordan also another thing we got to do is gonna take a little moment here to say it give a very special

210
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Delilah message Oh Delilah

211
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,360
We got an email beating up Sampson lady

212
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,760
We got an email from Mike. Uh-huh, and he wanted us to play. I'm holding out for a hero

213
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:08,760
To play a little bit of James Ingram

214
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Yep, that sounds right

215
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Real tough time coming up with

216
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,400
But he reached out and he wanted us to give a little bit of a happy birthday message out to his partner Lauren

217
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,960
Whose birthday is actually yesterday when this is coming out. All right, you know, some people have a birthday week

218
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,520
Yeah, and no, I hope not. Yeah, some people do that. That's not fair. You've not worked in an office in a long time

219
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,920
I don't remember

220
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,680
I don't remember that there were birthday. We don't remember people who would just be like this is my birthday week

221
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,320
It's like yeah, but that's Thursday. Oh

222
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,080
But it would be Tuesday and they'd be like

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,720
I choose to believe that we are not dealing with people who manufacture a personality based on their birthday. I

224
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,560
I

225
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,960
Think these people are great dad. Um, so Lauren, happy birthday. Happy birthday, Lauren

226
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,120
And you know what? You can have three days not a week

227
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,280
And I'm sorry Mike that I couldn't improvise a better song

228
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,600
James Ingram's name holding out for a hero. Yeah, I'm gonna go with 2d 2f

229
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,320
Mmm, nevermind. The only James Ingram song I can come up with right now off the top of my head is yamo be there

230
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,760
featuring Michael McDonald

231
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Just listening to the yacht rock podcast

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,520
Michael McDonald was usually halfway good. Yeah, so Jordan

233
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,080
Impeachment. Yes. What about it? It is upon us anything going on. Yeah

234
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,920
You know

235
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
watching watching this stuff

236
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:52,840
The one of my big takeaways is that Castro looks solid with a beaster. Oh, no walking Castro

237
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah, yeah, I got you. He does look better with a beard. Yeah, nice-looking beard. Huh? It's about all I got doesn't it?

238
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,120
It does his twin have a beard. I don't know

239
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, we should call him because that's a man who needs a beard. This is a

240
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,520
Would be to have a twin so you could try out facial hair

241
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,960
Be awesome twice as much done in terms of trying out styles. No, I think you are talking about a clone did you?

242
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Yeah, I just think his beard look good

243
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:32,400
And then beyond that I don't know. I feel like the image that's gonna resonate with me. Is that video of

244
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:40,640
The officer running down the hallway running past Mitt Romney Mitt Romney turning around and running the other way

245
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,480
paired with all the video of

246
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:52,100
Protesters talking about hanging Mike Pence and yeah, it's just the the imagining what could have happened had that guy

247
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,720
Goodman not said good, you know run the other way the other way, you know, just the idea that someone

248
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,960
Who's a very?

249
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,880
High level politician someone who's very notable in politics who ran for president who's in the Senate

250
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,960
They probably would have killed him. Yeah. Yeah

251
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,320
Yeah, there's there was a little there was a little bit of me that was watching that part thinking like and then the next thing

252
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,640
You should say is if it weren't for him Mitt Romney would be dead guys

253
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:33,360
Hey 45 senators who are gonna vote to uncovick say you want Mitt Romney to die or shut the fuck up

254
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,640
Well, yeah, that's one way to put it and I think that would be fair

255
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,360
Yeah, I think that's pretty much the only way to go. Yeah, I I it's it's it's a really surreal thing to be seeing

256
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,400
this conversation that's happening and the people you're trying to persuade are like

257
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,960
Do you know they're they're chanting to kill the vice president who they elected? Yeah

258
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
You understand that they Intel

259
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,080
Moments earlier they were fine with the idea of supporting my pants if he subverted the Constitution you understand

260
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Your name is very

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,220
Replaceable with that. Yeah in terms of who they are looking to kill see the problem

262
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,880
There is I think they thoroughly understand that which is why they will be voting to acquit. Yeah

263
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,180
I don't I don't know the dynamics but it's it was it's pretty it's pretty fucked up to

264
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,260
To to see the information presented that way. Yeah, cuz it's it's coherent. It makes sense and it it's it's almost

265
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
hilariously over-the-top

266
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:41,120
comprehensive where like I was watching yesterday and then today and they were talking about how this is almost guaranteed this is

267
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Guaranteed to be the shortest impeachment trial in history and after watching those two days

268
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,320
I was like that does make sense. Yeah in a normal real-world situation because you'd watch that and go

269
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,760
Boy, the defense better come up with something real good. Yeah, it's open

270
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,640
You watch the defense's opening argument. You're like, they're fucked. They're fucked. They got no chance. They're opening statement might as well a bit come on

271
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Come on he's not even president anymore. Get out of here

272
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,680
Yeah, and I was that caster is yeah

273
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,440
Yeah, it's yeah his statement being like oh they made some good points. Yeah, that's not good. Yeah. Yeah

274
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,960
Yeah, I don't know. We're all august members of this body. I just want to say you guys are all great

275
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,100
I love you now, obviously the prosecution makes some good points my clients guilty

276
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,560
But I want you all to know that you're spectacular people. I thought we were gonna bicker about jurisdiction

277
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,520
I am not prepared for no. No, oh boy. It really does look like he's committed those crimes

278
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,200
Yeah, and all the all these sort of defenses that you see thrown around are like well

279
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,440
The Trump's rally couldn't have incited this because the people were planning for weeks and it's like well, tada here. Yeah

280
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,960
Exactly. Here's the all the stuff that Trump was saying for weeks

281
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,980
Yeah, it's yeah, and I have no faith in any conclusion

282
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,440
Like I don't have any faith that there's gonna be a conviction and I also don't have any faith that

283
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,160
You know, there's not going to be also like I just I see this and I'm there. Yeah

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah

285
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,200
so I wanted to see Alex's response to a lot of this because I figure if anybody is gonna be

286
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,720
Mad about this it'd be Alex

287
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,240
Yeah

288
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,640
He for the sense the impeachment the second impeachment has come around has been really really

289
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,320
Insistent that Trump needs to get up there and put the whole system on trial

290
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,960
Yes, that would be great Trump needs to get in there and insist that he won the election. It was stolen from him

291
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
He still can

292
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,240
Alex is not happy that that is not happened

293
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,080
I imagine so and so we'll get get into a little bit of his response

294
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,400
But first here is an out-of-context drop from today's show because I actually worship these people. I hate them

295
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,600
I can't stand them, but I actually know everything about AOC everything about Joe Biden Kim Jong-un GG ping

296
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,680
I shouldn't be looking at GG ping ever

297
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,840
I mean what the hell's going on, but I have to because he's always up my ass. Yeah, man, that's tough

298
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,780
Yeah, we really shouldn't be looking at Alex Jones. He's there

299
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,480
But I can't I can't look away but we have to because he's up America's ass can't can't not look. Mm-hmm. So

300
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Alex discusses

301
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,720
The UN building a little bit at the beginning of this show here on February 10th

302
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,640
He's talking about how you know, he he made that documentary endgame and it is the UN building on the front of it

303
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
uh-huh, and

304
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,720
He wasn't supposed to be on air when this stuff was going on now

305
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,040
Oh, you know all the stuff that's supposed to have been taken off the air way in advance, right?

306
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
Yeah, and you could either believe that or you could believe that all that stuff

307
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,640
He was saying about they have plans to take me off the air when their plans come to fruition was just nonsense

308
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,120
Yeah, that's possible. We are not supposed to be on air right now

309
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,320
You're supposed to be shut down long before they launch this operation

310
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
If you saw my film in game

311
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,680
Also a green mist on the cover

312
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,080
You will notice that I specifically say they're gonna release

313
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,120
bioweapons stimulants to practice a lockdown and

314
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Then that they would launch

315
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,400
Stronger attacks each successive wave while posing as the saviors while will be the United Nations that launches the attack

316
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,400
You guys just type into a search engine in game blueprint for global enslavement and click images

317
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Or maybe go out on the bookshelf and bring a DVD and I want to show you the cover. It's the UN building

318
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,640
In New York City paid for by the Rockefellers and the land it sits on paid for by the Rockefellers

319
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,480
Strangely enough, I won't get into that story

320
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:06,840
My mom said own that land sold it to then come start the Texas Revolution. That was the heirs family, but that is a side issue

321
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,840
That's right back in the 1820s, that's not a family where Yankees in New York folks

322
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,320
anyways

323
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,480
You can't really count me as a Texan and my family's only been here on both sides since the 1820s

324
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,760
Just once you're from New York. Yes, you're always from New York, but I am digressing. Sorry. Yeah

325
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,360
Much so we have a nine-hour series about endgame and you can go and decide for yourself if

326
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,760
That documentary is actually about what Alex thinks it is. I believe he's literally asking us to judge a book by its cover. Yes

327
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,960
Yeah, a DVD by yeah, let me show you this cover of the DVD

328
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,760
I love the idea that Alex is, you know, he's making this physical land where the UN building sits into a personal issue for him

329
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Yep, like but there's a couple problems

330
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,040
so

331
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,600
The relative that Alex is talking about here is a guy named David Ayers who?

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,920
He he and his family were the ones who Colonel Travis

333
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,460
Left his son with and that Alex claims to be related. Sure. Sure. Sure. This dude came to Texas in 1832

334
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,540
Also Colonel Travis didn't like adopt his son to them

335
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,980
Like Alex likes to pretend his son just stayed with the Ayers family to attend school

336
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:25,120
While his dad drunkenly pretended to be a soldier at the Alamo. The son only stayed with the family for two years. It's not like

337
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,180
You know long enough to build a bond. I will I'm not gonna get in a problem. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

338
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,540
Ayers on that one. I'm not gonna split Ayers exactly

339
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,220
I think that that's fine. But the way Alex presents it is like they gave him his son. Yeah. Yeah

340
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:47,100
Yeah, he raised Colonel Travis's son. He was founded a manger. Yeah. Yeah. Also David Ayers himself actually wasn't from New York

341
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,180
He was from Morristown, New Jersey where he was born in 1793

342
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:57,180
According to the Texas State Historical Association David quote came to Texas to buy property and build a home

343
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,380
Prior to that he quote was a merchant in Ithaca, New York

344
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,780
Ithaca is about 230 miles from New York City

345
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,240
So I have some doubts about this whole story of him owning the land that the UN building is on

346
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,940
Sounds like a load of bullshit that Alex tells himself in order to keep this fight with his imaginary enemies personal. Yeah

347
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
That's my land

348
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,260
Man here's the thing about that. Yeah. All right, it's if that's what you want to do

349
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,500
Okay, I have a claim to that land back from the 1820s

350
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,740
Then you also have to acknowledge that maybe somebody else had a claim to that land in the 1500s. Nope

351
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,400
Nope, why not? Alex's property rights began in the 1820s. I did not know that

352
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,640
I should have was that in the Constitution. All right, so there's this

353
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,580
Thing in life where stuff happens gradually

354
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,160
Alex tries to discuss how taking COVID seriously

355
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,080
will lead to negative consequences much like

356
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,020
Taking the Klan seriously leads us to kicking Trump off Twitter

357
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
This is one of these

358
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,380
I'm gonna need to hear this one. It's an SAT all the way through

359
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,760
So the first domino was the KKK and the white supremacist most of them run by the southern property law center in the ADL

360
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,780
And the FBI that's come out mainstream the ADL

361
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,760
Mmm, and then the next like oh, I'm over the Nazis. So let's take their speech away

362
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,880
Let's take their bank accounts away. And then next it's oh, it's Alex Jones. Let's take everything

363
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,320
He's got and then two years later. It's the President of the United States

364
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,000
No, I think these are all lumped in with the Nazis for these masks for 15 days, I'll just stay in your house for 15 days

365
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,120
Sounds reasonable. It's the little domino then it's all six months. It's all two years. Well, just take this COVID test

366
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,280
Well, just have a contact tracer in your house. Well, it's ten years in jail if you're seen outside your house period I

367
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Got the video they announced it yesterday

368
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
In Parliament

369
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,960
In Parliament ten years in prison if you're seen outside your house when they tell you to quarantine

370
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,960
So the problem with the argument that he's making is that like if there is behavioral

371
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,780
Similarities between the Klan Alex Jones and the president

372
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,560
I don't understand in that they're all breaking the terms of service of a certain platform

373
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm getting kicked off is it's not like some kind of a dominoes falling situation. It's more of just a

374
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,140
Consistency of the rules only Nazis would expect justice to be applied fairly. Yeah, that doesn't make much sense

375
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,040
And then in terms of the the evolving situation with COVID, it's like we didn't do any of those things

376
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,160
No, no all of those things. It's like he had 15 days 30 days or like we didn't do those things

377
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,780
Or at least people some people didn't to large enough extent that those were not

378
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,880
effective or at least as effective as they could be yeah, and then secondarily the government didn't provide

379
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,520
material support to people to enable them to do these safety measures in a way that would have been meaningful and so

380
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,180
We end up with we end up with a situation that gets worse and worse and yeah the mitigation

381
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:20,620
Take things that you would prescribe for that become larger. So it's not the dominoes falling

382
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,220
It's just us not taking care of a problem

383
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:29,460
Not just that but mitigation efforts that were already planned for and in place that Jared Kushner according to witnesses denied

384
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:35,040
Specifically because it would only hurt Democrats more making it more of a genocide situation

385
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,340
Just saying just tossing that out there. So but if you're outside your house, you're gonna go to prison for 10 years

386
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,180
Oh, okay in the UK. This is nonsense

387
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,460
Yeah

388
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,820
the actual story is about how the UK government has rolled out new rules where if you're returning to the country after visiting a

389
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,660
Country that's on the red list of high-risk countries

390
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,080
You're required to quarantine at a government-designated hotel for 10 days, which costs approximately

391
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,500
1750 pounds

392
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,260
the discussion of a 10-year sentence is for people who knowingly lie about where they're returning to the UK from in order to skip

393
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,780
And skirt public health measures and the required quarantining everyone can still go outside their houses

394
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,620
Alex is just trying to scare people. Yeah, it's all a bunch of bullshit

395
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,060
Yep, and I am positive that you know, that is a high figure for a lot of people

396
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,580
Mm-hmm

397
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,980
but also I

398
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Would assume that people who are coming from these countries or people who are coming in from vacations to those countries

399
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,620
Yeah, possibly people who would be able to afford the quarantining and I would also assume that if not the there's probably

400
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,140
At least some sort of a program in place to help people who don't have the means. Yeah for the sake of public safety

401
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,880
Yeah, it's not I don't know. Anyway, it's all a load of bullshit. Yeah, Alex is lying. Oh, yeah, so

402
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,700
We know that Alex is a violent chap

403
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:03,220
But you from all of his words and deeds. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, those would be how we identify. Yeah. Yeah his regular tone

404
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,680
Yeah his insistence on encouraging people to be violent his behaviors in all of the stories

405
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,180
He tells about accosting people as though he's the hero. Yes. Yeah, but it turns out he's not

406
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,740
We were right now

407
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,140
By we I mean Alex and his audience. Yes, we are in a riptide

408
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,620
And if you fight when you're in a riptide, you're gonna drown. All right, so you can't fight

409
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,180
I don't know anything about riptides. You don't know. Oh see much like mochi

410
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
Riptides were a part of my grown-up

411
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,420
Well naturally, yes

412
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,620
Yeah, there is there is a certain amount of truth to it

413
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,660
Like if you get taken in an undertow or something

414
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,440
You will generally end up like just getting like fighting you gotta slide it

415
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,600
And you'll come out not a great strategy, right? Right?

416
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,560
Cuz you're just gonna stay under and drown it can be it can be very bad. Gotcha. It's really scary

417
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,000
I've been through similar things. I believe times and in my younger years, but

418
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,580
This metaphor doesn't quite work the way Alex wants it to

419
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,200
Because what he's sort of saying is like we're gonna take some bumps in this

420
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,960
Riptide and then we'll be spit out from the riptide and be in safety

421
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,040
It'll be scary but you know, you can't fight because if you fight that's when you're gonna drown

422
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,000
But then at the end he also says that people are coming to kill your family

423
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,800
I like in this to getting caught in a riptide and I'm one time foolishly when I was a teenager. They had red flags out

424
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,560
I'm like, I'm a great swimmer. I'm in hell before I quit doing almost 13

425
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,920
I was a champion swimmer when all the blue ribbons in Dallas and I thought I'd get out there

426
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm 18 years old

427
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,080
I got grabbed in one of those things and I knew what to do and it sucked me under I said just hold your breath

428
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,720
And relax don't fight it. It spit me out in 50 yards and I was okay, but it scared the living hell out of me

429
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,520
Well, let me just tell you we're already being pulled under so it's not time to even get air

430
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,800
You're just hold it relax baby because you panic you're gonna die

431
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,000
So this is not negative. This is biblical. It's all gonna happen and

432
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,040
It's gonna get so bad within a few years. You're just gonna be totally blown away

433
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,080
They're gonna tighten tighten tighten release a little and then clamp down even harder and then release a little and clamp down even harder

434
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,560
Mass suicides death there'll be COVID deaths from the vaccines everywhere

435
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:23,000
It's already happening and they'll just normalize it and then all these college students that don't have jobs are gonna have government paychecks their own uniforms

436
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They're already coming to your house

437
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,100
The communists are coming armed for you and your family and they're gonna kill you so get ready so we shouldn't do anything

438
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,320
We're in a riptide that we should just just hold your breath

439
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,000
Okay, relax, okay, or should I be worried about the armed commies coming to kill my family?

440
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,040
Well, those would seem important to you, but they're not coming to kill Alex's family

441
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,140
So we need to just sit tight and we'll get through this much like how a t-rex can't see you in the movies

442
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,520
When you sit still but the commies come to your door if you hold your breath and relax, they can't see you

443
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,500
I just kick why do you also have to have blue ribbons and swimming?

444
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,920
What is it always gonna be every time there's a new he's like a Stevie P's in high school

445
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,840
He's like he I was there I did all of the stuff is the best at everything everything

446
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,240
And not all of it can be true, but that's close enough to like I could believe that sure

447
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,600
I don't have any problem with that

448
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,080
I just have a problem with this is yet another in the long list of things where he tosses off

449
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,320
You know, I won all the I won all the awards when I was there. Anyways, I won the title for most specialist boy

450
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,560
Yeah, exactly. It's like Jesus. Come on, buddy. Yeah, come on

451
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,240
Yeah, so that that's an incoherent message that he's sending his audience there because at the end of it I

452
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:47,900
Feel like he'd negated a lot of the ideas that you'd want to be sending when you tell people you're in a riptide relax

453
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
We're gonna get out the other side of this

454
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,760
Yeah, I feel like he's telling you to fight that riptide no, no, no see cuz he said relax first

455
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,680
Yeah, it's it's like I said, it's incoherent. I don't know these clauses are dependent on each other

456
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,000
So first get the riptide and then die. So what do you know about Pablo Escobar?

457
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,240
Not

458
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,680
Did you not watch Narcos? I did not watch Narcos. They knew to die. Yeah, I think he was man had elephants

459
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
I know that he was in the movie blow

460
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:26,400
He was featured as a character in the movie blow all-time great mustache, I believe. Yeah all-time great. Sure. Yeah Pee-wee Herman was also there

461
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Yes, of course. Yeah

462
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
all-time great mustache by the way, I

463
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,640
Learned from listening to this and not only did he have elephants he also had hippos. Ooh, and

464
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Dangerous. Yes, Alex goes on a very long

465
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,240
a ramble about the dangers of hippos. He was voted best hippo in high school. Best hippo wrangler. Exactly

466
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,440
I used to do I was like a matador but for hippos

467
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,840
So Pablo Escobar had these hippos and they got you know

468
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,400
Now they've bred and now hippos are somewhere where they shouldn't be sure sure

469
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,960
And so now people want to cull them. Mm-hmm

470
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,360
This leads Alex to saying that there may be some good arguments for human culling cool

471
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,960
And I would like to remind you he is a noted eugenics disliker this guy

472
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,040
Theoretically Pablo Escobar down in South America got what was it for hippos?

473
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Something like 40 years ago

474
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
back in the 80s

475
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,000
Back when I was a little kid and now reportedly there's just thousands of these hippos running around and by the way

476
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,400
We didn't know the hippos the most deadly animal in the world. It'll kill an elephant and killed a lion

477
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,240
It'll kill a grizzly bear. There's nothing more powerful than on land than a hippopotamus

478
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,400
Everything runs in fear of the 20-foot crocodiles run in fear

479
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:52,040
You watch videos of a hippo just grabbing a 20-foot crocodile just throwing it around like it's a it's a it's a toothpick

480
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,920
Okay, there's the most know that so now all over where Pablo lived. There's this giant hippopotamus is everywhere

481
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:06,400
And so now they want to call them now

482
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,520
They want to call the hippopotamuses

483
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,760
And I'm like, yeah, they don't come from there yeah, they're killing everything okay kill them but see I'm a human being

484
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
I don't need to be called

485
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,720
But see the globalist they say Jones you notice you're telling people this and they don't care that's because they're not conscious

486
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,120
They're just eating food and their genetics are bad and they're breeding and we need to get rid of them and we're not racist

487
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,920
We're gonna kill the dumb black people the dumb white people the dumb Hispanics the dumb Asians

488
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,720
And that itself's playing God is evil

489
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,520
And I don't support that that's the problem. There's an argument there

490
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,920
But then you say the globalists they're into Satanism. They're into playing God

491
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,840
Their real documents are they want to overwrite everything and not save the earth and believe they're gonna just be able to make all the planets

492
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
They want once they become AI

493
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,640
artificially intelligent singularity godlike

494
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
And they're just in a mad race

495
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,280
Sacrificing the earth as a testing ground to this ascension

496
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,960
So that's a lot of nonsense

497
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,320
But yeah, I just find it really interesting whenever Alex has these like hypothetical conversations with globalists

498
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,400
And he's like, oh, there's an argument to be made

499
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,620
Off the dumb. Listen. Listen, I'm not saying it's a bad idea in

500
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:28,660
That's very weird. In practice it can go wrong. Yeah. Yeah, I would say that if your branding is the such

501
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:35,780
That Alex puts forth should never say that there's a there's an argument to be made. It's not eugenics if it's dumb people

502
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
That's not a race

503
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,100
Sure, it's never been used in a way that's not racist

504
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,300
Sure

505
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,900
There's a track record of some people maybe using this for their own racist purposes. Oh, hey Alex

506
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,100
You know how you see some people as dumb, huh? I

507
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,140
Just think about that

508
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,460
Hmm is he thinking that it's playing God because God had already done the Noah thing

509
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,980
I don't know maybe so he's so he's almost a little mad at God. He was like, what are you doing?

510
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,380
You should have just got rid of the dumb ones, right? We could have had plenty of fun

511
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,460
Yeah, shouldn't let the dumb dumbs on the boat and then you put all those goddamn hippos on the boat. They're everywhere now

512
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,860
We're calling them classic mistake classic God

513
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,900
Um, so Alex is not afraid of anything probably he's a strong strong boy

514
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:32,540
Who's only slightly afraid of riptides afraid of shadow gate? Well, he's afraid of his former employees probably

515
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,780
So people ask how I'm doing. I am totally committed. I have no fear. I've gone away past everything

516
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,740
I'm not worried even about my family

517
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,700
I love my family

518
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,160
But I've just had turned over to God because the enemy's done horrible things to my family

519
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,860
Horrible things to me behind the scenes that you even know about and I've just said hey, it's okay

520
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,580
It's God's plan. I'm not mad at God. I appreciate it. I

521
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,980
Understand because my children don't have a future. Anyways, if we don't beat this you don't either none of us. It's okay

522
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,460
And you watch

523
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,860
That first lawyer that got up and groveled like a dog with his tail between his legs

524
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,620
That rolled over and pissed all over itself and just oh, you're so powerful Schumer. I love you, sir

525
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,420
Oh, you're so much better than us great job with your presentation on Trump

526
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:23,180
He was just shaking because there's not men in this country. I told you Trump was surrounded by a bunch of damn cowards

527
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:30,740
Not by invincible fat deep s you talked about the dimensions and chess quite a bit

528
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,740
Yeah, don't fucking pretend. Yeah

529
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,420
That transition was as jarring as it seemed it felt so yeah, it felt felt a little bit a little weird

530
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:45,900
Yeah, it took a turn. Yeah, Alex is now mad at these lawyers being soft, right? Right? Yeah

531
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:53,260
Yeah, I think everybody pretty universally agreed that Kester did a real shit job. Not great lawyers

532
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,060
so Alex kind of is a little bit like touch-and-go on the

533
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:04,180
On the impeachment trial yells about the lawyer being weak a little bit, but then doesn't doesn't spend too much time

534
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Talking about it. Yeah, I kind of halfway assumed that today we would be talking about a secret migrant caravan

535
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,420
And they we wouldn't even know the impeachment happened

536
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,580
No

537
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,780
It's sort of dancing around a little bit, you know

538
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:20,860
Like side issues to the impeachment like for instance the fact that Democrats all have Chinese spy hand

539
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,980
In their office that sounds right now. Not only that they all have Chinese spy

540
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,060
handlers

541
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:34,180
Nobody knows what the name of the Chinese spy agency is called. Okay

542
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,980
most of Democrats are Chinese spy

543
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,500
handlers of Chinese

544
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,380
Intelligence so secret the name of Chinese intelligence is not even known but I know its name

545
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
What is it?

546
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,780
And you all know its name what is it because everything hides in plain view

547
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Like what?

548
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,020
America is the red white and blue

549
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,620
China is the red dragon a

550
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,700
What?

551
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
What's the name of the snake?

552
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,340
the old serpent

553
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,020
Diablo

554
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
the devil

555
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,020
So let's talk about some positive news

556
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,420
We're just doing word association game, that's all we're doing who would have thought the

557
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,580
It's actually the the Ministry of State Security, but yeah

558
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:45,660
Oh Diablo he couldn't come up with old scratch there. I think he was probably pretty pissed in the moment

559
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,700
Snake come on bad scratch is way better. Dude. Anyway, Alex is thinking about the devil and so sure

560
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,820
This clip is actually just titled. This show is stupid

561
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,580
They want you by increment to get caught by this and to be too late

562
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:08,260
You've got the whole blueprint folks the blueprint for global enslavement the blueprint for global extermination

563
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,860
You have the enemy operation you have it in Revelation. You have it in Daniel. You have it in Ezekiel

564
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,900
You have it all around you you have it in your soul

565
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,980
all you've got to do is

566
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,860
Decide that you don't want to be part of it and make the metaphysical decision to cut yourself off from Satan

567
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,420
Then God will extricate you out of that you need God to do it

568
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:35,660
But God says you've got to let me in and I come knocking. I come knocking. Let me in let me in

569
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
But you've got to open the door

570
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,300
because God is it like Satan that rams down the door and lies to you from the time you're a child to steal your

571
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:52,740
Essence to steal your will to steal your ability to interface with God and your free will

572
00:35:52,740 --> 00:36:01,220
God doesn't touch that. Satan's all about encasing you from birth in a matrix so he can fool your soul

573
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,100
This is the only way he can win because he's not a god

574
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,580
He's a fraud. Wait, can he win? He's a liar

575
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,340
He's a devil

576
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:17,860
Not so impactful to yell that the devil is a devil. Yeah, not he's he's a he's a devil

577
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:23,820
Yeah, that should come with a more upwards inflection that passion seemed so fake to me

578
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,180
Yeah, it was just it just so boring and then cookie cutter

579
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,580
Anyway, one thing that's very exciting

580
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:36,100
Maybe another bright spot is that my cat has jumped into my lap and is insisting on being very affectionate right now

581
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Well a car horn just went off a few times

582
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,820
Little guest appearance there on the mic

583
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,820
There it is. Get off my lap

584
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,820
Get kick on

585
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:52,380
I guess she probably, you know Selene probably heard some devil talk. Yeah, I gotta get in on this. Gotta protect him

586
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,980
Yeah, so actually she was trying to delay the inevitable and that is that I need to tell you about a couple guests

587
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,740
That we have on this show. No

588
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,300
They just got kicked off Twitter. Okay. It's Jim and

589
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Jim's brother, Hoft. I can't remember his brother's name

590
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:15,500
Jim Hoft and Joe Hoft maybe? Something like that. Yeah, they're the brothers Hoft. The brothers Hoft

591
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,660
I like that. Yeah, the Gateway Pundit dudes. They got kicked off Twitter. And so they come on to complain

592
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,220
About that and I don't care. Yeah, we don't want to listen to an hour of whining

593
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,140
No, not really. But you know, Jim Hoft his main point seems to be that

594
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,700
You know, like this isn't a cult of personality about Trump, okay

595
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:43,040
You know, we're not gonna have another candidate like that for a while. Donald Trump was, you know, once in a lifetime

596
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:51,340
candidate so these Republicans better wake up and I think it's also imperative that a lot of these rhinos get replaced by

597
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
other pro-Trump

598
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,780
Populist candidates in the next primary

599
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,540
We have to get rid of some of this dead weight in the Republican Party

600
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,580
If you don't want to sound crazy, I would recommend you not say

601
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:10,340
Whether or not a candidate in a future election is pro the president who is no longer in office

602
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:17,300
Yeah, I would say that that is a real designation of a crazy person. It's not a cult of personality Dan

603
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,500
I just want everyone to agree that a single person is the

604
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,100
Greatest human being that ever lived and we should do whatever he says

605
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:31,520
Yeah, if you were running a Democratic candidate and they were like, this is the pro-obama candidate

606
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,300
Mm-hmm. I would look at that. It also as weird. Yeah, very weird. Yeah, very comfortable strange

607
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,660
So Alex's is you know, he's talking about how like, you know, the they've they've

608
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,560
Stolen the election, you know, they steal the election sure and then we know that they've stolen the election

609
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,500
So that makes us not vote and that makes it easier for them to steal and then it goes out to break with something really

610
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,140
Upsetting in blue states and blue cities people get to knowing that once they take over

611
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,100
It's permanent. Then we stop voting then it makes it easier for them to cover up the fraud. Say hi to your brother

612
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,980
Let's talk. Look, let's talk about how we still get people to vote even though we know it's a fraud

613
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,980
Should we keep voting when we come back or what is our recourse?

614
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,580
Is it the cartridge box? I hope not. You cannot hide a grand assault

615
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,540
We'll get to that in a second. Okay. Um, yeah, is it the cartridge box? Yeah, I hope not. Mm-hmm

616
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,620
Gross, so you heard that at the end you can't hide and the assault. Yeah

617
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:35,300
Alex's commercial here is a little weird. I'm now back to listen. Well, it started off great

618
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,240
I'm listening to this episode on the GCN feeds

619
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,920
Mm-hmm. So this is a commercial that would have been played out on the radio, right? And I will tell you it is a very

620
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,880
Different tone. Oh, then the commercials and reads that we've heard Alex give on our recent episodes

621
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,180
It's a little bit. It's a little bit more fucked up. It also sounds like he's jacking it. Yeah. Okay. All right, please

622
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,240
Listener discretion advised he sounds we may be tubening by proxy. So creepy

623
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,620
You cannot hide a grand assault

624
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,340
America is about to have its energy cut off its borders destroyed

625
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,640
It's dollar brought down to nothing all of you that have served Satan

626
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
Believe that you are the right team

627
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,820
You're about to find out how pathetic you are

628
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,980
So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God

629
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,820
Stop living in fear

630
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,260
The enemy is about to expose itself. The enemy can't help itself

631
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,940
The enemy comes to kill steal and destroy

632
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,260
We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it

633
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,760
We should but once it comes through once it hits us

634
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,440
Once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us. Jesus. We just have to point out we tried to stop us

635
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,200
This is on the radio pair yourselves America. You're going under judgment. Just like all the children that were aborted. This is the truth

636
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
This is the info war

637
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:15,480
Wow quite a bumper. Hey Alex, uh, it sounds like your voice is a little bit scratchily or there than usual

638
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,280
You realize we're cutting promos today. Yeah, I forgot and I smoked an entire pack of cigarettes about 20 minutes ago

639
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm three quarters drunk

640
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,120
I'm jacking off. I'm hiding from my wife. I am recording this under a blanket

641
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
No, I'm not going to bed yet

642
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,280
That's supposed to be like a billion-dollar operation. That sounded like shit. Yeah, that was garbage

643
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,880
I think I think one of the things that's going on is I think he was probably fucked up

644
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,080
But yeah, he's also like trying to really do that movie. Yeah

645
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:56,600
Yeah, he's trying to do that really dramatic voice. Yeah to because I think that this is tailored more towards a

646
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,240
Possibly random person. Yeah, that could be listening on the radio right to really pique their interest to be like, what is this?

647
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,880
This is exciting, but he missed the mark though. Oh sounds creepy

648
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,860
I heard that and I thought ooh, I need to know more but you compare that to the meandering random bullshit

649
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:22,160
That's on the like actual infowars feed because he knows that that's targeting his audience. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's pretty clear

650
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,880
I just think that the it's really funny that this is what he thinks goes to the like

651
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:34,400
It's amazing that he can fail in multiple ways. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's remarkable. It is it is, you know

652
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,380
I like to imagine that

653
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,920
You know, I'm not I if I failed in a different arena, I would be aware of it

654
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,800
I wouldn't just be like yeah, I killed it. I can do literally anything

655
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,560
It Wow, it's done who gives a shit. Yeah, right

656
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,640
So this is a good strategy for Alex to try and get new listeners in

657
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,040
Just do these creepy jack-off commercials about the end of America Alex. This sounds really creepy

658
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,880
I only do one day. Yeah, you're not paying me for two

659
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,400
So that's a good strategy

660
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,360
Another good strategy might be a Paul Paul Joseph Watson my oldest friend

661
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,520
Yeah, why don't you promote my shit? Maybe I'm not mad about it

662
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,640
Please remember everything the enemy does is about shutting us down. That's why we built Bandai video

663
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,800
So we updated info Wars calm news Wars calm Paul's got his summit dot news

664
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,720
But she promote us more on there, but whatever still love Paul not mad about it

665
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,440
I was thinking about it. Like yeah, what isn't it for Paul to promote it for Wars zero reason

666
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,640
It's really in his best interest to play down as far away from info Wars as possible

667
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,660
There's nothing else that he can get out of it other than like not making Alex mad

668
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:54,140
Yeah, that's the only thing that he has to worry about. He's gotten as much publicity as could come out of info Wars

669
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,140
Well, that's why the arguably bigger

670
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,300
That's why the band on the Titanic kept playing is because they didn't want the captain to be angry

671
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:06,420
So they were like, well, I guess this is where we die. I don't want to piss that guy off. Yeah, it

672
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,140
Only hurts Paul to remind people that he worked at info Wars for 20 years

673
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,780
Yeah, if I were him, I would do the exact same thing. Goodbye

674
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,180
So Alex is mad about Trump's lawyer being polite

675
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:26,900
For the most part, I mean incompetent too, but Alex seems more mad that he's polite. Yeah about his presentation

676
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,900
Yeah, you know they're in the chambers bordering on obsequious. Sure

677
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,380
Yeah, but there's there's a certain there's a certain decorum that comes along. Sure. Sure congressional speech

678
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,540
There's the pageantry of being in the Senate halls

679
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:47,560
That was literally just stormed you refer to people as the the gentleman or the lady from New Hampshire, whatever the fuck

680
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,980
Alex is mad about that. Mm-hmm. I just wanna play a few clothes from yesterday

681
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,500
We got some of the new stuff today coming up as well just to show you with enemies like this

682
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:05,620
Well, imagine what your real enemies are like Oh what nailed it that's the old saying with friends like this who needs enemies

683
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,660
So when you look at just this this this foppish

684
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,500
Creaming

685
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,900
just classic BS artists a lawyer in there in gray shading himself and

686
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,760
and groveling to Chuckie Schumer when all Schumer takes out his weakness and

687
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,920
Congratulating him and and just all of this and then saying this will turn around and bite you later if you do it

688
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:35,100
Yeah, they're tyrants. They don't care about chivalry. He's just mad. There's not a lot of analysis at all

689
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,580
Yeah, and I think the big thing that he's mad about

690
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,060
in terms of the conversation that happens throughout the impeachment stuff is that

691
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,300
like the defense is not

692
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:53,000
Arguing that Trump won the election. No, they're taking as granted that Biden won

693
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,220
yeah, and Alex is pretty mad about that because

694
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:04,500
That's the only thing you could really get people like distracted by yeah that stupid argument

695
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,700
Yeah that you can't but the reason they're not doing that is because that doesn't belong in court that belongs on

696
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,020
Infowars and right-wing media out

697
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:18,380
But yeah, he's he's a little bit upset that that world isn't being like taken over by his right his shit, right?

698
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,380
I mean it is maybe

699
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,460
Maybe it's their best defense

700
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,540
Honestly after after looking at the the opening arguments

701
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:32,820
Maybe their best defense would be like we're putting this whole thing on trial actually Trump is president

702
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,260
That's why it's fine

703
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:40,580
That everybody did this and you're all the ones who should be impeached if you want to gum up the works and possibly create

704
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:47,900
New problems for yourself. Yeah, I I think Caster's already gone far enough. He might as well jump off the the edge

705
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,540
Yeah, I I mean look if you want it to be interesting. Yeah, probably that's the way to go

706
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,460
But it would be a disgrace. Yep. It wouldn't work probably not

707
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,860
Yeah, I think that Alex has gotten a little bit used to the last, you know

708
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:09,380
Four years five years of like politics descending to his level right and this is a concrete instance of it not

709
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,940
Yeah, and that probably would be pretty frustrating and then at the same time you have, you know

710
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,700
Biden's comments of you know

711
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:22,220
Like the Senate has an important role to to play and to do their job trying to stay above the fray and trying to keep

712
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,180
himself

713
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,500
Removed from the process sure and that's got to really piss off

714
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
Yeah, I would imagine so

715
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,060
So he does the only thing that he knows how to do and that is talk to a comedian. Oh

716
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:42,700
Boy, he has comedian. Let's see if you know who this guy is. Oh, no, I can't give you any clues though

717
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,460
Okay, if you ever heard of Dave Landau, uh, I mean I have heard of

718
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:53,420
I've heard the name before it's funny cuz on band.video the like the segment that he's on

719
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,400
I believe it refers to him as a top comedian. Ooh, that's not good. Usually means they're not

720
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,980
He apparently hosts

721
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:09,020
Or co-hosts with Anthony Kumiya, Anthony Kumiya's new show. Okay, or whatever show the fuck he's doing

722
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,300
Oh, man, I'm shocked that I didn't get a call to co-host on that one, too

723
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:18,100
I feel like I'm the I'm the guy for that. Are you comparing me to Anthony Kumiya?

724
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,460
Because you better not be

725
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,940
I'll take that is quite quite an insult

726
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:31,340
So yeah, Dave Dave Landau is on and I think he tries to make a few jokes and how's it go? Not great

727
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,300
Yeah, Alex is not a good scene partner. No as we know

728
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:40,460
I only have one clip here cuz I don't care about what Dave Landau has to say about cancel culture. Oh, yeah

729
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,580
No, no, no, no. I don't particularly care about his perspective on the

730
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,020
Impeachment because it's not interesting right and then anything that he has to say about cancel culture

731
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,220
I'm like you fucking co-host a show with Anthony Kumiya who gives a yeah, I gotta go

732
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,920
I have very few very little interest in what any white comedian has to say about cancel culture strike one

733
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:08,200
You host a show with Anthony Kumiya strike two. You're on info wars strike three. You said this on info wars

734
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,260
It's not even so much taking that big of a stand

735
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,940
It's just telling people not to be completely blind

736
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:20,180
And I think the only thing that most people are really saying is that this is gonna end in some kind of bloody civil war

737
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,940
And the way that it's starting to look I can see that I can see their point

738
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:29,440
But I just think if people just calm down and stop turning on mainstream media

739
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,960
Which I just can't imagine what it's like to sit in your house all day long

740
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:40,440
Stare at the television and have fear pumped into you. Yeah, totally unlike the show. You're on that would be terrifying

741
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,800
What kind of monster would force people to watch four straight hours of fear mongering? Yeah, I

742
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,680
feel like you really

743
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,600
Look like like a real ding-dong when you say something like that on info wars

744
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:03,360
Yeah, cuz that either means that you accepted a booking on a platform as maligned and notorious as in fours without having it

745
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,360
done any due diligence about

746
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,660
The place you're on or somehow you don't see what Alex does as rank fear monger. No, that's not rank

747
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,200
People up screaming about the fucking devil. It's it's really simple what he's doing

748
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,380
He's just asking people not to be blind and that's all he's doing. It's the mainstream media

749
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,660
That's pumping fear into your blood all the time by reporting news

750
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,840
Hmm, I would say that anybody who works for any kind of mainstream media outlet if they behaved in any kind of way

751
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,120
Close to like what Alex does they might be in jail. Yeah. Yeah

752
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,140
It at least would be sued over and over and over they'd be they'd be fired

753
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,040
Mm-hmm. It's just it's wildly irresponsible or they would be Brett Stevens. That's also a possibility possible

754
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:56,160
Yeah, that leads me to believe that maybe this Dave Landau guy is not incredibly sincere

755
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,200
I would maybe a little bit disingenuous with his his perspective. Mm-hmm

756
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:07,200
So that ends the 10th the 10th was the brothers hoffed. Yep weird comedian

757
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,240
Yep, surface level fairly certain that one of the big deals of stuff is happening right now on the 10th

758
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,800
Yeah, you mean the impeachment? Yeah, well, I feel like that's important

759
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,640
Yeah, but a lot of that's a lot of the hearings on the 10th were happening after Alex was on it. That's true

760
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,260
That's true. You're right the some of the stuff he had he didn't have any way of knowing

761
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,320
Got until the next day the 11th when he's on air

762
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,700
And he's still a little surface level. I'll be honest. He's not

763
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:43,960
He's not covering it nearly as much. I mean because from Alex's perspective that makes sense

764
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:49,460
The election was stolen according to Alex. Yeah, this is all bullshit. It's all imaginary

765
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,420
Yeah, so why engage with the substance of the thing if the thing?

766
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,780
That kind of seems to be where he's at explain to me how

767
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:05,380
Alex seems to have a more cogent position on what he imagines is imaginary and how much we should talk about it

768
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,380
Then the rest of us do

769
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,620
I

770
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:13,180
Won't okay. So he starts off on the 11th talking about Bill Gates

771
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,300
because of course this is the most important news of the

772
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:25,820
Our lifetimes it is official what Bill Gates called for on Bill Moyers and what he called for Ted Talks

773
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,040
And when he called for on CNN, we have three clips of it in the last few years

774
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,220
Calling for

775
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,140
The

776
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:43,060
Euthanasia of old people because we quote can't pay for the aging population in Europe the United States Australia, Canada, New Zealand

777
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,260
And he says so you kill a teacher

778
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:51,820
Then you can or excuse me you you you you kill an old person and you can hire ten teachers

779
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,460
And that's not how it really works

780
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:59,020
But they put that you kill ten teachers and you fish for a life job the moral thing to do

781
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,140
And and and so the reports are pouring in

782
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:07,700
Every day five died here four died here three died here ten died here seven died here

783
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,020
And it's only in the nursing homes

784
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,220
where the employees notice all of the death and

785
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,020
Say something

786
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,060
Most these places know to keep it quiet and say they died of something else

787
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:25,180
But in many of the cases I'm gonna read to you from the CDC's own website

788
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:31,020
Oh, they even have a record of this some of them die within 15 minutes

789
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,660
15 minutes

790
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,940
So Alex is claiming that someone died 15 minutes after getting a kovat 19 vaccine

791
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,660
And then he presents that as evidence that the two are causally connected sure that's the level of work

792
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:47,020
He does he just associates two things and insists that he is then proven that they're connected when he's done

793
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,740
No such thing Alex could legit show me a news story about someone dying as they're getting vaccinated

794
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,420
And it still doesn't prove the claim that the vaccines related to that person's death

795
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:03,380
There's an unfortunate reality here, and that is that Alex either doesn't understand that dynamic of reality

796
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:09,740
Or he understands all too. Well. How easy it is to trick people into thinking that correlation proves causation

797
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,780
Yeah, I think the latter is probably more likely yeah

798
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,080
But also Bill Gates wasn't advocating killing old people as he could hire teachers

799
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:22,260
It's easy to misconstrue his words that way, but the conversation he was having that Alex always takes out of content

800
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,660
Our context is about exorbitant medical costs, and what can be done about that right?

801
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,900
Which is a thing that literally most of the world is?

802
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:38,340
Dealing with right now as population explodes like it's not unique to anywhere. It's like oh shit

803
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,500
What are we gonna do those fucking baby boomers wrecked us?

804
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
it's

805
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,760
it's easy to look at that conversation that Bill Gates has had in these public forums as

806
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,500
Being like well mathematically if we just kill all the old people we can

807
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:02,160
Hire and that's not that's not the the conversation, but that would be a facetious argument that I would make in a

808
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,520
Debate where somebody's like oh well old people are trying about like then let's kill all of the old people

809
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,640
I bet you could sarcastically make that argument. Yeah against Alex and win. Yeah a debate

810
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah, totally he is he's got a lot of nothing actually that's a really good idea

811
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,520
So Alex is now more mad at Trump's lawyers. This is intentional. They're fucking setting them up

812
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,720
officially we now know

813
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:33,360
That the lawyers that Trump hired because the first groups were bad the second group was bad the third group was bad

814
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,280
Have all either sued him or Democrats that hate him and say that Trump's a criminal and they're actually sabotaging him

815
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,120
Publicly saying he deserves to be kicked out of office and that voters were smart and voted him out

816
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,880
So instead of putting on evidence of election fraud the lawyers are all slipping in by the way

817
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,360
The Americans are smart. They kick Trump out

818
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,880
Trump's getting sandbagged. Yep. Yep

819
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,480
When when that lawyer was saying that he was trying to get the shit thrown out

820
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,840
Yeah, and he said that you know, like hey, there's another president and it seems like the process has worked fine

821
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,280
Yeah, elections are how we solve problems like corrupt dictators

822
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,960
Historically you have an election. Let's not do this

823
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,760
If the goal is winning the case that is maybe a decent argument to try

824
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,400
Anyway if we didn't have any precedent for it if this was the first time if this was like

825
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,240
1810 and we were having one of these and people were having that argument. I'd be like, I don't know

826
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:41,320
Have we ever tried this before? Maybe give it a shot. So look, this is about the January 6th

827
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,640
This was about the storming of the Capitol. This impeachment trial is about that

828
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:52,280
It's easy to lose sight of that from time to time. Sure. Because of nefarious shitheads who, you know, make stuff up and whatever

829
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:57,880
but look that was not cool that happening because

830
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:06,680
Provocateurs did it to make Alex look bad because people who are in the same communities as Alex or appear to be are being violent

831
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,360
Right. Now at the same time violence is cool, too

832
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:16,800
Look, we are well past the point of being able to righteously use violence against these institutions and organizations

833
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,440
But having a few Democrats and a few infiltrator groups

834
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,160
Trigger out of hundreds of thousands of peaceful people in DC a few hundred to go in the Capitol so you can be called

835
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,560
Insurrectionist terrorist is not the place of the time for it. Okay

836
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:39,560
Coherent messaging. No, I think that one is actually really coherent. We should absolutely storm the Capitol

837
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,000
This was bad planning

838
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,440
They tricked us into not storming the Capitol on the 20th when we would have all been able to actually kill everybody

839
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,680
Maybe I think he's essentially saying that it wasn't the right time to fire the shot heard round the world

840
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:01,080
Yeah, yeah, I guess so. But the reason it's incoherent is because I don't think he wants to take responsibility for that

841
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,560
Cut and dry message. Yeah, that's why it's incoherent. Yeah, that is the what's behind

842
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:15,020
Well, yeah violence is obviously justified that this was this was a misstep. Yeah, that's why I blame it on agitators

843
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,480
They tricked us into shooting before we were ready to shoot

844
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:27,080
So in that case, I'm pretty sure he's saying that well, yeah, obviously we wanted to kill everybody and overthrow the country

845
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,160
Well, we just wanted to do it at the right time. So we would win. Yeah, of course

846
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
I mean Alex even gets into his blood loss. Sure

847
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,160
I was in a halfway decent mood today and but I was already aware of the euthanasia of the old

848
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,840
And how would I come on air and give it the gravitas it needs so we don't all just get conditioned to accepting this

849
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,120
Five years ago. I was reading the statistics of the numbers and just going through the stacks

850
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,600
and

851
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
I physically

852
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:57,720
Became nauseous. No, you didn't because my nervous system was telling me you

853
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,000
Need to go visit violence upon the people that are doing this

854
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,720
If you let them kill old people like this and kill babies already born and they admit they're doing it

855
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,280
You are an accomplice. My very cells are telling me

856
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,640
Defend these people. So for all of you out there that are mad at me because I'm saying let's not be violent

857
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,640
Let's not be offensive

858
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:26,120
I understand your guts and your blood and your soul and your mind is burning with the desire to kill

859
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,120
Pull up, pull up

860
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:36,440
I want to stop these people just as much as you do, but we've got to be wise as serpents and peaceful as doves

861
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,080
and walk

862
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:44,920
Gently but carry a big stick. I don't think you pulled it off. What was that?

863
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:53,640
I'm gonna end with two cliches because I realized that I just basically told everybody that it's fine to kill and that I want to

864
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,440
too

865
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,280
So you got to walk softly and carry a big stick Dan

866
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,240
I feel like Alex might not be lying about reading Infowars comments because that sounds like him

867
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,260
Responding to a lot of feedback of people who are like Alex you're soft. Let's just go kill him

868
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:15,040
Let's just go kill him. Yeah, I think that Alex that's Alex trying to like have an olive branch to the yeah the murderous audience

869
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:22,760
Yeah, and also do you know who else anthropomorphizes their murderous intentions? Who's that? Uh serial killers. Mm-hmm

870
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:28,960
Look, he wants to kill. Sure. And he understands that the audience wants to kill and they're connected on this

871
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,920
I feel like there's a problem there. But you got to be wise as a serpent

872
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:39,920
I feel like there's a problem there too. It doesn't get better.

873
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,380
I just want everybody to know the left and Apple and Facebook and Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg and

874
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,320
Jack Dorsey, you know what you're doing and you are just as guilty as Bill Gates

875
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,560
Especially Mark Zuckerberg who works directly under him

876
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,640
He's the next guy in line for to be science officer of North America

877
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,880
For the new world order and you guys are mass murdering killers

878
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,280
And I know who you are. Everybody knows who you are and you will pay for what you've done murderers. I

879
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,280
Don't care what you do to me. You are you you are guilty

880
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,040
Everybody else is scared to call your asses out

881
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,280
So I'll just tell everybody I

882
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,600
Was on the other day and I said it was a civil war starts don't go after the cops and military

883
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:31,640
That's a diversionary tactic to wipe them out for the Chinese to have a civil war don't have the civil war

884
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,640
It's why they've had the lockdowns black lives matter

885
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,760
Antifa try to provocateur us is to get a civil war where we all kill each other. We don't want a civil war

886
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,000
We want a removal of the globalist and their collaborators

887
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:50,880
Yikes, you just named a number of people what we want to do is remove these people that I have pointed out

888
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:57,960
For you guilty of murder and I have specifically said that violence and everything is okay because they're murderers

889
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,080
So and we're well past the point of being able to write

890
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,580
Way back now granted the storming of the Capitol was bad planning

891
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:10,940
But what would be good planning is how he's clearly implying what would be good planning

892
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,760
What are you guys doing storming the Capitol with only a few hundred people?

893
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,900
You can't win what you should be doing targeted

894
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,940
Assassinations, you know, it's stupid, you know, it's unfortunate to like Mark Zuckerberg is one of the people that's on Alex's list

895
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:30,500
Yeah, but Alex constantly calls him Jeff Zuckerberg. Yeah. Yeah, like there might be a Jeff Zuckerberg out there who he's targeted

896
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:36,860
He's because Alex can't remember dude's name. Oh, man. He wields too much power and is too dumb to handle it

897
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:44,260
Yeah, so this is really irresponsible and I think you could make a pretty good argument that you know using shifty language Alex is

898
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,740
Probably telling his audience that should maybe kill my enemies

899
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,820
I think one of the things about the evidence in the

900
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:59,540
impeachment trial that I've noticed was how many times that they did a really good job of avoiding allowing that kind of clause

901
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:07,720
To like excuse any behavior, you know, like so often they had they played Trump's words and you're you're literally like

902
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,180
Yeah, we all know he said peacefully

903
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:18,540
Mm-hmm. Yeah, we should we should all protest peacefully and then they're like, yeah, but we've got 300 examples of him saying otherwise

904
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:26,000
Yeah, so you can't pull that bullshit. This is a pattern behavior like Alex Jones is essentially on trial in the same way

905
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,740
Well, I mean in our show in some ways is a on

906
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,660
rigorous

907
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,660
Completely without legal backing. Yeah

908
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,380
And I would say he's guilty

909
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,900
It's just that there is not a specific crime yet, right?

910
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:52,060
It's just the behavior that would lead to that. Just thank God people have not carried out his his his clear

911
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,840
man, yeah

912
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:59,800
So yeah, he's mad about this trial because these these these lawyers are throwing the case, man

913
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,620
Here's another question are Trump's lawyers

914
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,520
Taking the impeachment trial on purpose. I don't know or are they just shitty folks. Everybody knows these lawyers

915
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,960
These are very competent lawyers

916
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:15,080
They are sabotaging Trump because they've been told to they wouldn't have had a trial unless it was rigged

917
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:20,900
That's why his lawyers are like Trump actually lost the election and you've done a great job and you proved he's bad

918
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
He's actually you prove he's guilty

919
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,060
Because it's a bunch of cowards

920
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:33,160
The globalists are making their move all these so-called men are a bunch of pinstripe wearing

921
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:40,320
knuckle-dragging dirty stupid crooks that have screwed this country over and sold it out to China and

922
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,880
You've got a consortium of dirtbag lawyers and a consortium of pedophile leftist

923
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:53,460
Bunch of nasty hunchback globalist that just absolutely gonna mount this country's head on a wall. I'll tell you why

924
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,980
I'll tell you why because they hate themselves and they're going down

925
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:04,880
Hollywood's going down all the leftist cities are going down and that's because they're run by the same slave master Satan and now they want

926
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,880
To just drag us down with them. Whoo

927
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:12,120
Well, how's he gonna explain it when Trump gets acquitted like

928
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:19,800
Like it really is gonna be difficult to explain for a lot of people. Yeah beyond saying these guys

929
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:24,520
We're just gonna quit no matter what why why if Trump gets acquitted then why?

930
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:30,580
I like how are you going to rationalize his lawyers are in on it. They're throwing it

931
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:35,700
They wouldn't have it a trial if it wasn't rigged. Oh, it's rigged to a quit

932
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,700
Yeah, the fuck are you talking about? This makes no sense

933
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:43,220
he's not rambling and you could tell the real dead giveaway that he's probably just

934
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:48,660
Fucking coked out of his mind and rambling about nothing is you get to the Satan at the end. Oh, of course

935
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:56,360
Then that always comes back to you know, why I'll tell you. Oh, yeah, that's that's a real four in the morning party

936
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,360
I want to leave kind of moment. Yep

937
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,480
Anyway, Alex gets to talk about these vaccines

938
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:07,980
Did you know that there's thousands dead already from the kovat 19 vaccine feel like I would have heard it if there were no

939
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,420
They're keeping it on the low. Oh, that's smart of them

940
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,420
One of the things that I think is interesting about this which is first of all, it's not true

941
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:18,420
Second is that if Alex believes that then he has to believe that there's

942
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,860
About as many deaths from the vaccine as there is from kovat. Yeah, that's outrageous

943
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:27,260
They estimate that one out of ten conservatively

944
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:33,340
Of adverse reactions gets reported a lot of daughters will tell you it's about one out of a hundred probably really

945
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:39,540
I mean how many times you take something of an adverse reaction and you call the CDC and then tell them?

946
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,020
okay, so

947
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:47,580
Thousands of dead people so far from the Pfizer mRNA vaccine thousands

948
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:53,140
You count Europe the US Australia. I think Pfizer could sue him. I think so, too. Yeah

949
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:58,420
Yeah, also, he's just making up numbers at the beginning totally and also you don't call the CDC

950
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:03,220
Your doctor ends up calling the CDC to report adverse. Yeah, that's why you go to the doctor

951
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:08,020
Yeah, if you have an adverse reaction to something you will go seek treatment and then they will yeah, they'll be like

952
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:13,420
Oh, we got a report this it's our job. Yeah, it would be a really inefficient system to force everyone to be like

953
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,700
Hello CDC

954
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,700
What frustrates me a lot about Alex's narratives regarding this type of stuff?

955
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:23,260
Is that yeah, man, people have already thought of those as problems

956
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,580
They happened a long time ago and people were like, oh, let's not do that

957
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:33,940
Like the reason we have the reporting system is precisely because you wouldn't call the CDC

958
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:38,880
Yeah, you wouldn't do that. So the doctor does it for you now the issue that

959
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,140
Where you could get to Alex may be having a kernel of truth

960
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:48,360
Although he's still making stuff up is that like if you have a headache that could be an adverse reaction

961
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,420
Yeah, and you might not report that right, but it would be something so trivial that you don't seek help with it

962
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,580
And you might not even know if it's related, right?

963
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,340
So yeah

964
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:02,820
Maybe one in ten if you count like minor nonsense that maybe you maybe my back hurts

965
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,580
Yeah, slight dizziness is off a headache or yeah, or I got up too quick

966
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:14,060
But but what he's saying is just a load of shit. Yeah, and I honestly think that some of the stuff that he's saying

967
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,540
Has a real potential for public health

968
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:22,740
Problems and then you look at what else it does. Holy mackerel

969
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:29,460
When you come across a COVID virus the most common in the world coronavirus in the future

970
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:35,820
Most people will have a violent autoimmune reaction and they're gonna call that COVID

971
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:42,340
2022 probably be the name. I think about 2022. They'll hit us with it. Maybe sooner. Hell maybe next month

972
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,700
And it'll be everybody dying. Oh

973
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,260
By the way, that's what I didn't tell you

974
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,980
Most of these old people that died they said it already tested positive for COVID obviously most that's fraud

975
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,860
But that's the thing. They also said that that's what Wolfgang would are

976
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:03,060
Another scientist said they said if you've already had a similar COVID

977
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:08,780
Virus or a coronavirus the same family or COVID-19 the vaccine may cause an autoimmune response and kill you

978
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:14,700
Or make you very sick or later. It'll cause the autoimmune response when you come in contact with one

979
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,660
I mean, this is a death sentence total death sentence

980
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:24,020
And they're just people to be dying all around you. It'll just be Bill Gates up there smiling like a psychotic at you

981
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:28,900
I mean, they're never gonna get away with this never they're crazy

982
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,980
But Hitler didn't get away with it either, but he wanted to kill everybody

983
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:38,420
Yeah, that's uh, that's deeply deeply irresponsible, yeah

984
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,460
Yeah, this is this is fuck

985
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,160
Yeah

986
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:48,660
Like this is the level of thinking that this is is which level like this is like a pure

987
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:55,140
We've never advanced beyond thinking that the person with two cats is actually behind illness

988
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:59,420
Yep, that's where we're at. That's where Alex's brain is at. How is developmentally?

989
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:06,100
How is it that we can develop a vaccine for a brand new virus in less than a year?

990
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:09,700
Yeah, and at the same time we have people who are like nah, nah, nah, nah

991
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,040
See if you're physically unattractive chances are you're the one killing everybody

992
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:21,640
Yeah, and I read I read a little bit about some of the folks who have died after getting the vaccine and some of them

993
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,400
did test positive for COVID and with the belief that they

994
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,000
people who were writing about this had were that

995
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,720
They had gotten the vaccine when they had already been infected

996
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:39,080
It was in the incubation period right and then the vaccine wouldn't be effective right at that point. It's too late

997
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:47,080
yeah, and you know you're talking about high-risk communities and people who are prioritized for getting the vaccines and

998
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:54,080
You know that doesn't it's not even that high of a number either like it's it's not in the thousands like Alex is saying

999
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,520
But but either way like this this kind of misinformation it stands to really

1000
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:06,260
Persuade people to have either a belief or an inclination to not disbelieve

1001
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:13,220
That this shot is a death sentence. Yeah, and that can be really really dangerous. Yeah, it's hard even to imagine like

1002
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,940
Okay, it's not the best

1003
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:23,980
Vaccine and it does have some of my adverse reactions, but it's gonna save a million lives

1004
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:30,780
You know like or like that kind of level of thing where it's like yeah, that's worth it

1005
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:38,580
Yeah, half a million people are dead man. Yeah, Alex does the straw man shit all the time of like everybody pretends

1006
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,780
The vaccines are totally safe and like there's never been a bad reaction like no no one says that

1007
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:49,700
That's a fake argument that you're making in order to to to straw man, and yep

1008
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,240
Yeah, it's just it's it's childish, and I wish that people

1009
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:59,760
Would treat him and his arguments with the disdain that they deserve yeah

1010
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,960
Um so Alex gets to talking about Bitcoin

1011
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:07,220
Of course yes of course because Elon Musk

1012
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,600
It was just on Rogan apparently again, and maybe he is into Bitcoin now sure

1013
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:19,200
He also has a guy named bit boy on as a guest later. I'm a motherfucking bit boy

1014
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,600
the weekend

1015
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,600
You want to laugh, but you can't

1016
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:30,400
That was that look oh, I can't laugh at this it's a cuz it's wrong

1017
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,080
Dan I'm well past the point of righteous violets that was going through

1018
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:42,560
Anyway, this guy is just a youtuber who's into Bitcoin sure to currencies sure his interview is not interesting

1019
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,920
I'm surprised youtubers are always fascinating

1020
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,000
I bet he actually has some interesting things to say and I don't get it

1021
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,840
I didn't get any sense of like you know him being a bigot, but I don't know sure

1022
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,400
He just was talking about crypto currencies

1023
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:00,000
Anyway, Alex is against them, but then he interviews this guy

1024
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,980
In a pretty positive. This is very confusing gotcha, and there is a global government openly

1025
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:13,140
Announcing itself and they need to end the dollar as the world reserve currency and bring in the new global digital currency

1026
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,140
Which will be based on Bitcoin?

1027
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:20,840
Which again is obviously a giant inside job from the beginning just like you and I told you that ten years ago

1028
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:26,200
And now you can see it, so why are you having a long interview with a guy? Who's into Bitcoin? Who's giving a really positive?

1029
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:33,680
Perspective it's very confusing. Yeah, also Alex hasn't been super negative about Bitcoin

1030
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,960
It's much more complicated than that yeah

1031
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,560
Yeah, he hasn't been a promoter of it

1032
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:43,780
But if he actually thought it was something that was meant to replace the dollar as part of the globalist plan

1033
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:50,280
He wouldn't have had Max Kaiser on for the last ten years on his show to constantly promote it

1034
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,720
Yeah, that would be an issue. Yeah, he wouldn't

1035
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,040
His behavior would be totally different, and that's the same actually as with Q

1036
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,480
Yeah

1037
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:05,760
If Alex actually thought that there wasn't some thing in it for him to not fully denounce

1038
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,640
X Y or Z whether it's QAnon or Bitcoin sure his behavior would be totally different

1039
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,600
He thought that there was an angle yeah, he could play some sort of hedge in the middle

1040
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:21,040
Yeah, and then once that was clearly not the case. Oh, I've known this was a setup all along right bullshit. Yeah

1041
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,520
yeah, his

1042
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:31,500
His pattern of like denouncing something softly and gently, but then having pro guests on it for an

1043
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,020
eternity is

1044
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:41,280
Clear evidence of some sort of like issue he has with I can't piss someone off

1045
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,720
There's always someone that can't be pissed off in these situations

1046
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,240
Or or just like gather might be might be worthwhile to not alienate this

1047
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:56,000
Yeah, maybe maybe down the road QAnon becomes something that is profitable for me

1048
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,920
So let's keep that lane open until it's too late sure and then I can always have been against it with with the

1049
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,660
Bitcoin it could have collapsed left people

1050
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:12,260
I with nothing sure could have been something that everyone hates and then Alex it'd be great for him to be able to say I've

1051
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:15,860
Been against the whole time right right right, but maybe it's a cool thing

1052
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:18,860
And then I could be like I've had max Kaiser promoting it on my show for ten years

1053
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:24,000
I'm an old-school Bitcoin guy sure you know if you play both sides, and then you look like a prophet

1054
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,060
Yeah, yeah, but you're not you're just dumb dumb. Yeah, anyway

1055
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,620
Trump is on trial because

1056
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:37,620
He said some things sure that's people did some things sure and hey what about Kamala Harris

1057
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,180
She said some things who hasn't said things

1058
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,820
here is

1059
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,400
Kamala Harris cackling like the witch she is

1060
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,980
Talking about killing Trump will she be

1061
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:57,420
Impeached here it is if you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump Mike Pence or Jeff Sessions who would it be?

1062
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,420
Just

1063
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,860
One of us have to come out alive

1064
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:19,300
You know what people think I was overdoing it play it again. She can hear the actual cackle

1065
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,340
I mean, I hear they're coming out with a new Wizard of Oz she's got the job as the wicked witch here

1066
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:29,820
It is a possible interpretation of that joke is that she would kill herself before going in an elevator with one of them

1067
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:33,580
Yeah, so I don't know. I think this is a little bit thin

1068
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:38,860
You think also the laughter and crowd applause?

1069
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:46,820
Indicates that this is a different setting maybe maybe I I would argue that there is a different contextual

1070
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:55,300
interpretation of someone saying a joke on the Ellen show and someone saying that you should kill one's political enemies in a

1071
01:16:55,300 --> 01:17:00,500
Rally after having said that killing them is fine for a long time. I would be dealing with this situation

1072
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:06,820
Entirely differently if Ellen DeGeneres killed Jeff Sessions in an elephant. I would be furious

1073
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,400
I would say that Kamala Harris was very irresponsible

1074
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,520
a generous killed Jeff Sessions in an elevator then we would be I mean

1075
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:22,800
How could you not that yeah, then she should be impeached? Yeah, I mean, it's still hard not to add the context of

1076
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,220
the cop was killed and to

1077
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:33,840
Yeah, so in terms of the the impeachment stuff from the the day before on the 10th

1078
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,560
Um, Alex doesn't deal with much of the let's say previously unreleased videos

1079
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,920
There are real problems over their issues. Well, I mean they certainly contradict his narrative quite a bit

1080
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,540
it's particular again resonating the

1081
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:57,800
People chanting hang Mike Pence and like people wandering through the halls yelling for Nancy Pelosi

1082
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:04,000
The just the person the first person going through the window wearing full tactical gear

1083
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,780
Confederate flags following along. Yeah, I

1084
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,840
Think that everybody has different images. That'll probably stick with them

1085
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,920
that chanting was one that was really really tough for me and particularly because you know, I

1086
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,080
Spent so much time with Alex's rhetoric and his narratives and like how directly counter

1087
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:28,360
This reality is to the game that he's spinning totally. So he just pretends a lot of that didn't happen

1088
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:32,360
Yeah, sure, but this Raskin guy, right the lead

1089
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,580
Counsel, yeah

1090
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,680
He I know that from watching the impeachment not from earlier before that

1091
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,880
Said some things that Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article about that. Alex is pissed about

1092
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,980
Oh now, let's start getting to it the slimiest rat-like creature

1093
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:57,980
I've seen in a while. Jamie Raskin is when the leader of the persecution

1094
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:06,020
He said that Trump impaled police and stabbed them to death on the 6th and then on the 6th Trump supporters burned

1095
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,180
down a church

1096
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:13,620
Well, it's funny because that church is the one that BLM firebombed that church

1097
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:19,700
Ladies and gentlemen is the church that Trump wouldn't visited with the Bible

1098
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:26,820
Why would you tell such a gigantic lie out in the open?

1099
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:32,580
Why would you say that St. John's Church was burned by Trump supporters? He didn't

1100
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,540
Well, that would be an issue. That's like saying

1101
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,700
That Abraham Lincoln killed Abraham Lincoln

1102
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:46,380
No, John Wilkes Booth did I mean, it's just it's just a it's like saying my background. My background is red

1103
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,940
You're like no your background is green today

1104
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:56,700
What I mean you might as well just get up there and say the sky is red at high noon in Texas

1105
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,900
But again, why does he do that? Because he's a lying criminal

1106
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:05,820
Everything comes out of his fat mouth so loud. I put out all these fake videos everything else and then his fake crying

1107
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,700
He couldn't get an acting part in a third party

1108
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:15,740
I couldn't get an acting part in a third-grader play with that kind of projection. Man, the master of similes, Alex Jones

1109
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,900
Projection. Yeah. Wild. Yeah, outrageous. Yeah, so

1110
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,500
Raskin didn't say that people were stabbed on January 6th

1111
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:29,500
He was clearly talking about people who were using flag poles as a weapon against Capitol Police because that's a super resonant image

1112
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:33,980
The idea that they're the Capitol Police and they're being attacked by something that has the flag on it. Sure

1113
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:38,940
It is hard to avoid. Yeah, if we're taking things super strictly literally then yes

1114
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,020
No one was run through with a pole

1115
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:45,260
But that kind of gives you a sense of the difficulty that Alex and his ilk have spinning this stuff

1116
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:50,960
The previously unreleased video, like I said of the storming really disprove a lot of Alex's narratives

1117
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,900
And you know, you really just don't want to deal with that stuff

1118
01:20:54,060 --> 01:21:01,180
So you retreat to dumb semantics arguments that mean nothing to pretend that that's the entire argument against Trump and it's all a lie

1119
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:06,860
No one was impaled. No one was impaled by a javelin thrown from 40 feet away

1120
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:13,820
We were slamming the cops head in a door. Come on. Get it right. As for the church burning Alex is playing dumb

1121
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:20,700
Raskin said quote that's before the second million maga march a rally that ended in serious violence and even the burning of a church

1122
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:23,340
This sentence doesn't say who burned a church

1123
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:30,140
But Alex and Paul Joseph Watson who wrote the article that Alex is covering are pretending that it's making an accusatory claim

1124
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:37,100
The essence of what Raskin is saying is that Trump has a pattern of inciting events that lead to violence, which isn't really debatable

1125
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:40,060
So Alex and Paul have created this fake claim to respond to

1126
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:44,140
They're also pretending that Raskin must be talking about the burning of the St.

1127
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:48,060
John's church, which was the church that Trump did his photo op in back in May

1128
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:52,940
The person or persons responsible for that fire are still unknown

1129
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,780
So Alex can't actually prove that anyone from one of his villain groups did it

1130
01:21:56,780 --> 01:22:02,380
Sure, but he's just decided to report as if that is the case. Yeah, as long as it's unknown. That's fine for him. Sure

1131
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:04,700
Raskin could have spoken more clearly

1132
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:10,220
But what he was talking about was the proud boys vandalizing the Asbury United Methodist Church and burning banners

1133
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:12,620
They've stolen from the church that said Black Lives Matter

1134
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:19,260
This is a secondary instance of Alex creating a fake thing to argue against and he knows exactly what Raskin is talking about

1135
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:25,180
The guy who took credit for burning that church's sign has been a guest on Alex's show and the night of January 5th

1136
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:30,860
Alex's employee Owen Schroyer recorded himself burning a Black Lives Matter flag in D.C. Yeah, there's that one

1137
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:33,100
Yeah, come on grow up asshole. No shit

1138
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:39,900
Anyway, what's really funny about this is with that lead-up that Alex has, he didn't actually watch this clip

1139
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,020
Oh, that's a problem. And you can kinda tell at the end because

1140
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:48,380
In the lead-up to this he's saying that Raskin claimed that

1141
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,620
There was all this on January 6th. Totally. Whoops

1142
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:55,340
And just listen to this BS

1143
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:02,140
And that's before the second million mega march a rally that ended in serious violence

1144
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,860
And even the burning of a church

1145
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,420
And as the president forecast it was only the beginning

1146
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,060
on December 19th

1147
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:16,140
18 days before January 6th. He told his base about where the battle would be that they would fight next

1148
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:23,500
January 6th would be wild, he promised. Be there, we'll be wild, said the president of the United States of America

1149
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,460
And that too turned out to be true

1150
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:34,220
You'll see in the days that followed, Donald Trump continued to aggressively promote January 6th to his followers

1151
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:39,740
Okay, so he's saying that the march that we coordinated that was peaceful

1152
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:46,300
That happened in December, was the June 1st BLM event that burned the church

1153
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,300
Did he say that?

1154
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:50,300
It's like six months apart

1155
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,300
Is that why you didn't say that?

1156
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:56,300
And it's a public event that happened. Trump went and visited it. So what does this guy do? He inverts it

1157
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:04,300
So you can hear him kind of re-spinning in real time because he realizes that the clip doesn't say what he had already prefaced it to say

1158
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,300
And you can hear it very clearly

1159
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:09,900
You can hear it very clearly. Oh, okay, okay

1160
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:18,940
All right, see now what he's saying is something different from what I said he would say and uh

1161
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,620
So he's uh

1162
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:31,180
Liar! So whose fault do you think it is that Trump has bad lawyers?

1163
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:39,180
Ooh, I let's see would it be the entire legal profession thinking that his case is both nonsensical and unwinnable or

1164
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:47,980
Him? Try again. Oh specific person. Oh, Nancy Pelosi? Nope. Oh, here's Bruce Castor. Let's play clip three

1165
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:55,260
Trump's a so-called lawyer who it turns out has sued Trump before. Oh, yeah, Trump didn't know that. This is people they give him and

1166
01:24:55,260 --> 01:25:02,780
And this other guy called he called him another one lawyers called Trump a crook just three months ago and said he's a horrible person

1167
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:04,780
And that's his lawyer. That's who Trump gets

1168
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:09,340
He can say well Trump's an idiot. Yeah, I don't even know how to use Google, but my god

1169
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,340
He better search, but see it's all

1170
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,260
It's all the son-in-law

1171
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:18,940
Man, Trump is under the spell of that Kushner. Okay. All right. It's Kushner. Yeah, okay

1172
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:27,020
Wow, all right a lot of buck stops there kind of show the secret leader of the deep state has been Kushner the entire time

1173
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:32,460
I think Pachannik has said that maybe yeah, I think this is a relatively Shakespearean tale

1174
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:36,740
Of a son-in-law betraying his father

1175
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:41,960
I would love to just be able to be like my dream job if I could have it

1176
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:47,980
Would be to be a person who hacks in to Alex's earpiece

1177
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,980
and

1178
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:55,420
I could just respond like from Fletch to I've never seen Fletch to but

1179
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,620
Alex has an earpiece in that the producers talk to him

1180
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:05,500
Yeah, and just to be able to hack in and respond in real time would be so great because I just hear that as we boo

1181
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,340
Well, you're saying that the bad lawyers who

1182
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:16,300
He hired a lawyer who sued him in the past and he didn't know about that and this is Kushner's you could absolutely

1183
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,300
absolutely convince him

1184
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:22,380
Absolutely convince him that that is an anthropomorphized voice in his head. Oh, yeah

1185
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:27,580
There is no doubt in my mind that he would have that like Alex. Oh, I got my self doubt in my ear again

1186
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:30,860
I'm your conscience and that was bad. That was dumb

1187
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,580
Isn't this guy supposed to be king shit hero guy and he?

1188
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:40,860
Hired a lawyer who sued him because his son-in-law tricked him. Yeah. Yeah. Yep

1189
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:47,580
This is this is stuff that even this is the man. I want leading the country. Yeah, so

1190
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:55,460
Alex, like I said, there's not there's not as much about the impeachment as as maybe would be

1191
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,200
Interesting or seems should be merited by yeah this

1192
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,460
show

1193
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:06,780
But he spends quite a while talking to bit boy. Sure. He's a motherfucking bit boy. Yeah

1194
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:11,140
We have two clips left. Okay, cuz I'm not talking about bit boy. No, I'm good

1195
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:16,700
We have two clips and I want to ask you if you'd rather go culture war or gossip first

1196
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:19,420
whoo, I feel like

1197
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:27,580
Culture war is going to be more offensive and yet somehow I feel like gossip also might wind up with some really fucked up shit

1198
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:32,700
So let's go with culture war. Okay Disney. All right. See I knew it

1199
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,700
Um

1200
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:38,820
Disney has fired Gina Carano. Ah

1201
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:46,700
So from the Mandalorian so a man who is absolutely not a fan of Star Wars absolutely not

1202
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:55,180
Appreciative of Star Wars at all. It's very angry about one particular character being removed from the Mandalorian. I didn't know that

1203
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,940
If I were Disney, I would blame her for Grogu

1204
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:05,260
On her way out. Yeah on the way out she'd be like toss all of our baggage onto her. What else do we got?

1205
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,100
Let's get all of it. Yeah

1206
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,780
Everyone else everyone be mad at her for all of this shit

1207
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:15,400
So in reality, what happened was that she had some social media posts

1208
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:23,540
Including a particularly offensive one where she compared being Republican to being a Jew in the Holocaust

1209
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,540
I

1210
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:31,860
People didn't care much for that. No, and she was out

1211
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:39,020
Alex may not quite understand why she got fired. Yeah, what's crazy about it is

1212
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,940
Disney's virtue signaling

1213
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,540
Kicking this former MMA lady out because she looks like a big tough man

1214
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,700
That's the image they want as women as you know

1215
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:53,540
All the leaders what now and her idiots goes back to married with children and all those shows where dad's always a moron

1216
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:56,300
I mean that's come out of memos not just gamer gate today. I

1217
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:02,480
Want to show an emasculated society, but but even that wasn't enough for her playing the part of the big male hero

1218
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:10,860
Pedro is the Mandalorian us trends after Star Wars cancels Gina Carano

1219
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:17,140
And I'm not saying she's a bad actress and I'm not saying I dislike women that are strong and have that

1220
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:18,260
a

1221
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:20,060
Amazon type look I think it's very attractive

1222
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:25,240
But the point is she actually groveled in and said it was so horrible what happened the Jews

1223
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:30,180
What she was bad what Hitler did and they called an anti-semitic Wow?

1224
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,380
Wow

1225
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,180
Alex may not quite get the conversation. Oh

1226
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:43,900
Boy, Alex Alex. You might be too used to people saying worse things than that

1227
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,740
Yeah, I mean like that's anti-semitic well

1228
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:53,340
It actually does make sense cuz Alex has compared himself to a Jewish person during the Holocaust like so for him

1229
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,620
Yeah, obviously yeah

1230
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,900
That's what she's saying is like

1231
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:05,700
Almost like he's like you're gonna fire for her for that. I have Steve be on my show all the time

1232
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:10,380
Yeah, he's throwing anti-semitic shit out like fucking candy in a parade

1233
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:17,020
Yeah, it's it's interesting to me the part that I find the most interesting outside of Alex's bizarre

1234
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:23,340
Need to have a sexual psychodrama with his audience. Yeah, I don't know why you need to do that

1235
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:29,000
Oh, I can't stand that they put strong female women in roles and make them look strong and powerful now

1236
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,660
It doesn't mean I don't want to have sex with them. Hey, but now this is something you should deal with your therapist

1237
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,860
It's not your audience

1238
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:42,580
I absolutely have to air out this problem that I can't sublimate which is that I both attracted to strong powerful women and want them

1239
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,300
Destroyed it's weird

1240
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:50,580
I wasn't quite sure where he was going as he was talking about this like what side he was gonna land on cuz he

1241
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:56,820
Was being very weird, but then when he said she groveled and said the Holocaust was bad, which it is

1242
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:02,500
Why did you say groveled? Well, I mean when you say the Holocaust is bad

1243
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:09,000
Obviously you're caving to the ADL and the Ku Klux Klan. Why do I don't understand that at all?

1244
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:14,700
Anyway, what should she have said that Hitler was a complete badass?

1245
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:18,660
Would that have been what she should have said?

1246
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,800
Maybe anyway now we get to gossip

1247
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:24,740
It is it would be kind of ridiculous

1248
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:29,780
If the guy who said that Hitler was a complete stud and a badass was like, yeah, Gina should have been fired

1249
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:32,780
I wish that I had a soundboard so I could just play that

1250
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:36,980
Yeah, all the time. I'm afraid that there may be new listeners who don't know that we had a drop

1251
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:40,700
That we used to play where Alex says that Hitler and Stalin are total badasses

1252
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:42,540
complete

1253
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,900
Badasses studs. That's how we used to thank people for

1254
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:50,200
Yeah, so we move on to gossip to close the show

1255
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:57,160
I'll say one of the more rewarding things about listening to Alex's show is getting to find little

1256
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:04,440
Threads that you can pull that you wouldn't you know, you'd never had like there was the story of Buckley's birthday party

1257
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:08,220
Oh, sure. Yeah a couple years back the ever-growing changing story

1258
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,400
There was the Nazi hat

1259
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,200
Sure, sure

1260
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:22,720
There's little glimpses that you get into Alex's life. The globalist in the hot tub is always a classic Barton Springs tales

1261
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,280
Oh, yeah, all the times he would go down to Barton Springs. Yes, the hike and bike trail

1262
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:31,360
Tails of the hike and bike a lot of interesting things have happened on that trail

1263
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:38,860
Another thing is that we know a lot about Alex's wife's tennis habits a lot more than I would have expected to learn

1264
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,120
We know that her tennis partner I believe

1265
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,280
Was scoping out antifa. Yep

1266
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:49,080
Has strong ability to do some reconnaissance

1267
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,640
She had some Intel on antiva and now we learn that

1268
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:59,340
Maybe not all is good in the world of Alex's wife's tennis. Oh, no, maybe there are some haters

1269
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,080
I was playing tennis

1270
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,080
With these women she's down a few years and one of them walks over the real ugly look on her face

1271
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:13,000
And I like this what's wrong just I just what's wrong is what you did at the Capitol tried to overthrow our country

1272
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,080
Well, I said we were protesting the election. That was a handful. It was just oh, yeah, right

1273
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,080
sure

1274
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:26,800
This is this whole act of like, you know, oh gosh what you did. Oh, it's like the Democrats were just saying

1275
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:36,040
Jamie Raskin says Trump supporters burned down the church to that BLM did publicly that quick

1276
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:46,080
Yeah, she's getting the news that quick the turnaround is fast on that. It's quick. I

1277
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,940
Mean I understand that it's most likely just a device for him to do like a character or whatever

1278
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:58,600
But I love that there's a like an entire genre within Alex's world of like stories where he complains about the people

1279
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,560
yeah, his wife plays tennis with yeah, he's almost doing like a

1280
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:08,880
A nursery rhyme levels of explaining things in in like entail, you know

1281
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:15,600
Like this is why we don't touch fire because there's a rabbit that goes around and it touched fire one time and you were like

1282
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:22,000
This is bad. This is her tennis instructor was like, hey, we should listen to this guy and that's bad

1283
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,740
See now children. Let's move on. I feel like more his

1284
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,260
his wife's tennis

1285
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:35,900
World is like a world that's populated by fictional characters that he just gets to cast in little plays

1286
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:41,660
It's like a little anime. Yeah. Yeah, whenever he needs somebody to have seen antifa setting up at the grocery store

1287
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:44,460
Well, it's somebody involved in my wife's tennis games

1288
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,180
you need somebody to play the role of

1289
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,660
nosy

1290
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,700
judgmental

1291
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:56,780
Democrat it's somebody that my wife's playing tennis with now it is strangely enough the only both

1292
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,780
a combined tennis club and private investigatory

1293
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:06,260
Agency on you know, it's like whenever you first saw Baskin-Robbins and a KFC in the same place

1294
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:10,100
You're like, what are we doing here? That's the tennis club. I think you're thinking of Dunkin Donuts

1295
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:15,420
It's all the same shit. There's never been a Taco Bell and KFC is what I meant

1296
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:18,340
What am I supposed to know never be a Baskin-Robbins?

1297
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,060
It's not the same company

1298
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:28,320
I'm talking Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. They're all young right? Right, right, right understand this and then

1299
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,840
Duncan and Baskin-Robbins, I think

1300
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:38,140
A lot of me mistaking this, you know, it's a meal Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut all together with good meal, but

1301
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:42,460
Don't eat it before you go play tennis without his wife

1302
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:48,900
you will you will probably wind up taking a nap and missing out on some crucial information either that or you'll become a story that

1303
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,620
Alex tells on the show

1304
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,820
About somebody who ate too much shitty food before playing tennis with his wife

1305
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:57,140
That's somehow illustrates how the Democrats are evil

1306
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,900
That's the new way to fuck with Alex Jones

1307
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:04,300
You join his wife's tennis club and you just every now and again walk up to her with a ugly look on your face and

1308
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,620
Just say something

1309
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:09,900
Reasonable. I if I had all the time in the world. Mm-hmm

1310
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:14,060
I'd still not do that. That sounds like a real wife's time. Absolutely not

1311
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:21,060
Anyway, Jordan we come to the end of this and I expected a little bit more fireworks, but I mean he is mad sure

1312
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:25,940
Don't get me wrong. He's mad sure sure, but it almost makes more sense to me

1313
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:29,300
You know like you're saying this is a coherent ish response. And yeah

1314
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:31,900
like he shouldn't be

1315
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:37,140
Like upset about the impeachment thing. He think he's supposed to think that Trump won the election. Yeah

1316
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:40,180
No, that's why we were should be disappointed in whatever

1317
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:44,820
Defense there is because they're not saying that Trump won the election, right?

1318
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:50,340
Yeah, it's even better for him that they're terrible lawyers. Yeah, because then you can pretend that they're

1319
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:56,020
Sandbagging on purpose, of course, and then whenever they whenever Trump wins and is acquitted

1320
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:03,380
He's gonna be like see even in spite of the lawyers that the globalists gave him right? Yeah, he's so innocent

1321
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:09,220
Mm-hmm. His defense was literally two men going bi POS

1322
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:12,700
For four hours and he won. Yeah

1323
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:18,620
Anyway, we'll see how this develops indeed. We will but until then Jordan we have a website. We do have a website

1324
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,820
It's knowledgefight.com. Yep. We're also on

1325
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:26,140
We are on Twitter. Is that an algorithm? If I go to pet Jordan? Yeah, we're also on Facebook

1326
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:31,900
We are lazy. Will you do that downscales in that if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

1327
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:35,460
We'll be back, but until then I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis

1328
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:40,460
I have no other place to mention this and it it seems perfect here. Danny

1329
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:48,040
Sent me a message and Norm Pattis's beard is fucking crazy. Norm Pattis trim your goddamn beard. It is inappropriate

1330
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:52,000
Anyway, Andy in Kansas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding

1331
01:37:52,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan. I love your work. I love you.
