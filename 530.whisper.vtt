N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.160
Knowledgefight.

00:25.160 --> 00:29.320
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.320
Knowledgefight.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.420
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.640
Riddle Earth!

00:33.640 --> 00:34.800
Riddle Earth!

00:34.800 --> 00:36.500
I need money.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.820
Riddle Earth!

00:37.820 --> 00:39.020
Riddle Earth!

00:39.020 --> 00:42.840
Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice, Stop it.

00:42.840 --> 00:47.120
Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice, It's time to pray.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.480
Andy and Candice, you're on the air.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.560
Thanks for holding.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.560
Hello Alex.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.560
I am a huge fan.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.560
I love your room.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.560
Knowledgefight.com, knowledgefight.com.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.560
Love you.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.120
on knowledgefight.com.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.400
I love you.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:01.000 --> 01:01.840
I'm Dan.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.660
I'm Jordan.

01:02.660 --> 01:03.920
We're a couple dudes that surround technology beverages

01:03.920 --> 01:05.240
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.640
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.480
Jordan.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.300
Dan.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.140
Jordan.

01:09.140 --> 01:09.980
Quick question for you.

01:09.980 --> 01:10.800
What's your bright spot today?

01:10.800 --> 01:11.960
My bright spot today, Jordan, is mochi.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.560
Ooh.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.960
I've, I got.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.640
You've recently discovered mochi.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.480
Yes.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.300
Yes.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.760
And it is expanded from there.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.080
I am off.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.400
Next year we will be doing 500 new tastes of mochi.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.220
No.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.060
Oh.

01:27.060 --> 01:28.120
I don't think that would be possible.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.400
It'd be pretty difficult.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.360
But I've tried a number of flavors

01:31.360 --> 01:32.800
that I've been able to get my hands on.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.540
And man, it's so good.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.200
The thing that was really tough for me

01:36.200 --> 01:41.200
was that I'd heard such startlingly different reviews.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.320
Sure, sure.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.300
It's a divisive dessert.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.140
Very much so.

01:46.140 --> 01:46.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.540
And I'd worried that I would fall squarely

01:48.540 --> 01:51.480
in the gl-eh category, but I love it.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.160
And it also, I didn't realize it,

01:53.160 --> 01:56.280
but it just takes me back a bit to, like,

01:56.280 --> 01:58.440
things that I had in Hawaii growing up.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.260
Yeah, yeah.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.360
And that makes total sense,

02:00.360 --> 02:02.400
but I didn't think that it would.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.360
Right, right, right, right.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.800
And it's great, I love it.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
So another dessert.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.000
Great, another fucking sweet thing for me to eat.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.440
Just what we needed.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.000
The audience was like, what other sweet things

02:13.000 --> 02:14.920
is Dan gonna become obsessed with?

02:16.280 --> 02:19.280
What will capture Dan's sweet tooth today?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.120
Fuck.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.160
Good news is people won't be mailing those to you.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.200
No, that is true, thank God.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.600
Next thing you know, shit just comes in dry ice.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.040
Start, start.

02:28.040 --> 02:28.880
Dry ice.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.720
Damn it!

02:29.720 --> 02:31.440
And then just melted ones.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.520
So yeah, Mochi, how about you?

02:32.520 --> 02:36.680
Oh, my bright spot this week, Dan, is The Swordsman.

02:36.680 --> 02:40.160
It's a Korean movie that's, I don't know, it's really good.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.080
It's about three swordsmen, they do stuff, it's fantastic.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.760
So it's swordsmen plural?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.800
No, the movie is about singular.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.640
Okay, so it's one of those three.

02:47.640 --> 02:48.960
There are multiple that appear, yes indeed.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.200
So it's like The Highlander,

02:50.200 --> 02:51.800
there's more than one Highlander.

02:51.800 --> 02:52.640
Yeah, absolutely.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.480
Although there can only be one.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.800
No, there's not more than one Highlander,

02:54.800 --> 02:55.880
there's only one Highlander.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.920
I mean, there are many people who live in the Highlands.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.360
I thought that there was these immortals

03:00.360 --> 03:01.320
and they have to kill each other.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.040
Sure, of course they do, but the Highlander

03:03.040 --> 03:05.200
specifically refers to that he's from Scotland.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.960
Oh, that's right, Highlander isn't the group of them.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.400
Yeah, yeah, and obviously as we all know

03:12.400 --> 03:15.960
from just appearance and conversational style alone,

03:15.960 --> 03:18.960
Sean Connery is indeed Egyptian in that movie.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.080
And the original Bond.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.520
And the original Bond, yes, we have discovered so much today.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.440
Yeah, a lot of education, referencing things we Googled

03:27.440 --> 03:29.040
just before getting on the show.

03:30.680 --> 03:34.960
So Jordan, today we have an interesting thing to go over.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.840
We're gonna be talking about February 10th and 11th, 2021.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.760
Butt check!

03:38.760 --> 03:39.600
I'll let you have that one.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.720
You let me have that one, you son of a bitch.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.560
Oh.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.880
You son of a bitch.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.040
I was still late,

03:45.040 --> 03:47.720
cause I was halfway waiting for you to say it first.

03:47.720 --> 03:52.000
I am disappointed in you because you had the open lane

03:52.000 --> 03:53.840
and you still stutter stepped.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.240
No, it's like, it's like,

03:56.240 --> 03:57.240
You thought it was a trap.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.480
It's Anthony Davis in the block, man.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.440
You can feel him coming.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.320
You just know, you're not gonna go for the layup

04:03.320 --> 04:04.840
cause he's gonna swat it away from you.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.160
I decided to hang back and just see what you had.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.080
And then I blew it.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.360
Yeah.

04:10.360 --> 04:14.000
So that is Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.440
And the reason that I wanted to check in on this

04:16.440 --> 04:19.120
is because of course the Trump impeachment is going on.

04:19.120 --> 04:19.960
Sure.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.480
We'll discuss some feelings about that.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.600
Cause both of us have watched a bit of that.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.440
Yeah.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.280
Weirdly.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.120
Way too much for no reason.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.160
Yeah, I blame you cause I wasn't going to.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.200
And then you texted me about it and I was like,

04:30.200 --> 04:31.360
well, I'll watch a little bit of this.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.800
And I'm like, oh my God.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.640
It's surprisingly engrossing.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.800
And at the same time, I'm like, this is stupid.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.640
What am I doing?

04:37.640 --> 04:38.480
What am I doing?

04:38.480 --> 04:39.960
Very conflicted about watching it

04:39.960 --> 04:41.600
and spending as much time as I have.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.840
But I mean, it feels important.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.720
It should be.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.400
It feels like it's way more important

04:47.400 --> 04:48.680
than people are taking it.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.520
Yeah.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.920
I think it has a vibe of everyone's like,

04:51.920 --> 04:53.160
this is our second one.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.240
We've been here before.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.400
We all know he should have been done in the first one.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.240
So let's get this over with

04:58.240 --> 04:59.840
cause these people are fucking nuts.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.800
We'll talk about some of the specifics and stuff

05:01.800 --> 05:03.600
once we get into the episode.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
But yeah, it's weird.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.600
Yeah.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.160
So before we get to business on the episode itself,

05:09.160 --> 05:10.600
let's take a moment, Jordan, to say thank you

05:10.600 --> 05:11.960
to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.800
Oh, that's a great idea.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.480
So first, Joe asks, thank you so much.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.880
You're now a Policy Wonk.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.920

05:16.920 --> 05:17.880

05:29.040 --> 05:29.880

05:29.880 --> 05:30.720
Nope.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.800
Bop, bop, bop.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.640
Nope.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.480
Sorry.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.760

05:38.280 --> 05:39.120

05:40.800 --> 05:41.880
Thanks Becky I'm a Policy Wonk.

05:41.880 --> 05:45.600
I was trying to get ahead of the oh man. I'm black

05:46.360 --> 05:53.180
Now I'm way too ramped up. Yeah the next Jim J. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

05:53.680 --> 05:59.760
And finally Jasmina K. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you Jasmina

05:59.760 --> 06:04.460
Thank you so much. Do you organize those cuz I feel like our last episode was

06:05.240 --> 06:09.320
99% fake joke names and this one just all seemed like normal people I

06:09.320 --> 06:14.220
Prepared a little bit today. Whereas sometimes I will end up it

06:15.360 --> 06:21.000
It changes it varies. I got it depends on how much time I have. Yeah, you're a busy man

06:21.000 --> 06:26.160
Yeah before the episode I need to be better at organizing stuff, but I'm just not yeah now

06:26.160 --> 06:32.040
I read an article recently about how podcasters don't really need to do much work and the money is really good in the job

06:32.040 --> 06:35.740
So yeah, I saw I saw yeah. Yeah, I assume that that's what you're up to

06:36.480 --> 06:38.120
Yep

06:38.120 --> 06:43.440
So Jordan also another thing we got to do is gonna take a little moment here to say it give a very special

06:43.800 --> 06:45.800
Delilah message Oh Delilah

06:49.900 --> 06:53.360
We got an email beating up Sampson lady

06:54.280 --> 07:00.760
We got an email from Mike. Uh-huh, and he wanted us to play. I'm holding out for a hero

07:00.760 --> 07:08.760
To play a little bit of James Ingram

07:12.200 --> 07:14.200
Yep, that sounds right

07:14.520 --> 07:16.520
Real tough time coming up with

07:18.240 --> 07:24.400
But he reached out and he wanted us to give a little bit of a happy birthday message out to his partner Lauren

07:24.640 --> 07:29.960
Whose birthday is actually yesterday when this is coming out. All right, you know, some people have a birthday week

07:29.960 --> 07:35.520
Yeah, and no, I hope not. Yeah, some people do that. That's not fair. You've not worked in an office in a long time

07:35.520 --> 07:36.920
I don't remember

07:36.920 --> 07:41.680
I don't remember that there were birthday. We don't remember people who would just be like this is my birthday week

07:41.680 --> 07:44.320
It's like yeah, but that's Thursday. Oh

07:44.960 --> 07:47.080
But it would be Tuesday and they'd be like

07:48.000 --> 07:53.720
I choose to believe that we are not dealing with people who manufacture a personality based on their birthday. I

07:53.720 --> 07:55.560
I

07:55.560 --> 08:00.960
Think these people are great dad. Um, so Lauren, happy birthday. Happy birthday, Lauren

08:00.960 --> 08:04.120
And you know what? You can have three days not a week

08:07.720 --> 08:11.280
And I'm sorry Mike that I couldn't improvise a better song

08:14.080 --> 08:19.600
James Ingram's name holding out for a hero. Yeah, I'm gonna go with 2d 2f

08:19.600 --> 08:26.320
Mmm, nevermind. The only James Ingram song I can come up with right now off the top of my head is yamo be there

08:26.920 --> 08:28.760
featuring Michael McDonald

08:28.760 --> 08:30.760
Just listening to the yacht rock podcast

08:32.000 --> 08:35.520
Michael McDonald was usually halfway good. Yeah, so Jordan

08:36.720 --> 08:40.080
Impeachment. Yes. What about it? It is upon us anything going on. Yeah

08:41.480 --> 08:42.920
You know

08:42.920 --> 08:44.920
watching watching this stuff

08:44.920 --> 08:52.840
The one of my big takeaways is that Castro looks solid with a beaster. Oh, no walking Castro

08:52.840 --> 08:58.600
Yeah, yeah, I got you. He does look better with a beard. Yeah, nice-looking beard. Huh? It's about all I got doesn't it?

08:58.600 --> 09:01.120
It does his twin have a beard. I don't know

09:01.520 --> 09:05.600
Well, we should call him because that's a man who needs a beard. This is a

09:07.360 --> 09:10.520
Would be to have a twin so you could try out facial hair

09:10.520 --> 09:17.960
Be awesome twice as much done in terms of trying out styles. No, I think you are talking about a clone did you?

09:21.440 --> 09:23.440
Yeah, I just think his beard look good

09:24.120 --> 09:32.400
And then beyond that I don't know. I feel like the image that's gonna resonate with me. Is that video of

09:32.400 --> 09:40.640
The officer running down the hallway running past Mitt Romney Mitt Romney turning around and running the other way

09:40.920 --> 09:43.480
paired with all the video of

09:44.240 --> 09:52.100
Protesters talking about hanging Mike Pence and yeah, it's just the the imagining what could have happened had that guy

09:53.220 --> 09:59.720
Goodman not said good, you know run the other way the other way, you know, just the idea that someone

09:59.720 --> 10:01.960
Who's a very?

10:03.200 --> 10:09.880
High level politician someone who's very notable in politics who ran for president who's in the Senate

10:10.920 --> 10:13.960
They probably would have killed him. Yeah. Yeah

10:14.560 --> 10:21.320
Yeah, there's there was a little there was a little bit of me that was watching that part thinking like and then the next thing

10:21.320 --> 10:25.640
You should say is if it weren't for him Mitt Romney would be dead guys

10:25.640 --> 10:33.360
Hey 45 senators who are gonna vote to uncovick say you want Mitt Romney to die or shut the fuck up

10:33.360 --> 10:36.640
Well, yeah, that's one way to put it and I think that would be fair

10:36.640 --> 10:43.360
Yeah, I think that's pretty much the only way to go. Yeah, I I it's it's it's a really surreal thing to be seeing

10:44.320 --> 10:48.400
this conversation that's happening and the people you're trying to persuade are like

10:48.400 --> 10:54.960
Do you know they're they're chanting to kill the vice president who they elected? Yeah

10:55.920 --> 10:57.920
You understand that they Intel

10:58.440 --> 11:05.080
Moments earlier they were fine with the idea of supporting my pants if he subverted the Constitution you understand

11:05.720 --> 11:07.720
Your name is very

11:08.000 --> 11:12.220
Replaceable with that. Yeah in terms of who they are looking to kill see the problem

11:12.220 --> 11:17.880
There is I think they thoroughly understand that which is why they will be voting to acquit. Yeah

11:17.880 --> 11:23.180
I don't I don't know the dynamics but it's it was it's pretty it's pretty fucked up to

11:23.360 --> 11:31.260
To to see the information presented that way. Yeah, cuz it's it's coherent. It makes sense and it it's it's almost

11:31.960 --> 11:33.960
hilariously over-the-top

11:33.960 --> 11:41.120
comprehensive where like I was watching yesterday and then today and they were talking about how this is almost guaranteed this is

11:41.120 --> 11:45.120
Guaranteed to be the shortest impeachment trial in history and after watching those two days

11:45.120 --> 11:51.320
I was like that does make sense. Yeah in a normal real-world situation because you'd watch that and go

11:51.720 --> 11:55.760
Boy, the defense better come up with something real good. Yeah, it's open

11:55.760 --> 12:02.640
You watch the defense's opening argument. You're like, they're fucked. They're fucked. They got no chance. They're opening statement might as well a bit come on

12:06.240 --> 12:09.080
Come on he's not even president anymore. Get out of here

12:09.560 --> 12:12.680
Yeah, and I was that caster is yeah

12:12.680 --> 12:19.440
Yeah, it's yeah his statement being like oh they made some good points. Yeah, that's not good. Yeah. Yeah

12:19.440 --> 12:25.960
Yeah, I don't know. We're all august members of this body. I just want to say you guys are all great

12:25.960 --> 12:31.100
I love you now, obviously the prosecution makes some good points my clients guilty

12:31.100 --> 12:36.560
But I want you all to know that you're spectacular people. I thought we were gonna bicker about jurisdiction

12:36.560 --> 12:42.520
I am not prepared for no. No, oh boy. It really does look like he's committed those crimes

12:42.520 --> 12:47.200
Yeah, and all the all these sort of defenses that you see thrown around are like well

12:47.440 --> 12:54.440
The Trump's rally couldn't have incited this because the people were planning for weeks and it's like well, tada here. Yeah

12:55.240 --> 12:58.960
Exactly. Here's the all the stuff that Trump was saying for weeks

12:59.520 --> 13:04.980
Yeah, it's yeah, and I have no faith in any conclusion

13:04.980 --> 13:08.440
Like I don't have any faith that there's gonna be a conviction and I also don't have any faith that

13:08.440 --> 13:15.160
You know, there's not going to be also like I just I see this and I'm there. Yeah

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah

13:18.680 --> 13:25.200
so I wanted to see Alex's response to a lot of this because I figure if anybody is gonna be

13:26.360 --> 13:28.720
Mad about this it'd be Alex

13:28.720 --> 13:29.240
Yeah

13:29.240 --> 13:35.640
He for the sense the impeachment the second impeachment has come around has been really really

13:35.640 --> 13:39.320
Insistent that Trump needs to get up there and put the whole system on trial

13:39.320 --> 13:44.960
Yes, that would be great Trump needs to get in there and insist that he won the election. It was stolen from him

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
He still can

13:47.720 --> 13:50.240
Alex is not happy that that is not happened

13:50.240 --> 13:54.080
I imagine so and so we'll get get into a little bit of his response

13:54.080 --> 13:59.400
But first here is an out-of-context drop from today's show because I actually worship these people. I hate them

13:59.400 --> 14:04.600
I can't stand them, but I actually know everything about AOC everything about Joe Biden Kim Jong-un GG ping

14:04.600 --> 14:06.680
I shouldn't be looking at GG ping ever

14:06.680 --> 14:11.840
I mean what the hell's going on, but I have to because he's always up my ass. Yeah, man, that's tough

14:11.960 --> 14:14.780
Yeah, we really shouldn't be looking at Alex Jones. He's there

14:16.640 --> 14:23.480
But I can't I can't look away but we have to because he's up America's ass can't can't not look. Mm-hmm. So

14:24.360 --> 14:26.360
Alex discusses

14:26.400 --> 14:30.720
The UN building a little bit at the beginning of this show here on February 10th

14:30.720 --> 14:37.640
He's talking about how you know, he he made that documentary endgame and it is the UN building on the front of it

14:37.640 --> 14:38.840
uh-huh, and

14:38.840 --> 14:42.720
He wasn't supposed to be on air when this stuff was going on now

14:42.720 --> 14:47.040
Oh, you know all the stuff that's supposed to have been taken off the air way in advance, right?

14:47.040 --> 14:51.360
Yeah, and you could either believe that or you could believe that all that stuff

14:51.360 --> 14:56.640
He was saying about they have plans to take me off the air when their plans come to fruition was just nonsense

14:56.640 --> 15:01.120
Yeah, that's possible. We are not supposed to be on air right now

15:01.120 --> 15:04.320
You're supposed to be shut down long before they launch this operation

15:05.920 --> 15:07.920
If you saw my film in game

15:08.840 --> 15:11.680
Also a green mist on the cover

15:12.800 --> 15:16.080
You will notice that I specifically say they're gonna release

15:16.840 --> 15:20.120
bioweapons stimulants to practice a lockdown and

15:20.760 --> 15:22.760
Then that they would launch

15:22.760 --> 15:30.400
Stronger attacks each successive wave while posing as the saviors while will be the United Nations that launches the attack

15:30.840 --> 15:36.400
You guys just type into a search engine in game blueprint for global enslavement and click images

15:36.880 --> 15:41.800
Or maybe go out on the bookshelf and bring a DVD and I want to show you the cover. It's the UN building

15:43.200 --> 15:49.640
In New York City paid for by the Rockefellers and the land it sits on paid for by the Rockefellers

15:49.640 --> 15:55.480
Strangely enough, I won't get into that story

15:59.560 --> 16:06.840
My mom said own that land sold it to then come start the Texas Revolution. That was the heirs family, but that is a side issue

16:09.200 --> 16:14.840
That's right back in the 1820s, that's not a family where Yankees in New York folks

16:16.040 --> 16:17.320
anyways

16:17.320 --> 16:21.480
You can't really count me as a Texan and my family's only been here on both sides since the 1820s

16:21.480 --> 16:25.760
Just once you're from New York. Yes, you're always from New York, but I am digressing. Sorry. Yeah

16:27.760 --> 16:34.360
Much so we have a nine-hour series about endgame and you can go and decide for yourself if

16:34.800 --> 16:40.760
That documentary is actually about what Alex thinks it is. I believe he's literally asking us to judge a book by its cover. Yes

16:40.760 --> 16:43.960
Yeah, a DVD by yeah, let me show you this cover of the DVD

16:43.960 --> 16:50.760
I love the idea that Alex is, you know, he's making this physical land where the UN building sits into a personal issue for him

16:50.760 --> 16:52.760
Yep, like but there's a couple problems

16:53.640 --> 16:55.040
so

16:55.040 --> 16:59.600
The relative that Alex is talking about here is a guy named David Ayers who?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.920
He he and his family were the ones who Colonel Travis

17:03.240 --> 17:10.460
Left his son with and that Alex claims to be related. Sure. Sure. Sure. This dude came to Texas in 1832

17:10.460 --> 17:14.540
Also Colonel Travis didn't like adopt his son to them

17:14.540 --> 17:18.980
Like Alex likes to pretend his son just stayed with the Ayers family to attend school

17:18.980 --> 17:25.120
While his dad drunkenly pretended to be a soldier at the Alamo. The son only stayed with the family for two years. It's not like

17:25.820 --> 17:31.180
You know long enough to build a bond. I will I'm not gonna get in a problem. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

17:31.700 --> 17:34.540
Ayers on that one. I'm not gonna split Ayers exactly

17:34.540 --> 17:40.220
I think that that's fine. But the way Alex presents it is like they gave him his son. Yeah. Yeah

17:40.220 --> 17:47.100
Yeah, he raised Colonel Travis's son. He was founded a manger. Yeah. Yeah. Also David Ayers himself actually wasn't from New York

17:47.380 --> 17:51.180
He was from Morristown, New Jersey where he was born in 1793

17:51.780 --> 17:57.180
According to the Texas State Historical Association David quote came to Texas to buy property and build a home

17:57.540 --> 18:01.380
Prior to that he quote was a merchant in Ithaca, New York

18:01.380 --> 18:04.780
Ithaca is about 230 miles from New York City

18:04.780 --> 18:09.240
So I have some doubts about this whole story of him owning the land that the UN building is on

18:09.620 --> 18:14.940
Sounds like a load of bullshit that Alex tells himself in order to keep this fight with his imaginary enemies personal. Yeah

18:14.940 --> 18:16.940
That's my land

18:20.860 --> 18:25.260
Man here's the thing about that. Yeah. All right, it's if that's what you want to do

18:25.780 --> 18:29.500
Okay, I have a claim to that land back from the 1820s

18:29.500 --> 18:35.740
Then you also have to acknowledge that maybe somebody else had a claim to that land in the 1500s. Nope

18:36.460 --> 18:42.400
Nope, why not? Alex's property rights began in the 1820s. I did not know that

18:43.220 --> 18:47.640
I should have was that in the Constitution. All right, so there's this

18:48.460 --> 18:51.580
Thing in life where stuff happens gradually

18:52.460 --> 18:56.160
Alex tries to discuss how taking COVID seriously

18:56.160 --> 18:59.080
will lead to negative consequences much like

18:59.760 --> 19:04.020
Taking the Klan seriously leads us to kicking Trump off Twitter

19:04.640 --> 19:06.640
This is one of these

19:08.240 --> 19:11.380
I'm gonna need to hear this one. It's an SAT all the way through

19:11.840 --> 19:17.760
So the first domino was the KKK and the white supremacist most of them run by the southern property law center in the ADL

19:18.320 --> 19:20.780
And the FBI that's come out mainstream the ADL

19:21.400 --> 19:24.760
Mmm, and then the next like oh, I'm over the Nazis. So let's take their speech away

19:24.760 --> 19:29.880
Let's take their bank accounts away. And then next it's oh, it's Alex Jones. Let's take everything

19:29.880 --> 19:34.320
He's got and then two years later. It's the President of the United States

19:38.400 --> 19:44.000
No, I think these are all lumped in with the Nazis for these masks for 15 days, I'll just stay in your house for 15 days

19:45.000 --> 19:51.120
Sounds reasonable. It's the little domino then it's all six months. It's all two years. Well, just take this COVID test

19:51.120 --> 19:57.280
Well, just have a contact tracer in your house. Well, it's ten years in jail if you're seen outside your house period I

19:58.280 --> 20:00.280
Got the video they announced it yesterday

20:02.280 --> 20:04.280
In Parliament

20:05.640 --> 20:10.960
In Parliament ten years in prison if you're seen outside your house when they tell you to quarantine

20:11.200 --> 20:16.960
So the problem with the argument that he's making is that like if there is behavioral

20:16.960 --> 20:21.780
Similarities between the Klan Alex Jones and the president

20:21.780 --> 20:25.560
I don't understand in that they're all breaking the terms of service of a certain platform

20:26.080 --> 20:31.920
I'm getting kicked off is it's not like some kind of a dominoes falling situation. It's more of just a

20:32.520 --> 20:38.140
Consistency of the rules only Nazis would expect justice to be applied fairly. Yeah, that doesn't make much sense

20:38.400 --> 20:45.040
And then in terms of the the evolving situation with COVID, it's like we didn't do any of those things

20:45.040 --> 20:50.160
No, no all of those things. It's like he had 15 days 30 days or like we didn't do those things

20:50.560 --> 20:55.780
Or at least people some people didn't to large enough extent that those were not

20:56.000 --> 21:00.880
effective or at least as effective as they could be yeah, and then secondarily the government didn't provide

21:01.360 --> 21:08.520
material support to people to enable them to do these safety measures in a way that would have been meaningful and so

21:08.640 --> 21:14.180
We end up with we end up with a situation that gets worse and worse and yeah the mitigation

21:14.180 --> 21:20.620
Take things that you would prescribe for that become larger. So it's not the dominoes falling

21:20.620 --> 21:22.220
It's just us not taking care of a problem

21:22.220 --> 21:29.460
Not just that but mitigation efforts that were already planned for and in place that Jared Kushner according to witnesses denied

21:30.060 --> 21:35.040
Specifically because it would only hurt Democrats more making it more of a genocide situation

21:35.040 --> 21:40.340
Just saying just tossing that out there. So but if you're outside your house, you're gonna go to prison for 10 years

21:40.340 --> 21:44.180
Oh, okay in the UK. This is nonsense

21:44.180 --> 21:44.460
Yeah

21:44.460 --> 21:50.820
the actual story is about how the UK government has rolled out new rules where if you're returning to the country after visiting a

21:50.820 --> 21:53.660
Country that's on the red list of high-risk countries

21:53.660 --> 21:58.080
You're required to quarantine at a government-designated hotel for 10 days, which costs approximately

21:59.000 --> 22:00.500
1750 pounds

22:00.500 --> 22:07.260
the discussion of a 10-year sentence is for people who knowingly lie about where they're returning to the UK from in order to skip

22:07.260 --> 22:12.780
And skirt public health measures and the required quarantining everyone can still go outside their houses

22:12.780 --> 22:15.620
Alex is just trying to scare people. Yeah, it's all a bunch of bullshit

22:15.620 --> 22:22.060
Yep, and I am positive that you know, that is a high figure for a lot of people

22:22.060 --> 22:22.580
Mm-hmm

22:22.580 --> 22:23.980
but also I

22:23.980 --> 22:31.980
Would assume that people who are coming from these countries or people who are coming in from vacations to those countries

22:31.980 --> 22:39.620
Yeah, possibly people who would be able to afford the quarantining and I would also assume that if not the there's probably

22:40.380 --> 22:46.140
At least some sort of a program in place to help people who don't have the means. Yeah for the sake of public safety

22:46.140 --> 22:51.880
Yeah, it's not I don't know. Anyway, it's all a load of bullshit. Yeah, Alex is lying. Oh, yeah, so

22:53.380 --> 22:55.700
We know that Alex is a violent chap

22:55.700 --> 23:03.220
But you from all of his words and deeds. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, those would be how we identify. Yeah. Yeah his regular tone

23:03.220 --> 23:08.680
Yeah his insistence on encouraging people to be violent his behaviors in all of the stories

23:08.680 --> 23:14.180
He tells about accosting people as though he's the hero. Yes. Yeah, but it turns out he's not

23:14.740 --> 23:16.740
We were right now

23:16.840 --> 23:22.140
By we I mean Alex and his audience. Yes, we are in a riptide

23:22.140 --> 23:28.620
And if you fight when you're in a riptide, you're gonna drown. All right, so you can't fight

23:28.620 --> 23:33.180
I don't know anything about riptides. You don't know. Oh see much like mochi

23:34.100 --> 23:36.100
Riptides were a part of my grown-up

23:36.500 --> 23:38.420
Well naturally, yes

23:38.420 --> 23:40.620
Yeah, there is there is a certain amount of truth to it

23:40.620 --> 23:43.660
Like if you get taken in an undertow or something

23:43.660 --> 23:48.440
You will generally end up like just getting like fighting you gotta slide it

23:48.440 --> 23:51.600
And you'll come out not a great strategy, right? Right?

23:51.600 --> 23:56.560
Cuz you're just gonna stay under and drown it can be it can be very bad. Gotcha. It's really scary

23:56.560 --> 24:01.000
I've been through similar things. I believe times and in my younger years, but

24:02.080 --> 24:05.580
This metaphor doesn't quite work the way Alex wants it to

24:05.780 --> 24:09.200
Because what he's sort of saying is like we're gonna take some bumps in this

24:09.240 --> 24:12.960
Riptide and then we'll be spit out from the riptide and be in safety

24:12.960 --> 24:17.040
It'll be scary but you know, you can't fight because if you fight that's when you're gonna drown

24:17.040 --> 24:21.000
But then at the end he also says that people are coming to kill your family

24:21.000 --> 24:27.800
I like in this to getting caught in a riptide and I'm one time foolishly when I was a teenager. They had red flags out

24:27.800 --> 24:31.560
I'm like, I'm a great swimmer. I'm in hell before I quit doing almost 13

24:31.560 --> 24:34.920
I was a champion swimmer when all the blue ribbons in Dallas and I thought I'd get out there

24:34.920 --> 24:35.800
I'm 18 years old

24:35.800 --> 24:40.080
I got grabbed in one of those things and I knew what to do and it sucked me under I said just hold your breath

24:40.080 --> 24:45.720
And relax don't fight it. It spit me out in 50 yards and I was okay, but it scared the living hell out of me

24:45.720 --> 24:51.520
Well, let me just tell you we're already being pulled under so it's not time to even get air

24:52.880 --> 24:55.800
You're just hold it relax baby because you panic you're gonna die

24:56.640 --> 25:01.000
So this is not negative. This is biblical. It's all gonna happen and

25:01.800 --> 25:05.040
It's gonna get so bad within a few years. You're just gonna be totally blown away

25:05.120 --> 25:11.080
They're gonna tighten tighten tighten release a little and then clamp down even harder and then release a little and clamp down even harder

25:11.080 --> 25:15.560
Mass suicides death there'll be COVID deaths from the vaccines everywhere

25:15.560 --> 25:23.000
It's already happening and they'll just normalize it and then all these college students that don't have jobs are gonna have government paychecks their own uniforms

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
They're already coming to your house

25:26.840 --> 25:33.100
The communists are coming armed for you and your family and they're gonna kill you so get ready so we shouldn't do anything

25:34.080 --> 25:37.320
We're in a riptide that we should just just hold your breath

25:37.320 --> 25:44.000
Okay, relax, okay, or should I be worried about the armed commies coming to kill my family?

25:44.000 --> 25:49.040
Well, those would seem important to you, but they're not coming to kill Alex's family

25:49.040 --> 25:55.140
So we need to just sit tight and we'll get through this much like how a t-rex can't see you in the movies

25:55.140 --> 26:00.520
When you sit still but the commies come to your door if you hold your breath and relax, they can't see you

26:00.520 --> 26:04.500
I just kick why do you also have to have blue ribbons and swimming?

26:04.500 --> 26:09.920
What is it always gonna be every time there's a new he's like a Stevie P's in high school

26:09.920 --> 26:13.840
He's like he I was there I did all of the stuff is the best at everything everything

26:13.840 --> 26:19.240
And not all of it can be true, but that's close enough to like I could believe that sure

26:19.240 --> 26:20.600
I don't have any problem with that

26:20.600 --> 26:25.080
I just have a problem with this is yet another in the long list of things where he tosses off

26:25.080 --> 26:31.320
You know, I won all the I won all the awards when I was there. Anyways, I won the title for most specialist boy

26:31.320 --> 26:34.560
Yeah, exactly. It's like Jesus. Come on, buddy. Yeah, come on

26:35.440 --> 26:40.240
Yeah, so that that's an incoherent message that he's sending his audience there because at the end of it I

26:40.920 --> 26:47.900
Feel like he'd negated a lot of the ideas that you'd want to be sending when you tell people you're in a riptide relax

26:47.900 --> 26:49.900
We're gonna get out the other side of this

26:51.040 --> 26:56.760
Yeah, I feel like he's telling you to fight that riptide no, no, no see cuz he said relax first

26:56.760 --> 27:01.680
Yeah, it's it's like I said, it's incoherent. I don't know these clauses are dependent on each other

27:01.680 --> 27:07.000
So first get the riptide and then die. So what do you know about Pablo Escobar?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.240
Not

27:10.240 --> 27:15.680
Did you not watch Narcos? I did not watch Narcos. They knew to die. Yeah, I think he was man had elephants

27:15.680 --> 27:17.680
I know that he was in the movie blow

27:17.680 --> 27:26.400
He was featured as a character in the movie blow all-time great mustache, I believe. Yeah all-time great. Sure. Yeah Pee-wee Herman was also there

27:26.440 --> 27:28.440
Yes, of course. Yeah

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
all-time great mustache by the way, I

27:32.400 --> 27:37.640
Learned from listening to this and not only did he have elephants he also had hippos. Ooh, and

27:38.760 --> 27:41.760
Dangerous. Yes, Alex goes on a very long

27:41.760 --> 27:48.240
a ramble about the dangers of hippos. He was voted best hippo in high school. Best hippo wrangler. Exactly

27:48.240 --> 27:51.440
I used to do I was like a matador but for hippos

27:53.320 --> 27:56.840
So Pablo Escobar had these hippos and they got you know

27:56.840 --> 28:01.400
Now they've bred and now hippos are somewhere where they shouldn't be sure sure

28:02.200 --> 28:04.960
And so now people want to cull them. Mm-hmm

28:04.960 --> 28:10.360
This leads Alex to saying that there may be some good arguments for human culling cool

28:10.360 --> 28:14.960
And I would like to remind you he is a noted eugenics disliker this guy

28:16.080 --> 28:21.040
Theoretically Pablo Escobar down in South America got what was it for hippos?

28:21.800 --> 28:23.800
Something like 40 years ago

28:24.280 --> 28:26.280
back in the 80s

28:26.640 --> 28:32.000
Back when I was a little kid and now reportedly there's just thousands of these hippos running around and by the way

28:32.000 --> 28:36.400
We didn't know the hippos the most deadly animal in the world. It'll kill an elephant and killed a lion

28:36.400 --> 28:41.240
It'll kill a grizzly bear. There's nothing more powerful than on land than a hippopotamus

28:41.880 --> 28:45.400
Everything runs in fear of the 20-foot crocodiles run in fear

28:45.400 --> 28:52.040
You watch videos of a hippo just grabbing a 20-foot crocodile just throwing it around like it's a it's a it's a toothpick

28:53.240 --> 28:59.920
Okay, there's the most know that so now all over where Pablo lived. There's this giant hippopotamus is everywhere

28:59.920 --> 29:06.400
And so now they want to call them now

29:06.640 --> 29:10.520
They want to call the hippopotamuses

29:12.640 --> 29:17.760
And I'm like, yeah, they don't come from there yeah, they're killing everything okay kill them but see I'm a human being

29:17.760 --> 29:19.760
I don't need to be called

29:21.000 --> 29:27.720
But see the globalist they say Jones you notice you're telling people this and they don't care that's because they're not conscious

29:27.720 --> 29:34.120
They're just eating food and their genetics are bad and they're breeding and we need to get rid of them and we're not racist

29:34.120 --> 29:37.920
We're gonna kill the dumb black people the dumb white people the dumb Hispanics the dumb Asians

29:38.520 --> 29:40.720
And that itself's playing God is evil

29:41.240 --> 29:44.520
And I don't support that that's the problem. There's an argument there

29:45.080 --> 29:48.920
But then you say the globalists they're into Satanism. They're into playing God

29:49.000 --> 29:54.840
Their real documents are they want to overwrite everything and not save the earth and believe they're gonna just be able to make all the planets

29:54.840 --> 29:56.840
They want once they become AI

29:56.840 --> 29:59.640
artificially intelligent singularity godlike

30:00.480 --> 30:02.480
And they're just in a mad race

30:02.520 --> 30:07.280
Sacrificing the earth as a testing ground to this ascension

30:07.480 --> 30:08.960
So that's a lot of nonsense

30:08.960 --> 30:14.320
But yeah, I just find it really interesting whenever Alex has these like hypothetical conversations with globalists

30:14.320 --> 30:16.400
And he's like, oh, there's an argument to be made

30:17.000 --> 30:21.620
Off the dumb. Listen. Listen, I'm not saying it's a bad idea in

30:21.620 --> 30:28.660
That's very weird. In practice it can go wrong. Yeah. Yeah, I would say that if your branding is the such

30:29.140 --> 30:35.780
That Alex puts forth should never say that there's a there's an argument to be made. It's not eugenics if it's dumb people

30:35.780 --> 30:37.780
That's not a race

30:38.220 --> 30:42.100
Sure, it's never been used in a way that's not racist

30:43.180 --> 30:44.300
Sure

30:44.300 --> 30:50.900
There's a track record of some people maybe using this for their own racist purposes. Oh, hey Alex

30:50.900 --> 30:54.100
You know how you see some people as dumb, huh? I

30:55.140 --> 30:57.140
Just think about that

30:57.780 --> 31:03.460
Hmm is he thinking that it's playing God because God had already done the Noah thing

31:03.460 --> 31:07.980
I don't know maybe so he's so he's almost a little mad at God. He was like, what are you doing?

31:07.980 --> 31:11.380
You should have just got rid of the dumb ones, right? We could have had plenty of fun

31:11.380 --> 31:17.460
Yeah, shouldn't let the dumb dumbs on the boat and then you put all those goddamn hippos on the boat. They're everywhere now

31:17.460 --> 31:19.860
We're calling them classic mistake classic God

31:19.860 --> 31:25.900
Um, so Alex is not afraid of anything probably he's a strong strong boy

31:26.140 --> 31:32.540
Who's only slightly afraid of riptides afraid of shadow gate? Well, he's afraid of his former employees probably

31:33.340 --> 31:38.780
So people ask how I'm doing. I am totally committed. I have no fear. I've gone away past everything

31:38.780 --> 31:40.740
I'm not worried even about my family

31:40.740 --> 31:41.700
I love my family

31:41.700 --> 31:45.160
But I've just had turned over to God because the enemy's done horrible things to my family

31:45.340 --> 31:48.860
Horrible things to me behind the scenes that you even know about and I've just said hey, it's okay

31:48.860 --> 31:51.580
It's God's plan. I'm not mad at God. I appreciate it. I

31:52.380 --> 31:57.980
Understand because my children don't have a future. Anyways, if we don't beat this you don't either none of us. It's okay

32:01.100 --> 32:02.460
And you watch

32:02.460 --> 32:06.860
That first lawyer that got up and groveled like a dog with his tail between his legs

32:06.980 --> 32:11.620
That rolled over and pissed all over itself and just oh, you're so powerful Schumer. I love you, sir

32:11.620 --> 32:15.420
Oh, you're so much better than us great job with your presentation on Trump

32:15.420 --> 32:23.180
He was just shaking because there's not men in this country. I told you Trump was surrounded by a bunch of damn cowards

32:24.300 --> 32:30.740
Not by invincible fat deep s you talked about the dimensions and chess quite a bit

32:30.740 --> 32:32.740
Yeah, don't fucking pretend. Yeah

32:33.460 --> 32:39.420
That transition was as jarring as it seemed it felt so yeah, it felt felt a little bit a little weird

32:39.420 --> 32:45.900
Yeah, it took a turn. Yeah, Alex is now mad at these lawyers being soft, right? Right? Yeah

32:46.460 --> 32:53.260
Yeah, I think everybody pretty universally agreed that Kester did a real shit job. Not great lawyers

32:53.460 --> 32:58.060
so Alex kind of is a little bit like touch-and-go on the

32:58.780 --> 33:04.180
On the impeachment trial yells about the lawyer being weak a little bit, but then doesn't doesn't spend too much time

33:04.180 --> 33:10.180
Talking about it. Yeah, I kind of halfway assumed that today we would be talking about a secret migrant caravan

33:10.180 --> 33:12.420
And they we wouldn't even know the impeachment happened

33:12.420 --> 33:12.580
No

33:12.580 --> 33:14.780
It's sort of dancing around a little bit, you know

33:14.780 --> 33:20.860
Like side issues to the impeachment like for instance the fact that Democrats all have Chinese spy hand

33:21.780 --> 33:25.980
In their office that sounds right now. Not only that they all have Chinese spy

33:26.660 --> 33:28.060
handlers

33:28.060 --> 33:34.180
Nobody knows what the name of the Chinese spy agency is called. Okay

33:34.700 --> 33:36.980
most of Democrats are Chinese spy

33:37.620 --> 33:39.500
handlers of Chinese

33:39.500 --> 33:45.380
Intelligence so secret the name of Chinese intelligence is not even known but I know its name

33:46.100 --> 33:48.100
What is it?

33:49.340 --> 33:53.780
And you all know its name what is it because everything hides in plain view

33:53.780 --> 33:57.780
Like what?

34:02.020 --> 34:04.020
America is the red white and blue

34:04.620 --> 34:06.620
China is the red dragon a

34:07.140 --> 34:08.700
What?

34:08.700 --> 34:10.700
What's the name of the snake?

34:11.340 --> 34:13.340
the old serpent

34:14.180 --> 34:16.020
Diablo

34:16.020 --> 34:18.020
the devil

34:18.020 --> 34:22.020
So let's talk about some positive news

34:27.060 --> 34:31.420
We're just doing word association game, that's all we're doing who would have thought the

34:33.700 --> 34:36.580
It's actually the the Ministry of State Security, but yeah

34:36.580 --> 34:45.660
Oh Diablo he couldn't come up with old scratch there. I think he was probably pretty pissed in the moment

34:47.020 --> 34:53.700
Snake come on bad scratch is way better. Dude. Anyway, Alex is thinking about the devil and so sure

34:54.460 --> 34:57.820
This clip is actually just titled. This show is stupid

34:58.820 --> 35:02.580
They want you by increment to get caught by this and to be too late

35:02.580 --> 35:08.260
You've got the whole blueprint folks the blueprint for global enslavement the blueprint for global extermination

35:08.260 --> 35:13.860
You have the enemy operation you have it in Revelation. You have it in Daniel. You have it in Ezekiel

35:13.860 --> 35:15.900
You have it all around you you have it in your soul

35:15.900 --> 35:17.980
all you've got to do is

35:18.300 --> 35:23.860
Decide that you don't want to be part of it and make the metaphysical decision to cut yourself off from Satan

35:23.940 --> 35:28.420
Then God will extricate you out of that you need God to do it

35:28.420 --> 35:35.660
But God says you've got to let me in and I come knocking. I come knocking. Let me in let me in

35:36.500 --> 35:38.500
But you've got to open the door

35:39.020 --> 35:45.300
because God is it like Satan that rams down the door and lies to you from the time you're a child to steal your

35:46.140 --> 35:52.740
Essence to steal your will to steal your ability to interface with God and your free will

35:52.740 --> 36:01.220
God doesn't touch that. Satan's all about encasing you from birth in a matrix so he can fool your soul

36:01.220 --> 36:04.100
This is the only way he can win because he's not a god

36:05.100 --> 36:08.580
He's a fraud. Wait, can he win? He's a liar

36:09.660 --> 36:11.340
He's a devil

36:11.340 --> 36:17.860
Not so impactful to yell that the devil is a devil. Yeah, not he's he's a he's a devil

36:17.860 --> 36:23.820
Yeah, that should come with a more upwards inflection that passion seemed so fake to me

36:23.820 --> 36:28.180
Yeah, it was just it just so boring and then cookie cutter

36:28.740 --> 36:30.580
Anyway, one thing that's very exciting

36:30.580 --> 36:36.100
Maybe another bright spot is that my cat has jumped into my lap and is insisting on being very affectionate right now

36:36.100 --> 36:38.100
Well a car horn just went off a few times

36:39.820 --> 36:41.820
Little guest appearance there on the mic

36:41.820 --> 36:43.820
There it is. Get off my lap

36:43.820 --> 36:45.820
Get kick on

36:46.580 --> 36:52.380
I guess she probably, you know Selene probably heard some devil talk. Yeah, I gotta get in on this. Gotta protect him

36:52.380 --> 36:57.980
Yeah, so actually she was trying to delay the inevitable and that is that I need to tell you about a couple guests

36:57.980 --> 36:59.740
That we have on this show. No

36:59.740 --> 37:03.300
They just got kicked off Twitter. Okay. It's Jim and

37:05.020 --> 37:08.020
Jim's brother, Hoft. I can't remember his brother's name

37:08.020 --> 37:15.500
Jim Hoft and Joe Hoft maybe? Something like that. Yeah, they're the brothers Hoft. The brothers Hoft

37:15.500 --> 37:20.660
I like that. Yeah, the Gateway Pundit dudes. They got kicked off Twitter. And so they come on to complain

37:21.260 --> 37:26.220
About that and I don't care. Yeah, we don't want to listen to an hour of whining

37:27.220 --> 37:33.140
No, not really. But you know, Jim Hoft his main point seems to be that

37:33.140 --> 37:37.700
You know, like this isn't a cult of personality about Trump, okay

37:37.700 --> 37:43.040
You know, we're not gonna have another candidate like that for a while. Donald Trump was, you know, once in a lifetime

37:43.420 --> 37:51.340
candidate so these Republicans better wake up and I think it's also imperative that a lot of these rhinos get replaced by

37:51.540 --> 37:53.540
other pro-Trump

37:54.380 --> 37:56.780
Populist candidates in the next primary

37:57.260 --> 38:00.540
We have to get rid of some of this dead weight in the Republican Party

38:00.540 --> 38:04.580
If you don't want to sound crazy, I would recommend you not say

38:05.260 --> 38:10.340
Whether or not a candidate in a future election is pro the president who is no longer in office

38:10.340 --> 38:17.300
Yeah, I would say that that is a real designation of a crazy person. It's not a cult of personality Dan

38:17.300 --> 38:21.500
I just want everyone to agree that a single person is the

38:21.780 --> 38:25.100
Greatest human being that ever lived and we should do whatever he says

38:25.100 --> 38:31.520
Yeah, if you were running a Democratic candidate and they were like, this is the pro-obama candidate

38:31.520 --> 38:37.300
Mm-hmm. I would look at that. It also as weird. Yeah, very weird. Yeah, very comfortable strange

38:38.100 --> 38:42.660
So Alex's is you know, he's talking about how like, you know, the they've they've

38:43.380 --> 38:48.560
Stolen the election, you know, they steal the election sure and then we know that they've stolen the election

38:48.560 --> 38:55.500
So that makes us not vote and that makes it easier for them to steal and then it goes out to break with something really

38:55.500 --> 39:00.140
Upsetting in blue states and blue cities people get to knowing that once they take over

39:00.140 --> 39:05.100
It's permanent. Then we stop voting then it makes it easier for them to cover up the fraud. Say hi to your brother

39:05.100 --> 39:09.980
Let's talk. Look, let's talk about how we still get people to vote even though we know it's a fraud

39:10.260 --> 39:12.980
Should we keep voting when we come back or what is our recourse?

39:12.980 --> 39:17.580
Is it the cartridge box? I hope not. You cannot hide a grand assault

39:18.460 --> 39:23.540
We'll get to that in a second. Okay. Um, yeah, is it the cartridge box? Yeah, I hope not. Mm-hmm

39:24.060 --> 39:28.620
Gross, so you heard that at the end you can't hide and the assault. Yeah

39:29.340 --> 39:35.300
Alex's commercial here is a little weird. I'm now back to listen. Well, it started off great

39:35.300 --> 39:38.240
I'm listening to this episode on the GCN feeds

39:38.240 --> 39:43.920
Mm-hmm. So this is a commercial that would have been played out on the radio, right? And I will tell you it is a very

39:44.520 --> 39:50.880
Different tone. Oh, then the commercials and reads that we've heard Alex give on our recent episodes

39:51.040 --> 39:58.180
It's a little bit. It's a little bit more fucked up. It also sounds like he's jacking it. Yeah. Okay. All right, please

39:58.880 --> 40:05.240
Listener discretion advised he sounds we may be tubening by proxy. So creepy

40:05.240 --> 40:08.620
You cannot hide a grand assault

40:10.180 --> 40:13.340
America is about to have its energy cut off its borders destroyed

40:13.940 --> 40:18.640
It's dollar brought down to nothing all of you that have served Satan

40:19.300 --> 40:21.300
Believe that you are the right team

40:21.740 --> 40:23.820
You're about to find out how pathetic you are

40:24.700 --> 40:28.980
So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God

40:29.820 --> 40:31.820
Stop living in fear

40:31.820 --> 40:36.260
The enemy is about to expose itself. The enemy can't help itself

40:36.900 --> 40:39.940
The enemy comes to kill steal and destroy

40:40.940 --> 40:45.260
We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it

40:45.260 --> 40:48.760
We should but once it comes through once it hits us

40:49.220 --> 40:55.440
Once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us. Jesus. We just have to point out we tried to stop us

40:55.440 --> 41:03.200
This is on the radio pair yourselves America. You're going under judgment. Just like all the children that were aborted. This is the truth

41:03.640 --> 41:05.640
This is the info war

41:07.640 --> 41:15.480
Wow quite a bumper. Hey Alex, uh, it sounds like your voice is a little bit scratchily or there than usual

41:15.480 --> 41:21.280
You realize we're cutting promos today. Yeah, I forgot and I smoked an entire pack of cigarettes about 20 minutes ago

41:21.520 --> 41:23.520
I'm three quarters drunk

41:23.520 --> 41:30.120
I'm jacking off. I'm hiding from my wife. I am recording this under a blanket

41:34.200 --> 41:36.200
No, I'm not going to bed yet

41:36.320 --> 41:40.280
That's supposed to be like a billion-dollar operation. That sounded like shit. Yeah, that was garbage

41:40.280 --> 41:43.880
I think I think one of the things that's going on is I think he was probably fucked up

41:43.880 --> 41:47.080
But yeah, he's also like trying to really do that movie. Yeah

41:47.080 --> 41:56.600
Yeah, he's trying to do that really dramatic voice. Yeah to because I think that this is tailored more towards a

41:57.000 --> 42:04.240
Possibly random person. Yeah, that could be listening on the radio right to really pique their interest to be like, what is this?

42:04.480 --> 42:08.880
This is exciting, but he missed the mark though. Oh sounds creepy

42:08.880 --> 42:15.860
I heard that and I thought ooh, I need to know more but you compare that to the meandering random bullshit

42:15.860 --> 42:22.160
That's on the like actual infowars feed because he knows that that's targeting his audience. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's pretty clear

42:22.160 --> 42:25.880
I just think that the it's really funny that this is what he thinks goes to the like

42:27.560 --> 42:34.400
It's amazing that he can fail in multiple ways. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's remarkable. It is it is, you know

42:34.400 --> 42:36.380
I like to imagine that

42:36.380 --> 42:40.920
You know, I'm not I if I failed in a different arena, I would be aware of it

42:40.920 --> 42:44.800
I wouldn't just be like yeah, I killed it. I can do literally anything

42:44.800 --> 42:48.560
It Wow, it's done who gives a shit. Yeah, right

42:48.560 --> 42:52.640
So this is a good strategy for Alex to try and get new listeners in

42:53.000 --> 42:59.040
Just do these creepy jack-off commercials about the end of America Alex. This sounds really creepy

42:59.040 --> 43:02.880
I only do one day. Yeah, you're not paying me for two

43:03.520 --> 43:05.400
So that's a good strategy

43:05.400 --> 43:11.360
Another good strategy might be a Paul Paul Joseph Watson my oldest friend

43:11.360 --> 43:15.520
Yeah, why don't you promote my shit? Maybe I'm not mad about it

43:16.200 --> 43:20.640
Please remember everything the enemy does is about shutting us down. That's why we built Bandai video

43:20.640 --> 43:24.800
So we updated info Wars calm news Wars calm Paul's got his summit dot news

43:24.800 --> 43:28.720
But she promote us more on there, but whatever still love Paul not mad about it

43:31.640 --> 43:36.440
I was thinking about it. Like yeah, what isn't it for Paul to promote it for Wars zero reason

43:36.440 --> 43:41.640
It's really in his best interest to play down as far away from info Wars as possible

43:41.640 --> 43:47.660
There's nothing else that he can get out of it other than like not making Alex mad

43:47.720 --> 43:54.140
Yeah, that's the only thing that he has to worry about. He's gotten as much publicity as could come out of info Wars

43:54.140 --> 43:56.140
Well, that's why the arguably bigger

43:56.480 --> 44:01.300
That's why the band on the Titanic kept playing is because they didn't want the captain to be angry

44:01.300 --> 44:06.420
So they were like, well, I guess this is where we die. I don't want to piss that guy off. Yeah, it

44:06.940 --> 44:11.140
Only hurts Paul to remind people that he worked at info Wars for 20 years

44:12.340 --> 44:15.780
Yeah, if I were him, I would do the exact same thing. Goodbye

44:16.380 --> 44:19.180
So Alex is mad about Trump's lawyer being polite

44:20.260 --> 44:26.900
For the most part, I mean incompetent too, but Alex seems more mad that he's polite. Yeah about his presentation

44:26.900 --> 44:31.900
Yeah, you know they're in the chambers bordering on obsequious. Sure

44:31.900 --> 44:37.380
Yeah, but there's there's a certain there's a certain decorum that comes along. Sure. Sure congressional speech

44:37.660 --> 44:40.540
There's the pageantry of being in the Senate halls

44:40.660 --> 44:47.560
That was literally just stormed you refer to people as the the gentleman or the lady from New Hampshire, whatever the fuck

44:48.540 --> 44:51.980
Alex is mad about that. Mm-hmm. I just wanna play a few clothes from yesterday

44:51.980 --> 44:57.500
We got some of the new stuff today coming up as well just to show you with enemies like this

44:59.940 --> 45:05.620
Well, imagine what your real enemies are like Oh what nailed it that's the old saying with friends like this who needs enemies

45:06.380 --> 45:09.660
So when you look at just this this this foppish

45:11.580 --> 45:13.500
Creaming

45:13.500 --> 45:18.900
just classic BS artists a lawyer in there in gray shading himself and

45:18.900 --> 45:22.760
and groveling to Chuckie Schumer when all Schumer takes out his weakness and

45:23.580 --> 45:28.920
Congratulating him and and just all of this and then saying this will turn around and bite you later if you do it

45:28.940 --> 45:35.100
Yeah, they're tyrants. They don't care about chivalry. He's just mad. There's not a lot of analysis at all

45:35.100 --> 45:37.580
Yeah, and I think the big thing that he's mad about

45:38.220 --> 45:43.060
in terms of the conversation that happens throughout the impeachment stuff is that

45:43.860 --> 45:46.300
like the defense is not

45:46.300 --> 45:53.000
Arguing that Trump won the election. No, they're taking as granted that Biden won

45:53.000 --> 45:56.220
yeah, and Alex is pretty mad about that because

45:58.020 --> 46:04.500
That's the only thing you could really get people like distracted by yeah that stupid argument

46:04.500 --> 46:08.700
Yeah that you can't but the reason they're not doing that is because that doesn't belong in court that belongs on

46:09.020 --> 46:11.020
Infowars and right-wing media out

46:11.020 --> 46:18.380
But yeah, he's he's a little bit upset that that world isn't being like taken over by his right his shit, right?

46:18.380 --> 46:20.380
I mean it is maybe

46:20.460 --> 46:22.460
Maybe it's their best defense

46:22.860 --> 46:26.540
Honestly after after looking at the the opening arguments

46:26.540 --> 46:32.820
Maybe their best defense would be like we're putting this whole thing on trial actually Trump is president

46:32.820 --> 46:34.260
That's why it's fine

46:34.260 --> 46:40.580
That everybody did this and you're all the ones who should be impeached if you want to gum up the works and possibly create

46:40.580 --> 46:47.900
New problems for yourself. Yeah, I I think Caster's already gone far enough. He might as well jump off the the edge

46:47.900 --> 46:53.540
Yeah, I I mean look if you want it to be interesting. Yeah, probably that's the way to go

46:53.540 --> 46:57.460
But it would be a disgrace. Yep. It wouldn't work probably not

46:57.980 --> 47:01.860
Yeah, I think that Alex has gotten a little bit used to the last, you know

47:01.860 --> 47:09.380
Four years five years of like politics descending to his level right and this is a concrete instance of it not

47:09.380 --> 47:13.940
Yeah, and that probably would be pretty frustrating and then at the same time you have, you know

47:13.940 --> 47:15.700
Biden's comments of you know

47:15.700 --> 47:22.220
Like the Senate has an important role to to play and to do their job trying to stay above the fray and trying to keep

47:22.220 --> 47:24.180
himself

47:24.180 --> 47:27.500
Removed from the process sure and that's got to really piss off

47:29.100 --> 47:31.100
Yeah, I would imagine so

47:31.500 --> 47:36.060
So he does the only thing that he knows how to do and that is talk to a comedian. Oh

47:36.060 --> 47:42.700
Boy, he has comedian. Let's see if you know who this guy is. Oh, no, I can't give you any clues though

47:42.700 --> 47:47.460
Okay, if you ever heard of Dave Landau, uh, I mean I have heard of

47:48.100 --> 47:53.420
I've heard the name before it's funny cuz on band.video the like the segment that he's on

47:53.420 --> 47:59.400
I believe it refers to him as a top comedian. Ooh, that's not good. Usually means they're not

47:59.980 --> 48:01.980
He apparently hosts

48:01.980 --> 48:09.020
Or co-hosts with Anthony Kumiya, Anthony Kumiya's new show. Okay, or whatever show the fuck he's doing

48:09.020 --> 48:13.300
Oh, man, I'm shocked that I didn't get a call to co-host on that one, too

48:13.300 --> 48:18.100
I feel like I'm the I'm the guy for that. Are you comparing me to Anthony Kumiya?

48:18.620 --> 48:20.460
Because you better not be

48:20.460 --> 48:22.940
I'll take that is quite quite an insult

48:24.060 --> 48:31.340
So yeah, Dave Dave Landau is on and I think he tries to make a few jokes and how's it go? Not great

48:31.340 --> 48:34.300
Yeah, Alex is not a good scene partner. No as we know

48:34.740 --> 48:40.460
I only have one clip here cuz I don't care about what Dave Landau has to say about cancel culture. Oh, yeah

48:40.940 --> 48:45.580
No, no, no, no. I don't particularly care about his perspective on the

48:46.100 --> 48:51.020
Impeachment because it's not interesting right and then anything that he has to say about cancel culture

48:51.020 --> 48:55.220
I'm like you fucking co-host a show with Anthony Kumiya who gives a yeah, I gotta go

48:55.220 --> 49:00.920
I have very few very little interest in what any white comedian has to say about cancel culture strike one

49:00.920 --> 49:08.200
You host a show with Anthony Kumiya strike two. You're on info wars strike three. You said this on info wars

49:08.740 --> 49:11.260
It's not even so much taking that big of a stand

49:11.260 --> 49:13.940
It's just telling people not to be completely blind

49:13.940 --> 49:20.180
And I think the only thing that most people are really saying is that this is gonna end in some kind of bloody civil war

49:20.180 --> 49:23.940
And the way that it's starting to look I can see that I can see their point

49:24.100 --> 49:29.440
But I just think if people just calm down and stop turning on mainstream media

49:29.440 --> 49:32.960
Which I just can't imagine what it's like to sit in your house all day long

49:33.440 --> 49:40.440
Stare at the television and have fear pumped into you. Yeah, totally unlike the show. You're on that would be terrifying

49:41.440 --> 49:47.800
What kind of monster would force people to watch four straight hours of fear mongering? Yeah, I

49:48.680 --> 49:50.680
feel like you really

49:50.880 --> 49:55.600
Look like like a real ding-dong when you say something like that on info wars

49:55.600 --> 50:03.360
Yeah, cuz that either means that you accepted a booking on a platform as maligned and notorious as in fours without having it

50:03.360 --> 50:05.360
done any due diligence about

50:05.400 --> 50:11.660
The place you're on or somehow you don't see what Alex does as rank fear monger. No, that's not rank

50:12.660 --> 50:17.200
People up screaming about the fucking devil. It's it's really simple what he's doing

50:17.200 --> 50:22.380
He's just asking people not to be blind and that's all he's doing. It's the mainstream media

50:22.380 --> 50:26.660
That's pumping fear into your blood all the time by reporting news

50:27.480 --> 50:33.840
Hmm, I would say that anybody who works for any kind of mainstream media outlet if they behaved in any kind of way

50:33.920 --> 50:38.120
Close to like what Alex does they might be in jail. Yeah. Yeah

50:38.560 --> 50:43.140
It at least would be sued over and over and over they'd be they'd be fired

50:43.480 --> 50:49.040
Mm-hmm. It's just it's wildly irresponsible or they would be Brett Stevens. That's also a possibility possible

50:49.040 --> 50:56.160
Yeah, that leads me to believe that maybe this Dave Landau guy is not incredibly sincere

50:56.160 --> 51:00.200
I would maybe a little bit disingenuous with his his perspective. Mm-hmm

51:00.200 --> 51:07.200
So that ends the 10th the 10th was the brothers hoffed. Yep weird comedian

51:07.200 --> 51:14.240
Yep, surface level fairly certain that one of the big deals of stuff is happening right now on the 10th

51:14.240 --> 51:18.800
Yeah, you mean the impeachment? Yeah, well, I feel like that's important

51:18.800 --> 51:24.640
Yeah, but a lot of that's a lot of the hearings on the 10th were happening after Alex was on it. That's true

51:24.640 --> 51:29.260
That's true. You're right the some of the stuff he had he didn't have any way of knowing

51:29.400 --> 51:32.320
Got until the next day the 11th when he's on air

51:32.840 --> 51:37.700
And he's still a little surface level. I'll be honest. He's not

51:37.700 --> 51:43.960
He's not covering it nearly as much. I mean because from Alex's perspective that makes sense

51:44.300 --> 51:49.460
The election was stolen according to Alex. Yeah, this is all bullshit. It's all imaginary

51:49.460 --> 51:53.420
Yeah, so why engage with the substance of the thing if the thing?

51:55.100 --> 51:58.780
That kind of seems to be where he's at explain to me how

51:59.260 --> 52:05.380
Alex seems to have a more cogent position on what he imagines is imaginary and how much we should talk about it

52:05.380 --> 52:07.380
Then the rest of us do

52:07.380 --> 52:08.620
I

52:08.620 --> 52:13.180
Won't okay. So he starts off on the 11th talking about Bill Gates

52:13.780 --> 52:17.300
because of course this is the most important news of the

52:18.420 --> 52:25.820
Our lifetimes it is official what Bill Gates called for on Bill Moyers and what he called for Ted Talks

52:26.220 --> 52:30.040
And when he called for on CNN, we have three clips of it in the last few years

52:32.220 --> 52:34.220
Calling for

52:34.220 --> 52:36.140
The

52:36.140 --> 52:43.060
Euthanasia of old people because we quote can't pay for the aging population in Europe the United States Australia, Canada, New Zealand

52:44.260 --> 52:46.260
And he says so you kill a teacher

52:46.300 --> 52:51.820
Then you can or excuse me you you you you kill an old person and you can hire ten teachers

52:51.820 --> 52:53.460
And that's not how it really works

52:53.460 --> 52:59.020
But they put that you kill ten teachers and you fish for a life job the moral thing to do

52:59.020 --> 53:02.140
And and and so the reports are pouring in

53:02.140 --> 53:07.700
Every day five died here four died here three died here ten died here seven died here

53:08.180 --> 53:10.020
And it's only in the nursing homes

53:10.540 --> 53:14.220
where the employees notice all of the death and

53:15.020 --> 53:17.020
Say something

53:17.140 --> 53:20.060
Most these places know to keep it quiet and say they died of something else

53:20.060 --> 53:25.180
But in many of the cases I'm gonna read to you from the CDC's own website

53:25.180 --> 53:31.020
Oh, they even have a record of this some of them die within 15 minutes

53:31.020 --> 53:32.660
15 minutes

53:32.660 --> 53:36.940
So Alex is claiming that someone died 15 minutes after getting a kovat 19 vaccine

53:36.940 --> 53:41.660
And then he presents that as evidence that the two are causally connected sure that's the level of work

53:41.660 --> 53:47.020
He does he just associates two things and insists that he is then proven that they're connected when he's done

53:47.020 --> 53:52.740
No such thing Alex could legit show me a news story about someone dying as they're getting vaccinated

53:52.740 --> 53:56.420
And it still doesn't prove the claim that the vaccines related to that person's death

53:56.420 --> 54:03.380
There's an unfortunate reality here, and that is that Alex either doesn't understand that dynamic of reality

54:03.380 --> 54:09.740
Or he understands all too. Well. How easy it is to trick people into thinking that correlation proves causation

54:09.740 --> 54:12.780
Yeah, I think the latter is probably more likely yeah

54:13.220 --> 54:17.080
But also Bill Gates wasn't advocating killing old people as he could hire teachers

54:17.140 --> 54:22.260
It's easy to misconstrue his words that way, but the conversation he was having that Alex always takes out of content

54:22.260 --> 54:27.660
Our context is about exorbitant medical costs, and what can be done about that right?

54:27.660 --> 54:30.900
Which is a thing that literally most of the world is?

54:31.700 --> 54:38.340
Dealing with right now as population explodes like it's not unique to anywhere. It's like oh shit

54:38.860 --> 54:42.500
What are we gonna do those fucking baby boomers wrecked us?

54:43.620 --> 54:44.620
it's

54:44.620 --> 54:49.760
it's easy to look at that conversation that Bill Gates has had in these public forums as

54:49.760 --> 54:54.500
Being like well mathematically if we just kill all the old people we can

54:54.880 --> 55:02.160
Hire and that's not that's not the the conversation, but that would be a facetious argument that I would make in a

55:03.000 --> 55:08.520
Debate where somebody's like oh well old people are trying about like then let's kill all of the old people

55:08.520 --> 55:13.640
I bet you could sarcastically make that argument. Yeah against Alex and win. Yeah a debate

55:13.640 --> 55:18.000
Yeah, totally he is he's got a lot of nothing actually that's a really good idea

55:18.000 --> 55:24.520
So Alex is now more mad at Trump's lawyers. This is intentional. They're fucking setting them up

55:25.720 --> 55:27.720
officially we now know

55:27.720 --> 55:33.360
That the lawyers that Trump hired because the first groups were bad the second group was bad the third group was bad

55:33.480 --> 55:39.280
Have all either sued him or Democrats that hate him and say that Trump's a criminal and they're actually sabotaging him

55:39.840 --> 55:44.120
Publicly saying he deserves to be kicked out of office and that voters were smart and voted him out

55:44.120 --> 55:48.880
So instead of putting on evidence of election fraud the lawyers are all slipping in by the way

55:49.080 --> 55:51.360
The Americans are smart. They kick Trump out

55:53.680 --> 55:55.880
Trump's getting sandbagged. Yep. Yep

55:56.360 --> 56:00.480
When when that lawyer was saying that he was trying to get the shit thrown out

56:00.480 --> 56:05.840
Yeah, and he said that you know, like hey, there's another president and it seems like the process has worked fine

56:05.840 --> 56:10.280
Yeah, elections are how we solve problems like corrupt dictators

56:10.280 --> 56:14.960
Historically you have an election. Let's not do this

56:16.160 --> 56:21.760
If the goal is winning the case that is maybe a decent argument to try

56:23.880 --> 56:28.400
Anyway if we didn't have any precedent for it if this was the first time if this was like

56:29.240 --> 56:34.240
1810 and we were having one of these and people were having that argument. I'd be like, I don't know

56:34.240 --> 56:41.320
Have we ever tried this before? Maybe give it a shot. So look, this is about the January 6th

56:41.320 --> 56:45.640
This was about the storming of the Capitol. This impeachment trial is about that

56:45.640 --> 56:52.280
It's easy to lose sight of that from time to time. Sure. Because of nefarious shitheads who, you know, make stuff up and whatever

56:52.320 --> 56:57.880
but look that was not cool that happening because

56:57.880 --> 57:06.680
Provocateurs did it to make Alex look bad because people who are in the same communities as Alex or appear to be are being violent

57:06.680 --> 57:10.360
Right. Now at the same time violence is cool, too

57:10.360 --> 57:16.800
Look, we are well past the point of being able to righteously use violence against these institutions and organizations

57:18.120 --> 57:21.440
But having a few Democrats and a few infiltrator groups

57:21.920 --> 57:27.160
Trigger out of hundreds of thousands of peaceful people in DC a few hundred to go in the Capitol so you can be called

57:27.160 --> 57:31.560
Insurrectionist terrorist is not the place of the time for it. Okay

57:33.640 --> 57:39.560
Coherent messaging. No, I think that one is actually really coherent. We should absolutely storm the Capitol

57:39.560 --> 57:41.000
This was bad planning

57:41.000 --> 57:48.440
They tricked us into not storming the Capitol on the 20th when we would have all been able to actually kill everybody

57:48.440 --> 57:53.680
Maybe I think he's essentially saying that it wasn't the right time to fire the shot heard round the world

57:53.680 --> 58:01.080
Yeah, yeah, I guess so. But the reason it's incoherent is because I don't think he wants to take responsibility for that

58:02.160 --> 58:07.560
Cut and dry message. Yeah, that's why it's incoherent. Yeah, that is the what's behind

58:07.840 --> 58:15.020
Well, yeah violence is obviously justified that this was this was a misstep. Yeah, that's why I blame it on agitators

58:15.880 --> 58:19.480
They tricked us into shooting before we were ready to shoot

58:19.480 --> 58:27.080
So in that case, I'm pretty sure he's saying that well, yeah, obviously we wanted to kill everybody and overthrow the country

58:27.080 --> 58:31.160
Well, we just wanted to do it at the right time. So we would win. Yeah, of course

58:31.160 --> 58:33.160
I mean Alex even gets into his blood loss. Sure

58:33.160 --> 58:38.160
I was in a halfway decent mood today and but I was already aware of the euthanasia of the old

58:38.520 --> 58:43.840
And how would I come on air and give it the gravitas it needs so we don't all just get conditioned to accepting this

58:44.040 --> 58:48.120
Five years ago. I was reading the statistics of the numbers and just going through the stacks

58:48.120 --> 58:49.600
and

58:49.600 --> 58:51.600
I physically

58:52.080 --> 58:57.720
Became nauseous. No, you didn't because my nervous system was telling me you

58:58.880 --> 59:03.000
Need to go visit violence upon the people that are doing this

59:03.280 --> 59:08.720
If you let them kill old people like this and kill babies already born and they admit they're doing it

59:08.720 --> 59:12.280
You are an accomplice. My very cells are telling me

59:12.280 --> 59:17.640
Defend these people. So for all of you out there that are mad at me because I'm saying let's not be violent

59:17.640 --> 59:18.640
Let's not be offensive

59:18.640 --> 59:26.120
I understand your guts and your blood and your soul and your mind is burning with the desire to kill

59:26.120 --> 59:28.120
Pull up, pull up

59:30.120 --> 59:36.440
I want to stop these people just as much as you do, but we've got to be wise as serpents and peaceful as doves

59:37.080 --> 59:39.080
and walk

59:39.080 --> 59:44.920
Gently but carry a big stick. I don't think you pulled it off. What was that?

59:46.640 --> 59:53.640
I'm gonna end with two cliches because I realized that I just basically told everybody that it's fine to kill and that I want to

59:53.640 --> 59:54.440
too

59:54.440 --> 59:58.280
So you got to walk softly and carry a big stick Dan

59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.240
I feel like Alex might not be lying about reading Infowars comments because that sounds like him

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.260
Responding to a lot of feedback of people who are like Alex you're soft. Let's just go kill him

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:15.040
Let's just go kill him. Yeah, I think that Alex that's Alex trying to like have an olive branch to the yeah the murderous audience

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:22.760
Yeah, and also do you know who else anthropomorphizes their murderous intentions? Who's that? Uh serial killers. Mm-hmm

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.960
Look, he wants to kill. Sure. And he understands that the audience wants to kill and they're connected on this

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.920
I feel like there's a problem there. But you got to be wise as a serpent

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:39.920
I feel like there's a problem there too. It doesn't get better.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:46.380
I just want everybody to know the left and Apple and Facebook and Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg and

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.320
Jack Dorsey, you know what you're doing and you are just as guilty as Bill Gates

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.560
Especially Mark Zuckerberg who works directly under him

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.640
He's the next guy in line for to be science officer of North America

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.880
For the new world order and you guys are mass murdering killers

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:09.280
And I know who you are. Everybody knows who you are and you will pay for what you've done murderers. I

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.280
Don't care what you do to me. You are you you are guilty

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.040
Everybody else is scared to call your asses out

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.280
So I'll just tell everybody I

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.600
Was on the other day and I said it was a civil war starts don't go after the cops and military

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.640
That's a diversionary tactic to wipe them out for the Chinese to have a civil war don't have the civil war

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.640
It's why they've had the lockdowns black lives matter

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.760
Antifa try to provocateur us is to get a civil war where we all kill each other. We don't want a civil war

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.000
We want a removal of the globalist and their collaborators

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:50.880
Yikes, you just named a number of people what we want to do is remove these people that I have pointed out

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:57.960
For you guilty of murder and I have specifically said that violence and everything is okay because they're murderers

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.080
So and we're well past the point of being able to write

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.580
Way back now granted the storming of the Capitol was bad planning

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:10.940
But what would be good planning is how he's clearly implying what would be good planning

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:14.760
What are you guys doing storming the Capitol with only a few hundred people?

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.900
You can't win what you should be doing targeted

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:23.940
Assassinations, you know, it's stupid, you know, it's unfortunate to like Mark Zuckerberg is one of the people that's on Alex's list

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:30.500
Yeah, but Alex constantly calls him Jeff Zuckerberg. Yeah. Yeah, like there might be a Jeff Zuckerberg out there who he's targeted

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:36.860
He's because Alex can't remember dude's name. Oh, man. He wields too much power and is too dumb to handle it

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:44.260
Yeah, so this is really irresponsible and I think you could make a pretty good argument that you know using shifty language Alex is

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:48.740
Probably telling his audience that should maybe kill my enemies

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.820
I think one of the things about the evidence in the

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:59.540
impeachment trial that I've noticed was how many times that they did a really good job of avoiding allowing that kind of clause

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:07.720
To like excuse any behavior, you know, like so often they had they played Trump's words and you're you're literally like

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.180
Yeah, we all know he said peacefully

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:18.540
Mm-hmm. Yeah, we should we should all protest peacefully and then they're like, yeah, but we've got 300 examples of him saying otherwise

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:26.000
Yeah, so you can't pull that bullshit. This is a pattern behavior like Alex Jones is essentially on trial in the same way

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.740
Well, I mean in our show in some ways is a on

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.660
rigorous

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.660
Completely without legal backing. Yeah

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.380
And I would say he's guilty

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:43.900
It's just that there is not a specific crime yet, right?

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:52.060
It's just the behavior that would lead to that. Just thank God people have not carried out his his his clear

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.840
man, yeah

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.800
So yeah, he's mad about this trial because these these these lawyers are throwing the case, man

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.620
Here's another question are Trump's lawyers

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.520
Taking the impeachment trial on purpose. I don't know or are they just shitty folks. Everybody knows these lawyers

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.960
These are very competent lawyers

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.080
They are sabotaging Trump because they've been told to they wouldn't have had a trial unless it was rigged

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:20.900
That's why his lawyers are like Trump actually lost the election and you've done a great job and you proved he's bad

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.900
He's actually you prove he's guilty

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.060
Because it's a bunch of cowards

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:33.160
The globalists are making their move all these so-called men are a bunch of pinstripe wearing

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:40.320
knuckle-dragging dirty stupid crooks that have screwed this country over and sold it out to China and

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.880
You've got a consortium of dirtbag lawyers and a consortium of pedophile leftist

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.460
Bunch of nasty hunchback globalist that just absolutely gonna mount this country's head on a wall. I'll tell you why

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.980
I'll tell you why because they hate themselves and they're going down

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:04.880
Hollywood's going down all the leftist cities are going down and that's because they're run by the same slave master Satan and now they want

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.880
To just drag us down with them. Whoo

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.120
Well, how's he gonna explain it when Trump gets acquitted like

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:19.800
Like it really is gonna be difficult to explain for a lot of people. Yeah beyond saying these guys

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.520
We're just gonna quit no matter what why why if Trump gets acquitted then why?

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:30.580
I like how are you going to rationalize his lawyers are in on it. They're throwing it

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.700
They wouldn't have it a trial if it wasn't rigged. Oh, it's rigged to a quit

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.700
Yeah, the fuck are you talking about? This makes no sense

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:43.220
he's not rambling and you could tell the real dead giveaway that he's probably just

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.660
Fucking coked out of his mind and rambling about nothing is you get to the Satan at the end. Oh, of course

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:56.360
Then that always comes back to you know, why I'll tell you. Oh, yeah, that's that's a real four in the morning party

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.360
I want to leave kind of moment. Yep

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.480
Anyway, Alex gets to talk about these vaccines

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:07.980
Did you know that there's thousands dead already from the kovat 19 vaccine feel like I would have heard it if there were no

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.420
They're keeping it on the low. Oh, that's smart of them

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.420
One of the things that I think is interesting about this which is first of all, it's not true

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:18.420
Second is that if Alex believes that then he has to believe that there's

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:23.860
About as many deaths from the vaccine as there is from kovat. Yeah, that's outrageous

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.260
They estimate that one out of ten conservatively

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:33.340
Of adverse reactions gets reported a lot of daughters will tell you it's about one out of a hundred probably really

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:39.540
I mean how many times you take something of an adverse reaction and you call the CDC and then tell them?

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.020
okay, so

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:47.580
Thousands of dead people so far from the Pfizer mRNA vaccine thousands

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:53.140
You count Europe the US Australia. I think Pfizer could sue him. I think so, too. Yeah

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:58.420
Yeah, also, he's just making up numbers at the beginning totally and also you don't call the CDC

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:03.220
Your doctor ends up calling the CDC to report adverse. Yeah, that's why you go to the doctor

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:08.020
Yeah, if you have an adverse reaction to something you will go seek treatment and then they will yeah, they'll be like

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:13.420
Oh, we got a report this it's our job. Yeah, it would be a really inefficient system to force everyone to be like

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.700
Hello CDC

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.700
What frustrates me a lot about Alex's narratives regarding this type of stuff?

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:23.260
Is that yeah, man, people have already thought of those as problems

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.580
They happened a long time ago and people were like, oh, let's not do that

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:33.940
Like the reason we have the reporting system is precisely because you wouldn't call the CDC

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:38.880
Yeah, you wouldn't do that. So the doctor does it for you now the issue that

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.140
Where you could get to Alex may be having a kernel of truth

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:48.360
Although he's still making stuff up is that like if you have a headache that could be an adverse reaction

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:53.420
Yeah, and you might not report that right, but it would be something so trivial that you don't seek help with it

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.580
And you might not even know if it's related, right?

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.340
So yeah

01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:02.820
Maybe one in ten if you count like minor nonsense that maybe you maybe my back hurts

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:07.580
Yeah, slight dizziness is off a headache or yeah, or I got up too quick

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:14.060
But but what he's saying is just a load of shit. Yeah, and I honestly think that some of the stuff that he's saying

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:17.540
Has a real potential for public health

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.740
Problems and then you look at what else it does. Holy mackerel

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:29.460
When you come across a COVID virus the most common in the world coronavirus in the future

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:35.820
Most people will have a violent autoimmune reaction and they're gonna call that COVID

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:42.340
2022 probably be the name. I think about 2022. They'll hit us with it. Maybe sooner. Hell maybe next month

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.700
And it'll be everybody dying. Oh

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.260
By the way, that's what I didn't tell you

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:55.980
Most of these old people that died they said it already tested positive for COVID obviously most that's fraud

01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.860
But that's the thing. They also said that that's what Wolfgang would are

01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:03.060
Another scientist said they said if you've already had a similar COVID

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.780
Virus or a coronavirus the same family or COVID-19 the vaccine may cause an autoimmune response and kill you

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:14.700
Or make you very sick or later. It'll cause the autoimmune response when you come in contact with one

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.660
I mean, this is a death sentence total death sentence

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:24.020
And they're just people to be dying all around you. It'll just be Bill Gates up there smiling like a psychotic at you

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:28.900
I mean, they're never gonna get away with this never they're crazy

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.980
But Hitler didn't get away with it either, but he wanted to kill everybody

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:38.420
Yeah, that's uh, that's deeply deeply irresponsible, yeah

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.460
Yeah, this is this is fuck

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.160
Yeah

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:48.660
Like this is the level of thinking that this is is which level like this is like a pure

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:55.140
We've never advanced beyond thinking that the person with two cats is actually behind illness

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:59.420
Yep, that's where we're at. That's where Alex's brain is at. How is developmentally?

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:06.100
How is it that we can develop a vaccine for a brand new virus in less than a year?

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:09.700
Yeah, and at the same time we have people who are like nah, nah, nah, nah

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:14.040
See if you're physically unattractive chances are you're the one killing everybody

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:21.640
Yeah, and I read I read a little bit about some of the folks who have died after getting the vaccine and some of them

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.400
did test positive for COVID and with the belief that they

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.000
people who were writing about this had were that

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.720
They had gotten the vaccine when they had already been infected

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:39.080
It was in the incubation period right and then the vaccine wouldn't be effective right at that point. It's too late

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:47.080
yeah, and you know you're talking about high-risk communities and people who are prioritized for getting the vaccines and

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:54.080
You know that doesn't it's not even that high of a number either like it's it's not in the thousands like Alex is saying

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.520
But but either way like this this kind of misinformation it stands to really

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:06.260
Persuade people to have either a belief or an inclination to not disbelieve

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:13.220
That this shot is a death sentence. Yeah, and that can be really really dangerous. Yeah, it's hard even to imagine like

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.940
Okay, it's not the best

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:23.980
Vaccine and it does have some of my adverse reactions, but it's gonna save a million lives

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:30.780
You know like or like that kind of level of thing where it's like yeah, that's worth it

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:38.580
Yeah, half a million people are dead man. Yeah, Alex does the straw man shit all the time of like everybody pretends

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:43.780
The vaccines are totally safe and like there's never been a bad reaction like no no one says that

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:49.700
That's a fake argument that you're making in order to to to straw man, and yep

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:54.240
Yeah, it's just it's it's childish, and I wish that people

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:59.760
Would treat him and his arguments with the disdain that they deserve yeah

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.960
Um so Alex gets to talking about Bitcoin

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.220
Of course yes of course because Elon Musk

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.600
It was just on Rogan apparently again, and maybe he is into Bitcoin now sure

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:19.200
He also has a guy named bit boy on as a guest later. I'm a motherfucking bit boy

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.600
the weekend

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.600
You want to laugh, but you can't

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:30.400
That was that look oh, I can't laugh at this it's a cuz it's wrong

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.080
Dan I'm well past the point of righteous violets that was going through

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:42.560
Anyway, this guy is just a youtuber who's into Bitcoin sure to currencies sure his interview is not interesting

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.920
I'm surprised youtubers are always fascinating

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.000
I bet he actually has some interesting things to say and I don't get it

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.840
I didn't get any sense of like you know him being a bigot, but I don't know sure

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.400
He just was talking about crypto currencies

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.000
Anyway, Alex is against them, but then he interviews this guy

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.980
In a pretty positive. This is very confusing gotcha, and there is a global government openly

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:13.140
Announcing itself and they need to end the dollar as the world reserve currency and bring in the new global digital currency

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.140
Which will be based on Bitcoin?

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.840
Which again is obviously a giant inside job from the beginning just like you and I told you that ten years ago

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:26.200
And now you can see it, so why are you having a long interview with a guy? Who's into Bitcoin? Who's giving a really positive?

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:33.680
Perspective it's very confusing. Yeah, also Alex hasn't been super negative about Bitcoin

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.960
It's much more complicated than that yeah

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.560
Yeah, he hasn't been a promoter of it

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.780
But if he actually thought it was something that was meant to replace the dollar as part of the globalist plan

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.280
He wouldn't have had Max Kaiser on for the last ten years on his show to constantly promote it

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.720
Yeah, that would be an issue. Yeah, he wouldn't

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.040
His behavior would be totally different, and that's the same actually as with Q

01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.480
Yeah

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.760
If Alex actually thought that there wasn't some thing in it for him to not fully denounce

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.640
X Y or Z whether it's QAnon or Bitcoin sure his behavior would be totally different

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.600
He thought that there was an angle yeah, he could play some sort of hedge in the middle

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:21.040
Yeah, and then once that was clearly not the case. Oh, I've known this was a setup all along right bullshit. Yeah

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.520
yeah, his

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:31.500
His pattern of like denouncing something softly and gently, but then having pro guests on it for an

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.020
eternity is

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:41.280
Clear evidence of some sort of like issue he has with I can't piss someone off

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.720
There's always someone that can't be pissed off in these situations

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:50.240
Or or just like gather might be might be worthwhile to not alienate this

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:56.000
Yeah, maybe maybe down the road QAnon becomes something that is profitable for me

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.920
So let's keep that lane open until it's too late sure and then I can always have been against it with with the

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.660
Bitcoin it could have collapsed left people

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:12.260
I with nothing sure could have been something that everyone hates and then Alex it'd be great for him to be able to say I've

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:15.860
Been against the whole time right right right, but maybe it's a cool thing

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.860
And then I could be like I've had max Kaiser promoting it on my show for ten years

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:24.000
I'm an old-school Bitcoin guy sure you know if you play both sides, and then you look like a prophet

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.060
Yeah, yeah, but you're not you're just dumb dumb. Yeah, anyway

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.620
Trump is on trial because

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:37.620
He said some things sure that's people did some things sure and hey what about Kamala Harris

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.180
She said some things who hasn't said things

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.820
here is

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:46.400
Kamala Harris cackling like the witch she is

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.980
Talking about killing Trump will she be

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:57.420
Impeached here it is if you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump Mike Pence or Jeff Sessions who would it be?

01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:59.420
Just

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.860
One of us have to come out alive

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:19.300
You know what people think I was overdoing it play it again. She can hear the actual cackle

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.340
I mean, I hear they're coming out with a new Wizard of Oz she's got the job as the wicked witch here

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:29.820
It is a possible interpretation of that joke is that she would kill herself before going in an elevator with one of them

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:33.580
Yeah, so I don't know. I think this is a little bit thin

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:38.860
You think also the laughter and crowd applause?

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:46.820
Indicates that this is a different setting maybe maybe I I would argue that there is a different contextual

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:55.300
interpretation of someone saying a joke on the Ellen show and someone saying that you should kill one's political enemies in a

01:16:55.300 --> 01:17:00.500
Rally after having said that killing them is fine for a long time. I would be dealing with this situation

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:06.820
Entirely differently if Ellen DeGeneres killed Jeff Sessions in an elephant. I would be furious

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:10.400
I would say that Kamala Harris was very irresponsible

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:16.520
a generous killed Jeff Sessions in an elevator then we would be I mean

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:22.800
How could you not that yeah, then she should be impeached? Yeah, I mean, it's still hard not to add the context of

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.220
the cop was killed and to

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.840
Yeah, so in terms of the the impeachment stuff from the the day before on the 10th

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:40.560
Um, Alex doesn't deal with much of the let's say previously unreleased videos

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.920
There are real problems over their issues. Well, I mean they certainly contradict his narrative quite a bit

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.540
it's particular again resonating the

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:57.800
People chanting hang Mike Pence and like people wandering through the halls yelling for Nancy Pelosi

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:04.000
The just the person the first person going through the window wearing full tactical gear

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.780
Confederate flags following along. Yeah, I

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.840
Think that everybody has different images. That'll probably stick with them

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.920
that chanting was one that was really really tough for me and particularly because you know, I

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.080
Spent so much time with Alex's rhetoric and his narratives and like how directly counter

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.360
This reality is to the game that he's spinning totally. So he just pretends a lot of that didn't happen

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.360
Yeah, sure, but this Raskin guy, right the lead

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:36.580
Counsel, yeah

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.680
He I know that from watching the impeachment not from earlier before that

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.880
Said some things that Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article about that. Alex is pissed about

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:52.980
Oh now, let's start getting to it the slimiest rat-like creature

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:57.980
I've seen in a while. Jamie Raskin is when the leader of the persecution

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:06.020
He said that Trump impaled police and stabbed them to death on the 6th and then on the 6th Trump supporters burned

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.180
down a church

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:13.620
Well, it's funny because that church is the one that BLM firebombed that church

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:19.700
Ladies and gentlemen is the church that Trump wouldn't visited with the Bible

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:26.820
Why would you tell such a gigantic lie out in the open?

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:32.580
Why would you say that St. John's Church was burned by Trump supporters? He didn't

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.540
Well, that would be an issue. That's like saying

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.700
That Abraham Lincoln killed Abraham Lincoln

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:46.380
No, John Wilkes Booth did I mean, it's just it's just a it's like saying my background. My background is red

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.940
You're like no your background is green today

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:56.700
What I mean you might as well just get up there and say the sky is red at high noon in Texas

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.900
But again, why does he do that? Because he's a lying criminal

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:05.820
Everything comes out of his fat mouth so loud. I put out all these fake videos everything else and then his fake crying

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.700
He couldn't get an acting part in a third party

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:15.740
I couldn't get an acting part in a third-grader play with that kind of projection. Man, the master of similes, Alex Jones

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.900
Projection. Yeah. Wild. Yeah, outrageous. Yeah, so

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.500
Raskin didn't say that people were stabbed on January 6th

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:29.500
He was clearly talking about people who were using flag poles as a weapon against Capitol Police because that's a super resonant image

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:33.980
The idea that they're the Capitol Police and they're being attacked by something that has the flag on it. Sure

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:38.940
It is hard to avoid. Yeah, if we're taking things super strictly literally then yes

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.020
No one was run through with a pole

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.260
But that kind of gives you a sense of the difficulty that Alex and his ilk have spinning this stuff

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:50.960
The previously unreleased video, like I said of the storming really disprove a lot of Alex's narratives

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.900
And you know, you really just don't want to deal with that stuff

01:20:54.060 --> 01:21:01.180
So you retreat to dumb semantics arguments that mean nothing to pretend that that's the entire argument against Trump and it's all a lie

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:06.860
No one was impaled. No one was impaled by a javelin thrown from 40 feet away

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:13.820
We were slamming the cops head in a door. Come on. Get it right. As for the church burning Alex is playing dumb

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:20.700
Raskin said quote that's before the second million maga march a rally that ended in serious violence and even the burning of a church

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:23.340
This sentence doesn't say who burned a church

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:30.140
But Alex and Paul Joseph Watson who wrote the article that Alex is covering are pretending that it's making an accusatory claim

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:37.100
The essence of what Raskin is saying is that Trump has a pattern of inciting events that lead to violence, which isn't really debatable

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:40.060
So Alex and Paul have created this fake claim to respond to

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:44.140
They're also pretending that Raskin must be talking about the burning of the St.

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.060
John's church, which was the church that Trump did his photo op in back in May

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:52.940
The person or persons responsible for that fire are still unknown

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.780
So Alex can't actually prove that anyone from one of his villain groups did it

01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:02.380
Sure, but he's just decided to report as if that is the case. Yeah, as long as it's unknown. That's fine for him. Sure

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.700
Raskin could have spoken more clearly

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:10.220
But what he was talking about was the proud boys vandalizing the Asbury United Methodist Church and burning banners

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.620
They've stolen from the church that said Black Lives Matter

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:19.260
This is a secondary instance of Alex creating a fake thing to argue against and he knows exactly what Raskin is talking about

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:25.180
The guy who took credit for burning that church's sign has been a guest on Alex's show and the night of January 5th

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:30.860
Alex's employee Owen Schroyer recorded himself burning a Black Lives Matter flag in D.C. Yeah, there's that one

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.100
Yeah, come on grow up asshole. No shit

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:39.900
Anyway, what's really funny about this is with that lead-up that Alex has, he didn't actually watch this clip

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:43.020
Oh, that's a problem. And you can kinda tell at the end because

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:48.380
In the lead-up to this he's saying that Raskin claimed that

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.620
There was all this on January 6th. Totally. Whoops

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:55.340
And just listen to this BS

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:02.140
And that's before the second million mega march a rally that ended in serious violence

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.860
And even the burning of a church

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.420
And as the president forecast it was only the beginning

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.060
on December 19th

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:16.140
18 days before January 6th. He told his base about where the battle would be that they would fight next

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:23.500
January 6th would be wild, he promised. Be there, we'll be wild, said the president of the United States of America

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.460
And that too turned out to be true

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:34.220
You'll see in the days that followed, Donald Trump continued to aggressively promote January 6th to his followers

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:39.740
Okay, so he's saying that the march that we coordinated that was peaceful

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:46.300
That happened in December, was the June 1st BLM event that burned the church

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.300
Did he say that?

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.300
It's like six months apart

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.300
Is that why you didn't say that?

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:56.300
And it's a public event that happened. Trump went and visited it. So what does this guy do? He inverts it

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:04.300
So you can hear him kind of re-spinning in real time because he realizes that the clip doesn't say what he had already prefaced it to say

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.300
And you can hear it very clearly

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.900
You can hear it very clearly. Oh, okay, okay

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:18.940
All right, see now what he's saying is something different from what I said he would say and uh

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.620
So he's uh

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:31.180
Liar! So whose fault do you think it is that Trump has bad lawyers?

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:39.180
Ooh, I let's see would it be the entire legal profession thinking that his case is both nonsensical and unwinnable or

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:47.980
Him? Try again. Oh specific person. Oh, Nancy Pelosi? Nope. Oh, here's Bruce Castor. Let's play clip three

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:55.260
Trump's a so-called lawyer who it turns out has sued Trump before. Oh, yeah, Trump didn't know that. This is people they give him and

01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:02.780
And this other guy called he called him another one lawyers called Trump a crook just three months ago and said he's a horrible person

01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.780
And that's his lawyer. That's who Trump gets

01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:09.340
He can say well Trump's an idiot. Yeah, I don't even know how to use Google, but my god

01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.340
He better search, but see it's all

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.260
It's all the son-in-law

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:18.940
Man, Trump is under the spell of that Kushner. Okay. All right. It's Kushner. Yeah, okay

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:27.020
Wow, all right a lot of buck stops there kind of show the secret leader of the deep state has been Kushner the entire time

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:32.460
I think Pachannik has said that maybe yeah, I think this is a relatively Shakespearean tale

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:36.740
Of a son-in-law betraying his father

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:41.960
I would love to just be able to be like my dream job if I could have it

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:47.980
Would be to be a person who hacks in to Alex's earpiece

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:49.980
and

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:55.420
I could just respond like from Fletch to I've never seen Fletch to but

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.620
Alex has an earpiece in that the producers talk to him

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:05.500
Yeah, and just to be able to hack in and respond in real time would be so great because I just hear that as we boo

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.340
Well, you're saying that the bad lawyers who

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:16.300
He hired a lawyer who sued him in the past and he didn't know about that and this is Kushner's you could absolutely

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:18.300
absolutely convince him

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:22.380
Absolutely convince him that that is an anthropomorphized voice in his head. Oh, yeah

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:27.580
There is no doubt in my mind that he would have that like Alex. Oh, I got my self doubt in my ear again

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:30.860
I'm your conscience and that was bad. That was dumb

01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:35.580
Isn't this guy supposed to be king shit hero guy and he?

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:40.860
Hired a lawyer who sued him because his son-in-law tricked him. Yeah. Yeah. Yep

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:47.580
This is this is stuff that even this is the man. I want leading the country. Yeah, so

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:55.460
Alex, like I said, there's not there's not as much about the impeachment as as maybe would be

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.200
Interesting or seems should be merited by yeah this

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.460
show

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.780
But he spends quite a while talking to bit boy. Sure. He's a motherfucking bit boy. Yeah

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:11.140
We have two clips left. Okay, cuz I'm not talking about bit boy. No, I'm good

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.700
We have two clips and I want to ask you if you'd rather go culture war or gossip first

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.420
whoo, I feel like

01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:27.580
Culture war is going to be more offensive and yet somehow I feel like gossip also might wind up with some really fucked up shit

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:32.700
So let's go with culture war. Okay Disney. All right. See I knew it

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.700
Um

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:38.820
Disney has fired Gina Carano. Ah

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:46.700
So from the Mandalorian so a man who is absolutely not a fan of Star Wars absolutely not

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:55.180
Appreciative of Star Wars at all. It's very angry about one particular character being removed from the Mandalorian. I didn't know that

01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:58.940
If I were Disney, I would blame her for Grogu

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:05.260
On her way out. Yeah on the way out she'd be like toss all of our baggage onto her. What else do we got?

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.100
Let's get all of it. Yeah

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.780
Everyone else everyone be mad at her for all of this shit

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:15.400
So in reality, what happened was that she had some social media posts

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:23.540
Including a particularly offensive one where she compared being Republican to being a Jew in the Holocaust

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.540
I

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:31.860
People didn't care much for that. No, and she was out

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:39.020
Alex may not quite understand why she got fired. Yeah, what's crazy about it is

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.940
Disney's virtue signaling

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.540
Kicking this former MMA lady out because she looks like a big tough man

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:48.700
That's the image they want as women as you know

01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:53.540
All the leaders what now and her idiots goes back to married with children and all those shows where dad's always a moron

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.300
I mean that's come out of memos not just gamer gate today. I

01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:02.480
Want to show an emasculated society, but but even that wasn't enough for her playing the part of the big male hero

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:10.860
Pedro is the Mandalorian us trends after Star Wars cancels Gina Carano

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:17.140
And I'm not saying she's a bad actress and I'm not saying I dislike women that are strong and have that

01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.260
a

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.060
Amazon type look I think it's very attractive

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:25.240
But the point is she actually groveled in and said it was so horrible what happened the Jews

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:30.180
What she was bad what Hitler did and they called an anti-semitic Wow?

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.380
Wow

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.180
Alex may not quite get the conversation. Oh

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:43.900
Boy, Alex Alex. You might be too used to people saying worse things than that

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:46.740
Yeah, I mean like that's anti-semitic well

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:53.340
It actually does make sense cuz Alex has compared himself to a Jewish person during the Holocaust like so for him

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:55.620
Yeah, obviously yeah

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.900
That's what she's saying is like

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:05.700
Almost like he's like you're gonna fire for her for that. I have Steve be on my show all the time

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:10.380
Yeah, he's throwing anti-semitic shit out like fucking candy in a parade

01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:17.020
Yeah, it's it's interesting to me the part that I find the most interesting outside of Alex's bizarre

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:23.340
Need to have a sexual psychodrama with his audience. Yeah, I don't know why you need to do that

01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:29.000
Oh, I can't stand that they put strong female women in roles and make them look strong and powerful now

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.660
It doesn't mean I don't want to have sex with them. Hey, but now this is something you should deal with your therapist

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.860
It's not your audience

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:42.580
I absolutely have to air out this problem that I can't sublimate which is that I both attracted to strong powerful women and want them

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.300
Destroyed it's weird

01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:50.580
I wasn't quite sure where he was going as he was talking about this like what side he was gonna land on cuz he

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:56.820
Was being very weird, but then when he said she groveled and said the Holocaust was bad, which it is

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:02.500
Why did you say groveled? Well, I mean when you say the Holocaust is bad

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:09.000
Obviously you're caving to the ADL and the Ku Klux Klan. Why do I don't understand that at all?

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:14.700
Anyway, what should she have said that Hitler was a complete badass?

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:18.660
Would that have been what she should have said?

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.800
Maybe anyway now we get to gossip

01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:24.740
It is it would be kind of ridiculous

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:29.780
If the guy who said that Hitler was a complete stud and a badass was like, yeah, Gina should have been fired

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:32.780
I wish that I had a soundboard so I could just play that

01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:36.980
Yeah, all the time. I'm afraid that there may be new listeners who don't know that we had a drop

01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:40.700
That we used to play where Alex says that Hitler and Stalin are total badasses

01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.540
complete

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.900
Badasses studs. That's how we used to thank people for

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:50.200
Yeah, so we move on to gossip to close the show

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:57.160
I'll say one of the more rewarding things about listening to Alex's show is getting to find little

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:04.440
Threads that you can pull that you wouldn't you know, you'd never had like there was the story of Buckley's birthday party

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.220
Oh, sure. Yeah a couple years back the ever-growing changing story

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400
There was the Nazi hat

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.200
Sure, sure

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:22.720
There's little glimpses that you get into Alex's life. The globalist in the hot tub is always a classic Barton Springs tales

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:27.280
Oh, yeah, all the times he would go down to Barton Springs. Yes, the hike and bike trail

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:31.360
Tails of the hike and bike a lot of interesting things have happened on that trail

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:38.860
Another thing is that we know a lot about Alex's wife's tennis habits a lot more than I would have expected to learn

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.120
We know that her tennis partner I believe

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:45.280
Was scoping out antifa. Yep

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.080
Has strong ability to do some reconnaissance

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.640
She had some Intel on antiva and now we learn that

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:59.340
Maybe not all is good in the world of Alex's wife's tennis. Oh, no, maybe there are some haters

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.080
I was playing tennis

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:06.080
With these women she's down a few years and one of them walks over the real ugly look on her face

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:13.000
And I like this what's wrong just I just what's wrong is what you did at the Capitol tried to overthrow our country

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:17.080
Well, I said we were protesting the election. That was a handful. It was just oh, yeah, right

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.080
sure

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:26.800
This is this whole act of like, you know, oh gosh what you did. Oh, it's like the Democrats were just saying

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:36.040
Jamie Raskin says Trump supporters burned down the church to that BLM did publicly that quick

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:46.080
Yeah, she's getting the news that quick the turnaround is fast on that. It's quick. I

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:51.940
Mean I understand that it's most likely just a device for him to do like a character or whatever

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:58.600
But I love that there's a like an entire genre within Alex's world of like stories where he complains about the people

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.560
yeah, his wife plays tennis with yeah, he's almost doing like a

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.880
A nursery rhyme levels of explaining things in in like entail, you know

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:15.600
Like this is why we don't touch fire because there's a rabbit that goes around and it touched fire one time and you were like

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:22.000
This is bad. This is her tennis instructor was like, hey, we should listen to this guy and that's bad

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.740
See now children. Let's move on. I feel like more his

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.260
his wife's tennis

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:35.900
World is like a world that's populated by fictional characters that he just gets to cast in little plays

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:41.660
It's like a little anime. Yeah. Yeah, whenever he needs somebody to have seen antifa setting up at the grocery store

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.460
Well, it's somebody involved in my wife's tennis games

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:47.180
you need somebody to play the role of

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.660
nosy

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.700
judgmental

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:56.780
Democrat it's somebody that my wife's playing tennis with now it is strangely enough the only both

01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:59.780
a combined tennis club and private investigatory

01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:06.260
Agency on you know, it's like whenever you first saw Baskin-Robbins and a KFC in the same place

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:10.100
You're like, what are we doing here? That's the tennis club. I think you're thinking of Dunkin Donuts

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:15.420
It's all the same shit. There's never been a Taco Bell and KFC is what I meant

01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:18.340
What am I supposed to know never be a Baskin-Robbins?

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.060
It's not the same company

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:28.320
I'm talking Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. They're all young right? Right, right, right understand this and then

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.840
Duncan and Baskin-Robbins, I think

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:38.140
A lot of me mistaking this, you know, it's a meal Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut all together with good meal, but

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:42.460
Don't eat it before you go play tennis without his wife

01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:48.900
you will you will probably wind up taking a nap and missing out on some crucial information either that or you'll become a story that

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.620
Alex tells on the show

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:53.820
About somebody who ate too much shitty food before playing tennis with his wife

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.140
That's somehow illustrates how the Democrats are evil

01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.900
That's the new way to fuck with Alex Jones

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:04.300
You join his wife's tennis club and you just every now and again walk up to her with a ugly look on your face and

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.620
Just say something

01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:09.900
Reasonable. I if I had all the time in the world. Mm-hmm

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:14.060
I'd still not do that. That sounds like a real wife's time. Absolutely not

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:21.060
Anyway, Jordan we come to the end of this and I expected a little bit more fireworks, but I mean he is mad sure

01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:25.940
Don't get me wrong. He's mad sure sure, but it almost makes more sense to me

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.300
You know like you're saying this is a coherent ish response. And yeah

01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.900
like he shouldn't be

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:37.140
Like upset about the impeachment thing. He think he's supposed to think that Trump won the election. Yeah

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:40.180
No, that's why we were should be disappointed in whatever

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:44.820
Defense there is because they're not saying that Trump won the election, right?

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:50.340
Yeah, it's even better for him that they're terrible lawyers. Yeah, because then you can pretend that they're

01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:56.020
Sandbagging on purpose, of course, and then whenever they whenever Trump wins and is acquitted

01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:03.380
He's gonna be like see even in spite of the lawyers that the globalists gave him right? Yeah, he's so innocent

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:09.220
Mm-hmm. His defense was literally two men going bi POS

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.700
For four hours and he won. Yeah

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:18.620
Anyway, we'll see how this develops indeed. We will but until then Jordan we have a website. We do have a website

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.820
It's knowledgefight.com. Yep. We're also on

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:26.140
We are on Twitter. Is that an algorithm? If I go to pet Jordan? Yeah, we're also on Facebook

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:31.900
We are lazy. Will you do that downscales in that if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:35.460
We'll be back, but until then I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:40.460
I have no other place to mention this and it it seems perfect here. Danny

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:48.040
Sent me a message and Norm Pattis's beard is fucking crazy. Norm Pattis trim your goddamn beard. It is inappropriate

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.000
Anyway, Andy in Kansas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding

01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan. I love your work. I love you.
