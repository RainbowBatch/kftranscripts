00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,320
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,880
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,440
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,000
saying we are the bad guys

Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,840
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,040
I love your work

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm Jordan

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,160
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, drink novelty beverages

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,520
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,760
Oh indeed we are Dan

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,200
Jordan

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,880
Dan

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,280
Jordan

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,000
I have a quick question for you

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,520
What's up?

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,280
What's your bright spot today?

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,880
My bright spot today, Jordan, is Pannino's Pizza

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,080
Pannino's Pizza

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Okay

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,600
I used to live fairly close to them and it was sort of a

38
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,080
bit of a thing where I'd go there and get a slice

39
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,000
pretty regularly

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,440
Sure

41
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,640
Like it, good, slice

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
Good, it's good stuff

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,480
I have moved since then, I no longer live near Pannino's

44
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,600
But I did see that there was a place that will go nameless

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,240
because I don't actually remember what the name of the

46
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,320
place was, but there was a by the slice pizza place

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,680
Alright

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,760
Nearly near my house, I was walking in the terrible snow

49
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,600
Sure, sure

50
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,840
A couple days ago and I saw this and I said

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,280
It's tough to walk out there, you built up a hunger

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,320
I said I would like a slice, see this is as good as Pannino's

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,920
Right

54
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
Terrible

55
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,800
Not as good as Pannino's

56
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,080
No

57
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,120
So my bright spot is remembering how much better

58
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,800
Pannino's was

59
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,320
No, a couple days after that I ordered Pannino's

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,760
because I was pissed

61
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,080
I'll see you in hell

62
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,600
Yeah, so I ordered it and it was as good as I remember

63
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,120
Shout out

64
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
That's fantastic

65
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Congratulations to Pannino's for making good pizza

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Sure, how about you?

67
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,440
My bright spot, Dan, is I finally tried out Hades

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
Oh yeah, the video game

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,440
Fantastic

70
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,160
Really, really fun, it's nice and it's got a great

71
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,520
I like the mechanic of the like, you're supposed to die

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,960
You die and that's part of the story

73
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,320
It's that Sisyphean trapped in the sense of

74
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,480
And you get to talk to Sisyphus too

75
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,880
Yeah, exactly, it's very fun

76
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,480
It's a nice little take on mythology, I enjoy it

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
I don't know if I have made this complaint

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
but I have one complaint about the game

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,320
What's that?

80
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,960
And that is I don't think Hephaestus is in it

81
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,920
I have not seen Hephaestus yet

82
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,440
Hephaestus is the reason, Hephaestus should be making all of these buffs that you're getting

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,960
He should, he's the armor of the gods

84
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,360
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point

85
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,080
Yeah, very glaring omission

86
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,360
That is a huge one

87
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,920
Yeah, anyway that was the one thing I just thought when I was playing it

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,600
But yeah, it's a lot of fun, I'm glad you enjoyed it

89
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,160
It's a good time

90
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,360
I recommended it to another friend and she enjoyed it quite a bit as well

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah, it was delightful

92
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,240
Seems like it's a beloved game

93
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,040
It's a good game

94
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,680
Seems like all the good reviews are merited

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,240
Do you know what it makes me, it reminds me of an old, old PlayStation 1 game called Azure Dreams

96
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,280
And it was that same kind of infinite dungeon crawler that would populate a new dungeon for you every time

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:41,360
But you would capture monsters, it was like a mixture of Pokemon and that same kind of Hades dungeon crawler

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,040
That sounds fun

100
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,440
Fantastic game

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Yeah, it was that weird kind of PS1 game though where it was like, also there's a dating simulator for some reason

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,800
You know, you're like, I don't need this guys

103
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,480
I've heard the relationship system in Hades compared to that as well

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A dating simulator kind of thing

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh yeah, that's a good point

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
Because you have to give gifts to all those people

108
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,000
You do give gifts, that's right

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,520
And boost your relations

110
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,040
Yeah, and that opens up different, yeah, yeah, no, that's almost exactly what it is

111
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,600
This to Hades is a rip-off

112
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,920
They remade Azure Dreams a very weird PlayStation 1 game

113
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
But without a Pokemon

114
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,400
Yeah, that's true, you don't really

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,640
Anyway, Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over

116
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,880
We're going to be talking about Valentine's Day 2021, Blackjack

117
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,880
I was even ready for it that time, I was like so prepared

118
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,360
I was hoping I could distract you by not saying the date, the holiday

119
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,000
Talking about February 14th, Sunday, Alex has a special

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Every year he does a special Valentine's Day episode

121
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
I just love it

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,000
Well, it's a family show and you know

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm being completely facetious, this is not a special Valentine's Day show

124
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm fairly certain that I wasn't being serious about it being a family show

125
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,840
So we have some interesting fun things to talk about

126
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,480
But first let's say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

127
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,200
Oh, that's fun

128
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,320
So first, sign me up to be a globalist

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Thank you so much, you are now a Policy Wonk globalist

130

I'm a Policy Wonk

131

Next, Rand D, that's W-R-E-N

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Thank you so much, you are now a Policy Wonk

137
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm a Policy Wonk

138
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
Thanks, Ren

139
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,360
That's a great name

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,640
That's a classic, classic name

141
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,200
Also classic, Truthquark, thank you so much, you are now a Policy Wonk

142
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm a Policy Wonk

143
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
Thanks Truthquark

144
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,120
Next, Michael, thank you so much you are now a Policy Wonk

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
I'm a Policy Wonk

146
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,400
Thanks Michael

147
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,560
And finally, Bill Walton's favourite tie dye t-shirt, thank you so much you are now a Policy Wonk

148
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm a Policy Wonk

149
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,040
Thank you very much

150
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,360
Bill Walton's favourite tie dye t-shirt

151
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Now it's interesting Jordan cuz Austin right now is in the state of Texas. That's true currently it has been for a while

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,640
But right now in the state of Texas

153
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:54,000
They're experiencing an incredible ice storm, and I hope everybody you know all of our listeners in that part of the world are staying safe

154
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,760
It ain't no joke yeah from what I understand. It's not for you guys. We're we're meant for that

155
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,040
That's where we're that's what we're for even us. That'd be a challenge. Oh, yeah, it's not fun. No

156
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,560
um and and so Alex decided who cares I'm coming into the

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,160
So he does come in for a Sunday show on Valentine's Day when he could have very easily done it remotely

158
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Not done the show no problem Harrison Smith ramble about white genocide everybody been fine

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,320
Yeah, so here's an out-of-context drop from today's show

160
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,160
So here's the video the granny being thrown off the cliff

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,760
Okay, okay, all right glad all right glad you came into work. I I assume that wasn't a Walker, Texas

162
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,200
Ranger kind of situation here no

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,320
So Alex came in and he starts off the show as anyone would try if they had just come in to work

164
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,600
Through driving through chaos, and that is complaining about driving

165
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,560
This has got to be an incredible show today because I've grown up

166
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Born in Texas

167
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,200
And I've grown up in people not being able to drive with ice on the roads cuz it only happens a few times a year

168
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,880
But I've never seen anything like this. This was road warrior level. I probably saw a

169
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,600
Hundred wrecked cars on the way here smash signs glass

170
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,160
Firefighters trying to block major roads

171
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,320
I wouldn't even be here if I hadn't just gone ahead and gone around them because I was driving my wife's all-wheel vehicle

172
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,760
I was driving my wife's all-wheel vehicle my favorite thing about

173
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,360
I need more explanation for how he went around him if his next line is with an all-wheel drive vehicle

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,320
We'll get to it. Okay. Let's talk more about that

175
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, um, but I do love the idea that he's starting off the show with like this better be a fucking great

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,560
Road warrior, it's gotta be worth it. Yeah, so you you're asking about this this car situation

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, little did you know he would just talk more about well and this basically turns into a car commercial sure

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,320
Oh

179
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,120
I tried to leave the house in my a truck and it was not four-wheel drive and that that truck isn't and I had to turn

180
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Around go back. I got her car

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,160
That's the only good thing that German car is good for but she wanted an Audi and man

182
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,320
I was just going cuz I live in West like up these big hills. Everybody else is wrecked

183
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,640
I mean just wreck I saw 300 wreck cars not a hundred it was

184
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,920
And I'm just like going I mean I'm not trying to an Audi commercial here ladies and gentlemen, but my lord that vehicle is incredible

185
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,480
And there are all these other four-wheel drive cars just wrecked everywhere Range Rovers are all-wheel drive

186
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,480
They were wrecked Subarus wrecked everywhere that Audi was like I was just a robot on rails through black ice

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
20 miles the office unbelievable

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,600
But a lot of people died in Texas, it's really sad Jesus Christ tonal shift Wow

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
That sounds sincere. Yeah

190
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,800
A lot of people died Audi's great, but a lot of people died because they didn't buy an Audi

191
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,680
I'm not making a car commercial

192
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,720
But if you don't buy an Audi you're gonna die about a minute of rambling about a great his wife's car is yeah

193
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,920
We leading into going out to break reminding you that there are have been fatalities and there have that's that's fucked up

194
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,720
Yeah, it's it's a little uncouth. Yeah, it makes me feel bad for making fun of something. That's awful that he did

195
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Yeah, and now I feel like

196
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,200
One degree removed from being an awful person. I think that's what we do though. We live in that shame

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,660
Yeah, that's fair so I wanted to cover this episode number one cuz it's Valentine's Day number two because

198
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,940
This is the point at which Alex would know that Trump had been acquitted

199
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,340
Yes

200
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,340
He did his he did a special report on Saturday

201
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,660
Which I tried to watch a bit of but it was mostly him talking about vaccines and I got really bored

202
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,780
She wanted to hear about his take on the yeah

203
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,540
He had said it was a setup

204
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,940
He said this was this whole trial was a sham and it was all just set up to get Trump

205
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,260
So now what happens whenever it worked out the way that we all knew it was going to well

206
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,940
I think Alex has a I mean, it's bullshit, but he has actually a pretty decent spin. I think all right

207
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,980
We have the insane trial of the president that they suddenly ended ish you had three days Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

208
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,740
Ten hours a day of total lies against the president 30 hours of garbage

209
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,960
Three hours by his lawyers doing half a decent job

210
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm gonna kill Trump the vice president. We're gonna burn everything down and they had to put their tail between their legs and drop it

211
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,880
Because it was another giant fraud. Yeah, so I mean that's that's not a terrible spin of like AI

212
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,080
They showed all these videos of Democrats saying things and then sure sure he had to quit him

213
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,280
Yeah, it's having a conversation about like they weren't gonna I mean they weren't going to vote in

214
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:46,080
a convicted and the fact that what how many Republicans voted with the Democrats

215
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,960
Seven, I believe more than one is a crazy number. Yeah. Yeah, like that's it. That was a pretty high one of them was

216
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,840
Directly going to be murdered. So there's that I would I would assume he would be a guaranteed. Yeah vote to come Romney's a lock

217
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm just saying that if you're going to be murdered, like I assume if Mike Pence was in the Senate

218
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
He would be like, yeah, I'm gonna have to

219
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,540
No hanging for me, you know, like that kind of feel. Mm-hmm. I prefer not to acquit this

220
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,620
Yeah, and Alex doesn't want to talk about like things like McConnell's comments about

221
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,380
Totally is it was his fault, but we have a constitutional

222
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,460
Yeah, cuz that that just that gets too messy that's so stupid

223
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:33,800
Yeah, I I feel like you should know you should be embarrassed if you even try and say they did a half good job

224
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:41,120
Van der Veen, you should be embarrassed. That was really really shameful stuff. It was yeah, although

225
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,900
You know, we learned a little bit about what happens in Philly. That's true. He did learn a lot about Philly little Philly Delfia

226
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,240
Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed that the portion that you and I watched

227
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,520
He was talking about Philly and then a different point. He said Philly Delfia

228
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,280
Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, that's good stuff. Yep. That's good stuff

229
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,960
so when you're you know, a radio show host and you come in on the Valentine's Day Eve through a

230
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,600
Movie like storm sure. Yes a perfect storm. Yes, you got it. You got a

231
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,240
Cover the important stuff, right? You got to take care of the really important business this Audi

232
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,760
We've got a lot. We've got Saturday Night Live is on a jag. They're on a roll

233
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,080
more jokes about pedophilia not existing and

234
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
more attacks about children being abused

235
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,440
Ritualistically because I can tell you a large part of the writing staff are pedophiles and our devil worshippers Wow

236
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm gonna I'm gonna have to send a couple of texts

237
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
I

238
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,300
Heard some disturbing news Alex Jones is informed me

239
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,020
That is a bit a bit much

240
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,120
So what's going on? Is that the last two weeks there have been QAnon jokes on

241
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,920
night live sure sure sure the first one was about the Super Bowl commercials and

242
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
there was a

243
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,800
A commercial for QAnon where it's like Papa John's Pizza, you know, we know sex trafficking in the basement. Yeah

244
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,120
And then apparently this week Kate McKinnon did a character where she was a witch

245
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Like a QAnon witch who was really interested in eating children

246
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,880
You know, I did an interview with weekend update and Alex is like they're up there pretending. This is the news

247
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's SNL man. He's very mad. He's very mad

248
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,840
Have you ever imagined for a second?

249
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,680
What the SNL cast that we grew up with would have done if QAnon was around then there?

250
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,360
They just what is Chris Farley gonna do about QAnon? They're just not prepared for that kind of stuff

251
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,880
That's just not in the in there in their wheelhouse. Yeah, I don't want Adam Sandler doing prank QAnon fun. Never mind

252
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,840
I want Adam Sandler doing prank QAnon phone calls. Sure. Yeah, um, so that's important business

253
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,960
Sure, very important to talk about how SNL is making jokes about QAnon

254
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,680
Yeah, that Alex tries to misconstrue as them making jokes. The pedophilia doesn't exist. Yeah, good job. Yeah

255
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,000
and other

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,280
Things he does are you know kind of distasteful, too

257
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,160
I don't I don't know how to say this, but I found this really repulsive. Okay, Alex plays

258
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,240
a

259
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,480
Fight fight fight fight fight fight. Alex plays video of the pileup it

260
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,480
Outside Fort Worth. Oh that giant 100 plus car pileup

261
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,960
That's fucked he plays video that someone captured from like the other lanes

262
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,040
Yeah, and so it's just playing the entire

263
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
like

264
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,880
Collision, it's terrifying and there's no real value to it. But Alex tries to pretend that there is yeah, but I want to give you

265
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,500
Some viewer discretion when we come back. I don't show

266
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
horrible tragedies

267
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,200
To just show you a horrible tragedy because some people like a train wreck I see this I

268
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,280
Was shown this on Friday by the crew. I

269
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,640
Didn't know after 24 hours of this stuff happening up by Fort Worth in Dallas of what really happened

270
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,920
I've seen the helicopter footage of a couple hundred cars all piled up

271
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,960
We come back. I'm gonna show you what really happened

272
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,720
From someone on the ground when it happened up close

273
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,040
I've never seen anything in a Hollywood movie like this when cars are crashing and flipping and exploding

274
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,600
wait till you see on the ground the actual pileup and the reason I'm gonna play it

275
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
Will be explained when we come back

276
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,520
So viewer discretion advised because people were dying

277
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,600
seven people died on the footage you're about to see and

278
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,760
I'm showing it to save some lives and to illustrate something

279
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Okay, let's stop right there

280
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,280
We're not gonna be on air in a year and you backed us last year

281
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,280
I told you that last year you came through we made it this year a little bit in the black just don't do it

282
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,480
We'll be able to keep our projects going. You don't have to fund some other secret projects

283
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,200
We're working on gosh. I could do a lot better if I had more money. I'm not

284
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,240
I'm about to show you footage of seven people dying. Yeah. No, I need money to stay on air. Yeah

285
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,600
Yeah, this was repulsive that is fucked. I was

286
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
shocked by the

287
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,960
Sort of the gross coldness. Yeah, the cynical ness of this the like and when he was saying

288
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm gonna show you what really happened. I was like, are you trying to say there's a conspiracy here?

289
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,680
He wasn't there is no real value to this unless

290
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:59,600
He wants to turn into a road safety show sure and then it's still a little bit first of all too soon

291
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,920
I don't think you could use this footage to illuminate any particular finer points of hazardous driving

292
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,320
Yeah, it was just like there is no reason to play this other than shock value or something

293
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,720
It's it's offensive. Yeah, I mean, it's it's nakedly

294
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,100
exploitative and macabre in a way that like makes you

295
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
like

296
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,040
It's hard not to think that he gets some sort of like weird fucked up like well

297
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,880
You know that the people who watched faces of death where you're like

298
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,560
There's something that you get out of this that I'll never understand. Yeah, I just won't be there for you

299
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Yeah, you know like that kind of thing

300
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,840
Yeah, it's a deal-breaker. Yeah, it's a real big. Yeah, it's real bad

301
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,680
Yeah

302
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,800
So he said that there's a reason and it's gonna become clear next segment

303
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,020
And this next clip kind of is him expressing what that reason is

304
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,160
But I I would say one this reason is stupid. That's to say bad second

305
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:06,800
And the connection that he's trying to make you don't need to watch the video to get I'm showing you footage of Dallas

306
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Texas a live

307
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Shop there from top of one of the little tallest buildings. You can see it as a icy wasteland. No one on the streets

308
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Now if you're in Chicago or you're in New York you laugh at that you say hell we drive all the time

309
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,280
Well, we're not used to it only happens once or twice a year and hundreds of people die

310
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,120
Statewide when it unfolds and that's a teaching moment

311
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,800
Americans haven't been under a Hitler

312
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,560
They haven't been under a Stalin or a Mao or Fidel Castro or a Hugo Chavez

313
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,040
So what he's trying to illustrate with playing this video is these people in Texas aren't used to ice driving

314
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:53,100
And so there's a giant pileup much like Americans aren't used to dealing with a Hitler or a Stalin

315
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,760
Yeah, and the tyranny and therefore we're metaphorically gonna have a pileup

316
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,600
Now you don't need to watch that video to make that metaphor at all. There's absolutely no reason

317
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,680
It doesn't add to your understanding of the metaphor. Yeah, you could just say it. It doesn't matter

318
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,520
Yeah, and also what about fucking Obama? What about Bill Clinton? Nothing. They were fine

319
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,000
They weren't they were no big deal. They weren't working for the devil yet. I think they were according to him

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,160
He just didn't know wasn't comfortable enough talking about it. He didn't remember that they were also presidents

321
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,440
He was trying to pretend he was serious back then. Yeah

322
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,900
That's not good. No, I'm not like one of those people who says that everybody's the devil

323
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm not like David Icke who have become my best friend in ten years

324
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,520
anyways, we've had about four devil presidents in my time and

325
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,560
All of those we've never even had to deal with anything new like a Joe Biden, right?

326
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,640
I just think I think it was it's

327
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,980
The most tenuous connection to make in order to justify playing this video

328
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,320
Yeah, and I don't respect the decision at all. I think it's disgusting and Alex even knows that

329
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
This is on the ground in the other lane

330
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,300
Radio listeners horrible footage. You're lucky. You're not seeing this 18-wheeler 50 miles. You're lucky. You're not seeing this

331
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,600
It gets worse ones going 70 in a minute. Alex is saying you're lucky

332
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,760
You're not seeing this to the radio audience Wow, but he's playing. I know you could just not know everybody could be lucky

333
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,560
Yeah, we could all be lucky right now. Yeah, I would like to be lucky. Yeah, don't be like you don't be like you're lucky

334
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,200
You're not watching my show. You're just listening to it. Yeah, you don't have to do it. It doesn't add anything

335
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,200
It's it was just outrageous. It's cuz he wanted to watch it

336
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,700
I think I think you might be might be onto something. It has to be something with with that's personal

337
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,200
I I found I found that disgusting and

338
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,760
unacceptable

339
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,960
Much like Alex's thinking pattern. Oh, that's fair. So he has decided that

340
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,720
Thousands are dead from the vaccine already when why well for what?

341
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,400
Thousands, okay. He just says it. Okay. Well, then I guess I will move on but you got to know this

342
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:12,040
Okay, it's actually probably 50 times higher. It's probably 50 times higher and we've now confirmed it. Okay, so

343
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,100
I have a stack of news here where there are thousands of dead admitted and I think about one in 50

344
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,280
Adverse reactions gets reported. So if thousands are dead, that's 50 times bigger

345
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,560
No one knows from the vaccines

346
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,480
So can you wonder can you identify like just really quickly?

347
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,160
It's like it's on a surface level the problem with that thinking

348
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,320
No, no, I don't see any problem if

349
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,040
Some then there's probably 50 times more. That means it's proven, right?

350
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,720
Yep, this is dumb

351
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,360
I mean like if you were to live if I were listening to a professor

352
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,040
I get a school right and I was in a lecture and they said something like that

353
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,720
I would not trust them to teach the rest of the class. I might withdraw. Yeah

354
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,200
Yeah, I wouldn't be real confident in a math class where they were like, okay, what's one plus one?

355
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,160
But remember one is probably 50 or it could be more or it could be fewer

356
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,780
No one knows who knows and I might be making up the one. Guess what? That one is the devil now

357
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,160
Yikes. Yeah, not good

358
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:25,040
So that that's the kind of thinking that Alex brings to the table just making assumptions and then multiplying things by whatever numbers he chooses

359
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah, whatever he feels good about today. And then the other thing he does is just make shit up

360
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,600
Like he does about this US News and World Reports article. Let's get to the good news

361
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
first

362
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,860
Because it's very very important the McRib the Pentagon touts vaccine

363
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,420
Administration rate amid concerns of widespread refusal US News and World Report

364
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:57,060
It goes on to say that the vast majority of the troops are

365
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,620
Refusing the vaccine because it's voluntary. They try to statistical manipulation

366
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,280
They go. Oh, but we did get a certain group that would said they'd take it and out of that group

367
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
80-plus percent did take it

368
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,940
So what do you do when the vast majority won't take it 98 percent?

369
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,180
You take the group that will take it and then say oh

370
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,540
80 plus percent of them 82 percent did

371
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:30,580
82% that's the statistical game. They play Alex absolutely has not read this article about the troops and vaccinations

372
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,700
He's claiming that the article says that there's a subsection of troops 82% of whom have received the vaccine

373
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,540
That's the statistical game Alex claims

374
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,000
This article is playing

375
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,420
The stat of 82% is actually in reference to the percentage of vaccines the Pentagon has received that have been administered

376
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,300
From the article quote Pentagon spokesman

377
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:56,740
John Kirby told reporters the department has so far ordered more than 1 million doses and as of Thursday morning had received roughly

378
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
968 thousand of those

379
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:07,540
800,000 or about 82 percent have been administered almost 600,000 were first doses and more than 200,000 or second doses

380
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:13,640
So they Alex has just seen the number and made up what it means. So they took the small subset of people

381
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:21,920
Otherwise known as the people who possibly could have gotten it and they're manipulating those numbers to say that those people did get it

382
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,400
I don't and then the people outside of those numbers. Well, they didn't get it

383
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,280
No, Alex has just skimmed the article seen numbers and written a story in his head about what those numbers mean

384
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,840
Yeah, this is what he does. He's really really bad at this. Yeah, I can't believe people actually take him seriously

385
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,380
Yeah, he does. He does seem to play mad libs and then search articles for like numbers to circle and like what if I put

386
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,460
82% here. Oh, it's great too. Cuz if you watch the video, he's got like 82% underline. Of course he does

387
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,380
Yes, that's exactly what he does. He goes through articles underlies the numbers

388
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,560
Do did it?

389
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Saw the underlined 82%

390
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:06,640
He's like, I gotta figure out what I think that means. Yeah. Yeah. What could that 82% be? I can't possibly read a sentence

391
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Can't be bothered to do that kind of work. It's very hard. Yeah, as he makes up some more shit about this article

392
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,640
We just saw on US News and World Report. I mean the military these evil people

393
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
I mean you heard you can't trust them from Joe Biden

394
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,560
They said pregnant women shouldn't take it because the British military said they shouldn't

395
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,720
They were the ones that started before the US military British military said yeah pregnant women shouldn't take we had a bunch of miscarriages

396
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,080
Oh, oh, but you don't say that in US News and World Report

397
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,960
You just say the US military the rank-and-file pull that out of their ass, didn't you?

398
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,360
Pisses me off. Excuse me. The pregnancy stuff is simply covered on a past episode

399
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,180
So I don't get too bogged down in it here

400
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,960
but this is just another instance of

401
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,000
Alex making more shit up about this article because he hasn't read it and he's just using it as a prop to get mad about

402
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,400
If Alex had actually read the article he would have found this quote from Air Force Brigadier General Paul Fredericks quote

403
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,760
Are we seeing people who are declining to it? Yes, I've had people say that for a variety of reasons

404
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,660
They're pregnant which is a very reasonable concern. They want to talk to their doctor first very reasonable concern

405
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,140
So there are people who've said they don't want to get it

406
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,400
This whole article is actually a big problem for Alex's narratives because he's been insistent that the vaccine is mandatory or it's gonna be mandatory

407
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,080
But the fact that the military is allowing enlisted persons to decide if they want to get it or not makes him have to change

408
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,360
The subject because the thing he was making his audience afraid about didn't happen

409
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,360
He now has to pivot to making it look like the enlisted persons who don't get the vaccine or somehow being maligned

410
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,480
Which this article doesn't support he didn't read it. No one listening is gonna read it. So this technique works perfectly

411
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,320
It's all just meaningless though. Yes, just like it might as well not to do this

412
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:53,720
yeah, and with the military that thing is you're most people aren't gonna look into it and for most people I would imagine that there

413
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,500
Makes a certain sort of like sense that well the military would be mandated to get it because they're the military

414
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,800
And that's that's the perception that Alex goes exactly and that's what you can you because most people wouldn't even

415
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,400
Follow up on that or especially not Alex's listeners. They'd be like, yeah, the military is forced to do everything. Mm-hmm

416
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:19,360
Yeah, so in this next clip Alex claims to have some information that he does not produce which means he's making it up

417
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,320
Yeah, I got so many adverse reaction death reports

418
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,920
I got over 200 upright here in just the last three days in the u.s. Alone. They shoot old people up

419
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,240
They're dead in 15 minutes in many cases

420
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,760
I mean folks here's thing. I used to be worried about stuff cuz I wanted to win the fight

421
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,560
I was worried about my family and everything. Oh things are so crazy. Now this ain't gonna go on long

422
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,820
Whatever is going on. Whatever is happening the number of people they're killing. Whatever is going on, baby

423
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,660
We ain't never seen nothing like this. This is big. I

424
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,660
Thought they put something in there kill you in five years. Oh, no, they don't kill your ass right now

425
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,900
So yeah, I mean if you have these these

426
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,660
200 why don't you talk about any of them doesn't produce any yeah

427
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,700
Yeah, I would I would I would argue that I mean, you know

428
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,980
If you just say something and you don't prove it or demonstrate it at all. I could just ignore it

429
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,820
Yeah, especially something that when tied to your other rhetoric

430
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,580
Is I guess license to go murder whomever you want, right?

431
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,860
Because they're killing you in 15 minutes. They're killing your grandma right now in 15 minutes Dan

432
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:32,260
Well, you thought you were gonna have a lovely five years to like hold your grandmother's hand as she dies from the government murder vaccine

433
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,300
But now you don't even have that much time

434
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,140
The only comfort I really take is hoping that people who listen to this would ask themselves at some point

435
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,900
Does Alex actually read the things he talks about and look into it and then that might erode public confidence in his dumbass

436
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:53,940
I could so a lot of the times when Alex is just rambling about something on air. It's something that our old friend

437
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,500
Paul Joseph Watson. Oh, I've written it and Paul has struck again Oh

438
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:06,420
Oh summit dot news links to BBC UK government could grant vaccine exemptions to ethnic minorities

439
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
I heard this a few months ago in NPR

440
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:15,180
Well black people are dumb, you know, we're liberals we can say that there did the UK say take shots

441
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,480
They just they're like the US military. They're dumb

442
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,860
You know, they just they just don't trust us. And so we're gonna have vaccine waivers for them

443
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,540
All right, but they won't be able to leave their house or have a job, you know how they are

444
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,300
But white people you're gonna take it

445
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,180
So show the black people not to be scared you roll up your sleeve and take your shot

446
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,980
This is just a total attack by these criminals to cover up Jeffrey Epstein and

447
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,780
Whoa

448
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:49,220
All the corruption the banking and the derivatives of the scams of the dollar implosion and the New World Order and the rigging and

449
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:55,060
The cloning and the and so they just want to make the whole world hellish with mask on and checkpoints and passports

450
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:01,140
So you forget all the crimes they committed and don't do anything about it. It's a dumb plan

451
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,580
It's a dumb dumb plan boy

452
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:10,340
It is hard not to think about what would have happened if you and all of your right-wing

453
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:17,780
Lunatic dumb dumb friends had decided to take this whole fucking thing seriously way back in February of last year Dan

454
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,740
Well, I think they did take it too seriously

455
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,060
I'm sorry, I apologize in March of last year

456
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,100
Would have been it would have been interesting would have been interesting. So quick point

457
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,820
There is no link to the BBC and Paul's article

458
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,420
There's a link to a story in the spectator and one in Sky News

459
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,500
The Sky News article says nothing about exemptions

460
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,140
But what Paul does is he cherry picks a very minor side point in the spectator article?

461
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,100
Which he then turns into his headline because it has the potential to help boost white victimhood feelings

462
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,780
This is an editorial column and one of the concerns it raises

463
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,620
With the idea of vaccine passports being required for travel is according to this column

464
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,460
Vaccine skepticism is higher in non-white communities in the UK sure

465
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:08,140
It's really interesting how Paul works here Paul takes this quote from the Sky News article quote a government insider stressed

466
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:15,300
There's nervousness about when such a system will even be announced publicly let alone rolled out for use if you read the article

467
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,380
It does seem to be implied that the nervousness in question is about the vaccines efficacy and not moving too fast

468
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:28,340
However, here's how Paul uses that line quote part of this nervousness is based around the perception that mandating

469
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:35,820
Mandating vaccines for travel could be seen as racist because suspicion of vaccines and poor inoculation rates are commonplace within BAME

470
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,500
communities

471
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,180
He's taken the concerns raised by the editorial of the spectator and applied them to the quote from the Sky News

472
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,900
Article without in any way demonstrating that the two are connected at all. No, they're connected

473
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,540
This is Paul

474
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,180
Just kind of making things up in order to justify writing a blog post about white identity fears that Alex can then report on

475
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,700
In a super racist way on air because that's what their audience needs to stay interested

476
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,980
Yeah, I do appreciate

477
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,500
The the real lack of effort that went into that for Paul

478
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,660
Yeah, like it is it is always real, you know heartwarming to know that some people

479
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,140
Wake up at 9 go to work and they're done at 10

480
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,140
Yeah, you know, it's just nice to know that that's a that's a dream that somebody can accomplish, you know, yeah

481
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,180
And so transparent about it. Yeah, that's not very very weak. So not good

482
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:33,500
So so far, I think we've seen just a real tragedy of a show. We see real sad Alex play a car crash

483
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:41,120
Just make up nonsense about a couple articles. I didn't drive through a snowstorm and an outstorm for no reason

484
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,300
I'm gonna deliver the guns cuz I'm alive and I'm not backing down in the name of Jesus Christ

485
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,780
I declare war on Satan

486
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,540
Good work

487
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,900
Yeah, you know what four out of ten four out of ten

488
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,740
Maybe I would argue that this is a good teaching moment as well for Alex. All right now

489
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,260
I understand that we're not gonna get anywhere with the corona virus with him

490
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,580
It's too we're too far gone for that

491
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,700
But let me toss this out for you Dan if there were fewer cars on the road during an ice storm

492
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,900
Mm-hmm. Don't you think that would be better at preventing accidents? Yes, right

493
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,300
So perhaps if Alex wanted to do his part to prevent accidents

494
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,520
He could have stayed home and done the show remotely now

495
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,300
Do you understand how those things might be a connected?

496
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,460
I understand the metaphor that you're making but I'd also like to say he did come in see now

497
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,900
That is the problem that we're having all across the board. It is it's an issue

498
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,460
So when Alex comes back for break after that pathetic growl

499
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
very fake very long

500
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:03,220
Passionless growl. Yeah, he starts complaining about how people think that he supported Trump because it somehow is good for his business

501
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,740
Now, I know that I've heard him a hundred times say that his traffic went up

502
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:13,020
Ridiculously. Yeah, once he started to kid in with Trump and all that was really good for his business. No, no

503
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,060
No, it hurt his business. He was persecuted. Sure. Alex was

504
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:23,700
Persecuted I got persecuted for supporting Trump you got persecuted for supporting Trump

505
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,940
But we're not losers because we supported President Trump. He really won that

506
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:37,500
Election and I don't just say that if he lost I'd say he lost I'd still say we have a Chinese agent in charge

507
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,340
I don't lie to myself

508
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,180
Okay, I did when I was 10 years old but not since about then. I want to know what's really going on

509
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:51,700
That's what gives me an effectiveness in my life read that US News and World Report article then that's a good starting point

510
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,500
I would I would argue he really wants to know what's not going on

511
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:03,180
Or he doesn't want to know what is going on. Yes. Yeah, he desperately needs not

512
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,360
Avoid what's going on? Yeah

513
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,140
Which is why you support Trump, yeah, but there's bad news about Trump, but it's bad news mixed with good news

514
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,260
Okay, but it's all bad news. Okay, but maybe it's good news. All right

515
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,720
Trump's basically bankrupt. He's not just lost two billion out of the inside baseball

516
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,540
They've got four or five thousand lawsuits against him

517
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,280
But you know, we have the treated man. He's actually stronger than ever

518
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,560
And he understands that and if more men were like President Trump if more men were like the supporters this broadcast, I mean that

519
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,180
Who would be in this position, but he understands leadership like Colonel Travis did at the Alamo

520
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,980
Drunkenly Travis knew he's gonna be killed. He sent that final letter. He knew what was about to happen

521
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,500
But he couldn't back down because he believed the cause he signed on to it. He wasn't suicidal

522
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:58,540
I can't get out of here so much like Jesus Christ said he was one to lay it down for others

523
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,420
So that's what this comes down to Colonel Travis had nowhere else to go no

524
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,700
No, no, he had nowhere else to go Trump may have nowhere else to go. Yeah, that's probably true

525
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,620
So Trump put out a little statement about the impeachment acquittal. Did he?

526
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:22,020
Yeah, and Alex Alex is kind of pissed off that no one's reading the full statement. Oh nice. Yeah, so nowhere

527
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,740
Do you really see the president's statement you hear he made one, but you don't really it may be a line here a line there

528
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,500
Let's read the whole thing together

529
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
right now as

530
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Beautiful what he said, it's totally true

531
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:40,260
National fall wrote the story. It's up at in full words calm president Trump releases statement on second impeachment acquittal

532
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,700
President Trump through the office of the former president was a statement celebrating this

533
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:52,420
Second Senate impeachment acquittal damn, right? He's the man the arena like oh look. He's under attack. You're like Oh Jones

534
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,220
You're under attack. Oh boy. They're coming after you. What'd you think?

535
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,460
I did you think I did this not to be attacked you think I did that cuz I don't expect a war

536
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,980
You people don't get and I'm talking to our enemies

537
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,020
You think I just want to line my pockets and sit around with you in some country club that I do think

538
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,260
Yes, I agree without fighting evil. I feel alive. I feel strong

539
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,420
You understand that you can put a gun to my head on my back it down you dumb sons of bitches

540
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,820
It's real shame no one's reading the Trump statement I

541
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,620
Do I do appreciate that it does it does appear that for most of the world

542
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,380
We're finally past like having to deal with stuff. He says on the daily. Yeah, that's nice

543
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:49,800
Yeah, everybody everybody enjoys that I I had I have personally some trouble whenever I see too much of him

544
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,340
Yeah, yeah

545
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,780
I don't want I don't want people that I would normally think of as sane

546
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,060
To talk about him and not because I want exclusive domain over Alex don't know. I just don't think it's worth it. No

547
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:08,280
Yeah, this is a problem for us, too. Yeah. Yeah, I don't value my own time

548
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,340
Save yourselves. Yeah, we're too far gone. Yeah. Yeah, this all means nothing. Yeah

549
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,140
We're not the people who hide a zombie bite. We have a zombie bite kick us out of the mall

550
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,740
We're not supposed to be there. We'll be on the roof

551
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
So

552
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,780
Alex does get around to reading the statement and I will say I think he reads it in full

553
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,420
But he does add some commentary and some of it is a little bit ridiculous

554
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,940
No president has ever gone through anything like it and that's true

555
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,300
That's the key and it continues because our opponents cannot forget the almost 75 million people

556
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,300
Way more than that the greatest number ever for a sitting president who voted

557
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:55,460
I was just a few months ago, and that's thing Trump had victory. It's there even though they lie about it folks

558
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,420
He won those other six states by half a point or less. He won him by five points on average

559
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,600
You understand that that's like what it's way more than quadruple the number of victory numbers

560
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,620
That's why they're crapping their bridges. That's more than quadruple the number of victory numbers

561
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,900
Yeah

562
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Kind of feels a lot like that

563
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
50 times the amount of imaginary

564
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:26,360
Vaccine deaths. Yeah, that doesn't sound like a reasonable number for someone to toss out there. I feel like Alex doesn't know much about

565
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,660
Numbers. Math? No. Anything? Nope. Very little. So he gets to complaining about SNL

566
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:41,620
And of course this leads into him yelling a bit about abuse towards children. Sure, sure. I don't respect his position on the issue

567
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,020
Man, I got a lot of complaints about SNL. I I think we can let that one go

568
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,780
Mm-hmm. I don't think we need to worry about that. No, there's there's really not not any reason to

569
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,440
Engage and so that's that's one break and then he comes back and I want to tell you

570
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
He's not killing time. I

571
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,140
Would argue even mentioning SNL on your apparently political talk show would be killing time

572
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,200
Well that that you know debatable if it's killing time. Sure. This next minute

573
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:19,500
Definitely not. It sounds like alright ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here back live two more segments left than Owen Schroyer

574
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,740
If he can get here in this snowstorm, we can run a rebroadcast if he can't or just loop this show

575
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
info wars live six to eight

576
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,240
Sunday nights is coming up if Ellen can get here

577
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,500
Will you guys call him and see if he can get here because it is just insane

578
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:41,820
Yes, this hosting ask him to come to work. Oh my gosh, Tom Pappert

579
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,180
Emperor Palpatine

580
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,620
the Sun

581
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:53,280
He's like a hundredth generation clone of Palpatine as you know that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far far away Tom

582
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,920
Pappertine. Oh, you don't know about star. He's great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great great great thousandth clone

583
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,800
Is gonna be hosting with Sheldon after the broadcast. You don't want to miss it

584
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,320
All right, I have a lot of stuff to hit here in fact I've got too much material

585
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,360
It's not like I'm stalling out because I don't have information to cover here with 25 minutes left to go

586
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
it's because

587
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,160
This is surreal, I mean it is it's just surreal there's too much

588
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:29,480
There's too much got a riff on Tom Papperts name being similar to Palpatine. Yep. Yep for a bit

589
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:37,480
Dick what a dick people dying outside people dying outside. Let's see if Owen can get to work

590
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,240
Yeah, great. Good boss. Good boss. Love working for you, buddy

591
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,920
I'll say for what I would expect of Alex as a boss the fact that he's like we can go to rebroadcast if he can't

592
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,680
That's true. That almost seems like that's that kind of a stand-up guy. Yeah, that is that is to be like no

593
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,320
He gets here now or he's fired. Yeah, but that is also Scrooge being like you get Christmas off like

594
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,840
Yeah, I guess that's nice. So he's not killing time

595
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,640
Well, maybe he's killing some time. Okay, so here's the video of the granny being thrown off the cliff

596
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:19,640
So, he plays this video that's a guy rolling a woman in a wheelchair

597
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,160
Through a park and then it ends with him dumping her off a cliff

598
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,840
So it is like that Conan O'Brien Walker, Texas Ranger sketch. It's well, there's a little bit of well, I mean

599
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,840
There's some racial undertones for oh god. Damn it

600
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Look at her fighting back that old white lady. That old racist.

601
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,840
Get rid of her!

602
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Yeah, there we go.

603
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
Ahh, good, liberal.

604
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Oh, liberal ooh.

605
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:56,840
This video is a campaign ad that was targeting Paul Ryan because he was gonna take take away Medicare.

606
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Yeah, yeah. This is at least a two-year-old ad that was against the GOP that Alex is playing as some kind of attack

607
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,840
on liberals or something?

608
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Boo this man! Boo this man!

609
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
Boo!

610
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Yeah, I was like this is this is surreal and Alex clearly hadn't watched it in advance

611
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,240
He just knew it was an old lady getting dumped out of a wheelchair because he looks pretty surprised when the thing comes up

612
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
and it says call Paul Ryan

613
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

614
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on now. Hold on one second.

615
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,240
Oh boy.

616
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,240
Yeah, so Alex, you know, he's in a bit of a fatalistic mood, you know.

617
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,240
He already said earlier that, you know, we might not be here next year. Fuck that, we might not be here tomorrow.

618
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,240
I got a final segment and a bunch of news I want to hit. I'm loaded for bear on that.

619
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,240
But I'll just tell you all this, ladies and gentlemen, it's been a great pleasure to be on air with you.

620
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,240
I don't know how long I'm going to be here. Things are so bad. Things are moving so fast

621
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,240
that I'm not even sure we'll be here tomorrow, next week, next year.

622
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,240
It's all up to God right now, but the bottom fell out.

623
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,240
And it's just they're euthanizing the old people.

624
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,240
I mean, we've got probably 5% death rates at nursing homes to take the shot

625
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
and they've successfully covered up most areas.

626
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
OK, that's a ridiculous number.

627
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,240
All right. OK, hold on. Even then.

628
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
He can't just make up numbers like that.

629
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,240
No. No. But even then, what's the current bet? Never mind.

630
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,240
I don't even know. Just stop. Just stop. Just stop.

631
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,240
One of the things that I think is interesting is Alex is talking pretty fatalistically.

632
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,240
He's talking a lot of, uh, we're gone. We're done.

633
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
It looks like Plan B is back in play.

634
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Now, I won't say that I'm falling for it again or anything like that,

635
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,240
or thinking that he's talking for real, but I do need to tell you this, and I do think it's important.

636
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
What's that?

637
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
He's playing a lot of doors.

638
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,240
He's playing a lot of songs by the doors as bumper music.

639
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
So he's in a mood.

640
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,240
There's a lot of, like, this is the end, my friend.

641
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,240
A lot of those sorts of songs.

642
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,240
And it honestly bums me out, mostly because I don't like the doors,

643
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,240
but also it has, like, such a scent.

644
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,240
Like, the mood of the music that he's playing on a very regular basis,

645
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,240
like multiple coming in from commercials per show.

646
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Little Mothlin?

647
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,240
Yeah, or Doors songs. It has the tone of a dirge.

648
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,240
Okay. All right. Let's see how this goes.

649
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,240
Yeah, I don't know.

650
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
I just, I think...

651
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,240
I will say that if it doesn't end soon and he keeps playing the doors, I'm gonna be pissed.

652
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,240
You know, one thing that I realized after the impeachment trial was that

653
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,240
I don't think that's the appropriate punishment.

654
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:47,240
And I think the same thing for Alex. I don't think the appropriate punishment is to, like, take him off the air.

655
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:53,240
I don't think the appropriate punishment for Trump is to take him away from politics or anything.

656
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,240
They should have no money. Zero money. Take their money.

657
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,240
If the impeachment trial was like, yeah, sure, run for office again, with nothing.

658
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
I got broke.

659
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,240
I think if people do things that have civic, or civil penalties,

660
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,240
then by all means they should be sued and what have you.

661
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,240
And I don't want what I'm about to say to be like, no, don't sue Alex.

662
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,240
Like people who he has wronged.

663
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Sure, sure, sure.

664
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,240
But I think that I'm not particularly concerned with him having money or not having money.

665
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
I'm concerned about the impact that he can have.

666
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
Sure, sure, sure.

667
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:34,240
I think a far greater punishment for him is the illumination and explanation of how bullshit everything he does is.

668
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
Right.

669
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:44,240
And how he's basically defrauding people with the posture of, like, some guy who's against the system when all he really is is a fucking idiot.

670
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Right, and I want to take away the thing he cares about most.

671
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,240
Memories of Colonel Travis.

672
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,240
I'll take those too.

673
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
If I could sue him for those, I would.

674
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:01,240
So, this show has been largely devoid of meaning?

675
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,240
No, no, no. SNL.

676
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Well, and there's some more pop culture grievance.

677
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Sure.

678
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,240
Because Alex has found a video of Run DMC.

679
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,240
Run DMC, the current stars?

680
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
Well, it's just DMC.

681
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,240
Current stars Run DMC?

682
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
They did a little song about the vaccine.

683
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
Okay.

684
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
And Alex is not happy about it.

685
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,240
Alright.

686
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Run DMC members now put out this, I guess the money must be good, this type of garbage.

687
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,240
Then I got something even sicker.

688
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Here it is.

689
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:35,240
I got the vaccine, you got the vaccine, they got the vaccine, we got the vaccine.

690
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,240
We can get back to normal, let me inform you, let's all get the vaccine.

691
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Look, I think that there's plenty of valid criticisms about this song.

692
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
Oh, do you mean that it's great?

693
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
That it's too good for the rest of us?

694
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,240
This isn't really my territory to critique too much.

695
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:58,240
But I will say that Alex was far less critical of Mike Adams' rap career.

696
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,240
That is fair.

697
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
That is fair.

698
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,240
His weird Ebola rap songs.

699
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,240
I mean, I respect what they're doing, it's tough to hear an afterschool special from DMC.

700
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,240
It is tough to hear a PSA.

701
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:20,240
I just, I don't really know, I don't know, it just seems weird that Alex would care that much.

702
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
Why?

703
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,240
Why?

704
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,240
Because he's filling fucking time.

705
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Right.

706
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
No, that's what I'm saying.

707
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Yeah, he's got nothing.

708
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Like, this is what he spends his other time with at the end of the show.

709
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,240
Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you.

710
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,240
You're gonna take his shots, here it is.

711
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,240
What if Bill Gates disappeared?

712
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
No problem.

713
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,240
I will buy many Gates and solve the problem.

714
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,240
Alex plays a video from like a YouTube channel called OMSOM, I believe, OMSOM.

715
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
And it's like, it's for kids.

716
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
It's an educational video for kids.

717
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,240
They have a big series of videos of what would happen if blank disappeared.

718
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,240
And so one of the recent ones is what would happen if the year 2016 disappeared?

719
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,240
What would happen if numbers disappeared?

720
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,240
And it's like animations for kids.

721
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,240
And there's one about what would happen if Bill Gates disappeared.

722
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,240
And some of it is like, well, he's a big philanthropist, a lot of that money would be gone.

723
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,240
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

724
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,240
And then the last one I think is like, Warren Buffett would miss his best friend.

725
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,240
It's like, why are you commenting on this stupid video for kids?

726
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,240
Because that's the first thing that he can engage with on an equal footing.

727
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,240
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

728
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,240
It's for kids.

729
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:45,240
I mean, look, I'm not gonna say that that doesn't have a kind of propaganda feel to it.

730
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,240
I'm not gonna say that making a video where you're like, what if Bill Gates was gone?

731
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:56,240
That didn't also include like, well, it's possible that his money would be shuffled back into the economy

732
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,240
and put into places where maybe he doesn't have half of it.

733
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,240
Sure, he's a philanthropist, but maybe he's still got $20 billion and he should go fuck himself.

734
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,240
That might be complicated for children.

735
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,240
It might be a little bit difficult.

736
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,240
I accept the point that you're making. This is not the critique that Alex has.

737
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,240
No, that's true.

738
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:20,240
Yeah, hey, I get what you're saying. I hear it being a little bit weird, but it's also a giant public figure.

739
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,240
Yeah, totally. No, of course.

740
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:30,240
I don't know. I didn't watch the whole thing, but the stuff that Alex plays is just like, alright, this isn't like Bill Gates is our god.

741
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,240
Yeah, you know what? If he went more like a Starship Troopers route where he's like,

742
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:43,240
doesn't it seem a little bit weird that we're making these kind of campaign videos that lionize these types of public figures

743
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,240
when what we should be doing is talking about the issues and policies and stuff like that?

744
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,240
But even then, he's talking about a kid's video.

745
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,240
But then look at Trump ads.

746
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,240
No, I know. Of course.

747
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,240
That argument cuts both directions.

748
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,240
Of course. That's never stopped him before.

749
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:05,240
True. I don't know. I just, you know, I was feeling like there wasn't much happening here, but there was a lot happening.

750
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:15,240
You know, it was really disgusting, the playing of the crash, the going right into an ad after talking about it.

751
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,240
And so much of this vaccine nonsense is sad.

752
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,240
And it really makes you think that this is how he ends the show.

753
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:31,240
I will now go into an incredible gauntlet of frozen roads and road warrior level crashes to get back to my family

754
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,240
and hopefully back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central for the live broadcast. I want to thank the crew for a great job.

755
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:43,240
Coming up on the other side on the Infowars Network stream is Tom Pappert of NationalFile.com.

756
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,240
There's no reason that he needed to come in at all.

757
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,240
Nope.

758
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,240
Tom Pappert is in, you know, he's not in Texas.

759
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
Nope.

760
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,240
Like, he does it remotely. Alex could have just set up a little cam at his house.

761
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,240
Wouldn't have been hard.

762
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,240
No need, no need. This is all for nothing.

763
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
Yep.

764
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
It's all a waste, just to get out of the house on Valentine's Day.

765
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,240
Yep.

766
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Alright. Okay.

767
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,240
Oh, also they debuted in, I don't know if it was debuted, but this is the first time I saw it.

768
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
There was a new commercial for my Patriot Supply.

769
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Uh-huh.

770
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,240
And Alex is at their warehouse that is in Salt Lake City, Utah.

771
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,240
Okay.

772
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,240
That's why he went to Utah.

773
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,240
That's why he went to Utah, to cut a clip? Oh, what a dick.

774
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,240
Yeah, he's there at the warehouse.

775
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,240
He's shooting promos?

776
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,240
Yeah.

777
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
What an asshole.

778
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,240
I think that must have been why he went, or at least part of it.

779
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Yeah.

780
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,240
I mean, maybe it's, maybe it's, you know.

781
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Eh, kill two birds with one stone. You're already there.

782
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,240
But that's at least part of it.

783
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,240
Yeah.

784
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:41,240
That explains why, like, I mean, look, again, I love you, Utah, but not the number one vacation destination, necessarily.

785
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Um, so yeah, he was, I, uh, I don't have any clips of it because it's just that I'm talking about how great the food is.

786
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

787
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
Although, there is a kind of a funny part where he's like-

788
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,240
You know what that's like? That's a little bit like if you were to say,

789
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,240
hey, all you viewers, or all you listeners, you're lucky not to be watching this video right now.

790
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
But instead, you just didn't play it, Dan.

791
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
True, true.

792
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,240
Yeah.

793
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
Yeah.

794
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,240
Think about that.

795
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,240
Hmm.

796
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
Restraint.

797
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Yeah.

798
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,240
Um, did you know that if you get my Patriot Supply stuff and you open up one of those buckets-

799
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
What's that?

800
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,240
You gotta be careful.

801
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:21,240
You might not be able to get it closed because there's so much food in it.

802
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,240
They say that like three times.

803
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,240
It's all just one, it's all just a muffin. Like, you pull it up and then it pops out and they're like,

804
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,240
haha, it's a big muffin. You can eat it forever.

805
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,240
I would be charmed by that.

806
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,240
Um, so yeah, I don't know. I found this episode to be a little frustrating.

807
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,240
No, it's great. There's a lot going on.

808
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:49,240
Children's videos, Run DMC vaccine songs, SNL complaining, like everything just seems so trivial.

809
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,240
I feel like-

810
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,240
It's trivial.

811
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,240
Big stuff is happening.

812
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,240
Yeah, yeah.

813
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,240
Yeah.

814
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,240
I think that Alex on some level didn't have as much skin in the game with the impeachment as you might have thought he might.

815
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Yeah.

816
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,240
And then the spin of they just played clips of Democrats saying stuff and how do you defend against that?

817
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Right.

818
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
As if that was legally relevant.

819
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
Yeah, no kidding.

820
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,240
And I think that works for him. So, I don't know.

821
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,240
I'm excited to see if he keeps playing the doors.

822
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
Yeah.

823
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,240
And if that is a bad omen-

824
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
You want to see how sad he gets?

825
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,240
Yes.

826
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
I'm excited to see how sad boy he goes.

827
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,240
Yeah.

828
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,240
Yeah.

829
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,240
Oh, I can only imagine. If he comes in from break with like the sound of silence, then we know it's over.

830
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,240
He's just singing along with Elliot Smith instead of you belong to the city.

831
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,240
Oh, it starts raining at the Interwar Studio.

832
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
How?

833
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,240
Oh, I paid $50,000 for a rain system.

834
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,240
We got sprinklers up there. They're always going 24-7 now.

835
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,240
Yep. It just fit the mood.

836
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
It's just how I feel.

837
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
Yep.

838
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:58,240
If you can afford to have your environment reflect your inner peace, then yeah, but I'm just sad.

839
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:04,240
Well, I guess we'll be back to find out what the next step in this adventure is.

840
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,240
Indeed we will.

841
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,240
But until then, we have a website.

842
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,240
We do have a website. It's knowledgefight.com.

843
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Yep. We're also on Twitter.

844
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,240
We are on Twitter. It's at knowledgefight.net. Go to bed Jordan.

845
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
We're also on Facebook.

846
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
We are on Facebook and iTunes.

847
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,240
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now.

848
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,240
Yep. We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo. I'm Leo. I'm DZXClark. I'm Daryl Rundis.

849
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,240
I'm Alex Jones's wife's auntie.

850
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,240
Andy in Kansas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.

851
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,240
Hello, Alex. I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.

852
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:44,240
I love you.
