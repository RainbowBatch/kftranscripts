00:59.400 --> 01:01.560
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:01.560 --> 01:02.200
I'm Jordan

01:02.200 --> 01:04.160
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:04.160 --> 01:05.520
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.520 --> 01:06.760
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:06.760 --> 01:07.200
Jordan

01:07.200 --> 01:07.880
Dan

01:07.880 --> 01:08.280
Jordan

01:08.280 --> 01:09.000
I have a quick question for you

01:09.000 --> 01:09.520
What's up?

01:09.520 --> 01:10.280
What's your bright spot today?

01:10.280 --> 01:12.880
My bright spot today, Jordan, is Pannino's Pizza

01:12.880 --> 01:14.080
Pannino's Pizza

01:14.080 --> 01:16.080
Okay

01:16.080 --> 01:20.600
I used to live fairly close to them and it was sort of a

01:20.600 --> 01:23.080
bit of a thing where I'd go there and get a slice

01:23.080 --> 01:24.000
pretty regularly

01:24.000 --> 01:24.440
Sure

01:24.440 --> 01:26.640
Like it, good, slice

01:26.640 --> 01:28.320
Good, it's good stuff

01:28.320 --> 01:32.480
I have moved since then, I no longer live near Pannino's

01:32.480 --> 01:35.600
But I did see that there was a place that will go nameless

01:35.600 --> 01:37.240
because I don't actually remember what the name of the

01:37.240 --> 01:40.320
place was, but there was a by the slice pizza place

01:40.320 --> 01:40.680
Alright

01:40.680 --> 01:43.760
Nearly near my house, I was walking in the terrible snow

01:43.760 --> 01:44.600
Sure, sure

01:44.600 --> 01:48.840
A couple days ago and I saw this and I said

01:48.840 --> 01:51.280
It's tough to walk out there, you built up a hunger

01:51.280 --> 01:54.320
I said I would like a slice, see this is as good as Pannino's

01:54.320 --> 01:54.920
Right

01:54.920 --> 01:56.680
Terrible

01:56.680 --> 01:57.800
Not as good as Pannino's

01:57.800 --> 01:58.080
No

01:58.080 --> 02:00.120
So my bright spot is remembering how much better

02:00.120 --> 02:00.800
Pannino's was

02:00.800 --> 02:04.320
No, a couple days after that I ordered Pannino's

02:04.320 --> 02:05.760
because I was pissed

02:05.760 --> 02:07.080
I'll see you in hell

02:07.080 --> 02:09.600
Yeah, so I ordered it and it was as good as I remember

02:09.600 --> 02:10.120
Shout out

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
That's fantastic

02:11.120 --> 02:13.680
Congratulations to Pannino's for making good pizza

02:13.680 --> 02:15.240
Sure, how about you?

02:15.240 --> 02:19.440
My bright spot, Dan, is I finally tried out Hades

02:19.440 --> 02:21.040
Oh yeah, the video game

02:21.040 --> 02:22.440
Fantastic

02:22.440 --> 02:25.160
Really, really fun, it's nice and it's got a great

02:25.160 --> 02:29.520
I like the mechanic of the like, you're supposed to die

02:29.520 --> 02:31.960
You die and that's part of the story

02:31.960 --> 02:36.320
It's that Sisyphean trapped in the sense of

02:36.320 --> 02:37.480
And you get to talk to Sisyphus too

02:37.480 --> 02:39.880
Yeah, exactly, it's very fun

02:39.880 --> 02:42.480
It's a nice little take on mythology, I enjoy it

02:42.480 --> 02:46.160
I don't know if I have made this complaint

02:46.160 --> 02:47.840
but I have one complaint about the game

02:47.840 --> 02:48.320
What's that?

02:48.320 --> 02:50.960
And that is I don't think Hephaestus is in it

02:50.960 --> 02:52.920
I have not seen Hephaestus yet

02:52.920 --> 02:57.440
Hephaestus is the reason, Hephaestus should be making all of these buffs that you're getting

02:57.440 --> 02:59.960
He should, he's the armor of the gods

02:59.960 --> 03:01.360
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point

03:01.360 --> 03:03.080
Yeah, very glaring omission

03:03.080 --> 03:04.360
That is a huge one

03:04.360 --> 03:07.920
Yeah, anyway that was the one thing I just thought when I was playing it

03:07.920 --> 03:09.600
But yeah, it's a lot of fun, I'm glad you enjoyed it

03:09.600 --> 03:10.160
It's a good time

03:10.160 --> 03:13.360
I recommended it to another friend and she enjoyed it quite a bit as well

03:13.360 --> 03:14.120
Yeah, it was delightful

03:14.120 --> 03:16.240
Seems like it's a beloved game

03:16.240 --> 03:17.040
It's a good game

03:17.040 --> 03:19.680
Seems like all the good reviews are merited

03:19.680 --> 03:27.240
Do you know what it makes me, it reminds me of an old, old PlayStation 1 game called Azure Dreams

03:27.240 --> 03:27.680
Okay

03:27.680 --> 03:33.280
And it was that same kind of infinite dungeon crawler that would populate a new dungeon for you every time

03:33.280 --> 03:41.360
But you would capture monsters, it was like a mixture of Pokemon and that same kind of Hades dungeon crawler

03:41.360 --> 03:42.040
That sounds fun

03:42.040 --> 03:43.440
Fantastic game

03:43.440 --> 03:49.440
Yeah, it was that weird kind of PS1 game though where it was like, also there's a dating simulator for some reason

03:49.440 --> 03:51.800
You know, you're like, I don't need this guys

03:51.800 --> 03:56.480
I've heard the relationship system in Hades compared to that as well

03:56.480 --> 03:57.000
Really?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
A dating simulator kind of thing

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh yeah, that's a good point

03:59.000 --> 04:00.360
Because you have to give gifts to all those people

04:00.360 --> 04:02.000
You do give gifts, that's right

04:02.000 --> 04:03.520
And boost your relations

04:03.520 --> 04:08.040
Yeah, and that opens up different, yeah, yeah, no, that's almost exactly what it is

04:08.040 --> 04:09.600
This to Hades is a rip-off

04:09.600 --> 04:12.920
They remade Azure Dreams a very weird PlayStation 1 game

04:12.920 --> 04:14.320
But without a Pokemon

04:14.320 --> 04:16.400
Yeah, that's true, you don't really

04:16.400 --> 04:19.640
Anyway, Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over

04:19.640 --> 04:21.880
We're going to be talking about Valentine's Day 2021, Blackjack

04:21.880 --> 04:25.880
I was even ready for it that time, I was like so prepared

04:25.880 --> 04:30.360
I was hoping I could distract you by not saying the date, the holiday

04:30.360 --> 04:35.000
Talking about February 14th, Sunday, Alex has a special

04:35.000 --> 04:38.840
Every year he does a special Valentine's Day episode

04:38.840 --> 04:40.840
I just love it

04:40.840 --> 04:43.000
Well, it's a family show and you know

04:43.000 --> 04:46.680
I'm being completely facetious, this is not a special Valentine's Day show

04:46.680 --> 04:50.120
I'm fairly certain that I wasn't being serious about it being a family show

04:50.120 --> 04:52.840
So we have some interesting fun things to talk about

04:52.840 --> 04:55.480
But first let's say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

04:55.480 --> 04:56.200
Oh, that's fun

04:56.200 --> 04:58.320
So first, sign me up to be a globalist

04:58.320 --> 05:00.600

05:27.120 --> 05:28.120
I'm a Policy Wonk

05:28.120 --> 05:29.400
Thanks Michael

05:29.400 --> 05:33.560
And finally, Bill Walton's favourite tie dye t-shirt, thank you so much you are now a Policy Wonk

05:33.560 --> 05:34.920
I'm a Policy Wonk

05:34.920 --> 05:36.040
Thank you very much

05:36.040 --> 05:38.360
Bill Walton's favourite tie dye t-shirt

05:38.360 --> 05:45.480
Now it's interesting Jordan cuz Austin right now is in the state of Texas. That's true currently it has been for a while

05:45.520 --> 05:47.640
But right now in the state of Texas

05:47.640 --> 05:54.000
They're experiencing an incredible ice storm, and I hope everybody you know all of our listeners in that part of the world are staying safe

05:54.520 --> 05:59.760
It ain't no joke yeah from what I understand. It's not for you guys. We're we're meant for that

05:59.760 --> 06:06.040
That's where we're that's what we're for even us. That'd be a challenge. Oh, yeah, it's not fun. No

06:06.040 --> 06:10.560
um and and so Alex decided who cares I'm coming into the

06:13.000 --> 06:19.160
So he does come in for a Sunday show on Valentine's Day when he could have very easily done it remotely

06:19.400 --> 06:24.560
Not done the show no problem Harrison Smith ramble about white genocide everybody been fine

06:24.560 --> 06:27.320
Yeah, so here's an out-of-context drop from today's show

06:27.800 --> 06:30.160
So here's the video the granny being thrown off the cliff

06:30.160 --> 06:36.760
Okay, okay, all right glad all right glad you came into work. I I assume that wasn't a Walker, Texas

06:36.760 --> 06:39.200
Ranger kind of situation here no

06:39.600 --> 06:45.320
So Alex came in and he starts off the show as anyone would try if they had just come in to work

06:46.040 --> 06:49.600
Through driving through chaos, and that is complaining about driving

06:52.120 --> 06:55.560
This has got to be an incredible show today because I've grown up

06:55.560 --> 06:58.120
Born in Texas

06:58.120 --> 07:03.200
And I've grown up in people not being able to drive with ice on the roads cuz it only happens a few times a year

07:04.200 --> 07:08.880
But I've never seen anything like this. This was road warrior level. I probably saw a

07:10.320 --> 07:13.600
Hundred wrecked cars on the way here smash signs glass

07:15.360 --> 07:17.160
Firefighters trying to block major roads

07:17.160 --> 07:22.320
I wouldn't even be here if I hadn't just gone ahead and gone around them because I was driving my wife's all-wheel vehicle

07:22.320 --> 07:25.760
I was driving my wife's all-wheel vehicle my favorite thing about

07:27.680 --> 07:34.360
I need more explanation for how he went around him if his next line is with an all-wheel drive vehicle

07:34.360 --> 07:36.320
We'll get to it. Okay. Let's talk more about that

07:36.320 --> 07:41.000
Okay, um, but I do love the idea that he's starting off the show with like this better be a fucking great

07:41.000 --> 07:48.560
Road warrior, it's gotta be worth it. Yeah, so you you're asking about this this car situation

07:48.560 --> 07:55.000
Yeah, little did you know he would just talk more about well and this basically turns into a car commercial sure

07:55.000 --> 07:55.320
Oh

07:55.320 --> 08:01.120
I tried to leave the house in my a truck and it was not four-wheel drive and that that truck isn't and I had to turn

08:01.120 --> 08:03.120
Around go back. I got her car

08:04.000 --> 08:08.160
That's the only good thing that German car is good for but she wanted an Audi and man

08:08.160 --> 08:11.320
I was just going cuz I live in West like up these big hills. Everybody else is wrecked

08:11.320 --> 08:14.640
I mean just wreck I saw 300 wreck cars not a hundred it was

08:17.040 --> 08:23.920
And I'm just like going I mean I'm not trying to an Audi commercial here ladies and gentlemen, but my lord that vehicle is incredible

08:25.200 --> 08:29.480
And there are all these other four-wheel drive cars just wrecked everywhere Range Rovers are all-wheel drive

08:29.480 --> 08:35.480
They were wrecked Subarus wrecked everywhere that Audi was like I was just a robot on rails through black ice

08:35.480 --> 08:37.480
20 miles the office unbelievable

08:39.000 --> 08:44.600
But a lot of people died in Texas, it's really sad Jesus Christ tonal shift Wow

08:45.040 --> 08:47.680
That sounds sincere. Yeah

08:48.440 --> 08:53.800
A lot of people died Audi's great, but a lot of people died because they didn't buy an Audi

08:53.800 --> 08:55.680
I'm not making a car commercial

08:55.680 --> 09:00.720
But if you don't buy an Audi you're gonna die about a minute of rambling about a great his wife's car is yeah

09:00.720 --> 09:06.920
We leading into going out to break reminding you that there are have been fatalities and there have that's that's fucked up

09:06.920 --> 09:13.720
Yeah, it's it's a little uncouth. Yeah, it makes me feel bad for making fun of something. That's awful that he did

09:13.720 --> 09:15.720
Yeah, and now I feel like

09:15.760 --> 09:21.200
One degree removed from being an awful person. I think that's what we do though. We live in that shame

09:23.000 --> 09:29.660
Yeah, that's fair so I wanted to cover this episode number one cuz it's Valentine's Day number two because

09:29.660 --> 09:33.940
This is the point at which Alex would know that Trump had been acquitted

09:33.940 --> 09:34.340
Yes

09:34.340 --> 09:37.340
He did his he did a special report on Saturday

09:37.340 --> 09:42.660
Which I tried to watch a bit of but it was mostly him talking about vaccines and I got really bored

09:42.660 --> 09:44.780
She wanted to hear about his take on the yeah

09:45.260 --> 09:46.540
He had said it was a setup

09:46.540 --> 09:50.940
He said this was this whole trial was a sham and it was all just set up to get Trump

09:50.940 --> 09:55.260
So now what happens whenever it worked out the way that we all knew it was going to well

09:55.260 --> 09:59.940
I think Alex has a I mean, it's bullshit, but he has actually a pretty decent spin. I think all right

10:00.060 --> 10:05.980
We have the insane trial of the president that they suddenly ended ish you had three days Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

10:06.580 --> 10:10.740
Ten hours a day of total lies against the president 30 hours of garbage

10:12.060 --> 10:14.960
Three hours by his lawyers doing half a decent job

10:14.960 --> 10:23.720
I'm gonna kill Trump the vice president. We're gonna burn everything down and they had to put their tail between their legs and drop it

10:24.160 --> 10:29.880
Because it was another giant fraud. Yeah, so I mean that's that's not a terrible spin of like AI

10:29.880 --> 10:35.080
They showed all these videos of Democrats saying things and then sure sure he had to quit him

10:35.080 --> 10:40.280
Yeah, it's having a conversation about like they weren't gonna I mean they weren't going to vote in

10:40.280 --> 10:46.080
a convicted and the fact that what how many Republicans voted with the Democrats

10:46.600 --> 10:53.960
Seven, I believe more than one is a crazy number. Yeah. Yeah, like that's it. That was a pretty high one of them was

10:54.480 --> 11:01.840
Directly going to be murdered. So there's that I would I would assume he would be a guaranteed. Yeah vote to come Romney's a lock

11:01.840 --> 11:06.500
I'm just saying that if you're going to be murdered, like I assume if Mike Pence was in the Senate

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
He would be like, yeah, I'm gonna have to

11:08.500 --> 11:13.540
No hanging for me, you know, like that kind of feel. Mm-hmm. I prefer not to acquit this

11:13.540 --> 11:17.620
Yeah, and Alex doesn't want to talk about like things like McConnell's comments about

11:18.540 --> 11:21.380
Totally is it was his fault, but we have a constitutional

11:23.020 --> 11:26.460
Yeah, cuz that that just that gets too messy that's so stupid

11:26.460 --> 11:33.800
Yeah, I I feel like you should know you should be embarrassed if you even try and say they did a half good job

11:33.800 --> 11:41.120
Van der Veen, you should be embarrassed. That was really really shameful stuff. It was yeah, although

11:41.680 --> 11:47.900
You know, we learned a little bit about what happens in Philly. That's true. He did learn a lot about Philly little Philly Delfia

11:47.900 --> 11:52.240
Yeah, yeah, I enjoyed that the portion that you and I watched

11:53.400 --> 11:58.520
He was talking about Philly and then a different point. He said Philly Delfia

11:58.520 --> 12:03.280
Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, that's good stuff. Yep. That's good stuff

12:03.320 --> 12:10.960
so when you're you know, a radio show host and you come in on the Valentine's Day Eve through a

12:13.680 --> 12:18.600
Movie like storm sure. Yes a perfect storm. Yes, you got it. You got a

12:19.120 --> 12:24.240
Cover the important stuff, right? You got to take care of the really important business this Audi

12:24.240 --> 12:30.760
We've got a lot. We've got Saturday Night Live is on a jag. They're on a roll

12:31.600 --> 12:35.080
more jokes about pedophilia not existing and

12:35.760 --> 12:38.320
more attacks about children being abused

12:39.200 --> 12:45.440
Ritualistically because I can tell you a large part of the writing staff are pedophiles and our devil worshippers Wow

12:46.680 --> 12:49.280
I'm gonna I'm gonna have to send a couple of texts

12:49.280 --> 12:51.280
I

12:52.040 --> 12:55.300
Heard some disturbing news Alex Jones is informed me

12:56.800 --> 12:59.020
That is a bit a bit much

12:59.600 --> 13:04.120
So what's going on? Is that the last two weeks there have been QAnon jokes on

13:04.480 --> 13:08.920
night live sure sure sure the first one was about the Super Bowl commercials and

13:09.960 --> 13:11.960
there was a

13:11.960 --> 13:18.800
A commercial for QAnon where it's like Papa John's Pizza, you know, we know sex trafficking in the basement. Yeah

13:20.320 --> 13:24.120
And then apparently this week Kate McKinnon did a character where she was a witch

13:24.320 --> 13:27.320
Like a QAnon witch who was really interested in eating children

13:27.440 --> 13:33.880
You know, I did an interview with weekend update and Alex is like they're up there pretending. This is the news

13:33.880 --> 13:39.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's SNL man. He's very mad. He's very mad

13:39.760 --> 13:41.840
Have you ever imagined for a second?

13:41.840 --> 13:47.680
What the SNL cast that we grew up with would have done if QAnon was around then there?

13:47.680 --> 13:53.360
They just what is Chris Farley gonna do about QAnon? They're just not prepared for that kind of stuff

13:53.920 --> 14:00.880
That's just not in the in there in their wheelhouse. Yeah, I don't want Adam Sandler doing prank QAnon fun. Never mind

14:00.880 --> 14:06.840
I want Adam Sandler doing prank QAnon phone calls. Sure. Yeah, um, so that's important business

14:06.840 --> 14:10.960
Sure, very important to talk about how SNL is making jokes about QAnon

14:10.960 --> 14:16.680
Yeah, that Alex tries to misconstrue as them making jokes. The pedophilia doesn't exist. Yeah, good job. Yeah

14:17.520 --> 14:19.000
and other

14:19.000 --> 14:22.280
Things he does are you know kind of distasteful, too

14:22.440 --> 14:29.160
I don't I don't know how to say this, but I found this really repulsive. Okay, Alex plays

14:29.160 --> 14:30.240
a

14:30.240 --> 14:36.480
Fight fight fight fight fight fight. Alex plays video of the pileup it

14:37.120 --> 14:41.480
Outside Fort Worth. Oh that giant 100 plus car pileup

14:41.480 --> 14:46.960
That's fucked he plays video that someone captured from like the other lanes

14:46.960 --> 14:50.040
Yeah, and so it's just playing the entire

14:50.560 --> 14:51.600
like

14:51.600 --> 14:59.880
Collision, it's terrifying and there's no real value to it. But Alex tries to pretend that there is yeah, but I want to give you

14:59.880 --> 15:03.500
Some viewer discretion when we come back. I don't show

15:04.180 --> 15:06.180
horrible tragedies

15:07.640 --> 15:13.200
To just show you a horrible tragedy because some people like a train wreck I see this I

15:14.080 --> 15:16.280
Was shown this on Friday by the crew. I

15:16.280 --> 15:21.640
Didn't know after 24 hours of this stuff happening up by Fort Worth in Dallas of what really happened

15:21.640 --> 15:24.920
I've seen the helicopter footage of a couple hundred cars all piled up

15:25.640 --> 15:27.960
We come back. I'm gonna show you what really happened

15:29.040 --> 15:31.720
From someone on the ground when it happened up close

15:31.880 --> 15:37.040
I've never seen anything in a Hollywood movie like this when cars are crashing and flipping and exploding

15:37.280 --> 15:43.600
wait till you see on the ground the actual pileup and the reason I'm gonna play it

15:43.600 --> 15:46.000
Will be explained when we come back

15:47.920 --> 15:50.520
So viewer discretion advised because people were dying

15:51.200 --> 15:54.600
seven people died on the footage you're about to see and

15:55.480 --> 15:58.760
I'm showing it to save some lives and to illustrate something

15:59.920 --> 16:01.920
Okay, let's stop right there

16:04.820 --> 16:09.280
We're not gonna be on air in a year and you backed us last year

16:09.280 --> 16:14.280
I told you that last year you came through we made it this year a little bit in the black just don't do it

16:14.280 --> 16:18.480
We'll be able to keep our projects going. You don't have to fund some other secret projects

16:18.480 --> 16:21.200
We're working on gosh. I could do a lot better if I had more money. I'm not

16:22.960 --> 16:29.240
I'm about to show you footage of seven people dying. Yeah. No, I need money to stay on air. Yeah

16:29.240 --> 16:33.600
Yeah, this was repulsive that is fucked. I was

16:34.320 --> 16:36.320
shocked by the

16:36.320 --> 16:42.960
Sort of the gross coldness. Yeah, the cynical ness of this the like and when he was saying

16:42.960 --> 16:48.400
I'm gonna show you what really happened. I was like, are you trying to say there's a conspiracy here?

16:48.400 --> 16:51.680
He wasn't there is no real value to this unless

16:52.340 --> 16:59.600
He wants to turn into a road safety show sure and then it's still a little bit first of all too soon

16:59.600 --> 17:05.920
I don't think you could use this footage to illuminate any particular finer points of hazardous driving

17:05.920 --> 17:12.320
Yeah, it was just like there is no reason to play this other than shock value or something

17:12.800 --> 17:16.720
It's it's offensive. Yeah, I mean, it's it's nakedly

17:17.420 --> 17:21.100
exploitative and macabre in a way that like makes you

17:22.360 --> 17:24.360
like

17:24.800 --> 17:30.040
It's hard not to think that he gets some sort of like weird fucked up like well

17:30.040 --> 17:33.880
You know that the people who watched faces of death where you're like

17:33.880 --> 17:39.560
There's something that you get out of this that I'll never understand. Yeah, I just won't be there for you

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
Yeah, you know like that kind of thing

17:41.640 --> 17:44.840
Yeah, it's a deal-breaker. Yeah, it's a real big. Yeah, it's real bad

17:44.840 --> 17:45.680
Yeah

17:45.680 --> 17:49.800
So he said that there's a reason and it's gonna become clear next segment

17:49.800 --> 17:54.020
And this next clip kind of is him expressing what that reason is

17:54.360 --> 17:59.160
But I I would say one this reason is stupid. That's to say bad second

17:59.160 --> 18:06.800
And the connection that he's trying to make you don't need to watch the video to get I'm showing you footage of Dallas

18:06.800 --> 18:08.800
Texas a live

18:08.840 --> 18:14.720
Shop there from top of one of the little tallest buildings. You can see it as a icy wasteland. No one on the streets

18:16.160 --> 18:22.160
Now if you're in Chicago or you're in New York you laugh at that you say hell we drive all the time

18:22.160 --> 18:27.280
Well, we're not used to it only happens once or twice a year and hundreds of people die

18:27.280 --> 18:31.120
Statewide when it unfolds and that's a teaching moment

18:31.960 --> 18:33.800
Americans haven't been under a Hitler

18:33.800 --> 18:38.560
They haven't been under a Stalin or a Mao or Fidel Castro or a Hugo Chavez

18:39.200 --> 18:46.040
So what he's trying to illustrate with playing this video is these people in Texas aren't used to ice driving

18:46.040 --> 18:53.100
And so there's a giant pileup much like Americans aren't used to dealing with a Hitler or a Stalin

18:53.100 --> 18:57.760
Yeah, and the tyranny and therefore we're metaphorically gonna have a pileup

18:58.240 --> 19:03.600
Now you don't need to watch that video to make that metaphor at all. There's absolutely no reason

19:03.600 --> 19:08.680
It doesn't add to your understanding of the metaphor. Yeah, you could just say it. It doesn't matter

19:08.720 --> 19:15.520
Yeah, and also what about fucking Obama? What about Bill Clinton? Nothing. They were fine

19:15.640 --> 19:21.000
They weren't they were no big deal. They weren't working for the devil yet. I think they were according to him

19:21.000 --> 19:26.160
He just didn't know wasn't comfortable enough talking about it. He didn't remember that they were also presidents

19:26.160 --> 19:28.440
He was trying to pretend he was serious back then. Yeah

19:29.160 --> 19:32.900
That's not good. No, I'm not like one of those people who says that everybody's the devil

19:32.920 --> 19:35.880
I'm not like David Icke who have become my best friend in ten years

19:36.140 --> 19:39.520
anyways, we've had about four devil presidents in my time and

19:40.200 --> 19:45.560
All of those we've never even had to deal with anything new like a Joe Biden, right?

19:45.560 --> 19:48.640
I just think I think it was it's

19:48.640 --> 19:53.980
The most tenuous connection to make in order to justify playing this video

19:53.980 --> 19:59.320
Yeah, and I don't respect the decision at all. I think it's disgusting and Alex even knows that

20:01.120 --> 20:03.120
This is on the ground in the other lane

20:03.680 --> 20:09.300
Radio listeners horrible footage. You're lucky. You're not seeing this 18-wheeler 50 miles. You're lucky. You're not seeing this

20:09.720 --> 20:13.600
It gets worse ones going 70 in a minute. Alex is saying you're lucky

20:13.600 --> 20:20.760
You're not seeing this to the radio audience Wow, but he's playing. I know you could just not know everybody could be lucky

20:20.760 --> 20:26.560
Yeah, we could all be lucky right now. Yeah, I would like to be lucky. Yeah, don't be like you don't be like you're lucky

20:26.560 --> 20:32.200
You're not watching my show. You're just listening to it. Yeah, you don't have to do it. It doesn't add anything

20:32.200 --> 20:36.200
It's it was just outrageous. It's cuz he wanted to watch it

20:36.200 --> 20:41.700
I think I think you might be might be onto something. It has to be something with with that's personal

20:41.700 --> 20:44.200
I I found I found that disgusting and

20:45.080 --> 20:46.760
unacceptable

20:46.760 --> 20:51.960
Much like Alex's thinking pattern. Oh, that's fair. So he has decided that

20:52.400 --> 20:57.720
Thousands are dead from the vaccine already when why well for what?

20:58.740 --> 21:04.400
Thousands, okay. He just says it. Okay. Well, then I guess I will move on but you got to know this

21:04.400 --> 21:12.040
Okay, it's actually probably 50 times higher. It's probably 50 times higher and we've now confirmed it. Okay, so

21:12.680 --> 21:18.100
I have a stack of news here where there are thousands of dead admitted and I think about one in 50

21:18.840 --> 21:23.280
Adverse reactions gets reported. So if thousands are dead, that's 50 times bigger

21:24.440 --> 21:26.560
No one knows from the vaccines

21:26.920 --> 21:31.480
So can you wonder can you identify like just really quickly?

21:31.480 --> 21:35.160
It's like it's on a surface level the problem with that thinking

21:36.080 --> 21:39.320
No, no, I don't see any problem if

21:40.200 --> 21:45.040
Some then there's probably 50 times more. That means it's proven, right?

21:45.800 --> 21:47.720
Yep, this is dumb

21:47.720 --> 21:51.360
I mean like if you were to live if I were listening to a professor

21:51.360 --> 21:56.040
I get a school right and I was in a lecture and they said something like that

21:56.040 --> 21:59.720
I would not trust them to teach the rest of the class. I might withdraw. Yeah

21:59.720 --> 22:05.200
Yeah, I wouldn't be real confident in a math class where they were like, okay, what's one plus one?

22:05.200 --> 22:09.160
But remember one is probably 50 or it could be more or it could be fewer

22:09.160 --> 22:15.780
No one knows who knows and I might be making up the one. Guess what? That one is the devil now

22:16.440 --> 22:18.160
Yikes. Yeah, not good

22:18.160 --> 22:25.040
So that that's the kind of thinking that Alex brings to the table just making assumptions and then multiplying things by whatever numbers he chooses

22:25.040 --> 22:30.000
Yeah, whatever he feels good about today. And then the other thing he does is just make shit up

22:30.000 --> 22:34.600
Like he does about this US News and World Reports article. Let's get to the good news

22:35.880 --> 22:37.880
first

22:38.720 --> 22:43.860
Because it's very very important the McRib the Pentagon touts vaccine

22:45.680 --> 22:51.420
Administration rate amid concerns of widespread refusal US News and World Report

22:51.420 --> 22:57.060
It goes on to say that the vast majority of the troops are

22:57.940 --> 23:02.620
Refusing the vaccine because it's voluntary. They try to statistical manipulation

23:02.620 --> 23:07.280
They go. Oh, but we did get a certain group that would said they'd take it and out of that group

23:08.100 --> 23:10.100
80-plus percent did take it

23:10.460 --> 23:13.940
So what do you do when the vast majority won't take it 98 percent?

23:15.180 --> 23:18.180
You take the group that will take it and then say oh

23:18.180 --> 23:22.540
80 plus percent of them 82 percent did

23:24.260 --> 23:30.580
82% that's the statistical game. They play Alex absolutely has not read this article about the troops and vaccinations

23:30.780 --> 23:36.700
He's claiming that the article says that there's a subsection of troops 82% of whom have received the vaccine

23:36.860 --> 23:39.540
That's the statistical game Alex claims

23:39.540 --> 23:41.000
This article is playing

23:41.000 --> 23:47.420
The stat of 82% is actually in reference to the percentage of vaccines the Pentagon has received that have been administered

23:47.420 --> 23:50.300
From the article quote Pentagon spokesman

23:50.300 --> 23:56.740
John Kirby told reporters the department has so far ordered more than 1 million doses and as of Thursday morning had received roughly

23:57.740 --> 23:59.740
968 thousand of those

24:00.380 --> 24:07.540
800,000 or about 82 percent have been administered almost 600,000 were first doses and more than 200,000 or second doses

24:07.540 --> 24:13.640
So they Alex has just seen the number and made up what it means. So they took the small subset of people

24:13.640 --> 24:21.920
Otherwise known as the people who possibly could have gotten it and they're manipulating those numbers to say that those people did get it

24:21.920 --> 24:25.400
I don't and then the people outside of those numbers. Well, they didn't get it

24:25.400 --> 24:31.280
No, Alex has just skimmed the article seen numbers and written a story in his head about what those numbers mean

24:31.280 --> 24:37.840
Yeah, this is what he does. He's really really bad at this. Yeah, I can't believe people actually take him seriously

24:37.840 --> 24:44.380
Yeah, he does. He does seem to play mad libs and then search articles for like numbers to circle and like what if I put

24:44.760 --> 24:50.460
82% here. Oh, it's great too. Cuz if you watch the video, he's got like 82% underline. Of course he does

24:50.460 --> 24:54.380
Yes, that's exactly what he does. He goes through articles underlies the numbers

24:55.120 --> 24:56.560
Do did it?

24:56.560 --> 24:58.560
Saw the underlined 82%

24:58.560 --> 25:06.640
He's like, I gotta figure out what I think that means. Yeah. Yeah. What could that 82% be? I can't possibly read a sentence

25:08.160 --> 25:12.480
Can't be bothered to do that kind of work. It's very hard. Yeah, as he makes up some more shit about this article

25:12.880 --> 25:17.640
We just saw on US News and World Report. I mean the military these evil people

25:17.640 --> 25:19.640
I mean you heard you can't trust them from Joe Biden

25:19.680 --> 25:24.560
They said pregnant women shouldn't take it because the British military said they shouldn't

25:24.560 --> 25:30.720
They were the ones that started before the US military British military said yeah pregnant women shouldn't take we had a bunch of miscarriages

25:30.720 --> 25:34.080
Oh, oh, but you don't say that in US News and World Report

25:34.080 --> 25:37.960
You just say the US military the rank-and-file pull that out of their ass, didn't you?

25:38.680 --> 25:43.360
Pisses me off. Excuse me. The pregnancy stuff is simply covered on a past episode

25:43.360 --> 25:45.180
So I don't get too bogged down in it here

25:45.180 --> 25:46.960
but this is just another instance of

25:46.960 --> 25:52.000
Alex making more shit up about this article because he hasn't read it and he's just using it as a prop to get mad about

25:52.000 --> 25:58.400
If Alex had actually read the article he would have found this quote from Air Force Brigadier General Paul Fredericks quote

25:58.400 --> 26:03.760
Are we seeing people who are declining to it? Yes, I've had people say that for a variety of reasons

26:03.960 --> 26:09.660
They're pregnant which is a very reasonable concern. They want to talk to their doctor first very reasonable concern

26:09.680 --> 26:12.140
So there are people who've said they don't want to get it

26:12.440 --> 26:19.400
This whole article is actually a big problem for Alex's narratives because he's been insistent that the vaccine is mandatory or it's gonna be mandatory

26:19.400 --> 26:25.080
But the fact that the military is allowing enlisted persons to decide if they want to get it or not makes him have to change

26:25.080 --> 26:29.360
The subject because the thing he was making his audience afraid about didn't happen

26:29.360 --> 26:34.360
He now has to pivot to making it look like the enlisted persons who don't get the vaccine or somehow being maligned

26:34.360 --> 26:40.480
Which this article doesn't support he didn't read it. No one listening is gonna read it. So this technique works perfectly

26:40.520 --> 26:45.320
It's all just meaningless though. Yes, just like it might as well not to do this

26:45.320 --> 26:53.720
yeah, and with the military that thing is you're most people aren't gonna look into it and for most people I would imagine that there

26:53.720 --> 26:59.500
Makes a certain sort of like sense that well the military would be mandated to get it because they're the military

26:59.680 --> 27:04.800
And that's that's the perception that Alex goes exactly and that's what you can you because most people wouldn't even

27:05.760 --> 27:11.400
Follow up on that or especially not Alex's listeners. They'd be like, yeah, the military is forced to do everything. Mm-hmm

27:11.400 --> 27:19.360
Yeah, so in this next clip Alex claims to have some information that he does not produce which means he's making it up

27:19.360 --> 27:22.320
Yeah, I got so many adverse reaction death reports

27:22.320 --> 27:27.920
I got over 200 upright here in just the last three days in the u.s. Alone. They shoot old people up

27:27.920 --> 27:30.240
They're dead in 15 minutes in many cases

27:31.480 --> 27:35.760
I mean folks here's thing. I used to be worried about stuff cuz I wanted to win the fight

27:35.760 --> 27:40.560
I was worried about my family and everything. Oh things are so crazy. Now this ain't gonna go on long

27:40.560 --> 27:46.820
Whatever is going on. Whatever is happening the number of people they're killing. Whatever is going on, baby

27:46.820 --> 27:50.660
We ain't never seen nothing like this. This is big. I

27:51.180 --> 27:55.660
Thought they put something in there kill you in five years. Oh, no, they don't kill your ass right now

27:55.900 --> 27:57.900
So yeah, I mean if you have these these

27:58.580 --> 28:01.660
200 why don't you talk about any of them doesn't produce any yeah

28:01.740 --> 28:05.700
Yeah, I would I would I would argue that I mean, you know

28:05.700 --> 28:09.980
If you just say something and you don't prove it or demonstrate it at all. I could just ignore it

28:09.980 --> 28:13.820
Yeah, especially something that when tied to your other rhetoric

28:14.380 --> 28:18.580
Is I guess license to go murder whomever you want, right?

28:18.980 --> 28:24.860
Because they're killing you in 15 minutes. They're killing your grandma right now in 15 minutes Dan

28:24.860 --> 28:32.260
Well, you thought you were gonna have a lovely five years to like hold your grandmother's hand as she dies from the government murder vaccine

28:32.260 --> 28:34.300
But now you don't even have that much time

28:34.300 --> 28:40.140
The only comfort I really take is hoping that people who listen to this would ask themselves at some point

28:40.300 --> 28:46.900
Does Alex actually read the things he talks about and look into it and then that might erode public confidence in his dumbass

28:46.900 --> 28:53.940
I could so a lot of the times when Alex is just rambling about something on air. It's something that our old friend

28:54.540 --> 28:58.500
Paul Joseph Watson. Oh, I've written it and Paul has struck again Oh

28:58.500 --> 29:06.420
Oh summit dot news links to BBC UK government could grant vaccine exemptions to ethnic minorities

29:06.420 --> 29:08.420
I heard this a few months ago in NPR

29:08.980 --> 29:15.180
Well black people are dumb, you know, we're liberals we can say that there did the UK say take shots

29:15.180 --> 29:17.480
They just they're like the US military. They're dumb

29:18.100 --> 29:23.860
You know, they just they just don't trust us. And so we're gonna have vaccine waivers for them

29:23.860 --> 29:27.540
All right, but they won't be able to leave their house or have a job, you know how they are

29:27.540 --> 29:29.300
But white people you're gonna take it

29:30.180 --> 29:34.180
So show the black people not to be scared you roll up your sleeve and take your shot

29:36.500 --> 29:40.980
This is just a total attack by these criminals to cover up Jeffrey Epstein and

29:40.980 --> 29:41.780
Whoa

29:41.780 --> 29:49.220
All the corruption the banking and the derivatives of the scams of the dollar implosion and the New World Order and the rigging and

29:49.220 --> 29:55.060
The cloning and the and so they just want to make the whole world hellish with mask on and checkpoints and passports

29:55.060 --> 30:01.140
So you forget all the crimes they committed and don't do anything about it. It's a dumb plan

30:02.020 --> 30:04.580
It's a dumb dumb plan boy

30:04.660 --> 30:10.340
It is hard not to think about what would have happened if you and all of your right-wing

30:10.620 --> 30:17.780
Lunatic dumb dumb friends had decided to take this whole fucking thing seriously way back in February of last year Dan

30:17.780 --> 30:21.740
Well, I think they did take it too seriously

30:21.740 --> 30:25.060
I'm sorry, I apologize in March of last year

30:25.900 --> 30:29.100
Would have been it would have been interesting would have been interesting. So quick point

30:29.100 --> 30:31.820
There is no link to the BBC and Paul's article

30:31.860 --> 30:35.420
There's a link to a story in the spectator and one in Sky News

30:35.780 --> 30:38.500
The Sky News article says nothing about exemptions

30:38.500 --> 30:43.140
But what Paul does is he cherry picks a very minor side point in the spectator article?

30:43.140 --> 30:48.100
Which he then turns into his headline because it has the potential to help boost white victimhood feelings

30:48.100 --> 30:51.780
This is an editorial column and one of the concerns it raises

30:52.060 --> 30:56.620
With the idea of vaccine passports being required for travel is according to this column

30:56.740 --> 31:00.460
Vaccine skepticism is higher in non-white communities in the UK sure

31:00.580 --> 31:08.140
It's really interesting how Paul works here Paul takes this quote from the Sky News article quote a government insider stressed

31:08.140 --> 31:15.300
There's nervousness about when such a system will even be announced publicly let alone rolled out for use if you read the article

31:15.300 --> 31:20.380
It does seem to be implied that the nervousness in question is about the vaccines efficacy and not moving too fast

31:21.100 --> 31:28.340
However, here's how Paul uses that line quote part of this nervousness is based around the perception that mandating

31:28.660 --> 31:35.820
Mandating vaccines for travel could be seen as racist because suspicion of vaccines and poor inoculation rates are commonplace within BAME

31:36.340 --> 31:37.500
communities

31:37.500 --> 31:43.180
He's taken the concerns raised by the editorial of the spectator and applied them to the quote from the Sky News

31:43.180 --> 31:47.900
Article without in any way demonstrating that the two are connected at all. No, they're connected

31:47.900 --> 31:48.540
This is Paul

31:48.540 --> 31:54.180
Just kind of making things up in order to justify writing a blog post about white identity fears that Alex can then report on

31:54.180 --> 31:59.700
In a super racist way on air because that's what their audience needs to stay interested

31:59.700 --> 32:01.980
Yeah, I do appreciate

32:02.620 --> 32:06.500
The the real lack of effort that went into that for Paul

32:06.500 --> 32:11.660
Yeah, like it is it is always real, you know heartwarming to know that some people

32:11.660 --> 32:15.140
Wake up at 9 go to work and they're done at 10

32:15.140 --> 32:20.140
Yeah, you know, it's just nice to know that that's a that's a dream that somebody can accomplish, you know, yeah

32:21.140 --> 32:26.180
And so transparent about it. Yeah, that's not very very weak. So not good

32:26.180 --> 32:33.500
So so far, I think we've seen just a real tragedy of a show. We see real sad Alex play a car crash

32:35.180 --> 32:41.120
Just make up nonsense about a couple articles. I didn't drive through a snowstorm and an outstorm for no reason

32:41.120 --> 32:47.300
I'm gonna deliver the guns cuz I'm alive and I'm not backing down in the name of Jesus Christ

32:47.300 --> 32:49.780
I declare war on Satan

32:58.100 --> 32:59.540
Good work

32:59.540 --> 33:02.900
Yeah, you know what four out of ten four out of ten

33:02.900 --> 33:07.740
Maybe I would argue that this is a good teaching moment as well for Alex. All right now

33:07.740 --> 33:12.260
I understand that we're not gonna get anywhere with the corona virus with him

33:12.260 --> 33:14.580
It's too we're too far gone for that

33:14.860 --> 33:20.700
But let me toss this out for you Dan if there were fewer cars on the road during an ice storm

33:21.580 --> 33:26.900
Mm-hmm. Don't you think that would be better at preventing accidents? Yes, right

33:27.060 --> 33:32.300
So perhaps if Alex wanted to do his part to prevent accidents

33:32.300 --> 33:35.520
He could have stayed home and done the show remotely now

33:35.520 --> 33:39.300
Do you understand how those things might be a connected?

33:39.300 --> 33:43.460
I understand the metaphor that you're making but I'd also like to say he did come in see now

33:43.460 --> 33:47.900
That is the problem that we're having all across the board. It is it's an issue

33:48.100 --> 33:51.460
So when Alex comes back for break after that pathetic growl

33:52.100 --> 33:54.100
very fake very long

33:55.340 --> 34:03.220
Passionless growl. Yeah, he starts complaining about how people think that he supported Trump because it somehow is good for his business

34:03.220 --> 34:07.740
Now, I know that I've heard him a hundred times say that his traffic went up

34:08.380 --> 34:13.020
Ridiculously. Yeah, once he started to kid in with Trump and all that was really good for his business. No, no

34:13.020 --> 34:17.060
No, it hurt his business. He was persecuted. Sure. Alex was

34:17.740 --> 34:23.700
Persecuted I got persecuted for supporting Trump you got persecuted for supporting Trump

34:23.740 --> 34:28.940
But we're not losers because we supported President Trump. He really won that

34:28.940 --> 34:37.500
Election and I don't just say that if he lost I'd say he lost I'd still say we have a Chinese agent in charge

34:37.500 --> 34:39.340
I don't lie to myself

34:39.340 --> 34:44.180
Okay, I did when I was 10 years old but not since about then. I want to know what's really going on

34:44.180 --> 34:51.700
That's what gives me an effectiveness in my life read that US News and World Report article then that's a good starting point

34:51.700 --> 34:55.500
I would I would argue he really wants to know what's not going on

34:55.500 --> 35:03.180
Or he doesn't want to know what is going on. Yes. Yeah, he desperately needs not

35:05.020 --> 35:07.360
Avoid what's going on? Yeah

35:09.820 --> 35:15.140
Which is why you support Trump, yeah, but there's bad news about Trump, but it's bad news mixed with good news

35:15.140 --> 35:18.260
Okay, but it's all bad news. Okay, but maybe it's good news. All right

35:18.900 --> 35:22.720
Trump's basically bankrupt. He's not just lost two billion out of the inside baseball

35:22.720 --> 35:25.540
They've got four or five thousand lawsuits against him

35:26.580 --> 35:29.280
But you know, we have the treated man. He's actually stronger than ever

35:30.220 --> 35:36.560
And he understands that and if more men were like President Trump if more men were like the supporters this broadcast, I mean that

35:37.300 --> 35:41.180
Who would be in this position, but he understands leadership like Colonel Travis did at the Alamo

35:42.100 --> 35:45.980
Drunkenly Travis knew he's gonna be killed. He sent that final letter. He knew what was about to happen

35:46.620 --> 35:51.500
But he couldn't back down because he believed the cause he signed on to it. He wasn't suicidal

35:51.500 --> 35:58.540
I can't get out of here so much like Jesus Christ said he was one to lay it down for others

36:00.220 --> 36:04.420
So that's what this comes down to Colonel Travis had nowhere else to go no

36:04.420 --> 36:09.700
No, no, he had nowhere else to go Trump may have nowhere else to go. Yeah, that's probably true

36:09.700 --> 36:14.620
So Trump put out a little statement about the impeachment acquittal. Did he?

36:14.620 --> 36:22.020
Yeah, and Alex Alex is kind of pissed off that no one's reading the full statement. Oh nice. Yeah, so nowhere

36:22.020 --> 36:26.740
Do you really see the president's statement you hear he made one, but you don't really it may be a line here a line there

36:26.740 --> 36:28.500
Let's read the whole thing together

36:28.500 --> 36:30.500
right now as

36:30.820 --> 36:32.820
Beautiful what he said, it's totally true

36:34.620 --> 36:40.260
National fall wrote the story. It's up at in full words calm president Trump releases statement on second impeachment acquittal

36:40.260 --> 36:45.700
President Trump through the office of the former president was a statement celebrating this

36:46.220 --> 36:52.420
Second Senate impeachment acquittal damn, right? He's the man the arena like oh look. He's under attack. You're like Oh Jones

36:52.420 --> 36:56.220
You're under attack. Oh boy. They're coming after you. What'd you think?

36:56.220 --> 37:01.460
I did you think I did this not to be attacked you think I did that cuz I don't expect a war

37:02.580 --> 37:04.980
You people don't get and I'm talking to our enemies

37:04.980 --> 37:10.020
You think I just want to line my pockets and sit around with you in some country club that I do think

37:10.580 --> 37:14.260
Yes, I agree without fighting evil. I feel alive. I feel strong

37:15.380 --> 37:20.420
You understand that you can put a gun to my head on my back it down you dumb sons of bitches

37:26.500 --> 37:29.820
It's real shame no one's reading the Trump statement I

37:29.820 --> 37:36.620
Do I do appreciate that it does it does appear that for most of the world

37:36.940 --> 37:42.380
We're finally past like having to deal with stuff. He says on the daily. Yeah, that's nice

37:42.380 --> 37:49.800
Yeah, everybody everybody enjoys that I I had I have personally some trouble whenever I see too much of him

37:49.900 --> 37:51.340
Yeah, yeah

37:51.340 --> 37:55.780
I don't want I don't want people that I would normally think of as sane

37:55.780 --> 38:02.060
To talk about him and not because I want exclusive domain over Alex don't know. I just don't think it's worth it. No

38:02.660 --> 38:08.280
Yeah, this is a problem for us, too. Yeah. Yeah, I don't value my own time

38:10.900 --> 38:15.340
Save yourselves. Yeah, we're too far gone. Yeah. Yeah, this all means nothing. Yeah

38:15.340 --> 38:20.140
We're not the people who hide a zombie bite. We have a zombie bite kick us out of the mall

38:20.180 --> 38:22.740
We're not supposed to be there. We'll be on the roof

38:22.740 --> 38:24.740
So

38:25.220 --> 38:28.780
Alex does get around to reading the statement and I will say I think he reads it in full

38:28.780 --> 38:32.420
But he does add some commentary and some of it is a little bit ridiculous

38:32.540 --> 38:36.940
No president has ever gone through anything like it and that's true

38:37.980 --> 38:44.300
That's the key and it continues because our opponents cannot forget the almost 75 million people

38:44.660 --> 38:49.300
Way more than that the greatest number ever for a sitting president who voted

38:49.300 --> 38:55.460
I was just a few months ago, and that's thing Trump had victory. It's there even though they lie about it folks

38:56.820 --> 39:01.420
He won those other six states by half a point or less. He won him by five points on average

39:03.400 --> 39:08.600
You understand that that's like what it's way more than quadruple the number of victory numbers

39:08.860 --> 39:13.620
That's why they're crapping their bridges. That's more than quadruple the number of victory numbers

39:14.660 --> 39:15.900
Yeah

39:15.900 --> 39:17.900
Kind of feels a lot like that

39:17.900 --> 39:19.900
50 times the amount of imaginary

39:20.660 --> 39:26.360
Vaccine deaths. Yeah, that doesn't sound like a reasonable number for someone to toss out there. I feel like Alex doesn't know much about

39:27.220 --> 39:32.660
Numbers. Math? No. Anything? Nope. Very little. So he gets to complaining about SNL

39:33.300 --> 39:41.620
And of course this leads into him yelling a bit about abuse towards children. Sure, sure. I don't respect his position on the issue

39:42.540 --> 39:47.020
Man, I got a lot of complaints about SNL. I I think we can let that one go

39:47.020 --> 39:51.780
Mm-hmm. I don't think we need to worry about that. No, there's there's really not not any reason to

39:52.420 --> 39:57.440
Engage and so that's that's one break and then he comes back and I want to tell you

39:58.500 --> 40:00.500
He's not killing time. I

40:01.280 --> 40:07.140
Would argue even mentioning SNL on your apparently political talk show would be killing time

40:07.140 --> 40:12.200
Well that that you know debatable if it's killing time. Sure. This next minute

40:12.200 --> 40:19.500
Definitely not. It sounds like alright ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here back live two more segments left than Owen Schroyer

40:19.500 --> 40:24.740
If he can get here in this snowstorm, we can run a rebroadcast if he can't or just loop this show

40:25.540 --> 40:27.540
info wars live six to eight

40:28.180 --> 40:31.240
Sunday nights is coming up if Ellen can get here

40:31.240 --> 40:34.500
Will you guys call him and see if he can get here because it is just insane

40:34.500 --> 40:41.820
Yes, this hosting ask him to come to work. Oh my gosh, Tom Pappert

40:43.460 --> 40:45.180
Emperor Palpatine

40:45.180 --> 40:46.620
the Sun

40:46.620 --> 40:53.280
He's like a hundredth generation clone of Palpatine as you know that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far far away Tom

40:53.980 --> 40:58.920
Pappertine. Oh, you don't know about star. He's great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great great great thousandth clone

40:58.920 --> 41:03.800
Is gonna be hosting with Sheldon after the broadcast. You don't want to miss it

41:05.640 --> 41:09.320
All right, I have a lot of stuff to hit here in fact I've got too much material

41:09.320 --> 41:14.360
It's not like I'm stalling out because I don't have information to cover here with 25 minutes left to go

41:14.920 --> 41:16.920
it's because

41:19.720 --> 41:23.160
This is surreal, I mean it is it's just surreal there's too much

41:23.160 --> 41:29.480
There's too much got a riff on Tom Papperts name being similar to Palpatine. Yep. Yep for a bit

41:30.320 --> 41:37.480
Dick what a dick people dying outside people dying outside. Let's see if Owen can get to work

41:37.800 --> 41:42.240
Yeah, great. Good boss. Good boss. Love working for you, buddy

41:42.240 --> 41:47.920
I'll say for what I would expect of Alex as a boss the fact that he's like we can go to rebroadcast if he can't

41:47.920 --> 41:54.680
That's true. That almost seems like that's that kind of a stand-up guy. Yeah, that is that is to be like no

41:54.680 --> 41:59.320
He gets here now or he's fired. Yeah, but that is also Scrooge being like you get Christmas off like

42:00.040 --> 42:02.840
Yeah, I guess that's nice. So he's not killing time

42:03.960 --> 42:08.640
Well, maybe he's killing some time. Okay, so here's the video of the granny being thrown off the cliff

42:08.640 --> 42:19.640
So, he plays this video that's a guy rolling a woman in a wheelchair

42:20.640 --> 42:24.160
Through a park and then it ends with him dumping her off a cliff

42:24.160 --> 42:30.840
So it is like that Conan O'Brien Walker, Texas Ranger sketch. It's well, there's a little bit of well, I mean

42:31.440 --> 42:34.840
There's some racial undertones for oh god. Damn it

42:34.840 --> 42:38.840
Look at her fighting back that old white lady. That old racist.

42:38.840 --> 42:40.840
Get rid of her!

42:40.840 --> 42:42.840
Yeah, there we go.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.840
Ahh, good, liberal.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.840
Oh, liberal ooh.

42:46.840 --> 42:56.840
This video is a campaign ad that was targeting Paul Ryan because he was gonna take take away Medicare.

42:56.840 --> 43:04.840
Yeah, yeah. This is at least a two-year-old ad that was against the GOP that Alex is playing as some kind of attack

43:04.840 --> 43:06.840
on liberals or something?

43:06.840 --> 43:08.840
Boo this man! Boo this man!

43:08.840 --> 43:09.840
Boo!

43:09.840 --> 43:14.840
Yeah, I was like this is this is surreal and Alex clearly hadn't watched it in advance

43:14.840 --> 43:20.240
He just knew it was an old lady getting dumped out of a wheelchair because he looks pretty surprised when the thing comes up

43:20.240 --> 43:22.240
and it says call Paul Ryan

43:22.240 --> 43:24.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:24.240 --> 43:28.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on now. Hold on one second.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.240
Oh boy.

43:30.240 --> 43:36.240
Yeah, so Alex, you know, he's in a bit of a fatalistic mood, you know.

43:36.240 --> 43:42.240
He already said earlier that, you know, we might not be here next year. Fuck that, we might not be here tomorrow.

43:42.240 --> 43:47.240
I got a final segment and a bunch of news I want to hit. I'm loaded for bear on that.

43:47.240 --> 43:52.240
But I'll just tell you all this, ladies and gentlemen, it's been a great pleasure to be on air with you.

43:52.240 --> 43:56.240
I don't know how long I'm going to be here. Things are so bad. Things are moving so fast

43:56.240 --> 43:59.240
that I'm not even sure we'll be here tomorrow, next week, next year.

43:59.240 --> 44:03.240
It's all up to God right now, but the bottom fell out.

44:03.240 --> 44:06.240
And it's just they're euthanizing the old people.

44:06.240 --> 44:10.240
I mean, we've got probably 5% death rates at nursing homes to take the shot

44:10.240 --> 44:12.240
and they've successfully covered up most areas.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.240
OK, that's a ridiculous number.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.240
All right. OK, hold on. Even then.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.240
He can't just make up numbers like that.

44:19.240 --> 44:23.240
No. No. But even then, what's the current bet? Never mind.

44:23.240 --> 44:27.240
I don't even know. Just stop. Just stop. Just stop.

44:27.240 --> 44:30.240
One of the things that I think is interesting is Alex is talking pretty fatalistically.

44:30.240 --> 44:33.240
He's talking a lot of, uh, we're gone. We're done.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.240
It looks like Plan B is back in play.

44:35.240 --> 44:39.240
Now, I won't say that I'm falling for it again or anything like that,

44:39.240 --> 44:44.240
or thinking that he's talking for real, but I do need to tell you this, and I do think it's important.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.240
What's that?

44:45.240 --> 44:47.240
He's playing a lot of doors.

44:47.240 --> 44:53.240
He's playing a lot of songs by the doors as bumper music.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.240
So he's in a mood.

44:54.240 --> 44:57.240
There's a lot of, like, this is the end, my friend.

44:57.240 --> 45:00.240
A lot of those sorts of songs.

45:00.240 --> 45:03.240
And it honestly bums me out, mostly because I don't like the doors,

45:03.240 --> 45:06.240
but also it has, like, such a scent.

45:06.240 --> 45:10.240
Like, the mood of the music that he's playing on a very regular basis,

45:10.240 --> 45:14.240
like multiple coming in from commercials per show.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.240
Little Mothlin?

45:15.240 --> 45:20.240
Yeah, or Doors songs. It has the tone of a dirge.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.240
Okay. All right. Let's see how this goes.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.240
Yeah, I don't know.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.240
I just, I think...

45:26.240 --> 45:31.240
I will say that if it doesn't end soon and he keeps playing the doors, I'm gonna be pissed.

45:31.240 --> 45:37.240
You know, one thing that I realized after the impeachment trial was that

45:37.240 --> 45:41.240
I don't think that's the appropriate punishment.

45:41.240 --> 45:47.240
And I think the same thing for Alex. I don't think the appropriate punishment is to, like, take him off the air.

45:47.240 --> 45:53.240
I don't think the appropriate punishment for Trump is to take him away from politics or anything.

45:53.240 --> 45:57.240
They should have no money. Zero money. Take their money.

45:57.240 --> 46:02.240
If the impeachment trial was like, yeah, sure, run for office again, with nothing.

46:02.240 --> 46:04.240
I got broke.

46:04.240 --> 46:08.240
I think if people do things that have civic, or civil penalties,

46:08.240 --> 46:11.240
then by all means they should be sued and what have you.

46:11.240 --> 46:15.240
And I don't want what I'm about to say to be like, no, don't sue Alex.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.240
Like people who he has wronged.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
Sure, sure, sure.

46:18.240 --> 46:23.240
But I think that I'm not particularly concerned with him having money or not having money.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.240
I'm concerned about the impact that he can have.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.240
Sure, sure, sure.

46:26.240 --> 46:34.240
I think a far greater punishment for him is the illumination and explanation of how bullshit everything he does is.

46:34.240 --> 46:35.240
Right.

46:35.240 --> 46:44.240
And how he's basically defrauding people with the posture of, like, some guy who's against the system when all he really is is a fucking idiot.

46:44.240 --> 46:49.240
Right, and I want to take away the thing he cares about most.

46:49.240 --> 46:51.240
Memories of Colonel Travis.

46:51.240 --> 46:53.240
I'll take those too.

46:53.240 --> 46:55.240
If I could sue him for those, I would.

46:55.240 --> 47:01.240
So, this show has been largely devoid of meaning?

47:01.240 --> 47:03.240
No, no, no. SNL.

47:03.240 --> 47:05.240
Well, and there's some more pop culture grievance.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.240
Sure.

47:06.240 --> 47:10.240
Because Alex has found a video of Run DMC.

47:10.240 --> 47:13.240
Run DMC, the current stars?

47:13.240 --> 47:14.240
Well, it's just DMC.

47:14.240 --> 47:15.240
Current stars Run DMC?

47:15.240 --> 47:18.240
They did a little song about the vaccine.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.240
Okay.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
And Alex is not happy about it.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.240
Alright.

47:21.240 --> 47:27.240
Run DMC members now put out this, I guess the money must be good, this type of garbage.

47:27.240 --> 47:28.240
Then I got something even sicker.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.240
Here it is.

47:29.240 --> 47:35.240
I got the vaccine, you got the vaccine, they got the vaccine, we got the vaccine.

47:35.240 --> 47:40.240
We can get back to normal, let me inform you, let's all get the vaccine.

47:40.240 --> 47:44.240
Look, I think that there's plenty of valid criticisms about this song.

47:44.240 --> 47:46.240
Oh, do you mean that it's great?

47:46.240 --> 47:48.240
That it's too good for the rest of us?

47:48.240 --> 47:53.240
This isn't really my territory to critique too much.

47:53.240 --> 47:58.240
But I will say that Alex was far less critical of Mike Adams' rap career.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.240
That is fair.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.240
That is fair.

48:00.240 --> 48:04.240
His weird Ebola rap songs.

48:04.240 --> 48:10.240
I mean, I respect what they're doing, it's tough to hear an afterschool special from DMC.

48:10.240 --> 48:13.240
It is tough to hear a PSA.

48:13.240 --> 48:20.240
I just, I don't really know, I don't know, it just seems weird that Alex would care that much.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.240
Why?

48:21.240 --> 48:22.240
Why?

48:22.240 --> 48:23.240
Because he's filling fucking time.

48:23.240 --> 48:24.240
Right.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.240
No, that's what I'm saying.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.240
Yeah, he's got nothing.

48:26.240 --> 48:30.240
Like, this is what he spends his other time with at the end of the show.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.240
Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.240
You're gonna take his shots, here it is.

48:35.240 --> 48:38.240
What if Bill Gates disappeared?

48:38.240 --> 48:40.240
No problem.

48:40.240 --> 48:44.240
I will buy many Gates and solve the problem.

48:44.240 --> 48:50.240
Alex plays a video from like a YouTube channel called OMSOM, I believe, OMSOM.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.240
And it's like, it's for kids.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.240
It's an educational video for kids.

48:54.240 --> 48:58.240
They have a big series of videos of what would happen if blank disappeared.

48:58.240 --> 49:03.240
And so one of the recent ones is what would happen if the year 2016 disappeared?

49:03.240 --> 49:06.240
What would happen if numbers disappeared?

49:06.240 --> 49:09.240
And it's like animations for kids.

49:09.240 --> 49:12.240
And there's one about what would happen if Bill Gates disappeared.

49:12.240 --> 49:16.240
And some of it is like, well, he's a big philanthropist, a lot of that money would be gone.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.240
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

49:17.240 --> 49:22.240
And then the last one I think is like, Warren Buffett would miss his best friend.

49:22.240 --> 49:26.240
It's like, why are you commenting on this stupid video for kids?

49:26.240 --> 49:31.240
Because that's the first thing that he can engage with on an equal footing.

49:31.240 --> 49:35.240
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.240
It's for kids.

49:37.240 --> 49:45.240
I mean, look, I'm not gonna say that that doesn't have a kind of propaganda feel to it.

49:45.240 --> 49:49.240
I'm not gonna say that making a video where you're like, what if Bill Gates was gone?

49:49.240 --> 49:56.240
That didn't also include like, well, it's possible that his money would be shuffled back into the economy

49:56.240 --> 49:59.240
and put into places where maybe he doesn't have half of it.

49:59.240 --> 50:03.240
Sure, he's a philanthropist, but maybe he's still got $20 billion and he should go fuck himself.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.240
That might be complicated for children.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.240
It might be a little bit difficult.

50:07.240 --> 50:10.240
I accept the point that you're making. This is not the critique that Alex has.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.240
No, that's true.

50:11.240 --> 50:20.240
Yeah, hey, I get what you're saying. I hear it being a little bit weird, but it's also a giant public figure.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.240
Yeah, totally. No, of course.

50:22.240 --> 50:30.240
I don't know. I didn't watch the whole thing, but the stuff that Alex plays is just like, alright, this isn't like Bill Gates is our god.

50:30.240 --> 50:36.240
Yeah, you know what? If he went more like a Starship Troopers route where he's like,

50:36.240 --> 50:43.240
doesn't it seem a little bit weird that we're making these kind of campaign videos that lionize these types of public figures

50:43.240 --> 50:47.240
when what we should be doing is talking about the issues and policies and stuff like that?

50:47.240 --> 50:49.240
But even then, he's talking about a kid's video.

50:49.240 --> 50:51.240
But then look at Trump ads.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.240
No, I know. Of course.

50:53.240 --> 50:55.240
That argument cuts both directions.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.240
Of course. That's never stopped him before.

50:57.240 --> 51:05.240
True. I don't know. I just, you know, I was feeling like there wasn't much happening here, but there was a lot happening.

51:05.240 --> 51:15.240
You know, it was really disgusting, the playing of the crash, the going right into an ad after talking about it.

51:15.240 --> 51:19.240
And so much of this vaccine nonsense is sad.

51:19.240 --> 51:24.240
And it really makes you think that this is how he ends the show.

51:24.240 --> 51:31.240
I will now go into an incredible gauntlet of frozen roads and road warrior level crashes to get back to my family

51:31.240 --> 51:35.240
and hopefully back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central for the live broadcast. I want to thank the crew for a great job.

51:35.240 --> 51:43.240
Coming up on the other side on the Infowars Network stream is Tom Pappert of NationalFile.com.

51:43.240 --> 51:47.240
There's no reason that he needed to come in at all.

51:47.240 --> 51:48.240
Nope.

51:48.240 --> 51:53.240
Tom Pappert is in, you know, he's not in Texas.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.240
Nope.

51:54.240 --> 51:58.240
Like, he does it remotely. Alex could have just set up a little cam at his house.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.240
Wouldn't have been hard.

51:59.240 --> 52:01.240
No need, no need. This is all for nothing.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.240
Yep.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.240
It's all a waste, just to get out of the house on Valentine's Day.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.240
Yep.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.240
Alright. Okay.

52:07.240 --> 52:10.240
Oh, also they debuted in, I don't know if it was debuted, but this is the first time I saw it.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.240
There was a new commercial for my Patriot Supply.

52:12.240 --> 52:13.240
Uh-huh.

52:13.240 --> 52:17.240
And Alex is at their warehouse that is in Salt Lake City, Utah.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.240
Okay.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.240
That's why he went to Utah.

52:19.240 --> 52:22.240
That's why he went to Utah, to cut a clip? Oh, what a dick.

52:22.240 --> 52:24.240
Yeah, he's there at the warehouse.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.240
He's shooting promos?

52:25.240 --> 52:26.240
Yeah.

52:26.240 --> 52:27.240
What an asshole.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.240
I think that must have been why he went, or at least part of it.

52:29.240 --> 52:30.240
Yeah.

52:30.240 --> 52:31.240
I mean, maybe it's, maybe it's, you know.

52:31.240 --> 52:33.240
Eh, kill two birds with one stone. You're already there.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.240
But that's at least part of it.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
Yeah.

52:35.240 --> 52:41.240
That explains why, like, I mean, look, again, I love you, Utah, but not the number one vacation destination, necessarily.

52:41.240 --> 52:46.240
Um, so yeah, he was, I, uh, I don't have any clips of it because it's just that I'm talking about how great the food is.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

52:47.240 --> 52:49.240
Although, there is a kind of a funny part where he's like-

52:49.240 --> 52:52.240
You know what that's like? That's a little bit like if you were to say,

52:52.240 --> 52:58.240
hey, all you viewers, or all you listeners, you're lucky not to be watching this video right now.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.240
But instead, you just didn't play it, Dan.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.240
True, true.

53:01.240 --> 53:02.240
Yeah.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
Yeah.

53:03.240 --> 53:04.240
Think about that.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.240
Hmm.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.240
Restraint.

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
Yeah.

53:07.240 --> 53:12.240
Um, did you know that if you get my Patriot Supply stuff and you open up one of those buckets-

53:12.240 --> 53:13.240
What's that?

53:13.240 --> 53:14.240
You gotta be careful.

53:14.240 --> 53:21.240
You might not be able to get it closed because there's so much food in it.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.240
They say that like three times.

53:23.240 --> 53:28.240
It's all just one, it's all just a muffin. Like, you pull it up and then it pops out and they're like,

53:28.240 --> 53:31.240
haha, it's a big muffin. You can eat it forever.

53:31.240 --> 53:34.240
I would be charmed by that.

53:34.240 --> 53:40.240
Um, so yeah, I don't know. I found this episode to be a little frustrating.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.240
No, it's great. There's a lot going on.

53:42.240 --> 53:49.240
Children's videos, Run DMC vaccine songs, SNL complaining, like everything just seems so trivial.

53:49.240 --> 53:50.240
I feel like-

53:50.240 --> 53:51.240
It's trivial.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.240
Big stuff is happening.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.240
Yeah, yeah.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.240
Yeah.

53:54.240 --> 54:01.240
I think that Alex on some level didn't have as much skin in the game with the impeachment as you might have thought he might.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
Yeah.

54:02.240 --> 54:07.240
And then the spin of they just played clips of Democrats saying stuff and how do you defend against that?

54:07.240 --> 54:08.240
Right.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.240
As if that was legally relevant.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.240
Yeah, no kidding.

54:10.240 --> 54:14.240
And I think that works for him. So, I don't know.

54:14.240 --> 54:17.240
I'm excited to see if he keeps playing the doors.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.240
Yeah.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.240
And if that is a bad omen-

54:20.240 --> 54:21.240
You want to see how sad he gets?

54:21.240 --> 54:22.240
Yes.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
I'm excited to see how sad boy he goes.

54:23.240 --> 54:24.240
Yeah.

54:24.240 --> 54:25.240
Yeah.

54:25.240 --> 54:30.240
Oh, I can only imagine. If he comes in from break with like the sound of silence, then we know it's over.

54:30.240 --> 54:36.240
He's just singing along with Elliot Smith instead of you belong to the city.

54:36.240 --> 54:40.240
Oh, it starts raining at the Interwar Studio.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
How?

54:41.240 --> 54:44.240
Oh, I paid $50,000 for a rain system.

54:44.240 --> 54:48.240
We got sprinklers up there. They're always going 24-7 now.

54:48.240 --> 54:49.240
Yep. It just fit the mood.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.240
It's just how I feel.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.240
Yep.

54:51.240 --> 54:58.240
If you can afford to have your environment reflect your inner peace, then yeah, but I'm just sad.

54:58.240 --> 55:04.240
Well, I guess we'll be back to find out what the next step in this adventure is.

55:04.240 --> 55:05.240
Indeed we will.

55:05.240 --> 55:06.240
But until then, we have a website.

55:06.240 --> 55:08.240
We do have a website. It's knowledgefight.com.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.240
Yep. We're also on Twitter.

55:09.240 --> 55:12.240
We are on Twitter. It's at knowledgefight.net. Go to bed Jordan.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.240
We're also on Facebook.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.240
We are on Facebook and iTunes.

55:15.240 --> 55:20.240
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now.

55:20.240 --> 55:25.240
Yep. We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo. I'm Leo. I'm DZXClark. I'm Daryl Rundis.

55:25.240 --> 55:28.240
I'm Alex Jones's wife's auntie.

55:28.240 --> 55:32.240
Andy in Kansas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.

55:32.240 --> 55:35.240
Hello, Alex. I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.

55:35.240 --> 55:44.240
I love you.
