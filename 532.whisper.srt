Knowledgefight!

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying,

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We are the bad guys, knowledgefight!

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight!

Andy and Kansas!

Andy and, Andy!

33
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's time to pray!

34
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding!

35
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work!

36
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Knowledgefight!

37
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-knowledgefight.com

38
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love you.

39
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan.

40
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Jordan!

41
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're couple dudes who like to drink novelty beverages in their own homes and sit around

42
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It does appear that that is our plan for the time being right now, Dan.

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, Jordan, we are recording this separately, probably the first actual episode that we've

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
recorded over a distance.

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a little bit weird.

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sure!

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, that remains to be seen as to whether or not it's an actual episode now.

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I set out with the intention of a regular episode-ish, kind of, kind of a mini episode.

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't want to, again, I want to stress to everybody that we're not going to have episodes

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but the circumstances kind of demanded this week.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We had to jump on the horse and get something together.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, I don't think that's a terrible idea.

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But, simultaneously, we can't get together.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because Chicago has waist-deep snow outside.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's bad.

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's really bad.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I ran out of coffee.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I ran out of coffee last night, Dan.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So this morning, I was about to take the dogs out for a walk and I always start a cup of

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
coffee, a pot of coffee, before I take the dogs out and I realized in that moment I have

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
none.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, I had to walk through close to a mile of waist-deep snow to get some coffee.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was the most brutal morning I've ever had.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, I walked down to the grocery store because I needed some salad stuff for lunch and it

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
was just a dead zone.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There was nobody there.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was fantastic.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I mean, other than the logistical problems that everyone's dealing with, the fact that

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
there was no one at a grocery store was pretty nice.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There are some advantages.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, I guess my bright spot is that you and I are both doing relatively alright with this.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I mean, it was coming down all day, all night yesterday.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Just a disaster.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Last night, it was one of the first times I've seen that kind of snowstorm and I was

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
like, man, I think I'm actually scared for Chicago.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Look, we get covered in snow.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's fine.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But this one was like, oh shit, this one might be too much for us.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Whenever people start talking in feet, it's like, alright, hold on.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You didn't say 16 inches.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You said multiple feet.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's trouble.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's trouble.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright, so the reason that we needed to jump on the old Zoom here and get an episode together

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
was because Alex is also dealing with inclement weather.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Naturally.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,560
He's got some, you know, Texas is seeing some unprecedented winter storms that are happening

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:05,960
right now and Infowars Studio has been struck by the ice, the Winter Queen.

93
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,880
What's the name of the character in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe?

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,200
I think it's just the Ice Queen.

95
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah.

96
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Okay.

97
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Well, anyway, Alex wants some Turkish delight and...

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Okay.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Alright.

100
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Okay.

101
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Running out of references.

102
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
We'll stop there.

103
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Let's just name all of the...

104
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Voyage of the Dawn Treader.

105
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Boy and his horse.

106
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Or Horse and his Boy.

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Sorry.

108
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Yeah.

109
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Silver Chair.

110
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Prince Caspian.

111
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Silver Chair.

112
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

113
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Right.

114
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I think I said that first.

115
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
You did.

116
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
You're missing two of them.

117
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,600
You're missing the final two.

118
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,160
The Magician's Apprentice.

119
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,880
Oh, close.

120
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Sorcerer's Apprentice.

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
No.

122
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Oh, real close.

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
The Magician's Nephew.

124
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Yes.

125
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
There you go.

126
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,400
What's the last one?

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,240
I think I forgot.

128
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,960
I think it's just the last battle.

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,520
Oh, that's probably it.

130
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,240
Very boring.

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
It's a really boring book.

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Can't believe I forgot The Magician's Nephew.

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
What a stupid name for a book.

134
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
You know what?

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,920
I think that one's always been my favorite.

136
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I always liked that one.

137
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,920
The little rings that they go into the little middle of the world to teleport thing.

138
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Always fun.

139
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,840
I read the hell out of those books and I don't think I remember the plot of any of the...

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,560
At least the last four of them.

141
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,640
Oh, no.

142
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
That's fine.

143
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
That is totally fine.

144
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,800
Magician's Nephew is the prequel, though, and that's why I've always liked it.

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,840
It's the prequel to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

146
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Oh, okay.

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,360
So it's like the Tokyo Drift of the...

148
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Exactly.

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Yes.

150
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Yes.

151
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,840
Before the main characters die.

152
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Sure.

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,280
So, Jordan, we got some Alex Jones stupidity to deal with.

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,840
It'll be a little bit of a briefer episode, but I wanted to check in with how he's doing

155
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,440
in Occupied by Ice, Austin.

156
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
But before we do that, Jordan, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who

157
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
signed up and are supporting the show.

158
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,260
Oh, that's a great idea.

159
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,720
So first, Bill W., thank you so much for your policy walk.

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm a policy walk.

161
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Thanks Bill.

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Thanks, Bill.

163
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,280
Next, Jordan th, not Jordan th.

164
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Thank you so much.

165
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
You're now policy want.

166
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,320
I'm a policy walk.

167
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Thanks Jordan.

168
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Great name.

169
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Oh, look at that.

170
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Ah.

171
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
There we go.

172
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
You're playing on my side of the streets.

173
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Next, Nicholas B. Thanks, Nicholas.

174
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Next, Andrew A. Thank you so much for your now policy walk.

175
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm a policy walk.

176
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,080
Thank you Andrew Aa.

177
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,880
Next, Amelia are thank you so much for your now policy walk.

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
I'm a policy walk.

179
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,160
Thanks Amelia. And finally, Drax. Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

180
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,520
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much, Drax.

181
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,640
You want to say hi to Drax? Maybe a hi Drax?

182
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,240
I don't know what I did. I saw it. I saw that joke coming.

183
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,200
Yeah, a mile away. I tried to duck, and you still hit me in the face with it, so that happens.

184
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,240
Yep. Well, sorry, I have cookies on the mind.

185
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think we've got one more little piece of...

186
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,920
I think we've got one more little piece of... We're getting into this place of...

187
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,960
We're just shouting people out for no reason at this point, but we do have one reason for

188
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,440
this particular shout out. We have one particular reason, and that is it is their anniversary

189
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:30,680
today, I believe. Bonnie and Eric, happy 20th wedding anniversary for Wednesday the 17th.

190
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,880
20 years, Dan. That's exciting. That's the piano anniversary, right? The 20th is the piano?

191
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First is paper. Second is silver. No, wait, that's much later.

192
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,080
You know, the customary gifts thing that you're supposed to give on anniversaries.

193
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,680
Sure. Of course. 20th is pianos. I hope you guys

194
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,600
exchanged pianos, and... That would be the right way to do it.

195
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:01,240
Yeah. This is taking me back to my hosting stand-up comedy days. I like to do, you know,

196
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,560
you start out every show at Zany's with, hey, anybody celebrating anything tonight?

197
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,160
The difference here is that people have told us that they're celebrating something as opposed

198
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,920
to us starting the show having to fish for something. That's fair. It is different.

199
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:25,400
It's more celebratory, less sad. So, Jordan, on the 16th, or maybe it was yesterday,

200
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:33,320
I think it was the 15th, actually, Alex put out a series of short vignettes of himself at the

201
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,640
Infowars studio. Lights are out in the studio. There's also a couple of them where he's outside

202
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,480
yelling in the snow. Sure. Well, that just makes sense, though. It's a load of nonsense,

203
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,520
and we're going to talk about it. But first, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

204
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,000
If a dog starts running at you, don't be scared. Yell at it, throw rocks at it. It'll run off most

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,920
of the time if you're not on its property. Whoa. Dogs know about property rights.

206
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,640
Wow. That's the plan. That's the trick. Yeah.

207
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,360
Dogs are very interested in borders. They don't like immigration from house to house.

208
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,120
That's the situation. Dogs are libertarians. They're part of the Austrian school.

209
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,960
I feel like this is just Alex protecting other people from his mistakes. He's hurt so many dogs

210
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,400
because he was afraid of them, and now he's sharing his wisdom with the rest of the world.

211
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,440
Hey, guys. Just throw a rock at it. It's bad to be a dog murderer.

212
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,240
Just throw a rock at the dog. That's fine. That's enough.

213
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,800
Yeah. Don't shoot too hard. So, Jordan, we're here recording on Tuesday,

214
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,040
and as the time of this episode being put together,

215
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,040
InfoWars has essentially been off air since Sunday evening.

216
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,840
Cancel culture.

217
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,240
Austin and most of Texas is dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime winter storm that has

218
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,600
left countless people without power in severe conditions. It appears that the InfoWars studio

219
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,280
has been left also without power, and that means no show for Alex. It makes sense, and I don't

220
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,960
think anyone would bat an eye if he just got on air and said that there was a weather emergency

221
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,960
and they had to take an unplanned break in programming. It could be an effective way to

222
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,080
push emergency food sales even, so it might not end up being a total money loss if he did that,

223
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,760
but Alex does not go that route. Instead of just expressing solidarity with the people of Texas,

224
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,000
encouraging people to stay inside if possible, and donating to a mutual aid fund,

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,920
Alex decided to record a video of himself at the InfoWars studio with the lights off,

226
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,520
explaining how power outages are actually a globalist conspiracy.

227
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,000
Really? We had to get there, huh? I would prefer a scaler attack. I want a scaler attack. I want

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,200
aliens if we're gonna do this. Globalist conspiracy. We'll get to the specifics of

229
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,000
this, but right off the bat, I wanted to explain why Alex feels the need to make this conspiracy

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,960
instead of just being, you know, a normal kind of thing. You know, you're a human. You accept that

231
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,640
inclement weather happens, and sometimes it gets in the way. I have a reason, I think, that he might

232
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:02,280
want this to be a conspiracy. Let's see if it's on my list. I'm just gonna go with mainly one of the

233
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,040
large contributors to this disaster being so much worse is his state actually being interested in

234
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,920
following the policies that he himself advocates for. All right, I'm gonna cross number four off

235
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,160
the list. That was number four. There we go. The first reason is that Alex has a vested interest

236
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,040
in infantilizing his audience. He needs their critical thinking skills to be on a child's level,

237
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,000
so whenever he has the chance he creates childish narratives. When you're in bed and you hear a bump

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,920
you could either think that it's the water heater or you could think it's a viking who's invaded

239
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,280
your house to come and get you. Adults are really capable, you know, they're able to reason it out,

240
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,760
that there's no reason a viking would be in your home, but for children their minds gravitate to

241
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,200
the more exciting possibilities, which is often nonsense, but it appeals to a particular emotional

242
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:56,520
need and a drive that children have. A quick question, is it around like 860 AD? In which case

243
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:02,120
it is a terrifying time for viking. Time travel is possible. You have a time traveling water heater.

244
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,080
Knowing that the noise is the water heater doesn't prompt an irrational response in a person.

245
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,080
They can ignore it, or if it's a serious noise they can choose to call a technician.

246
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,080
If you can convince people though that it's actually a viking who almost got them,

247
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,320
you might be able to sell them all sorts of products to protect against vikings or even

248
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,400
documentaries where you explain how vikings operate and how to avoid their attack plans.

249
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,720
Keeping the audience in a state where they don't deal with the problems that come up in a boring

250
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,760
but ultimately real way and keeping them fixated on childish emotional interpretations of every

251
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,440
stimulus they receive is essential for Alex's business model, so even a giant storm can't

252
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,360
just be a storm. It's clearly an attack on conservatives. Absolutely. The second reason

253
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,080
that Alex has a strong interest in presenting this storm as some kind of an act of foul play is that

254
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,320
it's really something that just happens in nature, and if so, he should have been prepared for it.

255
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,880
His brand is largely built around being a prepper type of guy, so the first question that comes up

256
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,520
in the case of his network being taken offline by a storm is naturally, why weren't you prepared for

257
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,800
that? A winter storm like this hitting Texas is obviously a very unlikely event and something that

258
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,960
the infrastructure was unprepared for, and my heart goes out to everyone who's dealing with the

259
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,760
consequences of it, but for Alex, the fact that he could be caught off guard by a natural event,

260
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,000
that's a contradiction of the way he wants the audience to see him, and so obviously you're

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,360
supposed to be prepared for the literal end of the world. I would imagine that includes some

262
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,120
sort of the power grid going down, right? Yeah, you touched on the fourth one, which is the

263
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,040
state of Texas and how they operate, and we'll talk about that a little bit down the line,

264
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,400
but the third issue is that a storm like this brings into sharp focus some of the elements of

265
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:55,240
the climate change conversation that Alex doesn't want people to think about. As the climate changes

266
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,800
and weather events become more severe, they're going to test long-standing assumptions about

267
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,240
infrastructure and how we build. For instance, houses are designed differently in different parts

268
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:13,080
of the country, like in California they prioritize earthquake protection, whereas in Missouri where

269
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,600
I grew up, every single family home that you're going to find has a basement because of tornadoes.

270
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,720
Right. So, you know, basements are less prevalent in flood prone regions. Yeah, Florida is not known

271
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,800
for having tons of basements that are literally underneath the swamp. Yeah, and as, you know,

272
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,840
different sorts of weather patterns and more severe storms hit different areas, you're going

273
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:45,240
to see those things, the long-standing assumptions that we've had, not be enough to suffice, and Alex

274
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,560
doesn't want the audience to think about that because it requires shifting ideas and paradigms

275
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,040
and he's not into that. Of course. I have a plan. Here's my plan, okay, because as shifting weather

276
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,640
patterns are going to test our assumptions and our architecture, what if now, and hear me out,

277
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:13,000
we've got a lot of real estate, now admittedly it is being held right now, but if you go underneath

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,360
the get, all right, no problems with weather issues, no problems with, you know, all that stuff,

279
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,400
you go into there, you knock out a few Nazis and then you got a home for life, Dan. There is

280
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,840
essentially a city under the Getty Museum, if we were to believe the people we've heard from. We

281
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,760
got space down there. Yeah. So, you know, these are the kind of things that are essential for

282
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,840
Alex to have his audience not think about, like, wait, this is a natural storm. This is bad,

283
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,800
but, you know, you should have known that it was a possibility. You are not prepared for this. You

284
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,640
got caught on your back foot. Weird. Maybe I shouldn't trust you about everything. Yeah,

285
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:00,280
instead of a conspiracy, maybe go, like, no conspiracy, buy snow tires, just in case. Sure.

286
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,040
Well, you know, it kind of felt like that was the direction he was going to go on Sunday after

287
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:12,360
obsessing about the, like, the traffic accidents, but it turns out not. Turns out that Alex is in

288
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:21,640
the great reset and that is why the power is out at Infowar Studios. Our power has been turned off

289
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,480
40% of the state without power this morning. All the great reset. I told my wife that this morning,

290
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,480
I told my security people that, and then my head security guy walks up and goes, here's the

291
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,120
Austin American statesman admitting that since they shut down the coal plants in Texas under

292
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,440
Obama, the windmills in West Texas failed and the power may be off for a week or longer.

293
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:51,800
Rolling blackouts because coal is evil. So here we are at Infohorse and we have to open the windows

294
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,160
up to have light. Here, let me give you a tour real quick. So Alex wants to pretend that the

295
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,200
wind turbines freezing in Texas is what caused the blackouts, but that is absolutely not true.

296
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,240
From an article in Bloomberg, quote, while ice has forced some turbines to shut down as the brutal

297
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,120
cold wave drives record electricity demand, that's been the least significant factor in the

298
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,000
blackouts, according to Dan Woodfin, a senior director for the electric reliability council

299
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,680
of Texas, which operates the state's power grid. The main factors, frozen instruments at natural

300
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,600
gas, coal, and even nuclear facilities, as well as limited supplies of natural gas, he said.

301
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,440
The article goes on to quote Daniel Cohen, an associate professor of environmental

302
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,160
engineering at Rice University, who said that it, quote, is really a red herring to blame

303
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,840
renewable energy production for the blackouts. If the wind turbines were operating at full capacity,

304
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,760
things would still be bad because of the infrastructure of Texas's power grid and how it

305
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,560
was unprepared to deal with a weather event like this. Alex doesn't want to address that point

306
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,320
because it's real and it requires calling in a technician. He would rather blame imaginary

307
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:09,400
Vikings. Yeah. Yeah. You have to pay for a technician. You have to pay for maintaining your

308
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,360
power grid. You have to pay for all of this stuff. But if it's the imaginary globalist, somehow

309
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,960
they're paying Alex. It makes perfect sense. Yeah. That's the way to do it. So Alex doesn't quite

310
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,680
understand the conversation that a lot of people are having surrounding climate issues. And we

311
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,920
heard this kind of position be expressed on when he was on Rogan's show, this idea that like

312
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,760
everybody wants like there to be no carbon. You're like, sure, sure, sure, sure. It's,

313
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,400
it's very strange. Here we are watching the most high tech, clean burning coal plants in the world

314
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,640
that nothing comes out of them, the carbon dioxide and water vapor, and they shut them down.

315
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,120
But Obama had already shut down thousands over a hundred in Texas. And then I'm reading the

316
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,680
Austin American Statesman and they admit the whole thing and say, this is green energy,

317
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,680
but it's worth it. Folks. This is the new dark age. Let's not, uh, I didn't see that in the

318
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,480
Austin American Statesman article. And, uh, you know, he just doesn't understand the, the issues

319
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,480
of like it's excess carbon dioxide. It's not like there will be no carbon dioxide in the world.

320
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,400
I don't, I don't, I don't think that that anyone would advocate for that.

321
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,840
No, it's, it's, this is a, this is a child going, okay, what? So I eat 35 apples a day.

322
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,000
You want nobody to have any apples? Zero apples then, huh? Not, Oh, you're saying I should have

323
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,320
a moderate amount. Fuck you. You want to take apples away from the honest working man. I don't

324
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:50,040
know why that's a six year old kid, but yeah, it's creating a false argument. Yeah, it's stupid.

325
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,000
And that's because, and Alex is able to do that because he's a climate scientist, basically.

326
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:05,960
Carbon dioxide are trace gases, trace gases. And if you look at the earth, it was a lot hotter in

327
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,440
the last few hundred thousand years and then was going down and now has gone up a tiny bit. Yes,

328
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,480
we've raised the temperature like maybe half a degree and thank God that's us terraforming it

329
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,400
in a good way. Unknowingly. Wow. He knows a lot. He's very, he's very insightful on these things.

330
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,880
Yeah. Yeah. That's not good. No, that's not good. Also, oxygen is specifically not a trace gas.

331
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,440
No, it's a trace gas. There's only like what? Zero percent of oxygen in the atmosphere? Nothing.

332
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,480
And saying that CO2 is a trace gas is meaningless in this context because the message he's seeming

333
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,760
to suggest is that there's so little of it that we should just make more. That's dumb. Ammonia is

334
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,160
also a trace gas, but I think that Alex would realize you don't want a ton of it in the air

335
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,320
because of obvious reasons. All right. You're making a good point, but have you ever walked

336
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,480
near a volcano and just breathed in pure sulfur dioxide? That's the good stuff. That's what gets

337
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,480
you breathing real good. You know, that's what you want in the atmosphere. It's a trace gas.

338
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,280
We shouldn't limit the amount of sulfur dioxide. Don't you want to chew your air?

339
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,440
Oh, so good that we raised the temperature.

340
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,920
So good. Yeah. I don't know. I think at this point, if you're a climate denier, it has to be

341
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:31,320
like, ah, I think I can wait out the clock. Right. You know, like there's no way Alex isn't,

342
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,440
isn't like at a certain point, like, oh shit, the climate really is fucked. I can't ignore this

343
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,960
anymore, but I'll probably be off the air by the time people want to really hold me accountable for

344
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,520
it. So fuck it, you know? Yeah, it could be. I mean, I mean, there, there has to be a certain

345
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,840
amount of, I'm not going to have to pay the fiddler and then there's, there's another part

346
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,200
with Alex though. I really do think that he is just like, dumb. He is just not interested.

347
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,000
And someone has explained it to him in such a way that like, Oh, Hey, the power plants are totally

348
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,840
clean. And he's never seen fit to have to look into it. Cause why would, yeah. Yeah. I just

349
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,040
don't know what, how stupid do you have to believe be to just believe that on like a gullibility

350
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:20,040
scale, I wouldn't trust a coal plant. If I walked through like the people who run coal are

351
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:27,160
demonstrably evil and have been for 150 years. Yeah. But they also tend to politically align

352
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,640
with the, the sort of things that Alex is into, you know, generally sure. He's, he's, he's inclined

353
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,560
to, to trust them even though maybe, maybe on some level, I mean, he does fucking Darth Vader

354
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:48,440
impressions all the time and talks about the dark side is the good people. That's fair. So Alex is

355
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,680
inside in the hallway at this point in the video. And then he, he now tells us we're going to go

356
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:01,160
outside. Let's go outside outside and show you Bill Gates, wanting to cool block out the sun

357
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,000
and look where we're at in a fricking frozen tundra with the power off freezing our asses off

358
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,160
like surfs. That's 21st century war. That's the great reset. And the great reset has cut

359
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,760
the power off in Texas. He is not established that he did not demonstrate this in any way.

360
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,840
Um, no wind turbines, real cold coal destroyed by Obama. See, it's the great reset. Oh, you could

361
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,240
say those things, but it doesn't mean it. There's no, no connection to reality. Really? No. If it

362
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:41,560
was destroyed by Obama, it's the great resets fault. Dan, do you understand? Yeah, sure.

363
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:49,560
And so Alex goes outside and he's just a man yelling in the snow. He is, uh, hanging out

364
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:55,960
with a snow backdrop being mad. And I, I think this is really interesting because if you take

365
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,560
him at his word, he seems to be lamenting the industrial revolution and how, how it made it.

366
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,960
So we don't have to make our own power or something that made us soft.

367
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,120
So modern society is great in many ways, but it's domesticated since man is very dependent

368
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,440
on the system. Now the average American, the average person in the industrialized world

369
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,160
flips on the light switch and just expects power or they pull into the gas station and they expect

370
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,280
gasoline or they go to the grocery store and they expected fresh food is going to be flown in or

371
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,960
trucked into where they're at. Even in the winter, people have been taken away from the land and have

372
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,480
been made very, very soft, myself included. But at least I know that that's going on.

373
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,120
I don't understand what he's complaining about. We're so soft because we expect there to be power

374
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,360
when we, you know, have all agreed to collectively pay for a power company to take care of that.

375
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:56,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, one, uh, hello Unabomber. It's been a while since we've talked.

376
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:03,800
And two, no, I think it's far worse. Look, if you, if you and I want to say we're unaware that,

377
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,800
uh, that technology has domesticated us and we have moved away from the land and then act like

378
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,920
that, that's fine. But if we are aware of it and don't take steps to avoid it and instead only tell

379
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,400
other people to do it, we're hypocritical pieces of shit you wish you didn't listen to.

380
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,160
Oh yeah, absolutely. His, his pretending that like, at least I know is, yeah, it doesn't matter.

381
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,400
It does make it way worse. It's worse. Yeah. You should, you should be, uh, not putting out

382
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,840
little tiny videos, uh, should be underground somewhere. Maybe if you want to, if you want to

383
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:45,480
join the land, if you want to broadcast, you should not ever have inclement weather get in

384
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,120
the way because you should have a ton of generators and you should be broadcasting from a compound

385
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,200
somewhere that no one knows where it is. And you got a bunch of potatoes growing, so you don't have

386
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,680
to worry about anybody. Hello, Unabomber. It's been a long time since we've done it.

387
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,200
It is strange. Although it is, it's, it's really interesting thing that Alex is like, okay, so

388
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,840
our uplinks are in another state, so they still have power. So what we have to do is we have to

389
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,880
shoot these little videos and then send them over somewhere else. And then he's got an elaborate

390
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:26,120
system to get like little tiny videos, which is just kind of, yeah, that's great. Yeah. It seems

391
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,720
like you should just not do this. I don't know. Take the day off. Yeah. That's my snow day.

392
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,360
That's my feeling about it. And the argument that he's making is so not compelling that I

393
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:43,240
don't even know why you bother, like why try to make this a conspiracy? Just like stay home.

394
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,360
Yeah. You don't need to risk driving. Yeah. Yeah. But on the other hand, he could risk other people's

395
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,680
lives and still probably make it to work, which is maybe his favorite thing to do. Yeah, sure.

396
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,320
And I mean, there's employees there too. It's not like he's alone at the studio too. So yeah,

397
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,760
that's true. Even better. I wonder if his wife is still playing tennis today. Probably. Yeah.

398
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,920
So Alex, uh, well, I mean, I think the reason he's doing this is because he wants to gloat

399
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:15,000
because he saw this coming. He knew what was going to happen. These guys have written about every

400
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,640
damn bit of it. How do you think I could make a film 13, 14 years ago called in game blueprint

401
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,240
for global enslavement. And you watch the damn film and almost all of it's come true

402
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,800
because I know their quotes and their statements and they think you deserve to have this done to

403
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,560
you. What's now unfolding because you're not fighting back. They all have private jets.

404
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,400
They all got a bunch of kids. They all have palatial mansions. They all live. However,

405
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,200
they want to have huge yachts. They're telling you when Obama goes to Africa,

406
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,760
that you can't have a car. You can't have an air conditioning. That's a lie. Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,160
It's an old, old, fun lie that he, I guess the snow pulled out of his little brain.

408
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,280
Um, but like this is nonsense and I'm starting to get feelings of almost like stolen valor on his,

409
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:11,160
like his part of like being right about things. Yeah. Yeah. How dare you? I resent that. He's

410
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,840
just pointing to end game and being like, I was right about everything. I was like,

411
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,400
you should go and rewatch your own work. This is not good. No, here's the worst part. Okay.

412
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:27,080
Okay. End game. Was this a large amount about a road jet had it been built would probably

413
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,200
have ameliorated a lot of problems they are currently experiencing. So not only was he

414
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,200
not right about that, it should have been built. So he didn't have to deal with it today.

415
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,840
I'm not positive that the road would have helped as much as you think, but it was a really big road

416
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,200
that it was pretty big. It was pretty big. Yeah. And also Alex does need to do this show, not only

417
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,040
to gloat about how he was right, though he wasn't. Um, he also needs to make an announcement. There

418
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,400
are new numbers out the new numbers. Do you know what, do you know what these numbers are? Uh,

419
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,080
Querkin is Querkin a new number? Nope. It's not, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. It's not

420
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,880
brand new numbers. You misunderstood. No. Okay. I've not discovered a new number. I was just

421
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,200
checking to see if maybe they discovered a new number. No, you never know. I recognize that

422
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:19,800
that's a fair interpretation of what I said. That is not correct. So the globalist, right?

423
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,960
Yeah. For a long time, they had claims of how many people they were going to kill.

424
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,320
They're going to kill a bunch. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. There's new numbers.

425
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Like you're part of the establishment and going along with this. That's why they always taught,

426
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh, we're going to get rid of half the world population in the seventies. And then later,

427
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,080
well, once we set up real government will be about 80%, but the good people will still be

428
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,280
around to guard the earth. Now they probably say 90% will be exterminated. And the new numbers are

429
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:53,880
down to 1% of world population. Do you understand? You've been taught to hate yourselves. You've

430
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,680
been isolated. Big tech media is designed. They admit to make you depressed to make you alone.

431
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,120
You are under a reclamation program to remove you and build a new world.

432
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:11,800
You were under a culling program. They decided to dynamite us. They decided to remove us. They

433
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,240
decided to blot us out. Like you destroy a building with a wrecking ball. So at least admit what's

434
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,000
happening to you and recognize what's happening to you as it happens and realize that the inhuman,

435
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,880
degenerate scumbag, filth and garbage that is carrying this out and doing this all lives

436
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,400
lavish lifestyles are all completely wicked and hateful. Most of their children commit suicide.

437
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,920
They're totally disconnected and they are ruthless scum and only have a will to dominate control

438
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,560
others. And if you lay down to them, you allow them to hurt other innocence and you cut yourself

439
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,840
off from God. So don't be part of it. And that's why we need to primary weak Republicans.

440
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,160
I'm confused. Is this not okay? All right. You need to take back the house.

441
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,320
This is ridiculous. This is so inciting. It's just nonsense,

442
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,000
but it's also just an idiot standing in the snow, yelling for no reason.

443
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,840
This is kind of, it's kind of a preview of what his life is going to be like in 10 years.

444
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,720
The visual of it is really jarring because it is like, I mean, it's Alex Jones. So like he's,

445
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,760
you know, this, this notable firebrand, ding dong idiot, but it's also a complete impotence

446
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,520
that he's showing because he's just standing in the snow, yelling about his enemies.

447
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,400
No, he's an apocalypse preacher.

448
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,920
Yeah. But also, but also how little import or meaning is there to him being like,

449
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:43,240
there's new numbers that 99% of the population is going to be killed. Like, okay, now you can't

450
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,960
make it smaller or like the survivor number smaller. Like you have just backed yourself

451
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,920
into a corner where it's like, okay, now a hundred percent. This doesn't mean anything. You're just

452
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,240
making up numbers. And now you've gotten to the end of the line. There's no more numbers.

453
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,000
I like the idea that there are quarterly, uh, extermination reports, you know, like every

454
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,440
quarter there's new numbers like, Oh no, no, no. We were going to kill 99% at the end of the first

455
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,280
quarter, but now re looking things into the second quarter, we're projecting a 97% murder.

456
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,080
Some weirdo like Daniel calls Alex and he's like, hey, build a bird. They were saying that,

457
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,840
uh, it's 99 now. Yeah. Yeah. There was a action that was saying 98,

458
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:34,760
but they lost the negotiations were fraught. Yes. All fell apart. So not to, not to spend

459
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,880
too much time, uh, uh, talking about why he's standing in the snow. Uh, Alex decides now time

460
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,880
to yell about the vaccines. Sure. There is hope. As I said,

461
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,040
Merck had to pull their vaccine three weeks ago because it was making people sick and killing them.

462
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,160
And they admitted that even if you take it, it doesn't protect you. They recommended you just

463
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,560
get COVID and get over it. And it was a scam, huge move that they, they got scared and said,

464
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,760
this is too evil. That would be a huge move. South Africa banned the vaccine,

465
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,360
make people sick and killing them. Australia had to ban their vaccine that they put out.

466
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:15,640
Cause it was going to be HIV positive stuff. India just banned the MRNA Pfizer shot HIV stuff.

467
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,920
What? Yeah. All right. Most of that shit we've covered in the past, uh, in episodes.

468
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,560
That's all nonsense. The India one though is a new narrative. So I wanted to just clarify why

469
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:32,280
India didn't approve the use of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported by CNBC back on February

470
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,920
5th that Pfizer had withdrawn their application for emergency use of their vaccine in India after

471
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,520
quote the government in January approved too much cheaper shots. There were a couple of other

472
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,560
hurdles, namely that India requires local studies to be done to approve vaccine use. And the studies

473
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,680
of Pfizer's vaccines had not been done in India. The second issue is that vaccine, uh, the one that

474
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,640
they had created the Pfizer one, it requires storage in very cold conditions, which creates

475
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,840
a concern about the ability for it to be rolled out all over India. You know, there's, there's

476
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,400
concerns about the supply of deep freeze, uh, capabilities. Alex is pretending, Alex is

477
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,080
pretending that they banned it because it's dangerous. When in reality, it's really just

478
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,560
kind of a boring logistics issue. Again, this is a water heater noise. Alex is trying to tell you

479
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,800
is a Viking. Yeah. That's a, that's like India being like, listen guys, we're going to have to

480
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,160
ban the import of snowballs. Now I know they don't get far once they get across the border,

481
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,920
but we just can't let this happen anymore. There are cheaper options that will do the same thing

482
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:44,040
that a snowball does. And yeah, we'll, we'll go with those. So Alex, uh, still, uh, being dumb

483
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,920
starts talking about how Texas used to supply everyone with power. They have shut our power

484
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,720
systems down so much that we can't even provide power in the summer and the winter and the great

485
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,480
state of Texas that up until 10 years ago was supplying power to 15 States and was doing an

486
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,640
incredible job, but we've been shut down. That's a complete lie. Uh, Texas is a unique state in the

487
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,320
country in terms of their power grid. And it's actually one of the reasons that the situation

488
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,200
in the state now is so much more complicated. Texas is the only state in the country that has

489
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,480
its own completely autonomous power grid called ERCOT, which is run by the electric reliability

490
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,360
council of Texas. Houston public media recently posted a very concise explanation of how the

491
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:32,040
system works and how it got to be the way it is, which I will paraphrase now. It doesn't and they

492
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,720
fucked it up. When electricity started to become more prevalent, the country saw utility companies

493
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:45,480
begin to combine and link up, uh, and, uh, create regional things. In 1935, FDR signed the federal

494
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,160
power act quote, which charged the federal power commission with overseeing interstate electricity

495
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,200
sales. The federal government could only really get involved with regulating interstate power

496
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,480
exchanges. So in order to avoid that regulation, Texas has remained the only state in the country

497
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,800
with its own power grid. This has been breached a few times, notably in 1976, when a Texas power

498
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,480
company sent power to Oklahoma very briefly in what's been called the quote, midnight connection.

499
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,920
Alex is completely making up that the state of Texas formerly provided energy to 15 States.

500
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,800
I suspect that he doesn't even know that his state's energy set up, uh, is the way it is

501
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,640
and how some of the problems he's complaining about are the direct by-product of his state

502
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,920
following his own anti-federal government paranoia. It's kind of embarrassing that, uh,

503
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,640
that he has no idea how it works, uh, and that because everybody else does it differently,

504
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:47,480
it's their fault despite not knowing how he does it. Yeah, probably. And you know, uh, it's, it's

505
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,560
really, it's really weird to me because like it should be a point of pride to him that the Texas

506
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:00,120
doesn't supply our to other States and other States don't supply power to them. It should be

507
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:08,200
like, this is a rugged individual pre-industrial revolution. We are not pacified instead. We mine

508
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:15,880
our own coal, we burn our own coal and that's what we do. He's still, he's instead choosing

509
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:23,000
the more attractive narrative to him, which is that Obama made it so Texas doesn't supply most

510
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,320
of the country electricity. Somehow it's still, you know, the anti-Obama pro-coal

511
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:36,600
kind of narratives take precedence over his state's rights, uh, jacking off, I think. Yeah.

512
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:43,880
Yeah. I mean, I think that depends on the day too. Probably. Yeah. I would, uh, I would also argue,

513
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:53,960
uh, that in this circumstance, Alex is, I guess trapped, you know, like everything that he says

514
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:01,240
is going to be wrong. Yeah. Because the reality of it is like, this is all fucked up beyond reason

515
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,640
because, you know, we made choices to get at this place. Um, I think that Alex might be literally

516
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:14,280
trapped as well. Uh, he might, his wife might be driving the Audi, so he might be stuck at the

517
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:21,240
studio. Might as well scream on the street. I'm not going anywhere until five. Yeah. So Alex gets

518
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,240
to rambling about some other stuff. And I found this particular, uh, thought that he has a little

519
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,120
bit upsetting. This has to do with the storming of the Capitol. Because the globalists fear what

520
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:36,920
you saw at the Capitol. It was a few hundred that got the big mass to do it. The globalists

521
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,440
the globalists provocateur it had security stand down so that what they feared in the future could

522
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:49,480
be discredited. Now, a million people in DC with a serious mission to take over and overthrow

523
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:57,080
an illegitimate government is powerful. Okay. So what I'm hearing is the globalists are afraid of

524
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,520
what happened on the sixth. And so they did the sixth in order to make sure that Alex couldn't do

525
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:10,440
it better later. Yes, you are correct. That is exactly what happened. Great. And Alex's Alex's

526
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:19,160
point, I believe is that a few million people overrunning the Capitol, that's a W guys. That

527
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:26,680
means we win this one. A few hundred people were fucked. So yeah, I think he's really against the

528
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,880
principles of what happened on the sixth. Yeah. I think, I think it's, I think it's become quite

529
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,600
clear that now he realizes he's not going to get arrested or anything. He can sort of now sort of

530
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,000
subtly, just, just chill out and, you know, Hey guys, guys, two weeks from now, anybody

531
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,560
not busy two weeks. That's when we got to get a couple of million, two weeks. So, uh, we know

532
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:58,040
that Alex is a scholar on the, uh, matter of carbon dioxide, um, climate change, world war two.

533
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:04,280
Yeah. Alex does. He, he, he seems to think this I've heard him say this before. And that's why I

534
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,440
wanted to play this again, because it's such a dumb thought that I'm, I'm surprised he repeats

535
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,920
this multiple times. It's clearly something he actually believes. And that is that people are

536
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:23,080
only afraid of carbon dioxide because it sounds like carbon monoxide. Oh boy. Yeah. This is very

537
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:30,120
bad. The sun is energy. It drives almost all of our climate, light, carbon dioxide, oxygen,

538
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,960
and water is the carbon cycle. And if you take any of those very, you have death on the planet.

539
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,800
Well, people know water's good. Folks know oxygen is good and they know the sun's good.

540
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,840
So what is it? They attack carbon dioxide. Cause it sounds like monoxide Penn and Teller did it

541
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,320
20 years ago. I did it 15 years ago. We ought to go out and do it again. You go out, you give

542
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:00,200
people the name of water scientific 95% saving it. And we talked to over a hundred people and

543
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,360
only a few went, wait a minute. We're like dihydrogen monoxide. It's everywhere. It's toxic.

544
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,440
If you drink too much of it, it can kill you. Um, it, it, you know, it, it, they're like, yes,

545
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:19,880
I agree. We should be in that. That's water even better. 99% of the studies we did out of the

546
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,600
public, unofficial study, if you give them the name of table salt, Oh my God, it sounds like

547
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:33,960
Satan. I mean, table salt has a really scary name and the average person will come to you

548
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,280
and we'll say, let's be in that. Alex couldn't remember the name of table salt. Yeah. I was

549
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,920
going to say, why didn't you say it then? If you're so proud of knowing what it is,

550
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,200
Jordan, I hate to say a demonic word here, but sodium chloride, get the fuck out.

551
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,840
You guys can't see those are Jordan is doing a cross the sign of a cross.

552
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,200
I might be crazy. I might be crazy, but I'm going to toss this out for you, Dan. Yeah. I think

553
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:13,080
somebody who knows what dihydrogen monoxide is yet believes that the president is secretly

554
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:19,160
controlled by the devil is still dumber than somebody who thinks things are what they are,

555
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,800
but it's like, just say one. Yeah. That's my belief. And I think that, you know,

556
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,960
we're leaving all that aside. I think, you know, you may be right. You may be wrong,

557
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,680
but my conjecture is sure. Anybody who thinks one of these kinds of studies of the public means

558
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:43,480
anything is a dick. Oh, that's fair. And they don't, they don't have much going on. I mean,

559
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,120
you don't, you don't remember the greatest poster before there was five 38, Dan,

560
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:54,600
there was Jay Leno. All right. And when you do jaywalking, you get the right results. Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:04,680
Yeah. I tricked you scientific poll. Fuck you. Yeah. So we just got one last clip here. And

562
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,800
I mean, the, the report ends with Alex sitting in a dark studio and it actually ends with him

563
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,240
yelling about how the new world order is going down and just the visual of it, of him sitting

564
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:25,800
in a completely dark studio. That is like a review. That is Andy daily review. It is exactly

565
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,360
that. It's like, guys, where's everybody. Why is everybody leaving this show? What's going on?

566
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,800
Yeah. There's a, if I didn't hate him so much, there'd be a little bit of pathos

567
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:43,160
in the moment of, of him sitting alone in a dark studio, insisting he was going to destroy

568
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,680
the globalists. But I choose not to end our episode with that clip because honestly it's

569
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,240
angry. It's kind of funny to think about, but it's, it's meaningless compared to this,

570
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:02,520
this clip, I think says everything that you need to know. I understand the average person doesn't

571
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:10,280
read 300 books on world war II. Correct. I understand the average person doesn't read a

572
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,200
hundred books on Rome. The person doesn't read 50 books on British naval history. The average

573
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,400
person doesn't read 30 books on us history in the revolutionary war or five books. I disagree.

574
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:30,200
The civil war or a couple of hundred books on globalism and perfectly in Zbigniew Brzezinski and

575
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:40,040
Klaus Schwab. But I did. Nope. And so I know who these people are just because I happen to

576
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:47,240
get into it when I was like nine years old because these books were all over my house.

577
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,800
And so I had a piece of chip earlier, so I keep licking my lips.

578
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,640
Cause all the stores are closed. There's no food. The grocery stores are all closed.

579
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,160
So I went out and got the crew some food, got some potato chips and

580
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,320
some candy bars. That's that. That's about all we get right now. Cause the power's off

581
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,120
because the government shut the power off by shutting the power plants down.

582
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,680
Yeah. I think that's a good summation of Alex. Just like bragging about books he's read that

583
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,480
he hasn't read. What hundred books are about Klaus Schwab? Get the fuck out of here.

584
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,880
I don't know. He's just rambling about how well ready he is. And he's not like normal people

585
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,280
cause he's, he's figured all this out because he's so smart and read all this shit. And then

586
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:38,600
he gets completely derailed by a chip. Just, Oh, I ate a chip earlier. That's all we get now.

587
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:47,320
Cause the power's out, man. The greatest minds of my generation. I saw it taken down by a little

588
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:53,640
chip in the tooth for want of a toothpick. The greatest minds of my generation have been torn

589
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:03,800
asunder. Yeah. This is a bleak. Yeah. That's not good. So I, yeah, I just wanted to check in with

590
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,000
you and let you know how things go. We're going for Alex. And it turns out, yeah, it turns out

591
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,440
this is how it's going. Last we, last we know of him at the time that we're recording this,

592
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:20,600
he's just sitting alone in a dark studio and no, no telling when he'll be back.

593
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,720
I, I do like the idea of somebody showing up at the office tomorrow,

594
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,360
turning the lights off and Alex is just sitting at the desk. Just like eyes haven't

595
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,480
blunt for 20 hours. Just Aaron. He's actually wearing a tie. Yeah.

596
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:43,080
It's more put together than usual. I slept in the office for the first time in a long time.

597
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,000
