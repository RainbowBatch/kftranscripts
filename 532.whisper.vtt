We are the bad guys, knowledgefight!

Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding!

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work!

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Knowledgefight!

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-knowledgefight.com

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I love you.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm Jordan!

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
We're couple dudes who like to drink novelty beverages in their own homes and sit around

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
It does appear that that is our plan for the time being right now, Dan.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, Jordan, we are recording this separately, probably the first actual episode that we've

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
recorded over a distance.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
It's a little bit weird.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Sure!

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, that remains to be seen as to whether or not it's an actual episode now.

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
I set out with the intention of a regular episode-ish, kind of, kind of a mini episode.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
I don't want to, again, I want to stress to everybody that we're not going to have episodes

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but the circumstances kind of demanded this week.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
We had to jump on the horse and get something together.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, I don't think that's a terrible idea.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
But, simultaneously, we can't get together.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Because Chicago has waist-deep snow outside.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
It's bad.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
It's really bad.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
And I ran out of coffee.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I ran out of coffee last night, Dan.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
So this morning, I was about to take the dogs out for a walk and I always start a cup of

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
coffee, a pot of coffee, before I take the dogs out and I realized in that moment I have

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
none.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
So, I had to walk through close to a mile of waist-deep snow to get some coffee.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
It was the most brutal morning I've ever had.

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, I walked down to the grocery store because I needed some salad stuff for lunch and it

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
was just a dead zone.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
There was nobody there.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
It was fantastic.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
I mean, other than the logistical problems that everyone's dealing with, the fact that

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
there was no one at a grocery store was pretty nice.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
There are some advantages.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
So, I guess my bright spot is that you and I are both doing relatively alright with this.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
I mean, it was coming down all day, all night yesterday.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Just a disaster.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Last night, it was one of the first times I've seen that kind of snowstorm and I was

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
like, man, I think I'm actually scared for Chicago.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Look, we get covered in snow.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That's fine.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
But this one was like, oh shit, this one might be too much for us.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Whenever people start talking in feet, it's like, alright, hold on.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
You didn't say 16 inches.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
You said multiple feet.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
That's trouble.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That's trouble.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Alright, so the reason that we needed to jump on the old Zoom here and get an episode together

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
was because Alex is also dealing with inclement weather.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Naturally.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.560
He's got some, you know, Texas is seeing some unprecedented winter storms that are happening

03:56.560 --> 04:05.960
right now and Infowars Studio has been struck by the ice, the Winter Queen.

04:05.960 --> 04:10.880
What's the name of the character in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe?

04:10.880 --> 04:12.200
I think it's just the Ice Queen.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
Yeah.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Okay.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.200
Well, anyway, Alex wants some Turkish delight and...

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Okay.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
Alright.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
Okay.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.200
Running out of references.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.200
We'll stop there.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
Let's just name all of the...

04:22.200 --> 04:24.200
Voyage of the Dawn Treader.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.200
Boy and his horse.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
Or Horse and his Boy.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.200
Sorry.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
Yeah.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
Silver Chair.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.200
Prince Caspian.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
Silver Chair.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.200
Right.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.200
I think I said that first.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.200
You did.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.200
You're missing two of them.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.600
You're missing the final two.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.160
The Magician's Apprentice.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.880
Oh, close.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.880
Sorcerer's Apprentice.

04:44.880 --> 04:45.880
No.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
Oh, real close.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.880
The Magician's Nephew.

04:47.880 --> 04:48.880
Yes.

04:48.880 --> 04:49.880
There you go.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.400
What's the last one?

04:52.400 --> 04:55.240
I think I forgot.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.960
I think it's just the last battle.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.520
Oh, that's probably it.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.240
Very boring.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.600
It's a really boring book.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
Can't believe I forgot The Magician's Nephew.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.600
What a stupid name for a book.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
You know what?

05:07.600 --> 05:08.920
I think that one's always been my favorite.

05:08.920 --> 05:09.920
I always liked that one.

05:09.920 --> 05:15.920
The little rings that they go into the little middle of the world to teleport thing.

05:15.920 --> 05:16.920
Always fun.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.840
I read the hell out of those books and I don't think I remember the plot of any of the...

05:21.840 --> 05:23.560
At least the last four of them.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.640
Oh, no.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.640
That's fine.

05:25.640 --> 05:26.640
That is totally fine.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.800
Magician's Nephew is the prequel, though, and that's why I've always liked it.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.840
It's the prequel to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

05:32.840 --> 05:33.840
Oh, okay.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.360
So it's like the Tokyo Drift of the...

05:36.360 --> 05:37.360
Exactly.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.360
Yes.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.360
Yes.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.840
Before the main characters die.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.840
Sure.

05:41.840 --> 05:47.280
So, Jordan, we got some Alex Jones stupidity to deal with.

05:47.280 --> 05:52.840
It'll be a little bit of a briefer episode, but I wanted to check in with how he's doing

05:52.840 --> 05:55.440
in Occupied by Ice, Austin.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.840
But before we do that, Jordan, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
signed up and are supporting the show.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.260
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.720
So first, Bill W., thank you so much for your policy walk.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
I'm a policy walk.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
Thanks Bill.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
Thanks, Bill.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.280
Next, Jordan th, not Jordan th.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.280
Thank you so much.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.280
You're now policy want.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.320
I'm a policy walk.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.320
Thanks Jordan.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.320
Great name.

06:12.320 --> 06:20.320
Oh, look at that.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.320
Ah.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.320
There we go.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.320
You're playing on my side of the streets.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
Next, Nicholas B. Thanks, Nicholas.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Next, Andrew A. Thank you so much for your now policy walk.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.320
I'm a policy walk.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.080
Thank you Andrew Aa.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.880
Next, Amelia are thank you so much for your now policy walk.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.880
I'm a policy walk.

06:31.880 --> 06:37.160
Thanks Amelia. And finally, Drax. Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.520
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much, Drax.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.640
You want to say hi to Drax? Maybe a hi Drax?

06:43.640 --> 06:47.240
I don't know what I did. I saw it. I saw that joke coming.

06:47.240 --> 06:54.200
Yeah, a mile away. I tried to duck, and you still hit me in the face with it, so that happens.

06:54.200 --> 06:59.240
Yep. Well, sorry, I have cookies on the mind.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think we've got one more little piece of...

07:04.360 --> 07:08.920
I think we've got one more little piece of... We're getting into this place of...

07:08.920 --> 07:13.960
We're just shouting people out for no reason at this point, but we do have one reason for

07:13.960 --> 07:20.440
this particular shout out. We have one particular reason, and that is it is their anniversary

07:20.440 --> 07:30.680
today, I believe. Bonnie and Eric, happy 20th wedding anniversary for Wednesday the 17th.

07:30.680 --> 07:35.880
20 years, Dan. That's exciting. That's the piano anniversary, right? The 20th is the piano?

07:36.680 --> 07:42.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First is paper. Second is silver. No, wait, that's much later.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.080
You know, the customary gifts thing that you're supposed to give on anniversaries.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.680
Sure. Of course. 20th is pianos. I hope you guys

07:50.680 --> 07:54.600
exchanged pianos, and... That would be the right way to do it.

07:54.600 --> 08:01.240
Yeah. This is taking me back to my hosting stand-up comedy days. I like to do, you know,

08:01.240 --> 08:05.560
you start out every show at Zany's with, hey, anybody celebrating anything tonight?

08:05.560 --> 08:09.160
The difference here is that people have told us that they're celebrating something as opposed

08:09.160 --> 08:14.920
to us starting the show having to fish for something. That's fair. It is different.

08:14.920 --> 08:25.400
It's more celebratory, less sad. So, Jordan, on the 16th, or maybe it was yesterday,

08:25.400 --> 08:33.320
I think it was the 15th, actually, Alex put out a series of short vignettes of himself at the

08:33.320 --> 08:39.640
Infowars studio. Lights are out in the studio. There's also a couple of them where he's outside

08:39.640 --> 08:45.480
yelling in the snow. Sure. Well, that just makes sense, though. It's a load of nonsense,

08:45.480 --> 08:48.520
and we're going to talk about it. But first, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

08:48.520 --> 08:53.000
If a dog starts running at you, don't be scared. Yell at it, throw rocks at it. It'll run off most

08:53.000 --> 08:56.920
of the time if you're not on its property. Whoa. Dogs know about property rights.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.640
Wow. That's the plan. That's the trick. Yeah.

08:59.640 --> 09:06.360
Dogs are very interested in borders. They don't like immigration from house to house.

09:06.360 --> 09:12.120
That's the situation. Dogs are libertarians. They're part of the Austrian school.

09:12.760 --> 09:19.960
I feel like this is just Alex protecting other people from his mistakes. He's hurt so many dogs

09:19.960 --> 09:25.400
because he was afraid of them, and now he's sharing his wisdom with the rest of the world.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.440
Hey, guys. Just throw a rock at it. It's bad to be a dog murderer.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.240
Just throw a rock at the dog. That's fine. That's enough.

09:31.240 --> 09:35.800
Yeah. Don't shoot too hard. So, Jordan, we're here recording on Tuesday,

09:35.800 --> 09:38.040
and as the time of this episode being put together,

09:38.040 --> 09:42.040
InfoWars has essentially been off air since Sunday evening.

09:42.040 --> 09:42.840
Cancel culture.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.240
Austin and most of Texas is dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime winter storm that has

09:47.240 --> 09:52.600
left countless people without power in severe conditions. It appears that the InfoWars studio

09:52.600 --> 09:58.280
has been left also without power, and that means no show for Alex. It makes sense, and I don't

09:58.280 --> 10:01.960
think anyone would bat an eye if he just got on air and said that there was a weather emergency

10:01.960 --> 10:05.960
and they had to take an unplanned break in programming. It could be an effective way to

10:05.960 --> 10:11.080
push emergency food sales even, so it might not end up being a total money loss if he did that,

10:11.640 --> 10:16.760
but Alex does not go that route. Instead of just expressing solidarity with the people of Texas,

10:16.760 --> 10:21.000
encouraging people to stay inside if possible, and donating to a mutual aid fund,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.920
Alex decided to record a video of himself at the InfoWars studio with the lights off,

10:24.920 --> 10:28.520
explaining how power outages are actually a globalist conspiracy.

10:28.520 --> 10:35.000
Really? We had to get there, huh? I would prefer a scaler attack. I want a scaler attack. I want

10:35.000 --> 10:40.200
aliens if we're gonna do this. Globalist conspiracy. We'll get to the specifics of

10:40.200 --> 10:45.000
this, but right off the bat, I wanted to explain why Alex feels the need to make this conspiracy

10:45.000 --> 10:49.960
instead of just being, you know, a normal kind of thing. You know, you're a human. You accept that

10:49.960 --> 10:55.640
inclement weather happens, and sometimes it gets in the way. I have a reason, I think, that he might

10:55.640 --> 11:02.280
want this to be a conspiracy. Let's see if it's on my list. I'm just gonna go with mainly one of the

11:02.280 --> 11:08.040
large contributors to this disaster being so much worse is his state actually being interested in

11:08.040 --> 11:12.920
following the policies that he himself advocates for. All right, I'm gonna cross number four off

11:12.920 --> 11:19.160
the list. That was number four. There we go. The first reason is that Alex has a vested interest

11:19.160 --> 11:24.040
in infantilizing his audience. He needs their critical thinking skills to be on a child's level,

11:24.040 --> 11:29.000
so whenever he has the chance he creates childish narratives. When you're in bed and you hear a bump

11:29.000 --> 11:32.920
you could either think that it's the water heater or you could think it's a viking who's invaded

11:32.920 --> 11:38.280
your house to come and get you. Adults are really capable, you know, they're able to reason it out,

11:38.280 --> 11:42.760
that there's no reason a viking would be in your home, but for children their minds gravitate to

11:42.760 --> 11:48.200
the more exciting possibilities, which is often nonsense, but it appeals to a particular emotional

11:48.200 --> 11:56.520
need and a drive that children have. A quick question, is it around like 860 AD? In which case

11:56.520 --> 12:02.120
it is a terrifying time for viking. Time travel is possible. You have a time traveling water heater.

12:04.600 --> 12:09.080
Knowing that the noise is the water heater doesn't prompt an irrational response in a person.

12:09.080 --> 12:13.080
They can ignore it, or if it's a serious noise they can choose to call a technician.

12:13.080 --> 12:17.080
If you can convince people though that it's actually a viking who almost got them,

12:17.080 --> 12:21.320
you might be able to sell them all sorts of products to protect against vikings or even

12:21.320 --> 12:25.400
documentaries where you explain how vikings operate and how to avoid their attack plans.

12:26.280 --> 12:31.720
Keeping the audience in a state where they don't deal with the problems that come up in a boring

12:31.720 --> 12:36.760
but ultimately real way and keeping them fixated on childish emotional interpretations of every

12:37.320 --> 12:42.440
stimulus they receive is essential for Alex's business model, so even a giant storm can't

12:42.440 --> 12:48.360
just be a storm. It's clearly an attack on conservatives. Absolutely. The second reason

12:48.360 --> 12:53.080
that Alex has a strong interest in presenting this storm as some kind of an act of foul play is that

12:53.080 --> 12:59.320
it's really something that just happens in nature, and if so, he should have been prepared for it.

12:59.320 --> 13:03.880
His brand is largely built around being a prepper type of guy, so the first question that comes up

13:03.880 --> 13:08.520
in the case of his network being taken offline by a storm is naturally, why weren't you prepared for

13:08.520 --> 13:15.800
that? A winter storm like this hitting Texas is obviously a very unlikely event and something that

13:15.800 --> 13:19.960
the infrastructure was unprepared for, and my heart goes out to everyone who's dealing with the

13:19.960 --> 13:24.760
consequences of it, but for Alex, the fact that he could be caught off guard by a natural event,

13:24.760 --> 13:29.000
that's a contradiction of the way he wants the audience to see him, and so obviously you're

13:29.000 --> 13:34.360
supposed to be prepared for the literal end of the world. I would imagine that includes some

13:34.360 --> 13:40.120
sort of the power grid going down, right? Yeah, you touched on the fourth one, which is the

13:40.120 --> 13:44.040
state of Texas and how they operate, and we'll talk about that a little bit down the line,

13:44.040 --> 13:49.400
but the third issue is that a storm like this brings into sharp focus some of the elements of

13:49.400 --> 13:55.240
the climate change conversation that Alex doesn't want people to think about. As the climate changes

13:55.240 --> 13:59.800
and weather events become more severe, they're going to test long-standing assumptions about

13:59.800 --> 14:05.240
infrastructure and how we build. For instance, houses are designed differently in different parts

14:05.240 --> 14:13.080
of the country, like in California they prioritize earthquake protection, whereas in Missouri where

14:13.080 --> 14:18.600
I grew up, every single family home that you're going to find has a basement because of tornadoes.

14:18.600 --> 14:25.720
Right. So, you know, basements are less prevalent in flood prone regions. Yeah, Florida is not known

14:25.720 --> 14:31.800
for having tons of basements that are literally underneath the swamp. Yeah, and as, you know,

14:31.800 --> 14:36.840
different sorts of weather patterns and more severe storms hit different areas, you're going

14:36.840 --> 14:45.240
to see those things, the long-standing assumptions that we've had, not be enough to suffice, and Alex

14:45.240 --> 14:51.560
doesn't want the audience to think about that because it requires shifting ideas and paradigms

14:51.560 --> 14:58.040
and he's not into that. Of course. I have a plan. Here's my plan, okay, because as shifting weather

14:58.040 --> 15:05.640
patterns are going to test our assumptions and our architecture, what if now, and hear me out,

15:05.640 --> 15:13.000
we've got a lot of real estate, now admittedly it is being held right now, but if you go underneath

15:13.000 --> 15:20.360
the get, all right, no problems with weather issues, no problems with, you know, all that stuff,

15:20.360 --> 15:25.400
you go into there, you knock out a few Nazis and then you got a home for life, Dan. There is

15:25.400 --> 15:30.840
essentially a city under the Getty Museum, if we were to believe the people we've heard from. We

15:30.840 --> 15:36.760
got space down there. Yeah. So, you know, these are the kind of things that are essential for

15:36.760 --> 15:42.840
Alex to have his audience not think about, like, wait, this is a natural storm. This is bad,

15:42.840 --> 15:47.800
but, you know, you should have known that it was a possibility. You are not prepared for this. You

15:47.800 --> 15:53.640
got caught on your back foot. Weird. Maybe I shouldn't trust you about everything. Yeah,

15:53.640 --> 16:00.280
instead of a conspiracy, maybe go, like, no conspiracy, buy snow tires, just in case. Sure.

16:00.280 --> 16:04.040
Well, you know, it kind of felt like that was the direction he was going to go on Sunday after

16:04.040 --> 16:12.360
obsessing about the, like, the traffic accidents, but it turns out not. Turns out that Alex is in

16:12.360 --> 16:21.640
the great reset and that is why the power is out at Infowar Studios. Our power has been turned off

16:21.640 --> 16:27.480
40% of the state without power this morning. All the great reset. I told my wife that this morning,

16:27.480 --> 16:31.480
I told my security people that, and then my head security guy walks up and goes, here's the

16:31.480 --> 16:36.120
Austin American statesman admitting that since they shut down the coal plants in Texas under

16:36.120 --> 16:42.440
Obama, the windmills in West Texas failed and the power may be off for a week or longer.

16:43.960 --> 16:51.800
Rolling blackouts because coal is evil. So here we are at Infohorse and we have to open the windows

16:51.800 --> 16:57.160
up to have light. Here, let me give you a tour real quick. So Alex wants to pretend that the

16:57.160 --> 17:02.200
wind turbines freezing in Texas is what caused the blackouts, but that is absolutely not true.

17:02.200 --> 17:07.240
From an article in Bloomberg, quote, while ice has forced some turbines to shut down as the brutal

17:07.240 --> 17:12.120
cold wave drives record electricity demand, that's been the least significant factor in the

17:12.120 --> 17:17.000
blackouts, according to Dan Woodfin, a senior director for the electric reliability council

17:17.000 --> 17:22.680
of Texas, which operates the state's power grid. The main factors, frozen instruments at natural

17:22.680 --> 17:28.600
gas, coal, and even nuclear facilities, as well as limited supplies of natural gas, he said.

17:28.600 --> 17:36.440
The article goes on to quote Daniel Cohen, an associate professor of environmental

17:36.440 --> 17:41.160
engineering at Rice University, who said that it, quote, is really a red herring to blame

17:41.160 --> 17:46.840
renewable energy production for the blackouts. If the wind turbines were operating at full capacity,

17:46.840 --> 17:50.760
things would still be bad because of the infrastructure of Texas's power grid and how it

17:50.760 --> 17:55.560
was unprepared to deal with a weather event like this. Alex doesn't want to address that point

17:55.560 --> 18:01.320
because it's real and it requires calling in a technician. He would rather blame imaginary

18:01.320 --> 18:09.400
Vikings. Yeah. Yeah. You have to pay for a technician. You have to pay for maintaining your

18:09.400 --> 18:14.360
power grid. You have to pay for all of this stuff. But if it's the imaginary globalist, somehow

18:14.360 --> 18:19.960
they're paying Alex. It makes perfect sense. Yeah. That's the way to do it. So Alex doesn't quite

18:19.960 --> 18:24.680
understand the conversation that a lot of people are having surrounding climate issues. And we

18:24.680 --> 18:30.920
heard this kind of position be expressed on when he was on Rogan's show, this idea that like

18:32.120 --> 18:38.760
everybody wants like there to be no carbon. You're like, sure, sure, sure, sure. It's,

18:38.760 --> 18:45.400
it's very strange. Here we are watching the most high tech, clean burning coal plants in the world

18:45.400 --> 18:49.640
that nothing comes out of them, the carbon dioxide and water vapor, and they shut them down.

18:49.640 --> 18:56.120
But Obama had already shut down thousands over a hundred in Texas. And then I'm reading the

18:56.120 --> 19:02.680
Austin American Statesman and they admit the whole thing and say, this is green energy,

19:02.680 --> 19:08.680
but it's worth it. Folks. This is the new dark age. Let's not, uh, I didn't see that in the

19:08.680 --> 19:13.480
Austin American Statesman article. And, uh, you know, he just doesn't understand the, the issues

19:13.480 --> 19:19.480
of like it's excess carbon dioxide. It's not like there will be no carbon dioxide in the world.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.400
I don't, I don't, I don't think that that anyone would advocate for that.

19:24.120 --> 19:30.840
No, it's, it's, this is a, this is a child going, okay, what? So I eat 35 apples a day.

19:30.840 --> 19:37.000
You want nobody to have any apples? Zero apples then, huh? Not, Oh, you're saying I should have

19:37.000 --> 19:43.320
a moderate amount. Fuck you. You want to take apples away from the honest working man. I don't

19:43.320 --> 19:50.040
know why that's a six year old kid, but yeah, it's creating a false argument. Yeah, it's stupid.

19:50.040 --> 19:55.000
And that's because, and Alex is able to do that because he's a climate scientist, basically.

19:56.040 --> 20:05.960
Carbon dioxide are trace gases, trace gases. And if you look at the earth, it was a lot hotter in

20:05.960 --> 20:10.440
the last few hundred thousand years and then was going down and now has gone up a tiny bit. Yes,

20:10.440 --> 20:15.480
we've raised the temperature like maybe half a degree and thank God that's us terraforming it

20:15.480 --> 20:21.400
in a good way. Unknowingly. Wow. He knows a lot. He's very, he's very insightful on these things.

20:21.400 --> 20:27.880
Yeah. Yeah. That's not good. No, that's not good. Also, oxygen is specifically not a trace gas.

20:28.520 --> 20:34.440
No, it's a trace gas. There's only like what? Zero percent of oxygen in the atmosphere? Nothing.

20:34.440 --> 20:39.480
And saying that CO2 is a trace gas is meaningless in this context because the message he's seeming

20:39.480 --> 20:44.760
to suggest is that there's so little of it that we should just make more. That's dumb. Ammonia is

20:44.760 --> 20:49.160
also a trace gas, but I think that Alex would realize you don't want a ton of it in the air

20:49.960 --> 20:55.320
because of obvious reasons. All right. You're making a good point, but have you ever walked

20:55.320 --> 21:01.480
near a volcano and just breathed in pure sulfur dioxide? That's the good stuff. That's what gets

21:01.480 --> 21:05.480
you breathing real good. You know, that's what you want in the atmosphere. It's a trace gas.

21:05.480 --> 21:10.280
We shouldn't limit the amount of sulfur dioxide. Don't you want to chew your air?

21:13.960 --> 21:16.440
Oh, so good that we raised the temperature.

21:18.120 --> 21:24.920
So good. Yeah. I don't know. I think at this point, if you're a climate denier, it has to be

21:24.920 --> 21:31.320
like, ah, I think I can wait out the clock. Right. You know, like there's no way Alex isn't,

21:31.320 --> 21:36.440
isn't like at a certain point, like, oh shit, the climate really is fucked. I can't ignore this

21:36.440 --> 21:41.960
anymore, but I'll probably be off the air by the time people want to really hold me accountable for

21:41.960 --> 21:46.520
it. So fuck it, you know? Yeah, it could be. I mean, I mean, there, there has to be a certain

21:46.520 --> 21:50.840
amount of, I'm not going to have to pay the fiddler and then there's, there's another part

21:50.840 --> 21:56.200
with Alex though. I really do think that he is just like, dumb. He is just not interested.

21:56.200 --> 22:01.000
And someone has explained it to him in such a way that like, Oh, Hey, the power plants are totally

22:01.000 --> 22:06.840
clean. And he's never seen fit to have to look into it. Cause why would, yeah. Yeah. I just

22:06.840 --> 22:14.040
don't know what, how stupid do you have to believe be to just believe that on like a gullibility

22:14.040 --> 22:20.040
scale, I wouldn't trust a coal plant. If I walked through like the people who run coal are

22:20.040 --> 22:27.160
demonstrably evil and have been for 150 years. Yeah. But they also tend to politically align

22:27.160 --> 22:33.640
with the, the sort of things that Alex is into, you know, generally sure. He's, he's, he's inclined

22:33.640 --> 22:39.560
to, to trust them even though maybe, maybe on some level, I mean, he does fucking Darth Vader

22:39.560 --> 22:48.440
impressions all the time and talks about the dark side is the good people. That's fair. So Alex is

22:48.440 --> 22:54.680
inside in the hallway at this point in the video. And then he, he now tells us we're going to go

22:54.680 --> 23:01.160
outside. Let's go outside outside and show you Bill Gates, wanting to cool block out the sun

23:01.160 --> 23:07.000
and look where we're at in a fricking frozen tundra with the power off freezing our asses off

23:07.000 --> 23:13.160
like surfs. That's 21st century war. That's the great reset. And the great reset has cut

23:13.160 --> 23:18.760
the power off in Texas. He is not established that he did not demonstrate this in any way.

23:18.760 --> 23:26.840
Um, no wind turbines, real cold coal destroyed by Obama. See, it's the great reset. Oh, you could

23:26.840 --> 23:33.240
say those things, but it doesn't mean it. There's no, no connection to reality. Really? No. If it

23:33.240 --> 23:41.560
was destroyed by Obama, it's the great resets fault. Dan, do you understand? Yeah, sure.

23:41.560 --> 23:49.560
And so Alex goes outside and he's just a man yelling in the snow. He is, uh, hanging out

23:49.560 --> 23:55.960
with a snow backdrop being mad. And I, I think this is really interesting because if you take

23:55.960 --> 24:01.560
him at his word, he seems to be lamenting the industrial revolution and how, how it made it.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.960
So we don't have to make our own power or something that made us soft.

24:05.960 --> 24:12.120
So modern society is great in many ways, but it's domesticated since man is very dependent

24:12.120 --> 24:16.440
on the system. Now the average American, the average person in the industrialized world

24:16.440 --> 24:21.160
flips on the light switch and just expects power or they pull into the gas station and they expect

24:21.160 --> 24:26.280
gasoline or they go to the grocery store and they expected fresh food is going to be flown in or

24:26.280 --> 24:31.960
trucked into where they're at. Even in the winter, people have been taken away from the land and have

24:31.960 --> 24:37.480
been made very, very soft, myself included. But at least I know that that's going on.

24:37.480 --> 24:44.120
I don't understand what he's complaining about. We're so soft because we expect there to be power

24:44.120 --> 24:48.360
when we, you know, have all agreed to collectively pay for a power company to take care of that.

24:48.360 --> 24:56.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, one, uh, hello Unabomber. It's been a while since we've talked.

24:56.200 --> 25:03.800
And two, no, I think it's far worse. Look, if you, if you and I want to say we're unaware that,

25:03.800 --> 25:09.800
uh, that technology has domesticated us and we have moved away from the land and then act like

25:09.800 --> 25:14.920
that, that's fine. But if we are aware of it and don't take steps to avoid it and instead only tell

25:14.920 --> 25:19.400
other people to do it, we're hypocritical pieces of shit you wish you didn't listen to.

25:19.400 --> 25:25.160
Oh yeah, absolutely. His, his pretending that like, at least I know is, yeah, it doesn't matter.

25:25.160 --> 25:31.400
It does make it way worse. It's worse. Yeah. You should, you should be, uh, not putting out

25:32.120 --> 25:38.840
little tiny videos, uh, should be underground somewhere. Maybe if you want to, if you want to

25:38.840 --> 25:45.480
join the land, if you want to broadcast, you should not ever have inclement weather get in

25:45.480 --> 25:50.120
the way because you should have a ton of generators and you should be broadcasting from a compound

25:50.120 --> 25:54.200
somewhere that no one knows where it is. And you got a bunch of potatoes growing, so you don't have

25:54.200 --> 26:00.680
to worry about anybody. Hello, Unabomber. It's been a long time since we've done it.

26:00.680 --> 26:06.200
It is strange. Although it is, it's, it's really interesting thing that Alex is like, okay, so

26:06.200 --> 26:10.840
our uplinks are in another state, so they still have power. So what we have to do is we have to

26:10.840 --> 26:17.880
shoot these little videos and then send them over somewhere else. And then he's got an elaborate

26:17.880 --> 26:26.120
system to get like little tiny videos, which is just kind of, yeah, that's great. Yeah. It seems

26:26.120 --> 26:31.720
like you should just not do this. I don't know. Take the day off. Yeah. That's my snow day.

26:31.720 --> 26:36.360
That's my feeling about it. And the argument that he's making is so not compelling that I

26:36.360 --> 26:43.240
don't even know why you bother, like why try to make this a conspiracy? Just like stay home.

26:43.240 --> 26:50.360
Yeah. You don't need to risk driving. Yeah. Yeah. But on the other hand, he could risk other people's

26:50.360 --> 26:54.680
lives and still probably make it to work, which is maybe his favorite thing to do. Yeah, sure.

26:54.680 --> 26:59.320
And I mean, there's employees there too. It's not like he's alone at the studio too. So yeah,

26:59.320 --> 27:04.760
that's true. Even better. I wonder if his wife is still playing tennis today. Probably. Yeah.

27:04.760 --> 27:08.920
So Alex, uh, well, I mean, I think the reason he's doing this is because he wants to gloat

27:08.920 --> 27:15.000
because he saw this coming. He knew what was going to happen. These guys have written about every

27:15.000 --> 27:21.640
damn bit of it. How do you think I could make a film 13, 14 years ago called in game blueprint

27:21.640 --> 27:25.240
for global enslavement. And you watch the damn film and almost all of it's come true

27:26.600 --> 27:31.800
because I know their quotes and their statements and they think you deserve to have this done to

27:31.800 --> 27:39.560
you. What's now unfolding because you're not fighting back. They all have private jets.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.400
They all got a bunch of kids. They all have palatial mansions. They all live. However,

27:43.400 --> 27:48.200
they want to have huge yachts. They're telling you when Obama goes to Africa,

27:48.200 --> 27:52.760
that you can't have a car. You can't have an air conditioning. That's a lie. Yeah. Yeah.

27:52.760 --> 27:57.160
It's an old, old, fun lie that he, I guess the snow pulled out of his little brain.

27:57.160 --> 28:04.280
Um, but like this is nonsense and I'm starting to get feelings of almost like stolen valor on his,

28:04.280 --> 28:11.160
like his part of like being right about things. Yeah. Yeah. How dare you? I resent that. He's

28:11.160 --> 28:14.840
just pointing to end game and being like, I was right about everything. I was like,

28:14.840 --> 28:19.400
you should go and rewatch your own work. This is not good. No, here's the worst part. Okay.

28:19.400 --> 28:27.080
Okay. End game. Was this a large amount about a road jet had it been built would probably

28:27.080 --> 28:32.200
have ameliorated a lot of problems they are currently experiencing. So not only was he

28:32.200 --> 28:36.200
not right about that, it should have been built. So he didn't have to deal with it today.

28:36.200 --> 28:40.840
I'm not positive that the road would have helped as much as you think, but it was a really big road

28:40.840 --> 28:46.200
that it was pretty big. It was pretty big. Yeah. And also Alex does need to do this show, not only

28:46.200 --> 28:52.040
to gloat about how he was right, though he wasn't. Um, he also needs to make an announcement. There

28:52.040 --> 28:57.400
are new numbers out the new numbers. Do you know what, do you know what these numbers are? Uh,

28:57.400 --> 29:03.080
Querkin is Querkin a new number? Nope. It's not, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. It's not

29:03.080 --> 29:07.880
brand new numbers. You misunderstood. No. Okay. I've not discovered a new number. I was just

29:07.880 --> 29:12.200
checking to see if maybe they discovered a new number. No, you never know. I recognize that

29:12.200 --> 29:19.800
that's a fair interpretation of what I said. That is not correct. So the globalist, right?

29:19.800 --> 29:23.960
Yeah. For a long time, they had claims of how many people they were going to kill.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.320
They're going to kill a bunch. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. There's new numbers.

29:29.800 --> 29:33.800
Like you're part of the establishment and going along with this. That's why they always taught,

29:33.800 --> 29:37.000
Oh, we're going to get rid of half the world population in the seventies. And then later,

29:37.000 --> 29:41.080
well, once we set up real government will be about 80%, but the good people will still be

29:41.080 --> 29:46.280
around to guard the earth. Now they probably say 90% will be exterminated. And the new numbers are

29:46.280 --> 29:53.880
down to 1% of world population. Do you understand? You've been taught to hate yourselves. You've

29:53.880 --> 29:58.680
been isolated. Big tech media is designed. They admit to make you depressed to make you alone.

29:59.560 --> 30:04.120
You are under a reclamation program to remove you and build a new world.

30:04.120 --> 30:11.800
You were under a culling program. They decided to dynamite us. They decided to remove us. They

30:11.800 --> 30:17.240
decided to blot us out. Like you destroy a building with a wrecking ball. So at least admit what's

30:17.240 --> 30:23.000
happening to you and recognize what's happening to you as it happens and realize that the inhuman,

30:23.000 --> 30:29.880
degenerate scumbag, filth and garbage that is carrying this out and doing this all lives

30:29.880 --> 30:35.400
lavish lifestyles are all completely wicked and hateful. Most of their children commit suicide.

30:35.400 --> 30:40.920
They're totally disconnected and they are ruthless scum and only have a will to dominate control

30:40.920 --> 30:45.560
others. And if you lay down to them, you allow them to hurt other innocence and you cut yourself

30:45.560 --> 30:50.840
off from God. So don't be part of it. And that's why we need to primary weak Republicans.

30:50.840 --> 30:55.160
I'm confused. Is this not okay? All right. You need to take back the house.

30:55.160 --> 31:01.320
This is ridiculous. This is so inciting. It's just nonsense,

31:01.320 --> 31:05.000
but it's also just an idiot standing in the snow, yelling for no reason.

31:05.720 --> 31:10.840
This is kind of, it's kind of a preview of what his life is going to be like in 10 years.

31:10.840 --> 31:15.720
The visual of it is really jarring because it is like, I mean, it's Alex Jones. So like he's,

31:15.720 --> 31:22.760
you know, this, this notable firebrand, ding dong idiot, but it's also a complete impotence

31:22.760 --> 31:28.520
that he's showing because he's just standing in the snow, yelling about his enemies.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.400
No, he's an apocalypse preacher.

31:31.400 --> 31:36.920
Yeah. But also, but also how little import or meaning is there to him being like,

31:36.920 --> 31:43.240
there's new numbers that 99% of the population is going to be killed. Like, okay, now you can't

31:43.240 --> 31:47.960
make it smaller or like the survivor number smaller. Like you have just backed yourself

31:47.960 --> 31:52.920
into a corner where it's like, okay, now a hundred percent. This doesn't mean anything. You're just

31:52.920 --> 31:57.240
making up numbers. And now you've gotten to the end of the line. There's no more numbers.

31:57.880 --> 32:03.000
I like the idea that there are quarterly, uh, extermination reports, you know, like every

32:03.000 --> 32:08.440
quarter there's new numbers like, Oh no, no, no. We were going to kill 99% at the end of the first

32:08.440 --> 32:14.280
quarter, but now re looking things into the second quarter, we're projecting a 97% murder.

32:14.280 --> 32:19.080
Some weirdo like Daniel calls Alex and he's like, hey, build a bird. They were saying that,

32:19.080 --> 32:24.840
uh, it's 99 now. Yeah. Yeah. There was a action that was saying 98,

32:26.440 --> 32:34.760
but they lost the negotiations were fraught. Yes. All fell apart. So not to, not to spend

32:34.760 --> 32:41.880
too much time, uh, uh, talking about why he's standing in the snow. Uh, Alex decides now time

32:41.880 --> 32:47.880
to yell about the vaccines. Sure. There is hope. As I said,

32:49.800 --> 32:54.040
Merck had to pull their vaccine three weeks ago because it was making people sick and killing them.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.160
And they admitted that even if you take it, it doesn't protect you. They recommended you just

32:57.160 --> 33:01.560
get COVID and get over it. And it was a scam, huge move that they, they got scared and said,

33:01.560 --> 33:04.760
this is too evil. That would be a huge move. South Africa banned the vaccine,

33:04.760 --> 33:08.360
make people sick and killing them. Australia had to ban their vaccine that they put out.

33:08.360 --> 33:15.640
Cause it was going to be HIV positive stuff. India just banned the MRNA Pfizer shot HIV stuff.

33:16.280 --> 33:20.920
What? Yeah. All right. Most of that shit we've covered in the past, uh, in episodes.

33:20.920 --> 33:25.560
That's all nonsense. The India one though is a new narrative. So I wanted to just clarify why

33:25.560 --> 33:32.280
India didn't approve the use of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported by CNBC back on February

33:32.280 --> 33:36.920
5th that Pfizer had withdrawn their application for emergency use of their vaccine in India after

33:36.920 --> 33:42.520
quote the government in January approved too much cheaper shots. There were a couple of other

33:42.520 --> 33:47.560
hurdles, namely that India requires local studies to be done to approve vaccine use. And the studies

33:47.560 --> 33:52.680
of Pfizer's vaccines had not been done in India. The second issue is that vaccine, uh, the one that

33:52.680 --> 33:57.640
they had created the Pfizer one, it requires storage in very cold conditions, which creates

33:57.640 --> 34:02.840
a concern about the ability for it to be rolled out all over India. You know, there's, there's

34:02.840 --> 34:09.400
concerns about the supply of deep freeze, uh, capabilities. Alex is pretending, Alex is

34:09.400 --> 34:13.080
pretending that they banned it because it's dangerous. When in reality, it's really just

34:13.080 --> 34:19.560
kind of a boring logistics issue. Again, this is a water heater noise. Alex is trying to tell you

34:19.560 --> 34:25.800
is a Viking. Yeah. That's a, that's like India being like, listen guys, we're going to have to

34:25.800 --> 34:31.160
ban the import of snowballs. Now I know they don't get far once they get across the border,

34:31.160 --> 34:36.920
but we just can't let this happen anymore. There are cheaper options that will do the same thing

34:36.920 --> 34:44.040
that a snowball does. And yeah, we'll, we'll go with those. So Alex, uh, still, uh, being dumb

34:44.040 --> 34:50.920
starts talking about how Texas used to supply everyone with power. They have shut our power

34:50.920 --> 34:55.720
systems down so much that we can't even provide power in the summer and the winter and the great

34:55.720 --> 35:01.480
state of Texas that up until 10 years ago was supplying power to 15 States and was doing an

35:01.480 --> 35:07.640
incredible job, but we've been shut down. That's a complete lie. Uh, Texas is a unique state in the

35:07.640 --> 35:11.320
country in terms of their power grid. And it's actually one of the reasons that the situation

35:11.320 --> 35:16.200
in the state now is so much more complicated. Texas is the only state in the country that has

35:16.200 --> 35:21.480
its own completely autonomous power grid called ERCOT, which is run by the electric reliability

35:21.480 --> 35:26.360
council of Texas. Houston public media recently posted a very concise explanation of how the

35:26.360 --> 35:32.040
system works and how it got to be the way it is, which I will paraphrase now. It doesn't and they

35:32.040 --> 35:37.720
fucked it up. When electricity started to become more prevalent, the country saw utility companies

35:37.720 --> 35:45.480
begin to combine and link up, uh, and, uh, create regional things. In 1935, FDR signed the federal

35:45.480 --> 35:51.160
power act quote, which charged the federal power commission with overseeing interstate electricity

35:51.160 --> 35:56.200
sales. The federal government could only really get involved with regulating interstate power

35:56.200 --> 36:01.480
exchanges. So in order to avoid that regulation, Texas has remained the only state in the country

36:01.480 --> 36:07.800
with its own power grid. This has been breached a few times, notably in 1976, when a Texas power

36:07.800 --> 36:13.480
company sent power to Oklahoma very briefly in what's been called the quote, midnight connection.

36:14.360 --> 36:18.920
Alex is completely making up that the state of Texas formerly provided energy to 15 States.

36:18.920 --> 36:23.800
I suspect that he doesn't even know that his state's energy set up, uh, is the way it is

36:23.800 --> 36:27.640
and how some of the problems he's complaining about are the direct by-product of his state

36:27.640 --> 36:32.920
following his own anti-federal government paranoia. It's kind of embarrassing that, uh,

36:32.920 --> 36:39.640
that he has no idea how it works, uh, and that because everybody else does it differently,

36:39.640 --> 36:47.480
it's their fault despite not knowing how he does it. Yeah, probably. And you know, uh, it's, it's

36:47.480 --> 36:53.560
really, it's really weird to me because like it should be a point of pride to him that the Texas

36:53.560 --> 37:00.120
doesn't supply our to other States and other States don't supply power to them. It should be

37:00.120 --> 37:08.200
like, this is a rugged individual pre-industrial revolution. We are not pacified instead. We mine

37:08.200 --> 37:15.880
our own coal, we burn our own coal and that's what we do. He's still, he's instead choosing

37:15.880 --> 37:23.000
the more attractive narrative to him, which is that Obama made it so Texas doesn't supply most

37:23.000 --> 37:29.320
of the country electricity. Somehow it's still, you know, the anti-Obama pro-coal

37:29.320 --> 37:36.600
kind of narratives take precedence over his state's rights, uh, jacking off, I think. Yeah.

37:36.600 --> 37:43.880
Yeah. I mean, I think that depends on the day too. Probably. Yeah. I would, uh, I would also argue,

37:43.880 --> 37:53.960
uh, that in this circumstance, Alex is, I guess trapped, you know, like everything that he says

37:53.960 --> 38:01.240
is going to be wrong. Yeah. Because the reality of it is like, this is all fucked up beyond reason

38:01.240 --> 38:07.640
because, you know, we made choices to get at this place. Um, I think that Alex might be literally

38:07.640 --> 38:14.280
trapped as well. Uh, he might, his wife might be driving the Audi, so he might be stuck at the

38:14.280 --> 38:21.240
studio. Might as well scream on the street. I'm not going anywhere until five. Yeah. So Alex gets

38:21.240 --> 38:27.240
to rambling about some other stuff. And I found this particular, uh, thought that he has a little

38:27.240 --> 38:32.120
bit upsetting. This has to do with the storming of the Capitol. Because the globalists fear what

38:32.120 --> 38:36.920
you saw at the Capitol. It was a few hundred that got the big mass to do it. The globalists

38:36.920 --> 38:42.440
the globalists provocateur it had security stand down so that what they feared in the future could

38:42.440 --> 38:49.480
be discredited. Now, a million people in DC with a serious mission to take over and overthrow

38:49.480 --> 38:57.080
an illegitimate government is powerful. Okay. So what I'm hearing is the globalists are afraid of

38:57.080 --> 39:02.520
what happened on the sixth. And so they did the sixth in order to make sure that Alex couldn't do

39:02.520 --> 39:10.440
it better later. Yes, you are correct. That is exactly what happened. Great. And Alex's Alex's

39:10.440 --> 39:19.160
point, I believe is that a few million people overrunning the Capitol, that's a W guys. That

39:19.160 --> 39:26.680
means we win this one. A few hundred people were fucked. So yeah, I think he's really against the

39:26.680 --> 39:31.880
principles of what happened on the sixth. Yeah. I think, I think it's, I think it's become quite

39:31.880 --> 39:36.600
clear that now he realizes he's not going to get arrested or anything. He can sort of now sort of

39:36.600 --> 39:43.000
subtly, just, just chill out and, you know, Hey guys, guys, two weeks from now, anybody

39:43.000 --> 39:49.560
not busy two weeks. That's when we got to get a couple of million, two weeks. So, uh, we know

39:49.560 --> 39:58.040
that Alex is a scholar on the, uh, matter of carbon dioxide, um, climate change, world war two.

39:58.040 --> 40:04.280
Yeah. Alex does. He, he, he seems to think this I've heard him say this before. And that's why I

40:04.280 --> 40:10.440
wanted to play this again, because it's such a dumb thought that I'm, I'm surprised he repeats

40:10.440 --> 40:14.920
this multiple times. It's clearly something he actually believes. And that is that people are

40:14.920 --> 40:23.080
only afraid of carbon dioxide because it sounds like carbon monoxide. Oh boy. Yeah. This is very

40:23.080 --> 40:30.120
bad. The sun is energy. It drives almost all of our climate, light, carbon dioxide, oxygen,

40:30.120 --> 40:35.960
and water is the carbon cycle. And if you take any of those very, you have death on the planet.

40:35.960 --> 40:41.800
Well, people know water's good. Folks know oxygen is good and they know the sun's good.

40:42.920 --> 40:48.840
So what is it? They attack carbon dioxide. Cause it sounds like monoxide Penn and Teller did it

40:48.840 --> 40:53.320
20 years ago. I did it 15 years ago. We ought to go out and do it again. You go out, you give

40:53.320 --> 41:00.200
people the name of water scientific 95% saving it. And we talked to over a hundred people and

41:00.200 --> 41:06.360
only a few went, wait a minute. We're like dihydrogen monoxide. It's everywhere. It's toxic.

41:06.360 --> 41:12.440
If you drink too much of it, it can kill you. Um, it, it, you know, it, it, they're like, yes,

41:12.440 --> 41:19.880
I agree. We should be in that. That's water even better. 99% of the studies we did out of the

41:19.880 --> 41:26.600
public, unofficial study, if you give them the name of table salt, Oh my God, it sounds like

41:26.600 --> 41:33.960
Satan. I mean, table salt has a really scary name and the average person will come to you

41:33.960 --> 41:38.280
and we'll say, let's be in that. Alex couldn't remember the name of table salt. Yeah. I was

41:38.280 --> 41:42.920
going to say, why didn't you say it then? If you're so proud of knowing what it is,

41:42.920 --> 41:48.200
Jordan, I hate to say a demonic word here, but sodium chloride, get the fuck out.

41:53.320 --> 41:56.840
You guys can't see those are Jordan is doing a cross the sign of a cross.

42:01.880 --> 42:06.200
I might be crazy. I might be crazy, but I'm going to toss this out for you, Dan. Yeah. I think

42:06.200 --> 42:13.080
somebody who knows what dihydrogen monoxide is yet believes that the president is secretly

42:13.080 --> 42:19.160
controlled by the devil is still dumber than somebody who thinks things are what they are,

42:19.160 --> 42:25.800
but it's like, just say one. Yeah. That's my belief. And I think that, you know,

42:25.800 --> 42:29.960
we're leaving all that aside. I think, you know, you may be right. You may be wrong,

42:29.960 --> 42:36.680
but my conjecture is sure. Anybody who thinks one of these kinds of studies of the public means

42:36.680 --> 42:43.480
anything is a dick. Oh, that's fair. And they don't, they don't have much going on. I mean,

42:43.480 --> 42:48.120
you don't, you don't remember the greatest poster before there was five 38, Dan,

42:48.120 --> 42:54.600
there was Jay Leno. All right. And when you do jaywalking, you get the right results. Yeah. Yeah.

42:54.600 --> 43:04.680
Yeah. I tricked you scientific poll. Fuck you. Yeah. So we just got one last clip here. And

43:05.640 --> 43:11.800
I mean, the, the report ends with Alex sitting in a dark studio and it actually ends with him

43:11.800 --> 43:17.240
yelling about how the new world order is going down and just the visual of it, of him sitting

43:17.240 --> 43:25.800
in a completely dark studio. That is like a review. That is Andy daily review. It is exactly

43:25.800 --> 43:32.360
that. It's like, guys, where's everybody. Why is everybody leaving this show? What's going on?

43:32.360 --> 43:35.800
Yeah. There's a, if I didn't hate him so much, there'd be a little bit of pathos

43:36.600 --> 43:43.160
in the moment of, of him sitting alone in a dark studio, insisting he was going to destroy

43:43.160 --> 43:48.680
the globalists. But I choose not to end our episode with that clip because honestly it's

43:48.680 --> 43:55.240
angry. It's kind of funny to think about, but it's, it's meaningless compared to this,

43:56.120 --> 44:02.520
this clip, I think says everything that you need to know. I understand the average person doesn't

44:02.520 --> 44:10.280
read 300 books on world war II. Correct. I understand the average person doesn't read a

44:10.280 --> 44:16.200
hundred books on Rome. The person doesn't read 50 books on British naval history. The average

44:16.200 --> 44:21.400
person doesn't read 30 books on us history in the revolutionary war or five books. I disagree.

44:21.400 --> 44:30.200
The civil war or a couple of hundred books on globalism and perfectly in Zbigniew Brzezinski and

44:31.160 --> 44:40.040
Klaus Schwab. But I did. Nope. And so I know who these people are just because I happen to

44:40.040 --> 44:47.240
get into it when I was like nine years old because these books were all over my house.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.800
And so I had a piece of chip earlier, so I keep licking my lips.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.640
Cause all the stores are closed. There's no food. The grocery stores are all closed.

44:58.200 --> 45:01.160
So I went out and got the crew some food, got some potato chips and

45:03.240 --> 45:07.320
some candy bars. That's that. That's about all we get right now. Cause the power's off

45:07.320 --> 45:12.120
because the government shut the power off by shutting the power plants down.

45:12.120 --> 45:16.680
Yeah. I think that's a good summation of Alex. Just like bragging about books he's read that

45:16.680 --> 45:21.480
he hasn't read. What hundred books are about Klaus Schwab? Get the fuck out of here.

45:23.320 --> 45:27.880
I don't know. He's just rambling about how well ready he is. And he's not like normal people

45:27.880 --> 45:32.280
cause he's, he's figured all this out because he's so smart and read all this shit. And then

45:32.280 --> 45:38.600
he gets completely derailed by a chip. Just, Oh, I ate a chip earlier. That's all we get now.

45:38.600 --> 45:47.320
Cause the power's out, man. The greatest minds of my generation. I saw it taken down by a little

45:47.320 --> 45:53.640
chip in the tooth for want of a toothpick. The greatest minds of my generation have been torn

45:53.640 --> 46:03.800
asunder. Yeah. This is a bleak. Yeah. That's not good. So I, yeah, I just wanted to check in with

46:03.800 --> 46:09.000
you and let you know how things go. We're going for Alex. And it turns out, yeah, it turns out

46:09.000 --> 46:14.440
this is how it's going. Last we, last we know of him at the time that we're recording this,

46:14.440 --> 46:20.600
he's just sitting alone in a dark studio and no, no telling when he'll be back.

46:20.600 --> 46:25.720
I, I do like the idea of somebody showing up at the office tomorrow,

46:25.720 --> 46:30.360
turning the lights off and Alex is just sitting at the desk. Just like eyes haven't

46:30.360 --> 46:35.480
blunt for 20 hours. Just Aaron. He's actually wearing a tie. Yeah.

46:37.320 --> 46:43.080
It's more put together than usual. I slept in the office for the first time in a long time.

46:43.080 --> 46:47.000
It feels really great. Really great guys. I didn't, I don't know if you know this,

46:47.000 --> 46:55.880
but you can read in the dark, probably have better comprehension of stuff than he does

46:55.880 --> 47:01.320
at this point. Guys. I started reading books with my hands, even if they aren't in braille,

47:01.320 --> 47:05.240
I'm figuring it out, man. Yeah. Really doing it this time. Did you know that

47:05.240 --> 47:10.280
Klaus Schwab didn't say all the stuff I said, he says, we're going to be real trouble if people

47:10.280 --> 47:18.520
find that out. Oh shit. Oh no. So, uh, Jordan will be back on Friday, but, uh, until then,

47:18.520 --> 47:24.040
uh, we have a website. We do have a website. It's knowledge fight.com. Yep. We're also on Twitter.

47:24.040 --> 47:28.120
We are on Twitter. It's at knowledge. We're fighting that go to bed. Jordan was on Facebook.

47:28.120 --> 47:33.480
We are down shy Tuesday. And if you could please find a local charity or bath under your

47:33.480 --> 47:37.560
area to help out people do in a God's work. Yeah. We'll be back. But until then I'm Neo,

47:37.560 --> 47:43.720
I'm Leo. I'm DZX Clark. I'm Daryl Rundis. I, uh, uh, uh, uh, we'll hope the best for everybody

47:43.720 --> 47:46.200
going through tough times with the weather all around the country.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.200
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.

47:48.200 --> 48:05.960
Well, Alex, I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.
