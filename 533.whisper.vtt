N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:13.040 --> 00:21.280
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating at knowledgefight.com It's time to pray

00:21.280 --> 00:26.920
I have great respect for knowledge fight I'm sick of them posing as if they're the

00:26.920 --> 00:34.280
good guys saying we are the bad guys. Knowledge Fight. Dan and Jordan, Knowledge Fight.

00:34.280 --> 00:47.240
I need, I need money. Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice. Stop it. Andy and Candice, Andy and Candice. It's time to pray.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.480
Andy and Candice, you're on the air. Thanks for holding us.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.080
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.

00:53.080 --> 00:59.400
Knowledge Fight. N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight dot com. I love you.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.520
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan. I'm Jordan. We're a couple dudes,

01:02.520 --> 01:05.880
like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

01:05.880 --> 01:10.760
Emmerich Jones. Oh indeed we are, Dan. Uh huh. Dan? Jordan. Quick question. Jordan.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.920
What's your bright spot today? My bright spot, Jordan, have I said mochi. Have I? Yes, you have

01:14.920 --> 01:19.560
said mochi. That one's true. Fuck. Do you have any other rice-based snacks that you

01:19.560 --> 01:24.120
appreciate? No. Do you like the Rice Krispie Treats? Oh I do, I do like those. I haven't had

01:24.120 --> 01:29.000
many in a while though. I did, um, I was telling you about this. Like I've been trying to branch

01:29.000 --> 01:33.320
out and try different types of rice. Naturally, yeah. I'm kind of excited about that. Maybe that

01:33.320 --> 01:38.040
could be a bright spot. Rice exploration. Although the path that I've gone down so far has been

01:38.040 --> 01:42.280
disappointing. I tried the Forbidden Rice. Yes, it was not as forbidden as you might imagine.

01:42.280 --> 01:48.200
Boo to the Forbidden Rice. I forbid it from my kitchen. But yeah, I'm gonna try a rice

01:48.200 --> 01:52.520
exploration for the next, uh, while. That's my new, I know, I know people enjoy hearing about

01:52.520 --> 01:58.040
whatever, like, childish cooking adventures are going on. Whatever rabbit hole you take for,

01:58.040 --> 02:04.120
uh, for a few weeks. Whatever elementary level, uh, cooking 101 shit. I like it. That would be,

02:04.120 --> 02:08.280
that would be more interesting if the word forbidden was just, uh, more applied to things

02:08.280 --> 02:11.640
that suck. Uh huh. You know, like, oh, the Forbidden Rice. It's not forbidden because

02:11.640 --> 02:15.560
it's bad or evil. It's just bad. You know, it just sucks. It's just shitty rice. Look, look,

02:15.560 --> 02:20.360
I want to be totally, like, above board and clear about this. It doesn't suck. It's just not,

02:20.360 --> 02:26.280
it's not, it doesn't live up to the name. Wow, the Lambada sucks. That, that dance is forbidden.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.240
I, I don't know if the Lambada sucks. I don't actually know how to do it, but. Okay. The rice

02:31.240 --> 02:35.960
itself is just, bleh, whatever. You expect a lot when something's forbidden. It's like,

02:35.960 --> 02:40.520
oh, only the king could have this rice. It does, it does kind of raise expectations a little bit.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.960
It doesn't live up to it. Anyway. The Forbidden City isn't just like fucking, uh, Detroit,

02:45.960 --> 02:50.040
you know? Anyway, rice, I guess, is my bright spot. That's a good bright spot. How about you?

02:50.760 --> 02:56.760
My good, my bright spot, Dan, is that, uh, approximately four hours ago, my partner got

02:56.760 --> 03:01.640
the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Oh, that's great. It is great news. So she will be

03:01.640 --> 03:07.400
transport, uh, transforming into a cyborg, uh, within weeks. Yeah, either that or where she will

03:07.400 --> 03:12.440
be dead within 15 minutes. Well, that should have happened three hours ago. Okay. Three and a half

03:12.440 --> 03:17.400
hours ago. 15 minutes temporally. Have you talked to her in three hours? I haven't. Uh-oh. Oh,

03:17.400 --> 03:22.760
no, that's not good. Um, well, congratulations. Uh, I hope that, uh, I hope it all is very happy

03:22.760 --> 03:28.360
for it. Uneventful and, uh, everybody's is healthy. Yep, it's, it's nice. It's a, it's a

03:28.360 --> 03:34.440
good little bright spot considering, you know, how shittily the teacher's union has been treated.

03:34.440 --> 03:39.160
Sure. You know, like, yep. Yeah. Uh, anyway, Jordan, today we have an interesting episode

03:39.160 --> 03:42.200
to go over. Oh, okay. We're going to be talking about February 17th. Blackjack!

03:42.920 --> 03:48.840
Too early, kid. Damn it! You're like the guy who hit the NOS too early in Fast and Furious.

03:48.840 --> 03:57.880
Too early, kid. February 17th, Jordan. Oh, okay. Uh, we were like two cars racing and you just

03:57.880 --> 04:02.920
went too fast. You went right into the barricade so I could slowly go around. I never know when

04:02.920 --> 04:07.640
you're going to speed up or slow down. You, I'm always chasing you. That's the struggle. Yeah,

04:07.640 --> 04:12.200
the advantage is with the server. You understand this in the game of tennis? You do understand this

04:12.200 --> 04:16.920
in the game of tennis. Um, yeah, so interestingly, Alex was able to get back into studio on the

04:16.920 --> 04:22.680
17th, which is Wednesday. Okay. And I have some interesting thoughts about it. I don't know

04:22.680 --> 04:28.280
exactly what was going on, but he was able to broadcast. Uh, the studio is a bit dark. Sure.

04:28.280 --> 04:33.160
There are lights in terms of like focused on him, so it's not like he's sitting in a shadow. Right,

04:33.160 --> 04:39.560
right, right. Um, but the giant million dollar board behind him is off. Okay. Uh, it's, it's

04:39.560 --> 04:45.720
bleak. Um, and it's interesting. This, uh, this episode is, uh, really fucked up. Oh, yeah, no,

04:45.720 --> 04:51.640
I believe that. I believe that. Sometimes when the, the, the vibe is this bad, just take the day

04:51.640 --> 04:55.480
off. I would, I would have advised. You're going to say all kinds of weird shit. You're in a dark

04:55.480 --> 05:01.800
room, basically by yourself. I would have said, uh, you know, call in, don't do, don't do this.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.960
Yeah, absolutely. But then, you know, the flip side of the coin is that like necessity is the

05:05.960 --> 05:10.840
mother of invention. And like, whenever your back's to the wall, sometimes you fuck around

05:10.840 --> 05:15.400
and pull out something amazing. Right, right, right. We've heard countless stories of that.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.680
Fair. How many times have you heard a standup talk about how, like, it was the worst possible

05:20.680 --> 05:25.080
scenario? Like you've been on stage and like the lights have gone out. Totally. Sometimes those

05:25.080 --> 05:29.240
are the best sets you could possibly have. Mic is cut out. Yeah. The whole thing. Yeah. Yeah.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.160
Your back's to the wall and something within you comes out that you didn't know was there.

05:33.160 --> 05:38.280
And you rise to the occasion. That's not this. I didn't think so. I was not expecting that.

05:38.280 --> 05:43.080
What could be rising to the occasion? I don't know. Anyway, it's going to be a lot of fun.

05:44.200 --> 05:50.360
Uh, I've enjoyed some of this and some of it is just, oh, we'll just say overtly white

05:50.360 --> 05:55.080
supremacist. Well, that'll happen. It's a dark room, so you gotta brighten it up somehow, Dan.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.600
We'll get down to business on the episode, but before we do, let's take a little moment to say

05:58.600 --> 06:01.240
thank you to some folks who signed up and are supporting the show. Oh, that's a great idea.

06:01.240 --> 06:06.200
So first, Alex Jones in Mike Tyson's voice. The in Mike Tyson's voice was not in parentheses,

06:06.200 --> 06:10.680
so I'm not doing a, I'm not doing a, no, it has to be, no, it's the name. I'm not doing an

06:10.680 --> 06:14.920
impression. No, you don't do impressions. No, certainly not. You are now a policy wonk.

06:14.920 --> 06:20.200
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next, Bill. And then also thank you to Dana

06:20.200 --> 06:26.360
for suggesting to Bill to listen to this podcast. Very complicated name, but you're a policy wonk.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.800
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you. Thank you very much. I swear you themed these.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.360
Sometimes there's normal names. Sometimes it's a long list of joke names and now we're just

06:34.360 --> 06:39.320
getting explanations. I try and balance it out. Next, The Demon Deacon. Thank you so much. You

06:39.320 --> 06:43.640
are now a policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thank you very much, Dee Dee. I think it's the Wake

06:43.640 --> 06:49.800
Forest mascot. Yes, I am fairly certain. Do you know about Deacon Blues, a song by Steely Dan?

06:49.800 --> 06:56.520
No, I do not know. I'm not a big Steely Dan guy, man. Holy shit. No, this is a thing.

06:56.520 --> 07:05.320
They got a name for the winners in the world and I want a name when I lose. They call Alabama

07:05.320 --> 07:13.960
the Crimson Tide. Call me Deacon Blues. Okay. All right. So I'm not missing a ton. Drink

07:13.960 --> 07:21.080
scotch whiskey all night long. Well, now you're selling it. And dive behind the wheel. Is that

07:21.080 --> 07:27.480
what Steely Dan sounds like? A little bit. I think Fagan has a better voice than I do.

07:30.280 --> 07:34.200
Deacon Blues, good song. Peg. That Asia album is all just pretty good.

07:35.800 --> 07:41.640
Reagan liked Peg. Anyway, next, Nathan W. Thank you so much. You're now a policy wonk.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.520
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you, Nathan. Next, John C. Thank you so much. You're now a policy wonk.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.120
I'm a policy wonk. Thank you, John. Thank you. And then I'd like to give a shout out to some

07:50.120 --> 07:54.520
folks who donated on an elevated level. We appreciate that very much. So the Woods Boys,

07:54.520 --> 07:59.080
but I'm insisting on calling them Dem Woods Boys. Thank you so much. You are now technocrats.

07:59.800 --> 08:06.440
And Jake, AKA Gibby. Okay. It's your birthday. Happy birthday. Oh, happy birthday. And you're

08:06.440 --> 08:12.200
now a technocrat. And Mr. Goblin keeps you clean. You are now a technocrat. And I'd like to say

08:12.200 --> 08:20.440
hello and good tidings to you and your family and your daughter. You're now all technocrats. Sure.

08:20.440 --> 08:26.280
Everybody's a technocrat. I'm a policy wonk. Crikey, mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself

08:26.280 --> 08:30.760
a brew. How's your 401k doing, bro? All right. We got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.600
All right. Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

08:34.600 --> 08:41.480
Why are you pimps so good? My neck is freakishly large. I declare info war on you. Thank you all.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.280
Jordan. I can't believe you don't like Steely Dan. I didn't say I didn't like Steely Dan.

08:46.280 --> 08:51.400
I'm just not a Steely Dan guy. Like I'd never got into Steely Dan. I'm not in my,

08:51.400 --> 08:56.520
I'm not yet 42. So I don't feel like it's the right time for me to get into Steely Dan.

08:56.520 --> 09:01.160
I don't know. A Steely Dan folk. We have a saying, and that's you're either with us or

09:01.160 --> 09:06.280
you're against us. Is that what Steely Dan folks say? I did not know that. I guess that's why I

09:06.280 --> 09:10.840
haven't been invited. Cause apparently I'm against you. Yeah. You, you were a dissenter.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.400
Check it out. Check it out. Buy the camp, listen to the camp buy a thrill album. I think you'll

09:17.400 --> 09:22.040
enjoy it. I believe I will. I've never, I've never heard a Steely Dan song that I wasn't like.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.480
What about Black Cow? Have you heard Black Cow? I don't know.

09:25.480 --> 09:32.520
Black Cow is a good song. Probably. So Jordan, we have two out of context drops from today's

09:32.520 --> 09:36.680
show. That's exciting. Yeah. I'll let you decide afterwards, which you prefer. Okay. Here's option

09:36.680 --> 09:40.440
number one. All right. And I'm just telling you what I really think. Okay. So this is the ultimate

09:40.440 --> 09:45.880
Black Pill broadcast today. That is an accurate assessment of the show. He's very Black Pill

09:45.880 --> 09:51.080
mood. Okay. Which is probably going to hurt sales of the real red pill, which he sells. Could.

09:51.080 --> 09:57.080
Here's option number two. You gotta wash that ass. What's it going to be? Well, that's tough.

09:57.640 --> 10:03.160
That's tough. You do gotta wash that ass. You gotta wash that ass. However, there's a part of

10:03.160 --> 10:07.640
me that thinks that he should try selling like that's kind of an untapped market. The Black

10:07.640 --> 10:12.200
Pill, right? It's a, you know, you got the real red pill. It gets you all that. What if you sold

10:12.200 --> 10:17.160
a pill that just gives you, gives you like minor depression. Everybody could use a couple of days

10:17.160 --> 10:22.280
on the bed without liking yourself. I don't know if this is a good market. I think it'd be best

10:22.280 --> 10:27.800
to avoid that, that, that space. Maybe, maybe it would be a prank gift that you get, you know,

10:27.800 --> 10:34.600
like it's a, it's a white elephant gift. Yeah. These are depression pills. All right. I don't

10:34.600 --> 10:39.400
know. I don't like this. Okay. Fair enough. So we start off the episode here and Alex is

10:39.400 --> 10:46.520
sitting in studio alone. Sad. Yeah. No cool lights behind him. Clean ass though. We washed that ass.

10:46.520 --> 10:53.880
Yeah. And I don't know. It kind of, you know, I know he didn't, but I, this he's responding to

10:53.880 --> 10:59.000
a question that we brought up on our episode, which is like, Hey man, you're supposed to be

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
the big prepper guy, right? Right. What's going on here. Thank you so much for joining us. I have

11:05.000 --> 11:14.440
a skeleton crew and we have limited power back on in the studios here. And a lot of listeners will

11:14.440 --> 11:18.600
say to me, well, you're Mr. Prepared. Why aren't you prepared? Want to eat some of that struggle

11:18.600 --> 11:23.160
food. When I've told people that we should all take our vitamins and be in shape, I'm pointing

11:23.160 --> 11:28.360
three fingers back at myself and one finger at you. But I'm obviously saying why I think the

11:28.360 --> 11:33.320
best thing to do is the city of Austin was here two years ago and wouldn't give us the permits

11:34.360 --> 11:39.400
for a full power to generator system that we wanted to put in here. And you could,

11:39.400 --> 11:43.960
I guess move locations. We don't have the money to do that. So we're just like the average folks

11:43.960 --> 11:49.000
in. I don't have power. Most of my family doesn't have power. Uh, and so I've been going around

11:49.000 --> 11:53.560
dealing with frozen pipes and things like that. And I'm, I'm not complaining. Oh, so it's the red

11:53.560 --> 11:58.360
tape. Yeah. So Alex very well may have been dealing with some pipe issues, but that's far

11:58.360 --> 12:02.520
from the only thing he's been doing while this winter storm has lingered in Texas. And apparently

12:02.520 --> 12:07.400
his family is without power. As it turns out in the middle of all this, Alex decided to take a

12:07.400 --> 12:12.120
helicopter to Dallas to sit down and get drunk and smoke cigars with Steven Crowder while

12:12.120 --> 12:16.840
simultaneously complaining about cancel culture and lying about what they do for a living.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.280
I wanted really badly to cover that interview for the show because it's very stupid,

12:20.280 --> 12:24.600
but it's behind a paywall. So it kind of falls into that territory of things. I don't feel right

12:24.600 --> 12:29.000
making content out of. And unfortunately the section they released for free on YouTube,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.640
it's kind of dumb. It's not, uh, it's not worth it. And as you and I were talking about this,

12:33.640 --> 12:40.200
how terrible of a tease would it be? Like as if we were promoting. Yeah, no, that would be us

12:40.200 --> 12:44.280
being like, and then go listen to the last bit of their show, I guess. No, we're not doing that

12:44.280 --> 12:48.920
shit. There was one interesting kernel in there though, that I wanted to talk about a Lieutenant

12:48.920 --> 12:53.480
Colonel. Ooh, there was a point where Steven Crowder was trying to help Alex sell his whole,

12:53.480 --> 12:58.440
like I'm not left-wing or right-wing kind of bona fides. Sure, sure, sure. So, you know,

12:58.440 --> 13:02.680
they're trying to pretend that he's above the political fray. And Alex said something that I

13:02.680 --> 13:10.440
thought was shocking and interesting. My mom's, uh, brother had been a big helicopter ace in

13:10.440 --> 13:15.080
Vietnam, and then he was involved in Iran Contra. And so he would come by the house sometimes and

13:15.080 --> 13:18.920
talk about what was really going on in the country. And I had some other family that was

13:18.920 --> 13:22.760
involved in clandestine stuff and like army special operations. And that was back when it was

13:22.760 --> 13:27.160
all human intelligence. It wasn't digital. It was like, it was like hit teams and like real stuff

13:27.160 --> 13:31.400
and like killing Russian spies and, uh, you know, stuff in Germany. I'll be sitting around like

13:31.400 --> 13:35.400
eight years old early stories at the table, you know, with family talking about it. And so for me,

13:36.040 --> 13:40.200
I kind of grew up in the real world and then other people were growing up in the fantasy land.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.640
And so that was, I kind of had a leg up just because as a kid, I grew up hearing about all

13:43.640 --> 13:47.640
this stuff. So you were always more right-leaning when you grew up, like you didn't have a phase

13:47.640 --> 13:51.400
where you became a liberal? No, I mean, I just grew up like any family reunion or any place I

13:51.400 --> 13:56.440
went. It was like all really army people. They were just all like sitting, it wasn't a big deal.

13:56.440 --> 14:00.600
They were just like all, you know, they're just all like in the real world. We're battling the

14:00.600 --> 14:04.600
Russians and America's going to win and we're gonna get more nuclear reactors and more weapons

14:04.600 --> 14:08.600
in them. And you know, the real world took out their people and I'm growing up hearing all this

14:08.600 --> 14:12.200
and then I'm hearing, and then I go to college finally, like America sucks and communism was

14:12.200 --> 14:16.120
good. And I was like, well, I'm going to join the anti-communist movement. So that's, that's when

14:16.120 --> 14:19.160
it started where you said that you were going to fight against the communist movement, which would,

14:19.160 --> 14:24.040
by the way, grew up around a bunch of bad-ass Americans, right? This is an interesting insight

14:24.040 --> 14:28.600
and anyone who's not a complete idiot interviewing Alex would have heard that and realized what he

14:28.600 --> 14:32.840
had just said. This wasn't him saying that he's neither right wing nor left wing. He's just

14:32.840 --> 14:38.040
opposed to communism. Alex is saying that at a young age, he decided to join the anti-communist

14:38.040 --> 14:42.600
movement. Any interviewer worth a damn would have heard that and understood that what Alex is saying

14:42.600 --> 14:46.840
is that he's not a conservative. He's about a thousand miles to the right of conservatives.

14:47.400 --> 14:52.200
Anytime you hear him criticize the right wing, like he did with George W. Bush, it's because

14:52.200 --> 14:56.200
they're doing something that seems like something a Democrat would do. So they must be a secret

14:56.200 --> 15:02.120
communist. Interviews with people like Crowder exist entirely to launder Alex Jones to a naive

15:02.120 --> 15:06.440
audience, unaware of what's actually being discussed and getting them to think that he's

15:06.440 --> 15:11.080
comically, this comically fringe right wing politics that he has is actually somehow an

15:11.080 --> 15:16.600
expression of being above the two party system. Crowder's audience skews younger too. So this

15:16.600 --> 15:22.200
is really an effort to mainstream like a zealot bigot like Alex to children, which Steven should

15:22.200 --> 15:28.840
be deeply ashamed of being a part of. And also I fucking couldn't help it. So I decided I have

15:28.840 --> 15:35.960
a few clips. I needed to take a few clips because some of this is so embarrassing. It's really bad.

15:36.520 --> 15:42.760
Just dumb shit. It starts with them sort of like joshing around about Joe Rogan. It's like,

15:42.760 --> 15:49.320
oh, you two guys who are like, oh yeah, you're just talking about how you're friends with Joe

15:49.320 --> 15:54.200
on a completely separate show. Steven Crowder hasn't been on Rogan's show in like three years.

15:54.200 --> 15:59.320
And I'm certain you'll never be back close friends. Come on. They're just two guys talking

15:59.320 --> 16:04.280
about how they're close friends with a famous guy. I do. I do find it fun when it's just like,

16:04.280 --> 16:08.280
you know, talking about the third person who's substantially more famous and relevant,

16:09.560 --> 16:14.920
but then they start talking about butts because, uh, because, uh, is Alex's kid there,

16:14.920 --> 16:22.600
they're describing, uh, um, uh, the Rogan studio as being like the, uh, intestine of a whale or

16:22.600 --> 16:27.400
whatever. And this gets to talking about the digestive tract. Sure. I just need to take a

16:27.400 --> 16:31.240
piss. And there was a Bush right there. We're right in a, in a whale's, uh, large intestine.

16:31.240 --> 16:36.760
You're so well, I don't, I don't know. I, Colin just sounds, uh, it just sounds more nefarious.

16:36.760 --> 16:41.320
So lower intestine. Well, what's the large intestine is the large intestine that lower?

16:41.320 --> 16:43.960
Yes, I think you're right. I guess we're saying the same thing. No, wait,

16:43.960 --> 16:48.760
Colin's different. What's rectum. Let's move on. We don't need to go through rectum.

16:48.760 --> 16:56.680
You have the mouth, you have the esophagus, you have the, uh, the stomach, which is a small

16:56.680 --> 16:59.960
intestine, right? No, the stomachs, the stomach. Oh yeah, that's right. Then you have the small

16:59.960 --> 17:04.200
intestine and the large intestine. Then the colon, then the rectum, the anus. No, the rectum is

17:04.200 --> 17:08.120
before the anus. Well, then I'm saying the rectum and the ants, the small, the large intestines

17:08.120 --> 17:13.080
connected to the colon. Remember the show like schoolhouse rock. Yeah. I think, I think I missed

17:13.080 --> 17:17.960
that one. The stomachs is connected to the large intestine. They just had a bill saying, I have to

17:17.960 --> 17:23.000
poo. Can you imagine this? They're going to censor this saying, this is going to be like, you cannot

17:23.000 --> 17:27.240
let Jones talk about this. It actually brings me to something interesting because you've been on,

17:27.240 --> 17:29.880
and I want to go through your story. This is a little bit different. A lot of people don't know

17:29.880 --> 17:34.360
your story, but what's funny is what we just did people here on YouTube and people who are on mug

17:34.360 --> 17:39.720
club, no one cares, but on YouTube, that's not offensive at all. But what's, what's kind of

17:39.720 --> 17:45.080
interesting to me is back in the day with the FCC, my talk radio currently, if I said that on my

17:45.080 --> 17:49.960
show, anything scatological. In other words, you could say that guy's a, that guy's a rectum head

17:49.960 --> 17:55.320
or a dump, but you can't say my rectum, anything that's considered like potty. You can't say

17:55.320 --> 17:59.640
that's just such a great example of Crowder and Alex pretending they're like this conversation

17:59.640 --> 18:03.560
they're having about the digestive tract is going to get them censored. They're there's,

18:03.560 --> 18:08.360
they still rely on this, the conservative media system. They rely on this preemptive complaining

18:08.360 --> 18:11.480
that something that they haven't even released yet is going to get censored or

18:11.480 --> 18:15.880
would be censored in a certain context in order to give them the pretense of credibility.

18:15.880 --> 18:21.320
Shit's so edgy, man, it's going to get banned before it exists. I can't talk about rectums.

18:21.320 --> 18:27.080
That's such a great observation that Patton Oswalt made better 20 years ago and didn't

18:27.080 --> 18:32.360
make it about cancel culture or whatever. Interesting. Yeah. So now this next clip here is

18:32.360 --> 18:36.040
also one of the three of us needs to be hit with a meteor and I don't care which it is.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.160
After listening to that shit, one of the three of us has got to go.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.880
Well, I mean, there's another part I didn't take from this that I thought was really funny where

18:43.880 --> 18:47.880
Steven Carter was talking about how he got into what he's doing because conservative comedians

18:47.880 --> 18:52.600
weren't funny. And I'd like to play back that clip. Oh man. Look, I say a lot of stupid shit,

18:52.600 --> 18:58.680
but I try and keep it short. I don't go into like, no, let's get into the order of how stupid

18:58.680 --> 19:05.080
shit is. Yeah. And then try and effortlessly or effortfully weave it into cancel culture.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.080
Yeah, go fuck yourself. I can't talk about butts. Go fuck yourself. I can't talk about butts on the

19:09.080 --> 19:14.280
radio. Go listen to Alex's show anytime and hear the kind of gross shit he's talking about. Also,

19:14.280 --> 19:19.480
at least say fuck if you're going to talk about being censored. Sure. Losers. So this,

19:19.480 --> 19:25.400
this clip was poorly timed and completely not true. Yeah. I disagree with Rush when he had the

19:26.760 --> 19:31.720
magic Negro song. Remember that? Based on the LA times article, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I get it.

19:31.720 --> 19:35.640
I'm not even against Rush. I'm not saying censoring. I just, I, I wouldn't do that humor.

19:35.640 --> 19:42.840
So hearing that- Motherfucker! God damn shit! Fuck! The dragon! The fucking dragon!

19:42.840 --> 19:48.440
This is the laundering of Alex Jones's persona on Steven's platform. I want to throw things. But

19:48.440 --> 19:52.600
also hearing that Alex Jones didn't like his racial humor may actually have been what finally

19:52.600 --> 19:57.400
did Rush in. There's actually no way to know for sure, but 13 Lieutenant Colonels have actually

19:57.400 --> 20:00.840
told me that that is what happened. That does sound right. And also if Alex, like you said,

20:00.840 --> 20:04.520
doesn't like that humor, he's got to stop doing fentanyl. He's got a lot of stuff he needs to

20:04.520 --> 20:09.640
stop doing, but that one's a big one. This next clip is Alex carrying on his great tradition

20:09.640 --> 20:14.360
of outing his secret sources that he claims he never outs because confidentiality is super

20:14.360 --> 20:17.720
important to him. Hey, look, I can't tell you who it is. Well, I'll go ahead and tell you. It was

20:17.720 --> 20:22.760
Don Jr. who was a Cernovich's source. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, woo, huh? Whoops. This is about Ted

20:22.760 --> 20:26.440
Cruz. I love Ted Cruz. I think he's a great lawyer, a great American. I'm supporting for

20:26.440 --> 20:32.040
president. It was Trump and Roger Stone, I think it's them that put out the story that his dad was

20:32.040 --> 20:37.560
in the CIA and all that stuff. And then he's like, Jones is crazy, but I'll support his free speech,

20:37.560 --> 20:42.840
even though he made up that my dad did this. I didn't do that. I covered what they said.

20:42.840 --> 20:48.120
So you can't Ted Cruz love Trump and do all that when they were the ones that gave me the story.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.320
To be fair, you might've given it more legitimacy than it warranted.

20:51.320 --> 20:59.320
Probably so. That's not funny. That's not funny. That's a tragedy. You're just describing a

20:59.320 --> 21:05.960
tragedy. You're describing a hypocritical douchebag who's hiding behind his best friend slash guest

21:05.960 --> 21:11.880
who hosted the show at the time. Yeah. And it's kind of unclear if Alex is talking about just

21:11.880 --> 21:18.920
like, I will cover and pretend anything that's Trump and Roger say is true. And they said this

21:18.920 --> 21:25.800
and therefore I made it news. Or if it was like they had some kind of a plan and they were,

21:25.800 --> 21:31.640
they were discussing this, like someone, some conduit to Alex, like, Hey, here's a story for

21:31.640 --> 21:35.720
you. Cause that's what it sounds like. He said they gave me the story. No, he's saying, he's

21:35.720 --> 21:42.600
literally describing them saying, we want you to spread this lie for us. So, I mean, in many ways

21:42.600 --> 21:49.640
that that's campaign finance laws that he's just fucked up right there. The FEC might want to ask

21:49.640 --> 21:54.520
some questions. So this last clip is hilarious because it really demonstrates how little

21:54.520 --> 21:59.400
Steven Crowder cares at all about accurately presenting the person he's talking to, to his

21:59.400 --> 22:03.000
audience. And I think you really care about your audience too. I mean, that's why your audience is

22:03.000 --> 22:06.120
loyal. And even with this sort of deep platform, which I know has probably affected you in a

22:06.120 --> 22:10.600
negative way. You've talked about it, but your audience flocked to support you because you have

22:10.600 --> 22:15.720
been, people have to say this about you. You know, whether they disagree with you or agree with you,

22:15.720 --> 22:19.480
that you're pretty consistent. God damn it. No matter what you think about Alex, whether you

22:19.480 --> 22:23.800
like him or not, the last thing you should say about him is that he's consistent. That's the

22:23.800 --> 22:28.600
last word I would use to describe this dude who makes up shit all the time and flip-flops on

22:28.600 --> 22:33.160
anything whenever it becomes inconvenient for him or more convenient to say something else.

22:33.160 --> 22:38.440
What happened to the globalists plan B? What happened to Alex's post DUI crusade to clear

22:38.440 --> 22:42.680
the names of all the people who've been wrongfully convicted of drunk driving? What happened to all

22:42.680 --> 22:46.600
of Alex's old expert friends who he doesn't talk to anymore because they didn't like Trump enough?

22:47.240 --> 22:50.760
Maybe my favorite example of this in recent history was how toward the beginning of the

22:50.760 --> 22:56.920
COVID-19 pandemic, Alex misread a headline about the then fairly unknown Dr. Fauci,

22:56.920 --> 23:01.640
and Alex decided to report this whole thing as Fauci being a brave person inside the government,

23:01.640 --> 23:06.840
blowing the whistle on how the virus was all a sham. Alex claimed that he looked into Fauci

23:06.840 --> 23:11.640
and he made some calls about him and he was the real deal. Within days Fauci had become the

23:11.640 --> 23:15.720
villain in the right-wing media and Alex pretended that whole thing about him, looking into him and

23:15.720 --> 23:19.560
seeing that he's the real deal, that never happened. Never happened. Alex Jones is not

23:19.560 --> 23:25.000
consistent. His work is meaningless and it's internally self-contradictory at many points,

23:25.000 --> 23:29.560
but his branding is that of a guy who's consistent and he's right about the bedrock stuff. Yeah.

23:30.360 --> 23:35.160
That's why Steven Crowder is presenting him this way because he's trying to sell Alex's branding

23:35.160 --> 23:40.120
to his audience as opposed to dealing with who Alex actually is as a person and what his show

23:40.120 --> 23:46.040
is actually like. Someone like Crowder is actively doing harm with this kind of shit, like a way less

23:46.040 --> 23:51.400
talented Joe Rogan who by definition of his lesser talent attracts an audience that's gullible or

23:51.400 --> 23:55.640
immature enough to think that poo-poo and pee-pee jokes are edgy. Yeah. And that all you're doing

23:55.640 --> 24:01.160
is creating a false image of who Alex is. I wouldn't even be all that surprised if Steven

24:01.160 --> 24:05.720
Crowder is so goddamn cynical that he didn't even know what Alex's show is like. He's just

24:05.720 --> 24:09.560
hung out with him a couple times and assumes like, oh, he wouldn't be the kind of guy who

24:09.560 --> 24:16.360
yells about the devil all the fucking time and talks about people eating poop on his show. Yeah.

24:16.360 --> 24:20.440
Nah. Get the fuck out of here. Yeah. It was offensive. What are you guys doing? So anyway,

24:20.440 --> 24:24.840
I just wanted to cover a couple of those little clips. That kind of presentation of him is like

24:24.840 --> 24:31.400
some sort of elected official completely and utterly bungling, uh, health crisis.

24:31.400 --> 24:36.360
And then writing or ghostwriting a book about his leadership. You're talking about Cuomo?

24:36.360 --> 24:41.320
Meh, maybe. I didn't cut out this clip, but on this February 17th episode, Alex reveals that

24:41.320 --> 24:46.920
Cuomo spends most of his time chained up in a sex dungeon. That's better than what he does.

24:46.920 --> 24:54.200
I would prefer that. It's come out. Give me a governor who spends more time in a sex dungeon

24:54.200 --> 24:59.400
than doing evil shit like him. And really my problem is that Alex's reporting had a very

24:59.400 --> 25:05.240
sex negative slant to it. That's unfortunate. Yeah. So we jump back to the 17th here and

25:05.240 --> 25:09.560
Alex recognizes that he's starting the show a little bit down. He's complaining a little bit.

25:11.080 --> 25:16.200
Now I just can't stop thinking of like, what if Lori Lightfoot had a big scandal where it was

25:16.200 --> 25:21.640
like, she spent $240 million on a sex dungeon. I'd be like, yeah, of course you do. You don't

25:21.640 --> 25:29.480
give it to the fucking cops. Anyway, Alex is complaining a lot. And really what I'm doing

25:29.480 --> 25:33.320
here at the start of the broadcast is just doing a little bit of bitching, uh, because

25:34.440 --> 25:41.320
the information is so heavy. The information is so insanely intense that I'm going to be covering

25:41.320 --> 25:48.120
here today, uh, as I broadcast to you from a building that's 99% dark except for the studio.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.640
And we've got three generators running just to keep this going 24 hours a day.

25:53.480 --> 25:59.080
I bring you this information because this is the end of the Republic, the end of the country,

25:59.080 --> 26:03.560
the end of the world, as you know it, this is the global extermination plan. Okay. Well,

26:03.560 --> 26:07.480
we're at the end. That is big news. Yep. Also you don't, yeah, you don't, you don't need, uh,

26:07.480 --> 26:12.920
power there 24 hours a day. You're not at the studio. How about save some of your money and

26:12.920 --> 26:19.160
maybe use those generators to help out all those people, you know, you can use generators to help

26:19.160 --> 26:23.240
other people. Right. Yeah. I don't know. It's, it's a little bit confusing and we'll get,

26:23.240 --> 26:28.040
it becomes more and more confusing as the show goes along. Like how much power do you have?

26:28.040 --> 26:33.720
What is going on? This makes no sense. Yeah. Okay. Um, but, uh, Alex, he's talking about,

26:33.720 --> 26:39.240
uh, you know, QAnon, right? You remember QAnon? I've heard of it. Um, there is a thing in QAnon

26:39.240 --> 26:43.480
where they were talking about like the power is going to go out and that's when Q and Trump

26:43.480 --> 26:48.040
and the hit teams are going to round up the bad guys. Sure, sure, sure, sure. So Alex is like,

26:48.040 --> 26:53.560
no, no, no, no, no. Right. Right. Right. The opposite is true. Now there is a blackout.

26:53.560 --> 26:59.720
There's power out in Texas. And now the right wing is being rounded. Oh no. I also noticed

26:59.720 --> 27:06.200
everything Q said was the enemy bragging. It was the enemy, the mouth of Sauron. And, and so Q

27:06.200 --> 27:10.520
said when the, when the lights go out, that's when the roundups begin. And, and indeed they

27:10.520 --> 27:14.360
are starting to swat team and kill and round people up during the workouts, but it's getting

27:14.360 --> 27:21.080
rounded up, not them. So that's some of the sick, sick irony of, uh, of president Q.

27:23.400 --> 27:28.680
Yep. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, this is a hellish situation. So I would like,

27:28.680 --> 27:33.880
uh, proof of any of this. I would like a demonstration of where who's being rounded

27:33.880 --> 27:39.880
up by hit teams. Yeah. Also, how do you, what do you, what's happening? You just got into the

27:39.880 --> 27:45.800
office on a day when no one has any fucking power. What are you getting? Like 300 text messages.

27:45.800 --> 27:51.480
I'm being rounded up. Isn't this, I mean, it's also a little bit of a problem for his whole,

27:51.480 --> 27:58.360
like everybody's going to have no power. Here I am broadcasting live on my show, whatever.

27:58.360 --> 28:03.960
Like it's still, I don't know. This is the apocalypse. It's over. The great reset is happening. Obviously

28:03.960 --> 28:11.160
I'm still broadcasting. If I were him, I probably would think that it would be better to broadcast

28:11.160 --> 28:16.840
from home, whatever, as low fi as possible. Like we're in the bunker. We're all, we're all in

28:16.840 --> 28:21.160
this together. It would be a very nice sentiment. It seems a little strange. It would be too little,

28:21.160 --> 28:24.600
too late, but it would be nice. It seems a little strange for when people are going through

28:24.600 --> 28:29.880
something really severe to be like, well, you know, my big problem is my warehouse is closed.

28:29.880 --> 28:37.160
Yeah. Somebody made me cut my vacation short. Relatable. Anyway, America has fallen.

28:37.960 --> 28:48.840
Beta is over, baby. Beta is over. So America has fallen. America is gone. America is dead.

28:49.400 --> 28:54.120
And only admitting that gives us any chance to turn it around. We are now completely overrun.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.480
The FBI is completely paid off and hell on earth is now being released.

29:00.360 --> 29:04.280
I just feel like you'd hear that stuff. And if you, if you believed any word of it,

29:04.280 --> 29:09.240
why would you follow any laws? Yeah. Why, why would you feel beholden to any form of

29:10.280 --> 29:16.840
social contract? Yeah. And why wouldn't you possibly for one second, at least think to

29:16.840 --> 29:23.640
yourself, okay, this is the result of me supporting every politician that I've ever supported.

29:23.640 --> 29:30.680
This is the literal inevitable result of everything I've ever believed in.

29:32.360 --> 29:38.600
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Not for a moment. Not for a moment. Do you think, oh, this sucks.

29:39.720 --> 29:45.240
I wish I hadn't done that. Oh no. Infrastructure's crippled. I probably shouldn't have supported the

29:45.240 --> 29:51.640
party that hates. Yeah. So in this next clip, we get to the little bit of the beginning of

29:51.640 --> 29:57.480
Alex's sort of dipping his little angry toe into white supremacy. Sure. Sure. He's talking about

29:57.480 --> 30:01.880
Mark Zuckerberg, right? Right. And Zuckerberg, he's, you know, he talks about how we're fighting

30:01.880 --> 30:07.800
World War II with this virus, right? And it's true. That is true. Okay. Except when he says

30:07.800 --> 30:13.960
virus, what he actually means is a white male Christian. Oh, okay. And I'm going to explain

30:13.960 --> 30:17.960
something when we come back to the next segment. That's the most important thing ever. Okay. And

30:17.960 --> 30:25.400
okay. And it's, it's, it's this everything with them is actually a truthful statement,

30:25.400 --> 30:29.560
except it's inverted. So Bill Gates says we're fighting the equivalent of World War II.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.480
You have that clip coming up. We're fighting the equivalent of World War II.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.480
And the virus is World War II and climate change is like World War II.

30:41.480 --> 30:47.880
When he says we're fighting the virus, you're the virus. They call human overpopulation and

30:47.880 --> 30:54.040
free speech and everything and Christians and white males the virus. Ooh. I'm sorry. He was

30:54.040 --> 30:58.760
talking about Bill Gates. He was talking about Zuckerberg in that rant also. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha.

30:58.760 --> 31:03.960
But yeah. So it's the virus is straight white males, Christian males. You know,

31:03.960 --> 31:10.040
there's an argument to be made for straight white males who are Christian being something of a

31:10.040 --> 31:15.560
toxic presence. I don't know if I would describe them as a virus. No, I, I think that, I think

31:15.560 --> 31:21.880
that even joking around there is, is, is, uh, is a little bit iffy. I don't know. When the

31:21.880 --> 31:27.560
evangelical block votes 90% for Trump, uh, I think we're good. Yeah. But, but that that's,

31:28.120 --> 31:32.440
I don't know. I feel like that's something you got to really parse out. Sure. You're getting too

31:32.440 --> 31:37.800
close to justifying Alex's narratives. I'm not justifying his narratives. I walked it back.

31:37.800 --> 31:44.760
I said they're just a toxic presence. I didn't say they were a virus. Okay. You can solve toxic

31:44.760 --> 31:54.040
presences with things other than, uh, you know, his plans. Okay. So, um, Jordan, remember,

31:54.040 --> 32:02.360
remember Enron? Yeah. Energy company. Yes. I do remember Enron. Ken Lay. Yeah. Not a good dude.

32:02.360 --> 32:08.680
Yeah. Real, real exemplars of, uh, of late stage capitalism. What happened to Ken Lay?

32:08.680 --> 32:14.120
Uh, I don't know. I, I not bad enough things, I suppose. What do you, I mean, he died. Oh,

32:14.120 --> 32:17.480
did he? Right. I don't know. Before he was able to go on trial. I don't know anything

32:17.480 --> 32:22.840
about Ken Lay. Oh, well, he did. Okay. Um, he actually faked his death. He faked his death.

32:23.400 --> 32:29.480
Because it was Enron came up with the carbon tax in 1987. I mean, you knew that, right? Ken Lay

32:29.480 --> 32:36.120
uh, hatched all this. And then we all heard he committed suicide on house arrest and then

32:36.920 --> 32:42.680
word is he's down in Paraguay. So that's, that's how all this works. Ladies and gentlemen. See,

32:42.680 --> 32:49.160
I study how these boys operate, how they do it. So the thing that I think is really interesting

32:49.160 --> 32:55.480
about that is the juxtaposition of Alex saying, uh, word is he's down in Paraguay in the same

32:55.480 --> 33:02.600
sentence as he says, I study this. I study this, but I also report hearsay as if it's facts.

33:02.600 --> 33:08.840
QAnon people are fucking crazy with this. John F. Kennedy Jr. isn't going to find you and help you

33:08.840 --> 33:13.720
in any way. Now Ken Lay is obviously in Paraguay naturally. He's not going to help you, but he's

33:13.720 --> 33:20.360
hiding out there. He's hiding. The word is. The word is from who? Yeah. Does he have a lot of

33:20.360 --> 33:25.800
Paraguayan listeners? Uh, yeah, probably. Oh, okay. Well, that's fair. A hotbed of Trump support

33:27.080 --> 33:33.240
and info warrior. Yeah, well, that's fair. So, uh, Alex is talking about China and he's complaining

33:33.240 --> 33:39.240
about, uh, I'm going to be honest. This is a little bit, this, this hits my ear a little

33:39.240 --> 33:45.320
bit racist. Sure. Alex is going off on a little bit of a jag about how, you know, there's more

33:45.320 --> 33:52.120
Chinese men in China than women. And so they export men to other places to get brides and

33:52.120 --> 33:57.560
other countries. He's kind of implying that it's like exporting people in order to make the world

33:57.560 --> 34:02.680
Chinese. Sure, sure. It's fucked up and weird. And then in the middle of it, we're in a Hank

34:02.680 --> 34:07.800
Stamper situation. You go find a wife out East and you bring her back to Oregon. And in the middle of

34:07.800 --> 34:13.800
this kind of disgusting, weird, uh, jag, Alex gets some bad news. Okay. They've had a one child

34:13.800 --> 34:19.240
policy to where there's probably a hundred million more boys in China, uh, than there are girls. So

34:19.240 --> 34:24.760
they export Chinese men to colonies and tell them, get an African wife, get an American wife,

34:24.760 --> 34:33.560
get an American wife. They forcibly raped the Uyghur women and up to 10 men at a time. That's

34:33.560 --> 34:40.360
in mainstream news. They don't deny it to forcibly make them Chinese instead of the group they are,

34:40.360 --> 34:59.160
which basically is Chinese it's a dark day, ladies and gentlemen,

35:00.600 --> 35:04.680
it's a dark day. I'm gonna play this clip in a moment, but this is all being done on purpose.

35:04.680 --> 35:10.440
This is rubbing our faces in it. And we got another bad piece of news. He wasn't perfect.

35:10.440 --> 35:15.880
He got snookered into wars, globalist wars, but he wasn't American. And he was at loyal

35:15.880 --> 35:19.240
to the country and he meant well, and he fought the communist rush Limbaugh,

35:21.240 --> 35:27.160
American radio host dead at 70. So just another disgusting, sickening omen.

35:27.160 --> 35:38.040
Oh God. So Alex is not happy about this news. It is a disgusting omen. It's strange. Um,

35:38.040 --> 35:45.880
a little bit curious bedfellows, uh, considering in the earlier times of his career rush Limbaugh

35:45.880 --> 35:51.800
would have been an enemy. Sure. Uh, and somebody who was kind of like the, the fucking shitty

35:51.800 --> 35:58.520
globalist, right. Yeah. And in Trump times, you know, we're Limbaugh love Trump. So the two of

35:58.520 --> 36:05.320
them, they reached a little bit of an understanding naturally, naturally silly. Oh, but Alex is very

36:05.320 --> 36:13.480
consistent. Sure. Yeah. The, the winds of hatred are very consistent. Very much. Yeah. So Russia

36:13.480 --> 36:20.760
is dead. Um, and Alex pays him quite a, quite a tribute. I will say that I think that this might

36:20.760 --> 36:26.840
be a send-off. He's kind of a piece of his shit, but, uh, you know, he inspired my career. So fuck

36:26.840 --> 36:32.680
that guy. I hope he dies again. This is immediately after Alex reports the news that, uh, that Russia

36:32.680 --> 36:39.640
has died. Okay. American radio host dead at 70. So just another disgusting, sickening omen.

36:43.320 --> 36:46.360
And folks I've learned at 47 to go, Oh my God, it's never wrong.

36:46.360 --> 36:53.320
The United States is facing imminent destruction. Are you saying he was murdered? My guts never

36:53.320 --> 36:57.960
been wrong. And I keep having very intense nightmares the last month that the United

36:57.960 --> 37:03.480
States is going to be hit by nuclear weapons by China. And it's going to stand down dreams.

37:04.520 --> 37:09.800
Stop having sweets before bed. They're preparing us with, with stay in your homes. Uh,

37:09.800 --> 37:13.880
Oh, your power's off, but they turn the power off. I'll prove that coming up, but they admit

37:13.880 --> 37:19.000
they did by the way, it's in the fine print and they're just getting us ready for the disaster.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.960
They're not going to hit the main cities. They're going to hit the military basis.

37:23.640 --> 37:29.640
And that's why they want to keep national guard in DC. So, so that the, the, the, the States can't

37:29.640 --> 37:34.280
organize and have a response. They'll be cut off in DC. That's why they're doing this purge. The

37:34.280 --> 37:39.960
military that is 60 day stand down to go through and create list of who, uh, they're going to kill

37:39.960 --> 37:44.920
right away and who they're not. I mean, if you don't want to stay and fight this, I would

37:44.920 --> 37:50.040
evacuate the United States right now. Very good chance that they're going to either blow the

37:50.040 --> 37:53.560
entire power grid with the MPs. Sure. I've been conditioning is to get ready for, or they're

37:53.560 --> 37:59.080
going to hit us with the first strike. I saw that's crazy. No, this is war folks. America's

37:59.080 --> 38:03.720
over, it's gone. Trump was removed. Of course he wanted a giant landslide. They weren't going to

38:03.720 --> 38:08.040
allow that to happen. And that's why when you look at the press secretary and all the Biden's

38:08.040 --> 38:13.000
people, they are scared. And if I was them, I'd be scared too. I decided I'm going to eulogize

38:13.000 --> 38:18.760
rush by making up scary bullshit. Yep. Yep. That was it. That was a good, uh, I found out that

38:18.760 --> 38:24.200
Russia is dead. And now I must tell you, China is about to nuke us. That is a, that is a fitting

38:24.200 --> 38:33.000
send off for us. That's exactly what you should do. You should let me spread propaganda in your

38:33.000 --> 38:40.680
honor. Here's some bullshit that are alert people. Yeah. But, and that really kind of defines Alex's

38:40.680 --> 38:45.720
mood for a bit in the show. It's over, man. Alex, I'm just going to throw this out there.

38:45.720 --> 38:51.400
They are shutting off power on purpose. What if they weren't allowed to do that?

38:52.280 --> 38:59.000
What if there was some sort of like thing that the law and I'm not saying that we have to give

38:59.000 --> 39:03.480
it a name? Cause I think names might be a problem for Alex. Alex isn't into labels. What if there

39:03.480 --> 39:09.400
was like a like, Hey, this is a law that says you can't do that. Despite you being a private

39:09.400 --> 39:17.400
company, suggesting something that would regulate behaviors. I feel like I'm playing operations.

39:18.840 --> 39:24.840
You just hit the edge. Alex is in a bad mood. Uh, it's over, man. America's fucking done.

39:24.840 --> 39:30.840
Sure. Rush was the last thing together. And then this gets back to where I think this is

39:30.840 --> 39:36.600
overtly white supremacist show. I just, I gotta be honest with you folks. It's all over. Okay.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.040
It's all over. We're about to be hit with nuclear weapons or the military stood down.

39:40.040 --> 39:44.440
Everything's gone. So I'm sorry. It's over. The country's gone. It's all over. I mean,

39:45.480 --> 39:49.480
I'm admitted. The death star is orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. We don't

39:49.480 --> 39:53.480
stop the globalist. If they aren't stopped, it's over. You think they just steal elections for a

39:53.480 --> 39:57.720
reason? I think they're saying veterans are terrorists for no reason. All white men are

39:57.720 --> 40:02.200
terrorists. Sure. Under this Chinese regime, folks are going to take all white men in for

40:02.200 --> 40:08.200
reeducation. And then it'll be every other group after that, because they know that white men

40:08.200 --> 40:14.280
coming from a Scottish Irish English tradition, even the continent of Europe, Europe didn't get

40:14.280 --> 40:19.400
free until about a hundred years ago. Germans were still served 150 years ago, slaves in the

40:19.400 --> 40:25.400
Austrian Hungarian empire. They're under a team, military services, oppressions were owned men,

40:25.400 --> 40:34.200
passions were sold as mercenaries. So you had a bunch of wars in the British Isles over tribalism

40:34.200 --> 40:38.680
and, and, and who ran things. And then that grew into our system of freedom. That's where it all

40:38.680 --> 40:41.960
came from folks. That's your argument. It all comes out of England. It all comes out of Scotland.

40:41.960 --> 40:47.560
It all comes out of Ireland. That's where all the freedom comes from. Mainly England. Oh boy. Okay.

40:47.560 --> 40:52.840
So I'm going to be, I'm going to be real with Alex. I don't think he really read anything that

40:52.840 --> 40:57.320
the founders wrote. No, I don't think so. I don't think he read, I don't think he's read a whole

40:57.320 --> 41:04.200
lot of history either. Cause this is a very skewed and the Scotch Irish were fighting for a while

41:04.200 --> 41:08.520
and they came over here and democracy happened. I don't know what's wrong with you. All freedom

41:08.520 --> 41:17.640
flows from the, the, the, the river head of a white man. As everybody knows freedom originated

41:17.640 --> 41:25.880
in England whenever they traveled to Africa in order to sell human beings to America. That's

41:25.880 --> 41:33.160
freedom. Yeah. Thanks for sort of mainlining and supporting this Steven Crowder. Yeah. I hope

41:33.160 --> 41:37.400
you're proud you promote somebody who has these kinds of ideas that they disseminate on their

41:37.400 --> 41:42.840
show. They're going to come after white men. And as we all know, freedom only comes from white men.

41:42.840 --> 41:50.760
Exactly. Wow. I mean like there's such an interesting division that I find with his

41:50.760 --> 41:55.880
show. Like a lot of the time it's very much white identity. It's very much like implicit bias and

41:55.880 --> 42:01.640
like, you know, clearly racist positions. Totally. But that's white supremacist. Oh, 100%. That's

42:01.640 --> 42:10.280
like beyond the line. It's saying that white men are supreme. The only people who have ever

42:10.280 --> 42:15.720
thought freedom is worth anything. Hey, what if we weren't serfs? Only white men ever had that

42:15.720 --> 42:21.800
thought. It's, it's a bit, it's, it's pretty, it's, it's shocking. It's shocking to see.

42:21.800 --> 42:28.280
I think I should have a say in how things are run. Only white men ever considered that thought.

42:28.280 --> 42:33.960
Well, I mean, and the sort of, I don't know, I guess tributary kind of argument that would

42:33.960 --> 42:41.720
spring off that river is that any time, you know, like any time there is actual movements

42:41.720 --> 42:45.720
towards freedom, it's gotta be white people doing it. And the only way non-white people

42:45.720 --> 42:48.680
can really be involved is they just follow whatever the white people are doing. Yeah,

42:48.680 --> 42:55.240
they call white men in order to run their, their freedom operations. Yeah. You know,

42:55.240 --> 42:59.320
you know how white men often promote freedom throughout the world? You know,

42:59.320 --> 43:04.680
so many times we've seen white men go all across the world and just promote the fuck out of freedom.

43:04.680 --> 43:10.680
I think that this might be a half thought through thing of Alex's. It might be something that's more

43:10.680 --> 43:16.120
emotionally felt for him. Could be. It might come from the place of white supremacy that is deep

43:16.120 --> 43:23.400
within his white heart. I would say in his mind, the only freedom is the freedom of white men to

43:23.400 --> 43:28.840
do whatever it is they want. And that freedom does only come from white men. So I will give him that.

43:28.840 --> 43:34.280
You've made an interesting argument. So, uh, Alex has some problems with his staff. Uh, well,

43:34.280 --> 43:39.960
not actually. He likes the staff, but look, this guy, his longtime producer, his sister,

43:39.960 --> 43:44.840
she's weird. And I just told you, if you're a new listener and you think I'm joking or maybe,

43:44.840 --> 43:48.200
maybe you're a new listener, you think it's good. Like, oh yeah, we love ZZ Ping.

43:48.200 --> 43:55.720
Oh, I have a long time producer here. The oldest employee here, 17 years.

43:58.600 --> 44:05.320
He used to live in Minnesota. Good detail. His sister pledges allegiance to ZZ Ping.

44:05.320 --> 44:15.160
Does she? And is an academic. And she's main line in Minnesota. They pledge allegiance to ZZ Ping.

44:15.160 --> 44:22.760
That does sound right. Think I'm joking? Look at the Washington Post. Can ZZ Ping destroy

44:22.760 --> 44:30.040
Donald Trump to save America? Wow. Wow. This is what they do in Minnesota. Hey,

44:30.040 --> 44:37.320
listen, it's just mainstream. Obviously my producer's sister pledges allegiance to ZZ Ping

44:37.320 --> 44:43.720
because she's an academic. And if you want proof, read the Washington Post, which I assume must be

44:43.720 --> 44:48.680
about his sister's headline. I can't even really remember. And I definitely didn't read the article.

44:48.680 --> 44:53.800
Yeah, exactly. See the Washington Post. Yeah. You've got these listeners who are like in the

44:53.800 --> 44:59.560
middle of nowhere and Alex has just been like, yeah, trust me, academics in Minnesota, all

44:59.560 --> 45:07.000
pledge allegiance to ZZ. Fine. Jesus, man. It's, it's kind of like whenever you were in elementary

45:07.000 --> 45:12.280
school and you'd be like talking to somebody and they'd be like, yeah, I have a cousin who's in

45:12.280 --> 45:18.280
France and they all eat bugs. There's some sort of a weird cultural thing in another country.

45:18.280 --> 45:22.120
One of those things that they're lying to you because you're 12 and you are not going to go

45:22.120 --> 45:26.200
to France. No, it's one of those things your dad tells you. And then you tell everybody at school

45:26.200 --> 45:31.800
and everybody's like, no, no, you shouldn't believe anything your dad says anymore. Yeah.

45:31.800 --> 45:36.520
Speaking of things that dads tell you that you shouldn't believe. Alex has a little bit of a

45:36.520 --> 45:42.600
humdinger about his dad. Okay. So these are very dangerous people. They tried to recruit my dad.

45:47.240 --> 45:51.320
CIA death. Oh my dad just gave it the exact type they were looking for. Let me tell you.

45:56.360 --> 46:01.560
You know, there's, there's types. You can look at somebody and tell them they've been a Marine or

46:01.560 --> 46:12.520
an army officer. You tell somebody they look at these globalist are short, nice, friendly,

46:12.520 --> 46:17.960
little doctors. Usually it was for whatever reason, dark hair. That's what my dad looks like.

46:17.960 --> 46:21.400
And then he owed top of his class and they tried to recruit him. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

46:21.400 --> 46:26.200
wait, wait. Two of the things they're looking for are physical characteristics. They have to be short

46:26.200 --> 46:31.800
and have dark hair. Obviously. What the fuck are you talking? If you're looking for the Ubermensch,

46:31.800 --> 46:37.080
they need to be short with dark hair. I don't understand, Dan. That's what they're looking to

46:37.080 --> 46:45.720
do. Recruit CIA dentists who are short and have dark hair. And this is pre CIA dentistry. Uh,

46:45.720 --> 46:49.320
cause he was just coming out of high school. Oh, that's true. I love the idea that Alex Jones's

46:49.320 --> 46:54.920
dad was like, look, the globalists really wanted me cause I was short. Dark hair. They love that.

46:54.920 --> 47:01.880
That's a little bit, that's a little bit like, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Those dating apps.

47:01.880 --> 47:07.320
Love short guys. It's very stupid. It's very dumb. Um, so one of the, one of the like really

47:08.200 --> 47:15.160
through line narrative kind of things that Alex is going on about on this episode is that, uh, Biden

47:15.160 --> 47:21.240
had a town hall the night prior and apparently during this town hall, he had endorsed China's

47:21.240 --> 47:28.600
actions in Hong Kong and also about the Uyghurs. Hmm. Here's Alex playing that clip here, ladies

47:28.600 --> 47:36.360
and gentlemen, is Joe Biden endorsing communist China's death camps and takeover militarily of

47:36.360 --> 47:43.800
Hong Kong. Just unbelievable in your face treason over the top. Just it's only to get crazier from

47:43.800 --> 47:49.400
here. Here it is. You know, Chinese leaders, if you know anything about Chinese history,

47:49.400 --> 47:56.360
it has always been the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven't

47:56.360 --> 48:04.840
been unified at home. So the central pro vastly overstated the central principle of Xi Jinping

48:04.840 --> 48:11.320
is that there must be a United tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things

48:11.320 --> 48:17.160
he does based on that. I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president

48:17.160 --> 48:22.040
if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea, I'm not going to speak

48:22.040 --> 48:29.160
out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in Western mountains

48:29.160 --> 48:37.080
of China and Taiwan, trying to end the one China policy by making it forceful. I said,

48:37.080 --> 48:43.960
and by the, he said, he, he gets it culturally. There are different norms at each country and

48:43.960 --> 48:49.880
they, their leaders are expected to follow. He said, he said, he said, I'm not going to

48:49.880 --> 48:54.680
criticize it. Like he was saying, he would criticize it. Sick, evil lawyer crap. Okay.

48:54.680 --> 48:59.320
So there's just not understand words. Apparently not. Yeah. There are plenty of reasons to

48:59.320 --> 49:03.560
critique Biden about his town hall from the other night, but this is a complete misrepresentation

49:03.560 --> 49:08.280
of what Biden was saying. Yeah. So Anderson Cooper asked Biden about his conversation with Xi

49:08.280 --> 49:13.400
and the treatment of the Uyghurs came up and Biden said, quote, we must speak up for human

49:13.400 --> 49:18.360
rights. It's who we are. Then there's that clip that Alex plays. And then Anderson Cooper tries

49:18.360 --> 49:23.640
to refocus the question saying quote, when you talk to him though, about human rights abuses,

49:23.640 --> 49:28.840
is that just it? Is that as far as it goes in terms of the U S or is there any actual

49:28.840 --> 49:34.760
repercussions for China? Biden replied quote, well, there will be repercussions for China.

49:34.760 --> 49:39.560
And he knows that what I'm doing is making clear that we in fact are going to continue to reassert

49:39.560 --> 49:43.880
our role as spokespeople for human rights at the UN and other agencies that have an impact on their

49:43.880 --> 49:49.240
attitude. China is trying very hard to become the world leader and get that moniker. And to be able

49:49.240 --> 49:53.320
to do that, they have to gain the confidence of other countries. And as long as they're engaged

49:53.320 --> 49:57.800
in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it's going to be hard for them to do

49:57.800 --> 50:02.360
that. Biden wasn't endorsing any of the actions of the Chinese government. He was discussing a

50:02.360 --> 50:07.160
more nuanced approach to international relations than Trump was capable of. Alex is playing

50:07.160 --> 50:11.000
selectively edited clips of Biden's comments in order to make it appear that he was saying he

50:11.000 --> 50:15.400
supports the treatment of the Uyghur people and all this is just not true. It's a load of shit.

50:15.400 --> 50:21.480
It's not even in that clip. The clip is him saying, I have to respect them and their culture,

50:21.480 --> 50:27.320
but at the same time, I'm not going to not speak out. And he's literally saying, I'm not going to

50:27.320 --> 50:33.400
avoid speaking out just because I have to respect their culture. But you can take that clip and

50:33.400 --> 50:41.240
get like, you have just enough. You have just enough there to spin it into, he endorsed all

50:41.240 --> 50:46.440
this. I don't know why he left that second part in there where it is Biden saying, of course,

50:46.440 --> 50:49.960
I'm going to speak out about human rights abuse. Yeah. It's a little bit strange. Yeah.

50:50.600 --> 50:54.520
I don't know. Edit the clip better. Yeah. Well, look, the power's out. Or, I mean,

50:54.520 --> 50:59.880
eviler, I guess. The power's out, man. That's fair. So, you know, everyone loves that Biden

50:59.880 --> 51:03.400
has come out and he said that China can do whatever it wants and it's open season or

51:03.400 --> 51:07.560
whatever. I don't remember that, but I will accept your interpretation. You know, and he's

51:07.560 --> 51:13.000
not the only North American leader who has recently said such a thing. Okay. Now, who else

51:13.000 --> 51:18.760
recently? Oh, the prime minister of Canada said to a group of women who got really excited when

51:18.760 --> 51:24.840
he said it was like, it was so manly. He said, I like the communist Chinese system of total

51:24.840 --> 51:32.520
dictatorship. And I, I like ZZ Pink. I like total dictatorship. And the women just all were like

51:32.520 --> 51:39.880
squirming in their seats and just wiggling around like, like they were at a, you know, men's or

51:39.880 --> 51:44.360
woman's gentleman club. What do you call those? La bear guys with the bow ties, but that's all

51:44.360 --> 51:51.320
they're wearing. I mean, they were just giggling and snickering and hopping up and down. It's so

51:51.320 --> 51:56.840
sexy to have death camps. Small point. Alex is making up all that stuff about women squirming

51:56.840 --> 52:02.200
and being sexually excited by Trudeau's comments. That's just the product of his own pervy and very

52:02.200 --> 52:08.040
weird imagination. That's that clip just makes me want to be like, what is wrong with you? What's

52:08.040 --> 52:12.840
that's fucked up. It's an interesting question of whether he's just making that up because he

52:12.840 --> 52:19.400
wants the audience to think that, or if that's really his experience of watching a clip like

52:19.400 --> 52:24.760
that. Yeah. We know he's gross, gross, gross, very gross, gross. Yeah. But how much of it is

52:24.760 --> 52:29.800
like actual and how much of it is performance for the audience? Right. That part, I have no idea

52:29.800 --> 52:34.120
either way. It's fucked up. That's fucked up. Anyway. Also not for nothing that video that

52:34.120 --> 52:38.920
he's referencing, like it's, you know, it's something like recent. He's lying about the

52:38.920 --> 52:43.480
content of it. She's lying about the context of it. And wasn't it like two years ago, it's from

52:43.480 --> 52:49.720
2013. Get the fuck out of here. It's from 2013. Yeah. Was he even prime minister in 2013? No,

52:49.720 --> 52:55.640
he was not Dan. Nope. So with a guy like this, who's just accurate and like straight shooter

52:55.640 --> 53:02.440
and consistent. Yes. You might be surprised to learn. I think Alex is having some money troubles.

53:02.440 --> 53:07.080
Okay. Everybody around here goes, Oh, Alex, don't worry. They stole it from Trump. At least you'll

53:07.080 --> 53:11.880
have more listeners now that Biden's in. No, I said, no, people are going to give up and the

53:11.880 --> 53:15.320
center ship's going to get worse and we'll have less funds coming in. And sure as hell I was

53:15.320 --> 53:20.040
right again. Cause my gut's always right. I can analyze later why my gut's right, but it's always

53:20.040 --> 53:26.200
right. It's right. It's right. My spirit knows a lot smarter than just this gray matter. Is it?

53:26.200 --> 53:32.840
And it interfaces with my gray matter. And I'm telling you that, that, that, that, that you

53:32.840 --> 53:38.680
better get right with Jesus right now. Okay. This is a takeover, a military takeover.

53:38.680 --> 53:43.480
And they are going to purge the living snot out of them. They're going to kill probably a third

53:43.480 --> 53:48.600
of our military veterans and people. And they'll just fly over the helicopter and just bomb your

53:48.600 --> 53:52.520
house. I mean, that's what's going to happen. And the public will be out there like this because

53:52.520 --> 53:57.320
they don't want to get killed. The average American is a cowardly sack of demonic devil

53:57.320 --> 54:02.040
worshiping garbage. Your neighbors will watch the NFL while your ass is drug on to put in a

54:02.040 --> 54:09.080
FEMA camp. So some potbelly pedophile could screw your kids in front of you. Okay. It's all about

54:09.080 --> 54:14.440
raping you and you're going to find out now they're going to rape you and enjoy it. So just

54:14.440 --> 54:23.160
remember that if you want to fund this, we can stay on air. Who knows how long I would get the

54:23.160 --> 54:33.640
propure $50 off. Whoa. That is a, that's an ad read. Yeah. That's an ad read. Pretty impressive.

54:33.640 --> 54:43.880
Wow. Yeah. Wow. Holy shit. If you don't buy tied, they will rape you. Your neighbors will watch it.

54:43.880 --> 54:50.360
Everyone. Your neighbors will watch as your house is bombed. Yeah. If you buy an off brand detergent,

54:50.360 --> 54:58.920
the only way to stop it is to keep my bullshit on air. Yeah. All right. Wow. Congrats on promoting

54:58.920 --> 55:05.000
a dick like this, Steven Crowder. That's just so fucked up. Yeah. That's they're real human beings

55:05.000 --> 55:11.160
who don't need to listen to that shit. No, I would say every single human being on the planet

55:11.160 --> 55:17.560
doesn't need to hear this shit. God, that's so fucked. Yeah. But, uh, you know, if everybody

55:17.560 --> 55:23.880
didn't listen to the show said, no one would know that it's confirmed. Well it's official. Is it a

55:23.880 --> 55:28.440
hundred percent, a hundred percent that Satan is real. Okay. And I'm going to explain to you again,

55:28.440 --> 55:37.560
Satan is 1 trillion percent real. That sounds too high. And when we didn't start standing up

55:37.560 --> 55:42.040
for other people and our children and our old people, the hedge of protection has been lifted

55:42.040 --> 55:48.920
and God is going to let Satan literally annihilate us. So I hope everybody enjoys it.

55:49.480 --> 55:55.720
This kind of characterizes quite a bit of the show. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's kind of fitting

55:55.720 --> 55:59.960
and you know, like Alex is sitting in a dark studio. Of course, Satan has gotten control

55:59.960 --> 56:04.200
and God's going to let us be destroyed. Yeah. It thematically fits, but it's a little,

56:04.200 --> 56:10.440
it's a little exhausting. I dare God to let Satan kill all of us. I dare him. Man. That is,

56:10.440 --> 56:15.880
that is hubris. Oh, I'll do it right now. I'll do it again. You are like Icarus. I'm fine with it.

56:15.880 --> 56:24.680
I'll get up next to that sun. I don't give a shit. Pride comes before the fall. I will not

56:24.680 --> 56:29.720
join you in this. Okay. Because a trillion percent, Alex is saying, Satan's real. I mean,

56:29.720 --> 56:34.040
sure. You don't make up numbers like a trillion. I think you do. I think that's the exact type of

56:34.040 --> 56:38.680
number you make up. Well, here's some more stuff that's getting made up. Okay. I have to apologize

56:38.680 --> 56:43.240
to you in advance because Alex uses that word you hate discernment. Yeah. That's the one boy. See,

56:43.240 --> 56:49.160
he has that if he uses badly, I'm going to lose my shit. He has this discernment, right? But the

56:49.160 --> 56:56.520
other side has something that's kind of like a crystal ball that sort of works. Oh, a palantir,

56:56.520 --> 57:01.640
if you will. We have discernment through Christ. The enemy has its own sickening form of discernment

57:01.640 --> 57:07.880
and as a large understanding of the space time continuum,

57:08.760 --> 57:14.920
I was able to make long-term very accurate predictions that are almost like future

57:16.920 --> 57:23.800
crystal ball powers, but, but not really. And that's what you got for me crystal ball,

57:23.800 --> 57:31.240
but not foreseen basically most of what has already transpired. And I can tell you things

57:31.240 --> 57:45.400
are not going good for Satan. Wait a second. So now we're not just applying Satan as a malevolent

57:45.400 --> 57:52.920
force designed to torture us sent by God to fulfill his plan. Now we've got a Satan who

57:52.920 --> 57:58.280
also is like, God damn it guys, I need better help. Things aren't going well. Things are not

57:58.280 --> 58:03.080
going well right now. We're behind. We're 10 years behind. We got this shitty crystal ball.

58:03.720 --> 58:08.520
This crystal ball doesn't even work all the time. Why don't I get a good crystal ball? It kind of

58:08.520 --> 58:16.200
works, but it doesn't. So now we've got to put upon middle manager Satan. I feel like if Alex

58:16.200 --> 58:23.800
would just write this as a comedy show, like it would be a decent sitcom. Overworked,

58:23.800 --> 58:27.800
under supported devil. Yeah, but I think that's already been made. I think there was a cartoon

58:27.800 --> 58:34.360
made. I would almost guarantee that someone had that idea. I wouldn't be surprised. It got super

58:34.360 --> 58:39.240
mad about it. They're trying to launder the devil and make him acceptable to children. It's a

58:39.240 --> 58:45.400
cartoon. It's for kids. So Alex is in studio. He's able to broadcast. And like, I was watching

58:45.400 --> 58:51.880
a bit of this as it was airing. So it was live. It was happening. And do you know, the cameras

58:51.880 --> 58:59.800
look good. The lights look good. The only difference really is that there's no cool backdrop.

58:59.800 --> 59:06.520
Sure. That's about it. But he's running at half like his capabilities. And I was like, well, you

59:06.520 --> 59:13.000
know, bad storm makes sense. It turns out that's not why though. It turns out it's because everyone

59:13.000 --> 59:18.920
who works at Infowars is an idiot. So let me show you some of the history of this. And again,

59:18.920 --> 59:23.080
I don't have the document cam shot because most of the equipment's still down because we have

59:23.080 --> 59:27.800
the generators but not wired in correctly because there's so many electrical wires and systems. So

59:27.800 --> 59:31.800
a problem we failed, we probably won't even fix it. We'll probably just shut down. I don't think

59:31.800 --> 59:34.920
I'm actually capable to keep this place going much longer. I'm trying. The crew's great. But,

59:34.920 --> 59:38.120
you know, I'll tell you, the live crew is great, but the people that have the discipline of running

59:38.120 --> 59:42.760
the show are the best. But I just, I don't know anymore. I'm just being honest. So you have the

59:42.760 --> 59:47.560
generators. You just don't know how to plug them in or make things work. What an amazing

59:47.560 --> 59:57.400
like microcosm of conservative leadership of just like, well, we have the stuff because we were told

59:57.400 --> 01:00:03.000
that it's a good idea to have the stuff, but we didn't prepare and we didn't hook it up correctly.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.680
It turns out no one here knows how to use it. And instead of, because I hire poorly,

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:15.720
instead of being able and capable and creative, I quit. Yeah. And he does talk quite a bit about

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.760
quitting, but he's not giving up. I'm going to throw a little tantrum instead of do anything

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:25.640
about it. He's not giving up, Jordan. People will say that he's giving up. He's not. He's giving in.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.880
But hell, Biden's so evil. He doesn't care. He stole the election. Why didn't he have to

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:36.920
campaign? Why did he tell a group of people in a rally, I don't need you to win. I don't need you

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.000
to win. I don't need you to campaign to win. And I went, look, folks, he's telling you.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.080
Because they're trying to demoralize us and destroy our morale. They

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.880
think humiliating us like this will make us give up.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.080
Really? And you're like, well, Jones, you're talking about giving up. I'm not giving up.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.040
I'm giving out. Okay. Like a horse has been carrying too much too long.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.280
I want you to know how serious this is. You want us to go off the air?

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.440
You want us to just shut it down? Because if people don't get serious and understand

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.120
what's happening, I'll never sell out to the globalist. But at a certain point,

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.960
ladies and gentlemen, there's not enough serious people around me.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.720
This crew in here, because they work with me and they're great. They're serious and they kick ass.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.800
But almost everybody else I know doesn't give a rat's ass. And once you just sit there and

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:33.240
watch Netflix, some of them are pissed because the power's off. And so all I'm getting at is

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:39.720
everyone needs vitamin D3. Wow. Wow. That's what he's going to get. Wow.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.640
I would have preferred if that Springsteen commercial was like,

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.560
in Central America, there's a town. And if you don't want everyone to die,

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:56.440
y'all better come to fucking Ford. Buy a goddamn car.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:03.080
Yeah. Or I will blow up this town. I will kill everyone in this town.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:10.520
I wrote, born in the USA, I can afford a bomb. Don't test me.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.840
I can afford this commercial and I can afford the bomb I'm threatening you with. Come together.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:23.560
This is, that also characterizes Alex's show. It's like, I'm quitting. Buy shit.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.080
Buy shit. We're all going to die unless you buy shit.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.480
Yeah. So to add, to make... Also, all of you are cowards

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.640
who don't have the balls to step up and do what needs to be done.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.400
Like buy shit. Buy my pills.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.840
Yes. You cowards.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.360
I like the idea that there's not enough serious people around and it appears that the only way

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.400
you can be serious is buy Alex's product. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.280
That seems like a trap. He resents everyone he knows for

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.960
not being dumb enough to buy his pills. Yeah. And so now the show

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.200
turns, takes a little bit of an interesting turn.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.840
Okay. And that is Alex gets hungry.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.720
And so they're sitting in this darkened studio and they have to break out survival food.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.200
Oh boy.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:10.600
You know, Michael Gorman put this al dente on a hot plate in the dark about the studio.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.880
They have limited power here. And if it wasn't al dente, it tastes as good

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.120
as restaurant fettuccine alfredo from preparewithalex.com.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.320
It's good. It's good fettuccine alfredo. Wow.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.160
He eats some on the show. God damn.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.480
All right. Yeah, it's pretty great.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.800
It becomes like a commercial for the survival food.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.440
Just have a big Thanksgiving dinner of survival food like that.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.800
Sitting here in the dark studio, this fettuccine alfredo is a little toothsome.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.600
It's good. Yeah.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.080
So now compounding my issues with what is working there and what is not.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.480
Sure. Alex takes phone calls.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.040
Okay. How are your phone lines all working?

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:50.440
Sure.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.040
You can just take live phone calls?

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.400
Yeah, of course. Come on.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.480
I don't know what... I don't know. It's very strange.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.800
They have an old rotary phone. You don't need power for that shit. You just connect it.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:05.080
They might have not been able to plug in the thing that blocks really scary callers.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.120
Oh, that's not good.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.640
Because the first caller is a prophet.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.200
Uh oh.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.560
What's it going to take for the people of this country to wake up?

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.160
Your nation is judged and you have been found wanting.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.160
And I've got information for you, Alex, that is imperative.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.200
I can't get into it over the line, but I'm going to tell you right now

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.160
that there are 360 million lives at stake right now.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.400
And all I'm asking for you is 15 minutes of your time.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.200
If I give you this information and you hear it, you'll know it's the truth.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.280
And it's going to answer a lot of questions that you have had,

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.520
that you have not been able to get answers to.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.480
I'm a man of God. I'm a prophet of God.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.640
All right, brother, listen, I'll get your info.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.520
But I mean, here's the deal. Everybody always used to talk to me privately.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.400
I don't know why we can't. You got a point to make it on air.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.120
But I hear you. I think this is his judgment.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.000
I'm not talking to you out there. I'm not giving you 15 minutes.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Excuse me, excuse me, sir. No.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.640
Hey, it's fun when I yell about how I'm a prophet and millions are going to die.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.080
Yeah, you sound silly because I'm the star of the show.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.400
Yeah, you're just a guy calling in.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.920
Just a guy calling in. Yeah.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.720
Yeah, that's what kind of like hit my ear really weird is like,

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.120
how is that any different than the stuff Alex says?

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.080
It's not really.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.120
I'm always blown away by how local everyone is.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.320
Like 360 million lives are at stake.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.400
The globe is interconnected.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.360
I get that you guys want there to be nationalism and shit,

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.400
but even in that world, the globe is interconnected.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.560
If 360 million people died, the entire world would be fucked up.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.200
I don't think he was saying that it's all just the United States.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:42.840
Sure.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.040
It could be all over the place.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:44.440
Oh, okay.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.040
All right.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.000
Anyway, I don't know.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.040
Look, this prophet, not a great call. It doesn't go well.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.720
Alex gets another call from a guy.

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.480
I'm not going to play this because it's, who cares?

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.160
The caller is just, he wants to plug the Philadelphia Church of God.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:57.880
Sure.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.360
Which I looked into.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.400
The Philadelphia.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:05:59.720
Yes.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.160
That's a church that was founded on the teachings of Herbert Armstrong,

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.960
which is a guy who's a noted preacher of British Israelism.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.520
Sure.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.920
That church was started by a guy named Gerald Flurry,

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.960
who thinks he's a prophet and that Trump was a God-ordained ruler.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.680
That'll happen.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.520
So he calls in to promote that and Alex is like,

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.800
I love watching preachers.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:16.860
Who cares?

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.280
Anyway, Alex gets to, this is an interesting thing that came up.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:22.780
Sure.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.600
Alex believes in weather weapons.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.120
He believes that the globalists can control all this stuff.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:30.680
Naturally.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.400
And so he has this sort of complicated position he's presenting that is,

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.800
did the globalists do this?

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.200
Yes.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:38.840
No.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:39.320
What?

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.200
Could they have?

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.720
Yes.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.120
Is it wrong for me to ask questions?

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:44.620
No.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.000
So it's strange.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:49.480
All right.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.280
It's strange.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.840
And then wouldn't you know it?

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.960
He has all of the evidence to prove that they can do all this.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.120
Sure.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.800
Use storms as weapons and everything.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.520
Yeah, of course, of course.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.360
He just can't find it.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.040
Ooh, bad luck.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.160
Bad luck for us, Dan.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:11.800
It was 20 years ago or so that I got a contact from the Air Force and they said the director

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.600
of heart, the civilian head, would like to come on the show because he heard General

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.760
Benton K. Parton, the military head of heart, previously on your show, talk about it.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.640
And sure enough, there was an Air Force colonel on the line.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.080
They put the civilian head of it on.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.600
I look up, it's the real guy.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.040
He came on about a week after the Air Force called me, but when he admitted that they

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:37.800
could control the weather, they could actually ignite the upper atmosphere on fire and steer

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.680
the the Arctic blast south if they wanted to.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.040
The Air Force guy got real mad, got on the line and said the interview is over during

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.000
the break and hung up on me.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.720
And I've never been able to find that interview.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.680
It was a big interview.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.760
It was so big.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.560
We lost it.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.440
And just so things.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.880
Yeah, it's a real bizarre thing.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.240
So big we couldn't find it or keep it.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.080
And I've never been able to find it.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.280
Damnedest thing.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.000
Bummer.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.440
Because that would have proved everything.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.680
Well, not everything, but it would have proven something.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.720
Would have proved a lot.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.280
Yeah.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:12.840
Oh boy.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.600
I'll wait for him to produce this.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.160
Yeah.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:15.880
Any time now.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.000
I'm not going to wait.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.880
No, any day now.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.280
So we know from listening to this episode that the Alfredo, if Zimmerman hadn't cooked

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.320
it al dente.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:25.880
Amazing.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.760
Would be fantastic.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.320
Amazing.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.520
Uh, Alex eats some more survival food.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.960
And I called him this morning.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.640
Speaking of the devil, there's probably some macaroni and cheese.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.520
Thank you, sir.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.560
Speak of the devil.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.200
They, um, there's probably some macaroni and cheese.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.120
You are not going to eat that.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.000
They're going to give you an additional 10% off.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
They weren't going to do specials for a long time.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.280
We'll get back to this here in a second.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.960
But this either implies that Alex is just doing this to be on camera eating the food.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.600
Sounds like it.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.400
Or they don't have filling portions.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.160
I don't know.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.200
Survival, Dan.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.280
Not, not like thriving.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.480
No, Alex makes a big deal out of how this company is different than the others because

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.760
it's 2000 calories.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.080
Sure.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.160
That's the other ones are like 1000 calories.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:11.660
That's fair.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.880
They hadn't done sales in years.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.480
They had a bunch of sales last year.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.520
This is a huge deal.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.520
We knew it was coming.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.720
The price of food could not last as this low rate for much longer.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.920
And now even major brands like Kraft Heinz, ConAgra are announcing plans to start passing

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.480
the soaring food cost on to you.

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:31.800
Oh, no.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.920
Millions of Americans nationwide becoming aware of the impact of the global pandemic

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:41.080
and lockdown and four statewide outages to our power grid.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.360
There has never been a better time to stock up on terrible food while you still can.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.760
In response to these outages, we are leading to food lines in Texas.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.080
Again, I didn't write this.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:58.760
I talked to the crew about 30 minutes ago and I said, please write this up.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.480
And I guess this was written hastily, so I can't really even understand this.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:07.320
But let me just tell you this, ladies and gentlemen, you need to get prepared now with

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.000
all the craziness that's going on.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.840
How are they supposed to write that up in the dark while they're cooking you food?

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.680
What an asshole.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.800
What a fucking asshole.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.560
He handled it better than O'Reilly though.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.920
They're like, fuck, we're doing it live.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.560
Yeah, that's fair.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.800
That's because he's always doing it live.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.600
This isn't new.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.440
This is a daily occurrence for him.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440
I was like, this sentence does not work.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.160
All right, fuck it.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:29.960
I can't read this.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.640
Did he crumple it up to?

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.680
What an asshole.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.040
That's an homage to Rush.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:34.520
Okay.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.640
Paper crinkling noises.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.360
All right, Jesus.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.240
Homage to Rush.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:43.560
So yeah, we have one last clip here and Alex takes another call from a guy and unfortunately

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.520
in the process reveals that he knows literally nothing about the power situation in Texas.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.020
Sure.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.820
Jeff, first time caller from Arkansas.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.740
Now you've had power allergies there as well.

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.180
There's ERCOTs all over the country.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.060
What does ERCOT stand for?

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.780
What does the T stand for in ERCOT?

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.980
Dan, I think the T stands for Teveryware.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:04.460
Teveryware.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.180
It's everywhere.

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:05.740
Texas.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.660
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.780
ERCOT is everywhere.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.020
ERCOT is everywhere.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.340
It's defined by not being everywhere.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:13.980
No, no, no.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:21.420
So there's the power consortium on the West Coast and then on the East Coast and then

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:22.700
Texas is everywhere.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:28.780
So I would say that whenever you hear somebody say something like that, it would tend to

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:32.220
imply that they know nothing about the issue.

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.300
They don't know anything about the structure, the infrastructure, the way the power is

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.540
disseminated around the state.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.060
You could strongly infer that.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:40.620
Oh, yes.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.120
Yeah.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.760
And so whenever Alex tries to sum up his feelings about the storm and the electricity issues

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.840
like this, just go ahead and toss it out like he did that badly written copy.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.480
Yeah.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.680
They did this on purpose.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.400
I have family.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.400
They used to run power plants.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.160
One of them is dead now, but I've got family.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.080
I'm not going to get into it because they don't want me to.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.800
But I called them in Houston and I called others and they said 100% this is all fake

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.840
to jack up prices.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.040
This means nothing.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.760
He's literally just saying nothing in order to make more interesting stories for his audience

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.360
to have than, hey, poorly managed statewide.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.800
What else has your family done?

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.240
Has his family done everything?

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.440
They did Iran-Contra.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:22.000
Yeah.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:22.640
No kidding.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.200
Everybody.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:23.440
Yeah.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.240
But at a certain point now, everybody's done Iran-Contra.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.240
Everyone on the right did Iran-Contra.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.000
Everyone was like, everyone's proud of being part of it.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.440
I was part of Iran-Contra.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.240
You know, a good thing.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:34.740
Yeah.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.240
Me and Ollie.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.280
Yeah.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.200
He used to fuck around.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.000
It was a good time.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.160
Yeah.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:42.640
I don't know.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.600
This is all very stupid.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.080
I did find this a little more interesting than some shows recently.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:50.320
Sure.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:57.440
And I think one of the reasons is there's at least what appears to be a shift happening.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.120
And maybe I'm just tricked by the fact that the studio was pitch black.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.040
I think there is a little bit of that.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.760
Just like, oh, this is at least novel.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.160
Yeah.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:06.480
Yeah.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.360
And it's obviously, there's no reason to do this.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.640
You could have just taken the day off.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.360
Could have taken the day off.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.040
There's no reason to come into the studio.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.040
Even if you have power, you could say you don't.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.720
But it's to eat survival food on air or to try and get some money coming through.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.220
Yeah.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.760
Now's a great time to sell survival food.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.720
You know what I want to do?

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.000
And that's shipped from somewhere else.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
So it's something that he can still deliver.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.920
Whereas all the stuff in the warehouse, he doesn't have power to the warehouse.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.360
He can't deliver anything for at least a week at back orders.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.040
What a fucking asshole.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.440
Yeah.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.000
Using an emergency as a prop to sell shit is maybe one of the worst things you can do.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.680
And something he does regularly.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.180
Yep.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.160
God, fuck that guy.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:50.960
Yeah.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:55.920
So also, I think just to bring this back into really sharp focus, number one.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.160
You gotta wash that ass.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:58.560
True.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:05.600
Number two, Alex Jones very clearly was demonstrating some explicit white supremacy on this show.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.120
To levels that he rarely touches.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.200
There's some things that are usually kind of implied sometimes.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:19.840
But that idea that he has, that freedom over human history has only sprung forth from white men.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.240
It's pretty clearly indicative of like,

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.680
oh, this is behind a lot of your other beliefs that you try to masquerade as not racist.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:31.920
Yeah.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.600
The only conclusion you can draw is that white men are better than other people.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:36.880
That's it.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.440
Pretty clear.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.440
That's the only thing you can take.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.080
From his thinking.

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.640
Yeah.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:48.720
So you take that and you really have it in sharp contrast with people like Steven Crowder

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.240
trying to whitewash his presentation.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.800
And him trying to whitewash the world.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.300
Yeah.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.720
Just everybody is disgraceful.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.560
Disgraceful.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.840
That's really the feeling that I have.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.000
Steven Crowder, I don't know how good the money is,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.560
but just know that this is what you're doing.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.000
You're trying to mainstream and normalize this guy to your infantile audience

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.680
who think pee-pee jokes are funny.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.180
Yeah.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:22.180
And what's behind it is a guy who thinks that freedom only comes from white people.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:22.580
Right.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.340
So, oh, white males, excuse me.

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.100
I don't think the money's that good.

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.100
I've stopped thinking the money's that good.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:28.900
And here's why.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.860
Here's why.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.580
I'll tell you why.

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.740
Because I was reading about this Ted Cruz thing.

01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:38.660
And in the text messages, they point out that the room fee per night is $309.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.500
And they were like, that's a good room rate.

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:48.100
If you are Ted Cruz selling out literally the survival of the human race for corporations,

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.340
shouldn't you not have to worry about what your hotel room costs?

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:57.540
I'm telling you, it's cheaper to buy corrupt people than it should be.

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:58.180
I don't know.

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.460
I mean, you don't stay comfortably selling out the human race

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.980
if you don't keep up on room rates.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:03.780
Yeah, that's fair.

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.020
Yeah.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.500
That's fair.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.460
Rich people don't spend money.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.340
They keep it down.

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:08.840
Exactly.

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:10.340
I don't know.

01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.780
It's tough for me to say.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:17.060
All that stuff is so shrouded in obscurity that I really have no idea.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:22.260
But no matter what the price, it's just, this is what you're doing.

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.660
Stop trying to pretend you're doing something else.

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.700
Yep, yep.

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.980
Hey, Steven Crowder, you are spreading white nationalism.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.860
The end.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.860
I think it's that.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.580
And I think you could be even more direct with it.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:41.140
What you're doing is actively trying to pretend that this white supremacy

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.380
that is celebrated and disseminated by Alex isn't that.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.060
That's not what this is.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.660
And by doing that, you're trying to trick your young audience

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.020
into believing that something that is hate isn't hate.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:54.420
Yeah.

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:57.860
And that, I mean, gross.

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:02.020
No, it's him having a KKK member and being like,

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.100
see, he's not wearing the robe, so it's fine.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.020
His problem is really with the state.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.700
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:11.540
He doesn't like the state encroaching upon whiteness.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.300
And I don't understand why that's a problem.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.300
Yeah, he doesn't like the state telling him where he can and can't burn things.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.580
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:21.060
Oh, I can't burn it on somebody's yard.

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.980
I thought this was America.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:27.060
This is, yeah, and I resent that quite a bit.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:33.220
And I also resent that I can't get myself to just cover his episode.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.780
Because it is behind a paywall and I'm not going to breach that.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.100
Yep.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.340
God damn ethics, Stan.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:40.900
Oh, well.

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.660
Looks like I believe in their principles more than they do.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.860
Our problem is believing in reality.

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.620
Anyway, we'll be back, Jordan.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.140
But until then, we have a website.

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:51.940
We do have a website.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:52.980
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.860
Yes, we're also on, what is it called?

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.140
I believe it's called Twitter.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:57.540
That's right.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.620
It's at knowledge underscore fight and I go to bed, Jordan.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.500
Yep, we're also on Facebook.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.380
We are on Facebook.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:02.740
Will you tell the shots?

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.300
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.220
to help out people who are still doing God's work.

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:07.860
Yep, we'll be back.

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:08.820
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:09.300
I'm Leo.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:09.940
I'm DZX.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.180
Clark.
