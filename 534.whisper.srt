00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,880

Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm Jordan

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,680
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,000
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,240
Oh indeed we are Dan

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,640

Jordan

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,680
Quick question for you

31
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,720
What's up?

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Shut up

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,160
Oh shit

34
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,080
That's the trick daddy

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,320
Now we're doing a different show

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,560
Immediately we just skip into a different show

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,480
What's up?

38
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,160
Remix

39
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
Remix knowledgefight

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,680
Uh oh, y'all thought you were coming for Alex Jones

41
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,040
One of my two favorite things, that, what's up?

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,960
Shut up

43
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,880
And then the other one is the, hey, you know, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,920
Jordan, I'm serious, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,120
It doesn't matter what you're favorite

46
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,720
The Rock

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,680
You're gonna ask what my bright spot is, Jordan

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,800
Yes, what is your bright spot?

49
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Today my bright spot is, we're checking in on the Hot Sauce of the Month Club

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,720
that Policy Wonk Lisa signed us up for

51
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,360
This month, I was a little late getting over to the box

52
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,000
because of snow and schedule and stuff

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,840
but this month we got the Slow Death Hot Sauce

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
and this is, this is good

55
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,240
It's good

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,080
This is quite good

57
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,280
For now, you don't know what's gonna happen later

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,600
It's the slow death

59
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,640
I might die slowly

60
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,000
You don't know how slow it is

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,040
It's very hot, but it also is a

62
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Trinidad scorpion pepper based sauce

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,760
and I like the flavor of that a lot

64
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,600
What kind of hot?

65
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
Now that I'm a hot sauce guy too

66
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
Taste a little bit

67
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Let's talk, no I'm not ready for that just yet

68
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,680
You said very hot and I don't think I'm comfortable with very hot

69
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
I think you could handle it

70
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,280
Sure, but not before the show is over

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,080
It might, yeah, it might make things go down a strange path

72
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,240
You can try some after the show

73
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, sounds good

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,520
It's pretty good, I like it a bit

75
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,400
I could use it, I could see myself using it for like dipping chicken maybe

76
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,160
or adding to a sauce

77
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,560
Nice little, kick it up a little

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah

79
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
Throw a little in some soup

80
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,640
Maybe a little meat sauce, put a little hot sauce in there

81
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,920
Sure, why not?

82
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,320
Do it

83
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,640
Yeah, if you're getting a little bit of marinara together

84
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,080
What's your favorite flavor of spaghetti, Dan?

85
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,800
I don't know

86
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
It doesn't matter what's your favorite, okay

87
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,000
You have to interrupt

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,640
You understand, you're too fast

89
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,920
So what's your bright spot?

90
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,240
My bright spot, Dan, is, we were talking about this earlier today

91
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,040
My bright spot is the Chris Gethard show

92
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,960
Oh sure

93
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,160
As you and I have spoken

94
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,480
Going back to our early seasons

95
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,920
We have spoken about this show so much and you know I'm a huge fan obviously

96
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,400
Chris Gethard got you a cameo

97
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,760
You cruelly forced him to say nice things about me through the medium of money

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
Like some sort of indentured servitude

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Yeah, you thought your book was in Barnes and Noble

100
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,480
Yes, and we've developed a great friendship since then

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,400
Yes, absolutely

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
But yeah, no, I've been starting so many projects

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,400
I've been trying to find something new to like really sink my teeth into

104
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,160
And watching the Chris Gethard show and just that like unfettered creativity of it all

105
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,320
Is very inspiring and it's like, don't give up on doing weird shit

106
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah, it's good to reconnect with that from time to time

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,640
Like that sort of mentality

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,040
Absolutely, and that whole like, we're a public access show

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,840
We know no one's watching

110
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,240
That's why we're free

111
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,800
You know, that's something beautiful about it

112
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,520
That embracing of like, no we're not trying to get famous or anything like this

113
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,640
It's really interesting too to consider that both Chris Gethard and Alex Jones grew out of public access

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
That is interesting, yes

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,600
The two people who affect my life most today

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Two very divergent individuals

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,280
Very different paths they have tried

118
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,800
Yeah, both of them started at UCB

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
It's true, no, no, Alex was a groundling

120
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
Oh, that's right, that's right

121
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
Sorry, my bad

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,360
So Jordan, today we've got an interesting thing to go over

123
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,560
We're talking about Friday of last week

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,640
It's February 19th, 2021

125
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,240
Blackjack

126
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,760
I think that counts, you got 20...

127
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
I know

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
We're gonna leave that to the judges

129
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,120
The judges in the audience will determine

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
I think the only question is whether or not you fully finished the 21

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,360
I think you started before I finished, and that's why I stopped

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
I think

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
Anyway, it's Friday of last week

135
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,440
This episode is nuts, so

136
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,280
Okay, I imagine so

137
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,400
Yeah, power's back on

138
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Pretty much in the info studio, although maybe it's running on generators

139
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,320
It's unclear

140
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,400
Alex is really, really mad

141
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,720
He is really mad

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,680
Well, yeah, I, yeah

143
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,880
He has a lot of breakdowns on this episode

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
and some will be fun to laugh at

145
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,640
and discuss what he's lying about in order to get himself in the place where he can freak out

146
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,320
Yeah

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,400
But before we cover this episode, Jordan, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who signed up on our sporting show

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
That's a great idea

149
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,760
So first, I liked his name a lot, it's an affirmation

150

179
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:24,800
what's up um shut up you know what the deal is a little

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,660
dancy I've had very little sleep because the neighbors downstairs have been

181
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:36,800
partying oh I'm a little bit on fumes right a little bit loose right my

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,200
connection with the present is tenuous you've got a runner's high a little bit

183
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,840
yeah I think that there are some college students who live downstairs and I was

184
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,700
gonna I will text you and complain about this every now and again I can hear them

185
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,560
yell singing through the floor so they'll just be like singing wet ass

186
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,780
pussy yeah this sucks I'm waiting for you to get a saw and just get a whole

187
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,520
circle in the topping I've thought about drop it down I'm I am inches away from

188
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,560
old man stomping on the floor but I just can't do it and I feel right knocking on

189
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,860
the door cuz it's kovat yeah anyway yeah you're gonna need a broom that's why I'm

190
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,800
a little silly but the good news is Alex isn't in like a totally centered present

191
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,560
presence of mind himself that's good episodes we kind of match energy we're

192
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,920
all playing on a level playing field yeah here's an out-of-context drop from

193
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,520
today's show that's why we're in the position where as a bunch of lawyers a

194
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,880
bunch of candy-ass lawyers cover their ass so much the Chinese are running the

195
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,580
tables on us get ready to nuke our ass because you little chicken-net America

196
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,600
hating bastards have taken over the damn country

197
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:55,280
if I were Alex in the position he's in right now I think I'd probably hate

198
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,000
lawyers too yeah I like this I like getting back to where we should be which

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,320
is everybody hating on lawyers we've had it's been a while since everybody's

200
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,200
really agreed to just hate lawyers you know what I'm saying sure used to be

201
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
what we did all their early 90s Jurassic Park

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,640
everybody hated lawyers lawyers were more of a villain in Jurassic Park than

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,080
the dinosaurs exactly exactly that's the whole thing um yeah I don't know Alex is

204
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,960
it and we're in a weird state so Alex starts the show by talking about how

205
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,540
like maybe I shouldn't do the show which is nice that's a good way it's always a

206
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,320
good sign for the show that's about to happen start you know I learned

207
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
something during the Trump administration I had never tried to be

208
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,680
in LA or be in New York or be in DC and to be you know around the power I had

209
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,120
never tried to go be a sycophant and and and in the system but I noticed very

210
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,840
early on they would work around the clock to try to make sure that I didn't

211
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,560
have access to the president or access to anybody high-level government because

212
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,000
I always just thought inform the public about things and then that would

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,760
percolate up into government and into governance and then we would be able to

214
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,320
stand up against tyranny triple up lionomics take action against the

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:26,880
globalist but it's a balance it's a balance you also need to target

216
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,920
obviously people that are in a power structure and I'm almost tempted right

217
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,760
now with the news I have that I've been working on the last hour to just not do

218
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,720
the show today it probably would be better if I just call Tucker Carlson

219
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,720
call Steven Crowder call Roger Stone and try to get on the phone with Trump

220
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,560
cuz I get on the phone with them if I need to can you come up with the

221
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,320
audience down we cover so much hardcore stuff here but but we're here every day

222
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,760
no one kind of takes it serious we just drop bomb after bomb after bomb after

223
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,560
bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb but film but familiarity

224
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,560
breeds contempt and I get it I have contempt for myself too I don't realize

225
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,480
how important we are in the great work we've done this is an interesting head

226
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,560
space that is a startling number of words for a very simple concept to

227
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,040
express yeah yeah I people other people have better reach than I do I think I

228
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,480
need to probably yeah I could do but it is also like really shitting on the

229
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,320
audience yeah yeah it's my job you guys you guys are so used to me being the

230
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,080
best you don't even give a shit how great I am so good you don't even have

231
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,200
to try I wish I was worse at my job so you guys would have to raise your level

232
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,360
if only I kill time most of the time and then drop the bomb every now and again

233
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,400
you would know to amplify that bomb exactly exactly that's my problem also

234
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,680
why do you need to get a hold of Trump he's not the president anymore no he's

235
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,800
the president president he's the secret president it's very strange very strange

236
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,200
you ever you ever been at a comedy show Dan where for whatever reason the host

237
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,280
has just like their opening set was just something really weird and everybody in

238
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,640
the audience and all of the comics got the vibe of like this is gonna be a

239
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,680
weird show mm-hmm that's not gonna change mm-hmm this just happened it

240
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,200
doesn't matter that there's an hour and 20 minutes left yeah for the next hour

241
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,000
and a half it's gonna be weird yeah you've set the energy exactly you could

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,760
dig out of the hole and we might have some enjoyable whatever but it's still

243
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,520
gonna be weird it's gonna be yeah yeah it's gonna be strange this is what I'm

244
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,960
hearing right now yeah and you hear it a lot too like this this tone of like I

245
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,580
don't even want to do the show anymore but it's particularly severe distance

246
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:49,280
makes the heart grow fond familiarity braids content a contempt so I'm gonna go

247
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,280
to rebroadcast for a while we're gonna get real re ready to shoot the show go

248
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,800
live here today and then I may not do the show today just because this is too

249
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:05,080
important I don't have the smoking gun absolute total complete master plan of

250
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,760
the enemy we have them by the short hairs completely and no one is gonna

251
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,400
care it's always the same it's always the same all of you listeners I bring

252
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,840
light I give you all their plans that nothing happens I've got a call Tucker

253
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,560
Carlson and Steven Crowder I'm gonna be honest with you I don't think that

254
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:37,480
familiarity always breeds contempt you know it does though contempt that would

255
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,960
breed I would also argue continually starting the show with my news is too

256
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,520
big for me to do the show is something too familiar for me not to be

257
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,400
contemptuous about yes yes there's a lot of there's a lot of intersections of

258
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:58,520
familiarity in this equation so yeah Alex freaks out he's just screaming how

259
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,760
he wants to quit sure but I'm here to tell you we're gonna we had to get back

260
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
in the new studio today we weren't quite ready to launch it's okay not blaming

261
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,840
the crew that's okay time ready to go and to prepare my broadcast because

262
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,600
here's the deal I'm not just gonna sit here and put this information out and

263
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:26,520
just have it nothing happened I'll quit today because we have all the evidence

264
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,400
of what the enemy's done and I don't know why people don't have an instinct

265
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,320
to victory but it's incredible it was bleeped out he said no one gives a shit

266
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,200
he is very mad I like he is pretty mad I I do I mean there's something there's

267
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,720
something weirdly noble about the tenacity he has because every other

268
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,400
human being I think on the planet would at a certain point go like well I've

269
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,680
seen every other major news organization release huge information and then change

270
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,680
the world mm-hmm and I think I've done that literally every day for my entire

271
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,200
career and not once have I changed the world yeah perhaps it is me yeah maybe

272
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,360
my radar is busted maybe I can't tell what's big news maybe it's me maybe I

273
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,720
should look a little bit harder at the stories I cover nope nope nope it's

274
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,280
everybody else's fault forever gotta get so mad the end everyone else's fault

275
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,200
always and one of the things I really love about his broadcast style when he

276
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,920
gets into these moods is like he doesn't say what the news is yeah why would it

277
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:47,440
it's too big you can't handle it I enjoy that busy being petulant I enjoy that

278
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,760
because it's really the tell that this is performance yeah on some level yeah

279
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,920
like I think he's really mad there's something that is definitely pissing

280
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,960
him off for sure and it's probably financial and maybe the staff so I would

281
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,440
imagine it has something to do with lawyers probably lawyers the staff

282
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,460
probably also is incompetent and not not doing the job that he needs them to do

283
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,080
yeah but it he's not that mad about what this big news is he's clearly still

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,800
using this like this breakdown lashing out as a way of like anybody who's

285
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,480
watching oh they'll tell people that he's saying he's gonna quit on air no

286
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,680
it's him being like use it there's something else pissing him off I'm gonna

287
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,240
use it in my speech today yeah yeah what am I talking about what's the big news

288
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:36,480
no one cares I shouldn't even say it probably at least when I call other

289
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,880
people that are influential they care and look into it and put it out I call

290
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,960
Paul Watson with this oh he's busy out on a date or something I'm not mad at

291
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,200
Paul he already wrote like five articles today it's just that I don't have the

292
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,120
people I don't have the infrastructure I don't have anything and we can have the

293
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,720
keys to put Lucifer into the pit of hell no one would care they'd be busy get

294
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,120
their fucking nails done if I were Paul I would not appreciate the way Alex

295
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,960
talks about him he seems professional oh man weird weird to have to work with

296
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,360
that guy yeah it's almost like he lashes out at the people around him as well as

297
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,920
the audience on a constant basis yeah yeah like he's a child almost yeah we

298
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,200
get to the big news sure Alex does eventually let it rip what the story is

299
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:34,200
and it is bullshit you understand ladies and gentlemen we have the smoking gun of

300
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,120
what did the power outage 100% it was the Department of Energy and their order

301
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,600
to keep the power off you understand we have that and no one gives a damn I I

302
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,560
quit then screw this whole frickin place man I mean this is just all out of

303
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:57,200
control unbelievable we have released so many smoking guns so much proof Joe

304
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,480
Biden is on TV on CNN saying Gigi ping is doing a good job invading Hong Kong

305
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,600
and running giant death camps fine if America wants that then frickin have it

306
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,000
if you want your power turned off by the Department of Energy then enjoy it I'm

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,800
gonna run some tapes I'm not even sure let it all burn then I mean we can't

308
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,160
even admit aborting babies is murder so we don't deserve to have power

309
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm gonna lead you into the next okay Trump did win but it's a setback I'm

310
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,520
still gonna lead you in it nope yeah everyone dies all this emotional

311
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,400
outburst and this childish pageantry yeah but he's still able to say frickin

312
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
he's still able to recognize he's on the radio and he doesn't want to get fine

313
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,600
totally so I find this a little false yeah so also it appears that Alex is

314
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,680
very mad about a document from the Department of Energy that he's been

315
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,400
shown and I would guess that he hasn't read this document he claims that it's

316
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,640
smoking gun evidence that the power outages in Texas were intentional which

317
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,680
is why he's putting on this shamefully childish display of fake rage at the

318
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,200
start of the show we'll get into the document as Alex covers it but at this

319
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,200
point let me just sum things up to say that Alex is entirely wrong about it

320
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,960
that's not hard no that's not hard to believe no but it does it does like the

321
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,760
the level to which he's wrong about it makes all this outburst really really

322
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,840
funny what I do appreciate about all of this is there is you can't deny that

323
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,960
being your own boss is great right sure I mean he technically said I quit yeah

324
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,800
exactly like that kind of outburst you just get that if you work for someone

325
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,680
else and Wolf Blitzer is not going on TV on election night being like shit I

326
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,840
don't even know what the results are I quit let's let's imagine that Alex did

327
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,040
have a boss but he had such a good contract that they just couldn't get

328
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,520
him out of it like firing him would require paying out ten years it's

329
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,200
something ridiculous if he did that and he was yelled I quit on air and I was

330
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,480
his boss would be like he said it he said he's gone he's gone I accept your

331
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,800
letter of resignation immediately that's the other good thing about not having a

332
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,520
boss means anything exactly so like this is a smoking gun sure there's another

333
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,200
smoking gun and then there's another there's so many Alex has so many guns

334
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,120
okay this is smoking gun stuff and then I've got a bunch of other big giant

335
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,920
smoking guns but I'm too angry to do the show right now I am too damn angry to do

336
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,200
this broadcast right now and there's a lot of other stuff going on so I'm gonna

337
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,040
just I've got to go find my stack of news from yesterday I got to do a lot of

338
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,640
stuff around here sure I watch somebody walk out oh no you've got the stack

339
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,280
well I'll go get it myself but I'm not even bitching anymore I just can't do

340
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,080
this six seven days a week and just with the public like zombies everywhere just

341
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,580
like walking into globalist machine-gun fire and then that weird reanimated

342
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,440
corpse Biden's stumbling around up there just all of it just it's just it's a

343
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,960
joke because people are unconscious from watching TV and playing on their phones

344
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,320
all day ah that's it yeah that's the problem yeah the public yeah hmm he's

345
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,120
having a bad day yeah yeah you know I can't help but feel like I've been there

346
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,240
before and what comforts me all the time is when I just go oh no I'm just an

347
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,360
asshole yeah you know like everybody else is asleep and everybody no no I'm

348
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,120
just being a dick my bad guys I'm an asshole I just I'm having a bad day I

349
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,000
didn't like you know some I got too overcharged for something totally maybe

350
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,440
I'm taking it out on the people around me subconsciously I'm sorry and you tell

351
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,040
them and they're like you know what I get it yeah it happens and then you're

352
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,040
just like we got a de-escalate for Alex it's an essential piece of his

353
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,680
showmanship dwelling in that place he's having a bad day yeah and that means

354
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,080
everyone's got to die yeah people are unconscious from watching TV and playing

355
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,400
on their phones all day it manipulates all the dopamine receptors where people

356
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,520
think that's the real world and the real world they're all like this and I just

357
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,760
don't want to be around this anymore maybe Bill Gates is right just kill

358
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,000
everybody but use a neutron bombs at least and kill them quick man don't

359
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,560
mutate them and torture them and dumb them down but Bill Gates get a deal with

360
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,960
the globalists and start neutron bombing the public just neutron bomb everybody

361
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,720
then we don't kill the earth and the humans are gotten rid of baby he's right

362
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
maybe I should go work for Gates and just come up with a neutron bomb plan I

363
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,960
know Bertrand Russell had one before they call it a neutron bomb do you know

364
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,280
anything about neutrons the answer how to start over you know God did it so I

365
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,200
guess there's imitating God maybe I should just salute Bill Gates right now

366
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,080
on there pledge allegiance to him nobody else cares do it at least he actually

367
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,920
wants to run something it's me the devil do it I have the giant news but no one

368
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,400
no one cares of course I'm serious no one cares maybe I freak out maybe I cut

369
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,760
a few fingers off with loppers and people and this is really important this

370
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,440
will bring down the globalists here let me cut my pinky off oh now you pay

371
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,280
attention the Department of Energy on record told Texas you can't produce more

372
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,200
power I have the damn document with a direct link to them they'll just have

373
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,960
Snopes say it isn't real hell we want to be able to pull it up in there probably

374
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,800
so anyways I'm gonna go to rebroadcast for a while I'm gonna try to settle down

375
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:53,520
and then I'm gonna come back and lay all this out for you so incredible it's

376
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:02,680
incredible that is what wasn't a display that was a show that was a baby just

377
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,000
man you know what suck it would really suck if his conspiracies were actually

378
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,080
true oh yeah cuz that now the movement about these things are so beholden to

379
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,880
him that like like the imagined like having to fall in line behind him Oh

380
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,880
brutal oh this guy's onto something brutal this whiny little asshole you

381
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,840
know you know thankfully he's not you know goes down in history for being a

382
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,880
hero people who weather adversity you know when you think of Nelson Mandela

383
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,320
and you think of being put in prison for all those years and then not just

384
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,120
surviving through it but then going on to help found a fucking country for a

385
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,080
real opportunity at equality but you write you read his speech yeah no one

386
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,400
cares you guys imprison me for 25 years and I don't even know if I want to help

387
00:24:50,400 --> 00:25:00,600
any of you people I quit no one gives a shit about me Bishop Desmond Tutu's an

388
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:13,200
asshole yeah yeah that's who I want to follow it to the noble noble leader yeah

389
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,640
so I think part of his anger is coming from a place of like he wasn't on this

390
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,520
sooner cuz like this document was available before and he could have been

391
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,400
covering the story at this way before and said he had the sort of childish oh

392
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,880
it was the windmills narrative and what have you I think I think that's where a

393
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,600
little bit of this anger comes from before I went live on air I got a bunch

394
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,280
of extra news that I would already was told by a very close person to me and I

395
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:50,120
dropped the ball on Monday and just I've been told by inside sources in Texas

396
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,720
power plants that the feds ordered them not to increase power I should have

397
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,560
followed up on that I already knew there was those agreements I already knew

398
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,360
about those documents I should have gotten the current ones I should have

399
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,920
found out well let me see the directive instead I just went and poured another

400
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:11,960
glass of wine and set a fire in the dark and then son of a bitch a whistleblower

401
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,000
inside Department of Energy contacted someone that works here and said why is

402
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,720
Jones not covering this no one else is and I read it 20 minutes for I went on

403
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,140
air and I already knew all that was real we went and checked it's on the

404
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,560
Department of Energy website and it was like being punched in the chest and the

405
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,440
stomach over and over again to read for sure they raped us for sure they're

406
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:40,720
doing it I am so freaking pissed man I can't take much more of these people

407
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,160
and the way it's you sound like the demons all slimy the way it's written is

408
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,840
all slimy what is wrong with this man I don't know I'm not sure exactly what the

409
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,120
definition of slimy documents are but I guess for Alex it's when the document

410
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,880
says the opposite of what you need it to say and so you have to argue that when

411
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,040
they say yes they really mean no exact is slimy is super slimy super slimy

412
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,240
also I think that I think thug thinks it's slimy Dan I think Alex is really

413
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,800
using the term whistleblower too loosely here is a publicly available document on

414
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,120
the Department of Energy's website so I would say that this is a tipster if

415
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,480
anything well maybe someone who's doing Alex's work for him I don't know maybe

416
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,200
somebody who's just been to that website it's not a whistleblower no the document

417
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,040
in question is titled order number 202 dash 2 1 dash 1 it's four pages long so

418
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,040
there's no way I believe Alex read it and it's really easy to find and if you

419
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,560
go do do find it yeah what you'll read is an order that is designed to increase

420
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,000
the electric capacity of the Texas power grid in order to deal with the emergency

421
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,280
that the state is going through sure on February 14th quote the Electric

422
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,540
Reliability Council of Texas an independent system operator whose

423
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,960
service territory includes 90% of the electric customers in the state of Texas

424
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,820
filed a request for emergency order under section 202 C of the Federal Power

425
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,840
Act the beginning of the document lays out how ERCOT had foreseen the possible

426
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,800
issue and they quote this weather event is expected to result in record winter

427
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,040
electricity demand that will exceed even ERCOT's most extreme seasonal load

428
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,700
forecasts to try to adjust for this ERCOT attempted to maximize energy

429
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,400
generation by doing things like having the Railroad Commission of Texas put out

430
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,640
an emergency order that quote specified increasing the priority of gas supplies

431
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,360
to ERCOT generators one of the main things that this order is about is that

432
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,160
the electricity generation that they were needing to engage in would almost

433
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,640
certainly not be possible quote without violating federal air quality or other

434
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,200
permit limitations so ERCOT appealed to the Department of Energy to get an order

435
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,040
allowing them to work outside those regulations due to the emergency

436
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,880
situation right on page two of the order it says quote given the emergency nature

437
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,280
of the expected load stress the responsibility of ERCOT to ensure

438
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,560
maximum reliability on its system and the ability of ERCOT to identify and

439
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,280
dispatch generation necessary to meet the additional load I have determined

440
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,200
that the additional dispatch of the specified resources is necessary to best

441
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,160
meet the emergency and serve the public interest for purposes of FPA section 202

442
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,560
C okay so the document Alex Jones is saying is them saying you can't have

443
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,160
more power is them saying yes you can have more power with some limitations

444
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,760
well sure I mean you can't destroy the earth right yeah the order is the acting

445
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,000
secretary of energy replying to ERCOT saying that they have permission to

446
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,520
break regulations up to a point sure yeah yeah yeah the order literally says

447
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,920
quote ERCOT anticipates that this order may result in exceedance of emissions as

448
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,360
well as wastewater release limits to minimize adverse environmental impacts

449
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,080
this order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within

450
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,360
the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes that's great it's

451
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,600
pretty simple this is just an order where ERCOT asked for permission to

452
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,920
wiggle around some regulation in order to be able to meet the increased demand

453
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,520
of the energy emergency the Department of Energy replied that they could do so

454
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,800
but that wiggle room only existed for the purposes of re-establishing

455
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,120
reliability of the power grid they couldn't just flout all federal

456
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,640
pollution regulations but some be less rigidly enforced given the human need

457
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,320
that existed yeah we don't want to destroy the earth but people are

458
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,000
freezing to death so let's find a better place than find a way to make this work

459
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,960
exactly there's nothing here honestly it doesn't sound like which is why Alex is

460
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,000
doing this high school drama club play about how serious and smoking gun it all

461
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,320
is it's actually a document that says the opposite of what he claims it does

462
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,280
and because that is the case he has to claim that it's slimy this is the level

463
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,600
of work that he's doing and it really makes you wonder why he doesn't just

464
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,800
quit like it's it's this is nothing I don't know cuz he's his own boss I guess

465
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,200
slimy slimy start all over again anyway I don't think he's even read it so I

466
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,280
don't I wouldn't expect him to understand some of these like dynamics

467
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,360
and all of this yeah but I think that he realizes like I don't know if I can

468
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,200
really even fucking explain this to the audience in a way yeah it's gonna make

469
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,800
them motivated this might be too hard for me yeah better call Tucker oh boy I

470
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,680
can get more done if I call a bunch of influential people I know and tell them

471
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,320
to look into this and let them break it I don't care about breaking it and then

472
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,720
it will actually get have an effect instead the audience is great but I say

473
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,960
so much stuff people just hear it and just think oh that's another thing Alex

474
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,080
just said no it's not it's whatever happened to plan B smoke and God I ever

475
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:33,720
saw to quote Robert Duvall in network it's a big titted head okay I mean this

476
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,880
thing would hurt them so freakin bad I hate the New World Order I can't stand

477
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,560
Bill Gates I can't stand Warren Buffett I can't stand Ted Turner I can't stand

478
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:52,400
Barack Obama I can't stand them anymore I want them off my back now you mothers

479
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,360
and then I sit there and I read exactly what I was told by my family that works

480
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,920
in these damn plants that they're ordered to go at zero or quarter power

481
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,160
under the frickin federal government because Biden put them back under the

482
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:16,760
son-of-a-bitch two weeks ago now we all knew that did we I feel like we did not

483
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,000
know that no and I don't know I read this document I died I don't I still

484
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,560
don't know it yeah man you know I here's my pitch for Alex and I mean this is

485
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,320
gonna sound crazy all right but he's sick of being under the backs of sure

486
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,560
Bill Gates Warren Buffett Ted Turner for some reason uh-huh join the socialist

487
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,800
buddy we want to try and get rid of these rich people and remove their power

488
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,520
come on man no get rid of them let's go cuz socialists are working for Ted

489
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,560
Turner they don't just don't know it oh well how about this all this what if Ted

490
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,520
Turner here's here's my cell here's my cell back to you Alex yeah what if Ted

491
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,400
Turner thinks we're working for him but we're actually working for our own goals

492
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,080
using his money and power that he thinks he's bought us with another possibility

493
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,960
would be moved to Antarctica okay now that's also a good one

494
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,640
Alex you can also go to Antarctica so one of the features of Alex's coverage

495
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,320
of this document from the Department of Energy is one of those

496
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,480
strategies he uses a lot I call it making things up oh that's a good one

497
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,000
and guess what's in the document the Department of Energy told Texas under

498
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,200
federal law you'll be prosecuted unless you exhaust outside power supplies first

499
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,960
there's no mention of prosecution the relevant part of the order that Alex is

500
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,920
talking about is as follows quote consistent with good utility practice

501
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,720
ERCOT shall exhaust all reasonably and practically available resources

502
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,000
including available imports demand response and identified behind the meter

503
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,200
generation resources selected to minimize increase in emissions to the

504
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,800
extent that such resources provide support to maintain grid reliability

505
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,360
prior to dispatching these specified resources this makes total sense and

506
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,680
Alex is just writing a story about it to make things seem more nefarious when in

507
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,920
reality this is very much a document that is the Department of Energy giving

508
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,920
ERCOT a fair amount of leeway and trying to keep the system online frequently in

509
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,360
the document you see it made clear that if the determination of what is

510
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,880
necessary is that they need to put on more save lives now yeah save lives now

511
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,480
the determinant the determination of when it's necessary to put on all these

512
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,280
other things that's at the discretion of ERCOT yeah that is not that's that's

513
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,600
left up to them yep and so like behind the meter generation resources for what

514
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,600
it's worth is like solar and batteries and stuff like that so I don't know I

515
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,200
just don't I don't I don't see I don't see what he's saying I don't find this

516
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,600
very compelling at all no Texas always had more power than anybody we should

517
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,440
supply before Obama came in the states all around us remember that our grid

518
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,720
supplied much of the country that's what we were proud of it remember the US

519
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,400
under Trump got to where it was the biggest supplier of energy in the world

520
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,120
for the first time since the 50s again this is just something Alex is making

521
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,680
up the power grid in Texas specifically exists in such a ways to not supply

522
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,400
power to other states to avoid interstate energy sales regulation from

523
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,760
the federal government someone's the pretend persona that Alex has should

524
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,200
really understand that dynamic well and be proud of it also Alex is just

525
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,480
reporting something Trump lied about and pretending it's real Trump basically

526
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,880
lied in his State of the Union speech about how for the first time in 65 years

527
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,120
we're net exporters of energy but that's not true no anyway prices for energy

528
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,520
you're going up oh well yeah I imagine so Reuters Texas wholesale electric

529
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,760
prices spiked more than 10,000 percent amid outages and what does this little

530
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,080
sweet document show that I'll show you the print of the next segment they had

531
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:59,440
to first only buy from outside sources including available imports and demand

532
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,200
response you look those terms up that means demand response is a term meaning

533
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,040
outside power when you don't have enough demand response is a key term means you

534
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,280
buy from available imports these are all lawyer terms once again I think that

535
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,200
one's just an economics term well making things up because he knows that his

536
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,600
audience doesn't care and they're never gonna check on any why would they demand

537
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,560
response according to Alex's lawyer speak for that means you got to buy

538
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,040
outside power he knows this because he looked it up yeah this is made up out of

539
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,000
thin air yeah demand response is an energy efficiency strategy that involves

540
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,820
giving customers the ability to adjust their electricity usage away from peak

541
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,760
hours by doing things like offering cut rates at other times when the burden on

542
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,500
the electric grid is lower or putting small tariffs on power during peak

543
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,120
periods this Department of Energy document is saying that in addition to

544
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,180
using available reserves demand response strategies should be employed where

545
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,360
possible to maintain the functioning of the power grid oh so you mean

546
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,460
incentivizing people to spread out the usage of power yeah oh when possible yeah

547
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,800
I was I'm fairly certain that you did just say buy all your power from China

548
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,160
sure it would be easy for someone to hear me make this correction of Alex and

549
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,680
say that I'm just nitpicking and fact-checking him pointlessly but

550
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,520
there's a really serious phenomenon that I'm trying to illustrate here Alex Jones

551
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,640
constantly pretends to know things he has a consistent pattern of just making

552
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,120
up definitions of words and details about news stories and then pretending

553
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,160
that the thing he's making up is the product of research or investigation

554
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,420
it's important to recognize that he does this about the small details of his

555
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,680
day-to-day conspiracies in the same way he does with the larger worldview level

556
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,400
conspiracies his workflow is essentially like walking watching a shitty improv

557
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,440
show rooted in terrible racist politics he uses headlines and words he skims and

558
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,000
stories as the suggestions from the audience that he takes on any riffs a

559
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,520
scene out of it I would implore anyone who takes him seriously to consider that

560
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,800
dynamic and to critically engage with the things he's saying you'll almost

561
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,680
always find him fabricating details about the stories that he's covering in

562
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,640
order to make them fit his predetermined narrative and worldview which he

563
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,800
absolutely wouldn't need to do if he wasn't full of shit as for the

564
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,040
skyrocketing prices of energy some consumers are seeing that is being

565
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,200
reported in reputable outlets and it does appear that some of this is going

566
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,000
on the Public Utility Commission of Texas is opening an investigation into

567
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,240
possible price gouging and I would guess that if they find companies that were

568
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,480
engaging in that then the customers will not be responsible for paying those

569
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,400
outrageous rates there's one thing to keep in mind however a small number of

570
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,960
people in Texas use a company called gritty to provide their electricity

571
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,680
which operates on wholesale prices most people use providers who have fixed

572
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,720
rates but going through a company like gritty actually saves people money on

573
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,480
their electric bill generally the downside is in a situation like this

574
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,800
their rates are not fixed and they can skyrocket even so I would guess that

575
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,920
these people won't be stuck with these exorbitant bills and the solution will

576
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,480
be reached I I don't I just I find it hard to believe that but I don't know

577
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,200
yeah I mean I don't know at this at this point in time it's safer to assume that

578
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,360
people are going to get fucked over in some massive fashion possibly possibly

579
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:14,280
but I I would I would guess that there will be some forgiveness yeah yeah but

580
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,760
something but the examples that you see are these like really really high bills

581
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,920
and the ones that I've been able to see and someone could correct me if I'm

582
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,760
wrong but the ones that I've been able to find being reported are wholesale

583
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,680
prices okay which are not the majority of electric users right in the state of

584
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,960
Texas most people have fixed rate and they're obviously their prices will go

585
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,720
up too but not per like the right right right they will need to use more

586
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,060
electricity to heat their house because it's colder outside right yeah but they

587
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:51,680
won't you know that's just a natural phenomenon you know and like I mean

588
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,360
just price gouging is illegal yes that's going on people will get to the bottom

589
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,520
I will help yeah so Alex you know he's got this document that he's lying about

590
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,600
yes he feels really excited about this lie he's pretty pumped about it and he's

591
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,920
like you know what these fucking people in Congress in Texas and our governor

592
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,520
they need to lie about this document too oh no and all Ted Cruz has got to do to

593
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,000
change the subject all Greg Abbott has to do to redeem himself all John Corn

594
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,240
has to do is come out and read this on air and it's game over by the way I've

595
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,880
had my problems with Ted Cruz but I think he's a good constitutionalist

596
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,480
Ken Kuhn is like going out to get a cheeseburger in Texas it's an hour and

597
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,440
45 minute flight his daughters were going down there why do I care if he

598
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,880
flew down there with his daughters to get out of this hell when it turned out

599
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,080
his power was off my powers was off a bunch my water just came back today most

600
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:53,000
folks still don't have water now you're there out of school why not go Mexico

601
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,200
see we live by Mexico folks we go down there but I'm not even defending that

602
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,480
how is that the news how is he horrible and the Democrats are all oh look he

603
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,640
doesn't care about you he didn't want the lockdowns he didn't want to wear the

604
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,340
mask it's not like he's for a lockdown he's caught getting out of one ladies

605
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,720
and gentlemen Alex Jones with a master class and intentionally missing the

606
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,800
point yep yep yep remarkable I think the the point could very easily be made that

607
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,120
he doesn't see that as something very difficult to do because he too is rich

608
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,920
could be could have something to do with that could be could be one of those

609
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,760
things where rich people don't really understand why poor people get mad yeah

610
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,880
and I think that it's a it's a really interesting way that Alex engages with

611
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,200
Ted Cruz and his responsibilities as an elected official yeah yeah as opposed to

612
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,560
the responsibilities of other enemy yeah you know it's weird just because you

613
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,200
don't need to be there doesn't mean you're sure so Alex is mad at ERCOT now

614
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,560
I should say that he doesn't know that it's the Electric Reliability Council of

615
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,640
Texas well he doesn't really know what it is he doesn't he thinks he seems to

616
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,000
think that ERCOT is like basically Enron oh okay I get what you think it's a

617
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,800
company yeah of course he does yeah it's weird and I'm just reading it made me so

618
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,600
angry that I almost turned this desk over seriously man but you know what

619
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,680
that's a normal response to learning they not just robbing our future they're

620
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,680
blaming us they're starving people they're bankrupting all these

621
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,480
communities they killed over 50 people and and then now they're gonna rape us

622
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,640
more and are telling us permanent blackouts because the feds put ERCOT in

623
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,120
control because you can't have the state managing it the feds put ERCOT the feds

624
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:42,000
put ERCOT in control Alex has no idea what that is well he seems to think it's

625
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,600
like a power company as opposed to being the management entity for Texas's power

626
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,560
grid which is run by a board of directors that's overseen by the Public

627
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,920
Utility Commission of Texas and the state's legislature the Public Utility

628
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,040
Commissioners responsible for overseeing ERCOT are directly appointed by Texas's

629
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,240
governor there could almost be no system imaginable where the state would have

630
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,600
more direct control over the power system other than one where the state

631
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,440
itself runs all the power plants itself which I can't imagine Alex advocating

632
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,760
for no no no Alex knows nothing about the subjects he's covering and he's just

633
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,080
making up a story to tell the audience that fits the show's larger themes and

634
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,280
narratives none of this is based in reality at all yeah outrageous also you

635
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,120
don't get to you don't get to care he doesn't get to care you already did the

636
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,800
coronavirus thing where you denied all of that shit do you don't get to be like

637
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,280
oh how dare they do this now now fuck off it's remarkable how everything is a

638
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,600
conspiracy shit yeah anyway Alex gets back to this document and this is this

639
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,040
is kind of I guess one of the other reasons I'm in a nice mood beyond the

640
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,300
sort of slap happiness and sleep deprived ness cuz he's talking about the

641
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,600
docks he's talking about a document yeah and I always like it when we can get

642
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,680
ground you like the dock yeah in the ERCOT region that's Texas the

643
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,200
generating unit specified resources that this order pertains to are listed on the

644
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,240
order two zero two dash two one dash one resource list as described below and

645
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,320
it's Oh hydroelectric and it's all this it takes them a week to turn a coal

646
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,160
plant up didn't let him do that so Alex is reading this part of the document

647
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,040
that he's skimming and it should come as no surprise but he's just making shit up

648
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,100
the resource list that's referenced in that Department of Energy order is

649
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,040
available and it's easy to find it's just a list of power generation plants

650
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,680
in Texas that are relevant to the order each plant is listed in the third column

651
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,720
in the spreadsheet is the type of energy that they use okay literally zero are

652
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,120
solar or windmills or hydroelectric because that's not what the order

653
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,800
pertains to it doesn't seem like those would be important no particular one

654
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,320
these are all natural gas lignite bituminous coal or distillate fuel oil

655
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,280
power generators which are being given special permission to operate in ways

656
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,480
that would exceed environmental rules specifically only when doing so would be

657
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,160
needed to maintain the reliability of the grid Alex hasn't read the actual

658
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,880
document nor has he seen this resource list he's literally just making up what

659
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,280
he thinks the story is then repeating that to his audience as a fact that's

660
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:12,120
what he does yeah it makes up stories he's a storyteller yeah also this should

661
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:18,200
make it more than abundantly clear we have an order saying that these evil

662
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,240
power companies can destroy the earth in order to save lives but all the

663
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,520
renewable energies are just like yeah you guys keep on going like it seems it

664
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,200
seems very obvious that one of these is a serious polluter destroying the world

665
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,400
and the other one they're like okay well you guys are fine mm-hmm yeah so Alex is

666
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,200
you know again it's really confused about about ERCOT and what have you and

667
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,280
the relationship with the federal government the feds are in charge man a

668
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,840
lot of people are confused as to how this happened mm-hmm we're gonna come

669
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,440
back and read all this for you it's really bad right here it's really really

670
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,280
bad but the point is the feds are in control the feds wouldn't let them up

671
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,080
the power till the power grid was going down and then limited what they can do

672
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,720
and then sat back and said Texas is a bunch of idiots a bunch of hay seeds

673
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:12,320
well I'm watching he-haw right now I'm aware no Joe Biden go take me over Joe

674
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,040
Biden knows how to cook a possum oh yeah

675
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:23,120
I'm not sure that's what's happening I'm fairly certain that I have heard many

676
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:29,840
calm comments on Biden's ability to cook possum mm-hmm the jury's out on it from

677
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,640
what I've heard sure some people like it some people don't yeah be just above

678
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,120
board and totally clear any kind of like Texan bashing that's going on I think is

679
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,640
wrong yeah I think it's misguided counterproductive yeah at least to the

680
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,440
extent that that is going on I am I don't know what extent it is I have not

681
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,880
really been exposed to much of it myself sure I imagine if I spent more time on

682
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,360
Twitter maybe I would have seen some dumb comments yeah get him out but

683
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,120
whatever that said what Alex is doing is trying to take valid criticisms about

684
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,400
how Texas their power grid is operated and then he turns that into people

685
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,200
saying that Texans just watch he-haw all day and cook possum he doesn't have a

686
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,240
response to the arguments about the grid because he doesn't actually even

687
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,680
understand the conversation the people are having not even a little bit but he

688
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,640
can get his audience personally offended if he makes the whole thing about how

689
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,000
the coastal elites think people in the middle of the country are stupid that's

690
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,800
pretty much the tactic that you see being employed here it's infuriating I

691
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,480
do not appreciate that he is talking about a problem that is almost entirely

692
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,560
the result of a state desiring more than anything else for the federal government

693
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:45,120
to get out of their fucking business and then to blame the feds for being in

694
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,840
their business yeah I mean I think I think that I think that there's a piece

695
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,120
of it that you can probably blame on the organizational structure short of the

696
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,560
disconnection from the interstate yeah sales of energy but also like I think

697
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,800
that you also have to be very careful with that because of how severe this

698
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,280
storm is like oh totally like even in ideal circumstances there would have

699
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,120
been power outages like it 100% perhaps not to the extent that it you know we

700
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,480
have seen sure and maybe not as severe as we've seen but a storm like that in

701
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,760
Texas is something that is just a recipe for there's going to be a lot of trouble

702
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,960
sure sure I am I'm just saying that if the reports of them being that close to

703
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,680
having no power for months are true right that is 100% look there are gonna

704
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,840
be power outages they happen here they happen everywhere and it can be dealt

705
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,360
with but if you have a system that is like well we were a James Bond moment

706
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:51,480
away from fucking never having power for the next year then yeah you done fucked

707
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,200
up in the planning somewhere along the line yeah and it's it's really tough to

708
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:05,080
say if that problem is essentially related to the non interstate energy

709
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,080
sales it's just unrelated mismanagement or something it's highly possible I

710
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,200
don't know enough to say for sure but I think that those things are important to

711
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,000
tease out sure before you make too much of a judgment but it does seem like

712
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,120
whatever it is it's something yeah yeah I mean at the very least it would be

713
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:32,720
hard to imagine if there was some sort of unified or greater area of power

714
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,040
control where it wouldn't be able to be transported effectively much much better

715
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,760
to the point where the we would have a better response time at the very least

716
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,920
you know it may be yeah but who knows for now all we do know is that Alex

717
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,960
over prepares indeed for his show that sounds true I want to be totally clear

718
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:00,440
with you I massively prepared for the show I have one two three four five six

719
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,240
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen

720
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,520
stacks of news that I was a friend over and read and I've not even hit can't

721
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,200
believe he counted all the way like one story a segment and they go coming up is

722
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:19,240
this no no no no I will not sit here and watch the Department of Energy override

723
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Trump's executive orders and tell Texas they couldn't increase power when I have

724
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:32,840
the smoking gun I just want to I just want to see this all over the news I

725
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,920
want to see them go to prison got bad news yeah that's gonna be trouble yeah

726
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,160
it's probably not gonna happen yeah good luck buddy so Alex is personally

727
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,880
offended because this is about Texas yes of course you know yeah and what he

728
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,200
wants you to know is the Texas what about you look at me I am looking

729
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,640
straight on right on the eyes Texas what about it those people take action and

730
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:02,600
Alex might have the worst example that he uses okay there's a mistake that this

731
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,640
operation comes out of Texas there's a mistake Kennedy got his head blown off

732
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,240
down here people are ready to take action down here ladies and gentlemen

733
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,840
I'm not defending what happened to Kennedy I'm just saying the new oh what

734
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,520
with a lot of fire and they take our kindness as weakness because they're

735
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,480
stupid because they haven't studied history and they have no idea about

736
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,160
people dedicated to an idea dedicated to their family dedicated to God dedicated

737
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:35,040
to war to defend it if need be why did you say look Texicans Texans will

738
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,160
fucking kill the president we'll do it right fucking now that's weird I thought

739
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,840
it was a right now I guess I guess if there's one thing I know about the South

740
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:49,340
it's that they murder presidents dad huh this this adds a wrinkle to the

741
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:56,960
conspiracy I guess yep yep this is interesting it's not the mob is not the

742
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,440
Russians it was not a single lone actor it was the lone star state George HW

743
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:10,240
Bush Connecticut yeah yeah yeah I don't know this could be a tough one to sell

744
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,820
do you think it's a coincidence that infowars comes out of the same state

745
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,400
where Kennedy was killed what I don't think it is I don't think I was hoping

746
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,840
it was a good no it's not Ted Cruz's dad did it no Alex Jones's dad did it he was

747
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,200
a CIA dentist oh shit yeah shot him with a tooth exactly the magic bullet was

748
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,160
actually a no it was an exploding tooth it was a dune situation yep totally

749
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:42,600
that's dr. Jones's calling card so Alex goes to calls and not a lot of these are

750
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,620
worth even mentioning although I will say that this next call is probably the

751
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:54,920
saddest I've been listening to Alex in a long time nobody with my three kids I

752
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,760
live close to the Memorial City Mall right in the suburbs right in the thick

753
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,080
of this whole thing and I can just want to say thank you to you guys because

754
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,240
there is not a chance I would have gotten through this with my myself my

755
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,520
wife my three kids without two things first thing the water filtration system

756
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,660
is incredible anybody listening please please get prepared you do not want to

757
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:22,320
be a victim to this government to this squeeze bank info wars and Alex and this

758
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,200
entire crew because every day you guys get uncomfortable and you have the

759
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,320
uncomfortable conversation and you teach us here on the ground to be

760
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,320
uncomfortable and to talk to people and to have the uncomfortable conversation

761
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,480
and the reason why I let you so much much much so much Alex is you're real

762
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,280
you stay when you make mistakes you say when something got by you and when the

763
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:47,360
Q thing and you're just a real info wars is as real as it gets in America and I

764
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,380
can tell you from listening to you guys from my generator power this week you

765
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,560
kept my connection to humans you kept my connection to God Alex and I'm telling

766
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,460
you I have been freezing my butt off me and my family in 40-degree weather all

767
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,240
week long but I can promise you every morning when I wake up I was going to

768
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,800
band on video waiting for your reports because you guys keep our connection to

769
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,440
God and our human connection well that's exactly what John John the boom

770
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm ready said doesn't matter Jones you blew up earlier that's real looking for

771
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,240
red blood and that's it all I've got is I'm real oh boy

772
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,640
Wow that just bummed me out so much like everything that dude was saying is so

773
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,600
wrong Wow just brutal just oh that is that's just so it's the uncomfortable

774
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,320
conversation I don't know but that that guy has just enumerated a crime like

775
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:42,680
what he is just described is somebody so destroying his mind mm-hmm that he is

776
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:49,280
enthralled to the point of death the idea that in a in a disaster no I will

777
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,920
say that this is one of the situations where some of Alex's products actually

778
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,880
probably be quite useful like I take less issue with this guy saying I bought

779
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,760
a water filter like hey man hey how about that it paid off yeah yeah so that

780
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,120
I take less issue with yeah but the the idea that in a disaster in this in this

781
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,700
scenario that he's in he goes to the generator to try and find Alex's videos

782
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:19,960
to keep his connection with humanity and God is just dark yeah that is a dark

783
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:24,120
thought yeah that is a dark thought especially when like okay your

784
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,800
connection to humanity just quit earlier in the show no shit your humanities your

785
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,720
connection to humanity said fuck this good Bill Gates should neutron bomb

786
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,040
everybody I mean it just it just makes you like you think about all the

787
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,320
horrible shit that's happened in the past and you're like why would people

788
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,880
follow that guy and you're like oh people follow any old asshole apparently

789
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,560
yeah I believe the expression they used to say in Missouri was it takes all

790
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:54,720
kinds yeah it takes all kinds yeah so why would anyone listen to a 13 year old

791
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,480
Pope and then you get that guy and you're like well yeah I guess believe

792
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,600
whatever you want man so I gotta ask you I don't know I don't know a lot about

793
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:06,640
this 13 year old Pope mm-hmm is that the young Pope was that that HBO show no no

794
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,600
no that was a that was what what's his face I don't know British dude was he the

795
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,960
type who told his audience to prepare kill lists yeah actually he was oh he and

796
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,320
Alex have that in calm I believe you ladies and gentlemen I don't have words

797
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,280
to describe to you how serious the times are I know you already know that and I'm

798
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,200
not saying be violent either because that'll be misconstrued and used against

799
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,720
us and the people we go after are just minions they don't count but they don't

800
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:40,040
count the globalist and the people Bill Gates controls need to know in not a

801
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,640
threatening way they're assaulting us they need to know that we're aware of

802
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,560
what they're doing and that God is going to hold them accountable we're gonna

803
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,600
pray for God to bring vengeance upon them and that as they officially assault

804
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,000
us as they come after us that we reserve the right to defend ourselves he said

805
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,920
threateningly I don't shoot my mouth off I'm not mr. big badass you know talk

806
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,800
about I'm a big leader of the military and all this I'm not I just I can't sit

807
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,480
there and lie to you and tell you that you're not being assaulted and so like

808
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,120
Santa Claus you should be researching who's been naughty and who's been nice

809
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,880
who's gonna get cold they're stalking and who's gonna get little bicycle or

810
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:27,280
toys or candy so that's where we are we'll be right back stay with us your

811
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,480
calls are straight ahead so Alex talks a lot about this idea of making kill list

812
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,920
yeah and like I don't know I I don't know if it would hold up in court or

813
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,400
anything but I could see somebody like trying to kill Bill Gates or something

814
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,200
and then being like I was advised that he was trying to kill everyone with a

815
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:51,520
vaccine yeah and that we needed it was a defensive really he was attacking us

816
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,880
yeah well who told you that Alex Jones every day simply every day I don't I

817
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,400
don't know if it's like the kind of thing that he could get in trouble for

818
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:08,560
legally but like spiritually or or just morally yeah he's doing everything that

819
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:13,480
would lead someone to do the thing yeah just the thing hasn't happened yeah I

820
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:19,720
would I would just say that it's time to write a sequel to miracle on 34th Street

821
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,440
where Alex claims that Santa is making kill lists out of this naughty and nice

822
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,120
list listen we all know it's in the white papers it's uh no I'm Santa Claus

823
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,660
I'm real oh we know you're fucking real you're killing all of our children they

824
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:40,880
got kill teams of reindeer going around and elves why is that nose so blood-red

825
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,440
huh Santa yeah so we get another caller here and he actually brings up

826
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,600
interesting point that I have an answer for there were people in Oklahoma without

827
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,760
power freezing that you know cuz we got hit with the same storm you guys got hit

828
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:02,440
with them and they're sitting in the cold freezing and we've got a National

829
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,280
Basketball Association team called Oklahoma City Thunder and the whole

830
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,000
arena the power you know they played their basketball game and that was all

831
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,880
good and fun while people sat in the cold freezing that's what technocracy

832
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:21,360
is is they go Oh downtown Austin stays open all air caught stays open but I'm

833
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,360
in the dark for six days so some of the places that retain power during the

834
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,000
Texas storm seemed a little bit strange but a lot of it's actually really easy

835
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,720
to understand if you take the time to care a lot of it have to do with

836
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,280
sections of the grid where essential services were located like hospitals

837
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,040
being a higher priority than ones that say didn't contain hospitals sure this

838
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,500
could easily create the impression that there was power in downtown Austin but

839
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,240
not in outlying areas but if you look at the proximity of downtown to not only

840
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,920
the Capitol building but also Dell Seton Medical Center all kinds of warming

841
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,880
centers and st. David's Medical Center you start to understand how it might be

842
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,720
impossible to retain power to those buildings without also keeping power on

843
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,400
for some 6th Street businesses that maybe you were like why are they why

844
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,600
do they have a light also it appears that you do correctly understand why

845
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,680
people are mad at Ted Cruz mm-hmm oh is the basketball being played but people

846
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,020
are done oh are you flying to Mexico but people are dying yeah there we go now

847
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,400
you get it and and to be fair I would guess a similar thing is going on in

848
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,520
Oklahoma City where the Thunder play at the Chesapeake Energy Arena which is

849
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,260
within walking distance of the county courthouse the county detention center

850
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,200
and st. Anthony Hospital as well as the entire University of Oklahoma Medical

851
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,080
Center complex including the Children's Hospital and the VA yeah but you know

852
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:45,800
that everybody needs to suffer equally sure I mean it's it's a pretty simple

853
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,360
explanation I just don't I don't understand why people get mad or

854
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,560
confused about things that are like they're pretty easy to understand well

855
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:58,120
because it would be hard fine so Alex has max Kaiser on and they just talk

856
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:03,680
about Bitcoin yeah Alex gets really mad about how he could have bought Bitcoin

857
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,840
when it was like five dollars and now it's over 50 grand well the thing is or

858
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:15,840
whatever it is max ten years ago offered him 10,000 Bitcoin and Alex is like how

859
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,960
much would that be now it would be a lot of money buddy I was like I missed the

860
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,720
boat oh you might have missed the boat there was one funny clip but I actually

861
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,200
wish I would have pulled this but max's whole interview is just who gives a

862
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,160
shit it's just talking about how great Bitcoin is sure and Alex being like I'm

863
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,800
ambivalent stop giving out your web address makes it sound like you're a

864
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:41,120
sponsor but when when Alex is talking about how much this Bitcoin would be

865
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:46,440
worth now makes some kind of joke about like oh that's why you've got to sell

866
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:53,600
these boner pills it was really dishy nicely done man yeah max geyser has a

867
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,680
freedom as you are the Eve that is kind of enjoyable but it also makes his

868
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,840
interviews not really all that worthwhile for our show but after he

869
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:10,760
leaves Joel Skousen comes in oh shit Joel Skousen is a mess yeah he is a

870
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:16,720
weirdo and I just have four clips of Skousen's interview okay that are four

871
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,600
reasons why you should not take Joel Skousen series all right the first is

872
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:26,800
that he also along with Alex seems to think that ERCOT is of like a federal

873
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,920
agency or a company all right they want to set themselves up as the Savior's I

874
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,440
think it's important Joel that you grew me the evidence shows that it was

875
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,240
federal mismanagement and control with ERCOT removing the state from the

876
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,840
process that took one of our best power systems and made it one of our worst no

877
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:47,640
I completely agree with you Alex why the federal problem the federal EDX but so

878
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:54,800
why like shouldn't you correct him if you know that ERCOT is a Texas specific

879
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,840
if you understand the dynamics at play you shouldn't go along with Alex saying

880
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:04,120
a literally the opposite I completely agree with you sure what it is that he's

881
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:09,880
saying is 100% so that's not good and I'm maybe just not going to go ahead and

882
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,840
listen to anything that Joel has to say about the the storm and the power grid

883
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:18,680
if he doesn't know this basic yeah yeah that would be that would be a problem I

884
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,240
don't think I would want to learn calculus from somebody who doesn't know

885
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,380
algebra now here's where it gets weird reason number two not to take Joel

886
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:34,160
Skousen seriously where do you think fossil fuels and oil comes from oh god

887
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:41,440
no personally yes I think it comes from God and he put them there about 10,000

888
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,720
years ago to trick us in the big line petroleum geologists now it's becoming

889
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:51,680
recognized that that oil is not fossil fuel what is it well I'm afraid I have

890
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,280
to get theological here this was part of the creation of the earth oh my god you

891
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,200
know the Lord in his creation actually put oil deposits look if fossil fuels

892
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,800
exist if you create oil from deteriorating animals and you look at

893
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,200
all of the trillions and trillions and trillions of tons of oil which would

894
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,880
only represent a tiny fraction of the decaying bodies of any dinosaurs you

895
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,640
would have had to have the dinosaurs a hundred feet deep all over the entire

896
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:28,800
earth plants marine life Wow dude this is what's up yeah no Dan carbon only

897
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,280
comes from all dinosaurs thank God when he was making the earth put oil down

898
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:39,520
there I swear to God yeah I swear Dan yeah I mean I would I would say I don't

899
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,440
know this is really narcissistic and I'm gonna go ahead and preface this by

900
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,760
saying I don't actually believe it okay but it's kind of fun to think about I

901
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,640
felt a little bit of resistance on Joel Skousen's part to say that oh yeah and

902
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:56,880
part of it I'm hoping is him being like god damn it Dan's gonna make fun of this

903
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:03,400
him being like well to answer that question I have to get the whole okay okay

904
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,840
so Joel thinks that God put oil down there for us to to use that's another

905
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:13,720
reason not to take him all too serious I just I just suppose that look I'm

906
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:19,760
religion blah whatever but you can't do that you know like a demonstrably

907
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,000
ridiculous thing you can't just believe like that you can wrong you can that's

908
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,560
wrong no no you can you're more than free to believe whatever you want to

909
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:35,520
believe sure however it will implicate how I view your beliefs in other

910
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,720
subjects no I would like that to be true as well unfortunately that is not true

911
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:48,440
for most people sure yeah like if you want to believe anything like that God

912
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:52,260
put oil in the middle of the world I think it's harmless belief unless you're

913
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:56,640
using that to argue against climate change there we go right I'm going to

914
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,600
use your belief that God put oil down there for us to use I'm gonna use that

915
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:07,880
to inform my view of your arguments about anthropogenic sure I'm a chair

916
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:13,560
sure I just I would just prefer if we had if there if okay holy books now have

917
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,860
to have footnotes that's my new rule if something is demonstrably true it's a

918
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,840
footnote in your book I get it you stole that new rule from Bill Maher is that

919
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:27,360
from fuck off I swear to God if it is I'll kill myself sounds like something

920
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,800
he would say he's all anti-religion and shit any other segment called new rules

921
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,640
I just don't want oh that well that fine yeah yeah fine I quit that's the joke

922
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:41,680
I'm old and I'm useless Dan why don't you go turn into fossil fuel

923
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,400
nicely done cuz I'm not a dinosaur and I'm still only six feet below ground so

924
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:55,400
where do you think fossils come from Oh God no hmm I don't I I'm you know what

925
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,720
fuck it Samson every whenever he pulled the temple down he made all the fossils

926
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,640
okay that's interesting yeah it seems like it was intelligently designed

927
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:11,840
exactly intelligently designed and I I'm you know I'm not even sure that you know

928
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:16,280
desire you know a lot of the fossils we find of those actually lived on the

929
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,200
earth it's very very possible this earth was created by layers from other

930
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,560
previous planets where these things are previously grown and and put together oh

931
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:30,860
boy this is some this is Camelot this is some project right oh yes and to be

932
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:35,600
honest like I knew that Joel Skousen was a bit of like he has some weird beliefs

933
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:41,440
in such a lot of like it comes from his his family anti-communist royalty yeah

934
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,720
yeah yeah of course everything is a fucking false flag to him strange ideas

935
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:52,240
about what communism is and is not but this is this is out of my I did not know

936
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:59,800
that the planet itself was a false flag from other planets it could be could

937
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,760
possibly be right other planets false flagging us with themselves these

938
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:10,920
fossils they look weird that's well okay that's from space man all right so I

939
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,920
will admit that there are millions of people who have dedicated their entire

940
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,200
lives to studying and understanding what fossils are and I could listen to any

941
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,560
one of them however they look weirder to me than those people do so guess what

942
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,080
God space God yeah but see here's the thing that you don't understand about

943
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,040
all those people study fossils yes it's all a scam do you study fossils because

944
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,880
if you did you would get into it and then someone would come and put you put

945
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,440
their arm around you and be like listen it's all from fucking space we're

946
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:45,400
scamming people with I gotta get into this yeah yeah that's why Indiana Jones

947
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,600
was so cool he knew it was all a scam that was predictive program yeah exactly

948
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,720
it's a perfect grip that's why you steal it from the thuggy cult yeah yeah so

949
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,680
yeah I guess fossils coming from space is gonna be another reason I'm not gonna

950
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,840
take Joel Scousum too seriously that would be a good reason now I think he

951
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:07,120
might also believe in divine alchemy of some sort this is this is also kind of

952
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,880
weird you know when you look at the chance of this orbit of this earth being

953
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,000
so perfectly designed and the tilted ears to have the perfect seasons and the

954
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,400
moon is in the perfect spot there's just no way that these things can happen by

955
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:31,920
chance this earth was a design divine creation and you know most Christians

956
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,640
believe in and they should all believe in the fact that the Lord has power over

957
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,080
the Intel over the elements meaning the elements are intelligence enough

958
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:47,360
intelligent enough to obey commands no no it isn't natural no that most know

959
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:52,240
what the rock and water poured out it wasn't a natural spring you know the

960
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:57,720
Lord can command that elements reform and form any element necessary because

961
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,320
God is in command of everything created and we're made the small image of God

962
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,880
we'll be right back way that way to throw it to break now that that is a

963
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:10,760
thought process that I appreciate if God can command the elements then the

964
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:15,600
elements must be smart enough to understand God yeah see now I didn't

965
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,000
think of that yeah I didn't think that the elementals could also obey or

966
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,520
disobey commands I suppose yeah I guess the the staggering

967
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:33,760
unlikelihood of life leads one to just decide arbitrarily that it must be fully

968
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,920
designed and also the Bible is literal yeah how could how could we have such a

969
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,440
perfect environment a perfect planet where massive weather events are

970
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,240
occurring almost regularly due to our fault where people are being destroyed

971
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:51,320
over and over and over again by droughts because they get a perfect amount of

972
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,040
water wherever they go on the problem the problem I'm guessing is that we're

973
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,720
not burning enough oil well carbon is good for the planet is what I was told

974
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,680
that's what I'm hearing we're carbon dioxide starved damn where's my buddy

975
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:09,640
Mark Moreno at when you this dude is strange yeah yeah and I was listening to

976
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:15,360
this I was like wow you're a much weirder dude than I think I I can kind

977
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,320
of see why you normally stick to weird geopolitics as opposed to some of these

978
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,160
yeah more esoteric beliefs because they're very strange they kind of make

979
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,480
you look like a project Camelot person to answer that I'm gonna have to get

980
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,760
the object theological oh well then I'm gonna have to leave sir if the question

981
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,000
is why is there oil and I have to get a theological to answer it goodbye yes it

982
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,640
was lovely speaking to you don't have an answer I mostly bring this up and show

983
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,760
this to be like all right Joel Skousen is somebody who Alex thinks is super

984
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:00,820
credible very important source on like geopolitics like is Iran up to

985
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:04,560
something sure and he's also a person who thinks that God injected oil in the

986
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,880
world for us to find it maybe fossils come from outer space yeah yeah cuz

987
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:13,720
they're weird look like this is this is the level of expert that is hanging

988
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,520
around here right right beneath the surface and you're going to find them

989
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:23,280
saying things like this it's which is not to say that you can't have some out

990
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,800
their beliefs and not be you know like Jack Parsons everybody who trusted him

991
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,440
as an expert when it came to rockets and shit mm-hmm not when it came to

992
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:39,200
elementals not not true sex magic was not real yeah yeah it would be good if

993
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,160
you stayed in your lane stay in your lane now unfortunately his lane is also

994
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,760
bullshit that's a problem the difference between what lane you're in

995
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:55,720
yeah huh I don't know this was really interesting experience for me because

996
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:00,440
you know you start out with Alex furious and just like I quit fuck this I can't

997
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:05,200
do this yeah this sucks fuck this place I hate info wars I want to quit yeah but

998
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,760
if he does start quite that bad you know we're eventually gonna get to I'm gonna

999
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,060
have to get theological to answer that question Alex you go along the path you

1000
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:18,320
find out what's making him so mad and it's just lying about this Department

1001
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:24,920
of Energy document yeah and you know he mellows out says some bullshit and then

1002
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,840
you get Skousen and I think that this this illustrates two really essential

1003
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:34,600
points one is that Alex lies like this document he's just making shit up about

1004
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,000
it's just over and over again finding little things that he can use as like

1005
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,880
like as if he's climbing up a mountain little handholds that he can find to lie

1006
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,360
about exactly and then the second thing I think this illustrates is that like

1007
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:53,540
people like Skousen are not reliable sources no no so even if they have the

1008
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:58,680
pretense and the aura and the the the attempted facade of being like a serious

1009
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:03,680
minded I look at the documents and you know I go where you know I I've read

1010
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:08,600
Carol Quigley's book and I am left to assume that all Democrats are evil or

1011
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:13,560
whatever the fuck like even if you put on that hat underneath that hat is a

1012
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:20,240
dude who's weird yeah about fossils and let's never forget that patient zero for

1013
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:26,280
kovat 19 was indeed Steve Pachannik true and he cured it with antibiotics mm-hmm

1014
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:32,920
so and he rigged up this whole election as a sting operation against the

1015
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,880
Democrats yeah and Alex just can't handle his truth nope nope nope a lot of

1016
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,640
his experts are reliable he also arrested the Pope forgot about that

1017
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:46,680
year that's true that's true there are a lot of exploits that are regularly

1018
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:52,720
unmentioned despite their very bombastic nature yeah so anyway Jordan this has

1019
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:57,840
