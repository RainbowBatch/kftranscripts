Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.280 --> 01:01.800
I'm Jordan

01:01.800 --> 01:03.680
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:03.680 --> 01:05.000
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.000 --> 01:06.240
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:06.240 --> 01:06.640
Jordan

01:06.640 --> 01:07.000
Dan

01:07.000 --> 01:07.920
Jordan

01:07.920 --> 01:08.680
Quick question for you

01:08.680 --> 01:09.720
What's up?

01:09.720 --> 01:10.560
Shut up

01:10.560 --> 01:12.160
Oh shit

01:12.160 --> 01:13.080
That's the trick daddy

01:13.080 --> 01:14.320
Now we're doing a different show

01:14.320 --> 01:16.560
Immediately we just skip into a different show

01:16.560 --> 01:17.480
What's up?

01:17.480 --> 01:19.160
Remix

01:19.160 --> 01:20.880
Remix knowledgefight

01:20.880 --> 01:24.680
Uh oh, y'all thought you were coming for Alex Jones

01:24.680 --> 01:27.040
One of my two favorite things, that, what's up?

01:27.040 --> 01:27.960
Shut up

01:27.960 --> 01:32.880
And then the other one is the, hey, you know, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?

01:32.880 --> 01:34.920
Jordan, I'm serious, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?

01:34.920 --> 01:38.120
It doesn't matter what you're favorite

01:38.120 --> 01:39.720
The Rock

01:39.720 --> 01:41.680
You're gonna ask what my bright spot is, Jordan

01:41.680 --> 01:42.800
Yes, what is your bright spot?

01:42.800 --> 01:46.600
Today my bright spot is, we're checking in on the Hot Sauce of the Month Club

01:46.600 --> 01:49.720
that Policy Wonk Lisa signed us up for

01:49.720 --> 01:52.360
This month, I was a little late getting over to the box

01:52.360 --> 01:55.000
because of snow and schedule and stuff

01:55.000 --> 01:58.840
but this month we got the Slow Death Hot Sauce

01:58.840 --> 02:01.400
and this is, this is good

02:01.400 --> 02:02.240
It's good

02:02.240 --> 02:03.080
This is quite good

02:03.080 --> 02:05.280
For now, you don't know what's gonna happen later

02:05.280 --> 02:06.600
It's the slow death

02:06.600 --> 02:07.640
I might die slowly

02:07.640 --> 02:09.000
You don't know how slow it is

02:09.000 --> 02:12.040
It's very hot, but it also is a

02:12.040 --> 02:15.040
Trinidad scorpion pepper based sauce

02:15.040 --> 02:16.760
and I like the flavor of that a lot

02:16.760 --> 02:17.600
What kind of hot?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.880
Now that I'm a hot sauce guy too

02:18.880 --> 02:19.720
Taste a little bit

02:19.720 --> 02:22.320
Let's talk, no I'm not ready for that just yet

02:22.320 --> 02:24.680
You said very hot and I don't think I'm comfortable with very hot

02:24.680 --> 02:26.680
I think you could handle it

02:26.680 --> 02:29.280
Sure, but not before the show is over

02:29.280 --> 02:33.080
It might, yeah, it might make things go down a strange path

02:33.080 --> 02:34.240
You can try some after the show

02:34.240 --> 02:35.000
Okay, sounds good

02:35.000 --> 02:36.520
It's pretty good, I like it a bit

02:36.520 --> 02:41.400
I could use it, I could see myself using it for like dipping chicken maybe

02:41.400 --> 02:43.160
or adding to a sauce

02:43.160 --> 02:44.560
Nice little, kick it up a little

02:44.560 --> 02:45.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah

02:45.200 --> 02:46.520
Throw a little in some soup

02:46.520 --> 02:49.640
Maybe a little meat sauce, put a little hot sauce in there

02:49.640 --> 02:50.920
Sure, why not?

02:50.920 --> 02:51.320
Do it

02:51.320 --> 02:55.640
Yeah, if you're getting a little bit of marinara together

02:55.640 --> 02:57.080
What's your favorite flavor of spaghetti, Dan?

02:57.080 --> 02:57.800
I don't know

02:57.800 --> 02:59.560
It doesn't matter what's your favorite, okay

02:59.560 --> 03:01.000
You have to interrupt

03:01.000 --> 03:03.640
You understand, you're too fast

03:03.640 --> 03:04.920
So what's your bright spot?

03:04.920 --> 03:08.240
My bright spot, Dan, is, we were talking about this earlier today

03:08.240 --> 03:10.040
My bright spot is the Chris Gethard show

03:10.040 --> 03:10.960
Oh sure

03:10.960 --> 03:12.160
As you and I have spoken

03:12.160 --> 03:13.480
Going back to our early seasons

03:13.480 --> 03:17.920
We have spoken about this show so much and you know I'm a huge fan obviously

03:17.920 --> 03:19.400
Chris Gethard got you a cameo

03:19.400 --> 03:25.760
You cruelly forced him to say nice things about me through the medium of money

03:25.760 --> 03:27.280
Like some sort of indentured servitude

03:27.280 --> 03:28.960
Yeah, you thought your book was in Barnes and Noble

03:28.960 --> 03:33.480
Yes, and we've developed a great friendship since then

03:33.480 --> 03:34.400
Yes, absolutely

03:34.400 --> 03:37.440
But yeah, no, I've been starting so many projects

03:37.440 --> 03:41.400
I've been trying to find something new to like really sink my teeth into

03:41.400 --> 03:46.160
And watching the Chris Gethard show and just that like unfettered creativity of it all

03:46.160 --> 03:50.320
Is very inspiring and it's like, don't give up on doing weird shit

03:50.320 --> 03:53.200
Yeah, it's good to reconnect with that from time to time

03:53.200 --> 03:54.640
Like that sort of mentality

03:54.640 --> 03:59.040
Absolutely, and that whole like, we're a public access show

03:59.040 --> 04:00.840
We know no one's watching

04:00.840 --> 04:02.240
That's why we're free

04:02.240 --> 04:04.800
You know, that's something beautiful about it

04:04.800 --> 04:08.520
That embracing of like, no we're not trying to get famous or anything like this

04:08.520 --> 04:14.640
It's really interesting too to consider that both Chris Gethard and Alex Jones grew out of public access

04:14.640 --> 04:16.320
That is interesting, yes

04:16.320 --> 04:19.600
The two people who affect my life most today

04:19.600 --> 04:22.800
Two very divergent individuals

04:22.800 --> 04:26.280
Very different paths they have tried

04:26.280 --> 04:28.800
Yeah, both of them started at UCB

04:28.800 --> 04:30.960
It's true, no, no, Alex was a groundling

04:30.960 --> 04:32.440
Oh, that's right, that's right

04:32.440 --> 04:33.280
Sorry, my bad

04:33.280 --> 04:36.360
So Jordan, today we've got an interesting thing to go over

04:36.360 --> 04:38.560
We're talking about Friday of last week

04:38.560 --> 04:39.640
It's February 19th, 2021

04:39.640 --> 04:40.240
Blackjack

04:41.560 --> 04:43.760
I think that counts, you got 20...

04:43.760 --> 04:45.040
I know

04:45.040 --> 04:46.440
We're gonna leave that to the judges

04:46.440 --> 04:47.000
Okay

04:47.000 --> 04:49.120
The judges in the audience will determine

04:49.120 --> 04:52.000
I think the only question is whether or not you fully finished the 21

04:52.000 --> 04:55.360
I think you started before I finished, and that's why I stopped

04:55.360 --> 04:56.400
I think

04:56.400 --> 04:58.240
Anyway, it's Friday of last week

04:58.240 --> 05:00.440
This episode is nuts, so

05:00.440 --> 05:02.280
Okay, I imagine so

05:02.280 --> 05:05.400
Yeah, power's back on

05:05.400 --> 05:08.600
Pretty much in the info studio, although maybe it's running on generators

05:08.600 --> 05:10.320
It's unclear

05:10.320 --> 05:13.400
Alex is really, really mad

05:13.400 --> 05:14.720
He is really mad

05:14.720 --> 05:16.680
Well, yeah, I, yeah

05:16.680 --> 05:18.880
He has a lot of breakdowns on this episode

05:18.880 --> 05:20.880
and some will be fun to laugh at

05:20.880 --> 05:25.640
and discuss what he's lying about in order to get himself in the place where he can freak out

05:25.640 --> 05:26.320
Yeah

05:26.320 --> 05:30.400
But before we cover this episode, Jordan, let's take a moment to say thank you to some folks who signed up on our sporting show

05:30.400 --> 05:31.200
That's a great idea

05:31.200 --> 05:33.760

05:33.760 --> 05:37.320

07:16.600 --> 07:24.800
what's up um shut up you know what the deal is a little

07:24.800 --> 07:29.660
dancy I've had very little sleep because the neighbors downstairs have been

07:29.660 --> 07:36.800
partying oh I'm a little bit on fumes right a little bit loose right my

07:36.800 --> 07:42.200
connection with the present is tenuous you've got a runner's high a little bit

07:42.200 --> 07:48.840
yeah I think that there are some college students who live downstairs and I was

07:48.840 --> 07:52.700
gonna I will text you and complain about this every now and again I can hear them

07:52.700 --> 07:57.560
yell singing through the floor so they'll just be like singing wet ass

07:57.560 --> 08:02.780
pussy yeah this sucks I'm waiting for you to get a saw and just get a whole

08:02.780 --> 08:07.520
circle in the topping I've thought about drop it down I'm I am inches away from

08:07.520 --> 08:12.560
old man stomping on the floor but I just can't do it and I feel right knocking on

08:12.560 --> 08:17.860
the door cuz it's kovat yeah anyway yeah you're gonna need a broom that's why I'm

08:17.860 --> 08:22.800
a little silly but the good news is Alex isn't in like a totally centered present

08:22.800 --> 08:27.560
presence of mind himself that's good episodes we kind of match energy we're

08:27.560 --> 08:30.920
all playing on a level playing field yeah here's an out-of-context drop from

08:30.920 --> 08:34.520
today's show that's why we're in the position where as a bunch of lawyers a

08:34.520 --> 08:38.880
bunch of candy-ass lawyers cover their ass so much the Chinese are running the

08:38.880 --> 08:42.580
tables on us get ready to nuke our ass because you little chicken-net America

08:42.580 --> 08:46.600
hating bastards have taken over the damn country

08:46.600 --> 08:55.280
if I were Alex in the position he's in right now I think I'd probably hate

08:55.280 --> 09:01.000
lawyers too yeah I like this I like getting back to where we should be which

09:01.000 --> 09:05.320
is everybody hating on lawyers we've had it's been a while since everybody's

09:05.320 --> 09:09.200
really agreed to just hate lawyers you know what I'm saying sure used to be

09:09.200 --> 09:12.320
what we did all their early 90s Jurassic Park

09:12.320 --> 09:16.640
everybody hated lawyers lawyers were more of a villain in Jurassic Park than

09:16.640 --> 09:23.080
the dinosaurs exactly exactly that's the whole thing um yeah I don't know Alex is

09:23.080 --> 09:27.960
it and we're in a weird state so Alex starts the show by talking about how

09:27.960 --> 09:32.540
like maybe I shouldn't do the show which is nice that's a good way it's always a

09:32.540 --> 09:36.320
good sign for the show that's about to happen start you know I learned

09:36.320 --> 09:39.920
something during the Trump administration I had never tried to be

09:39.920 --> 09:47.680
in LA or be in New York or be in DC and to be you know around the power I had

09:47.680 --> 09:53.120
never tried to go be a sycophant and and and in the system but I noticed very

09:53.120 --> 09:59.840
early on they would work around the clock to try to make sure that I didn't

09:59.840 --> 10:03.560
have access to the president or access to anybody high-level government because

10:03.560 --> 10:09.000
I always just thought inform the public about things and then that would

10:09.000 --> 10:12.760
percolate up into government and into governance and then we would be able to

10:12.760 --> 10:17.320
stand up against tyranny triple up lionomics take action against the

10:17.320 --> 10:26.880
globalist but it's a balance it's a balance you also need to target

10:26.880 --> 10:31.920
obviously people that are in a power structure and I'm almost tempted right

10:31.920 --> 10:35.760
now with the news I have that I've been working on the last hour to just not do

10:35.760 --> 10:39.720
the show today it probably would be better if I just call Tucker Carlson

10:39.720 --> 10:43.720
call Steven Crowder call Roger Stone and try to get on the phone with Trump

10:43.720 --> 10:47.560
cuz I get on the phone with them if I need to can you come up with the

10:47.560 --> 10:52.320
audience down we cover so much hardcore stuff here but but we're here every day

10:52.320 --> 10:56.760
no one kind of takes it serious we just drop bomb after bomb after bomb after

10:56.760 --> 11:01.560
bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb but film but familiarity

11:01.560 --> 11:05.560
breeds contempt and I get it I have contempt for myself too I don't realize

11:05.560 --> 11:09.480
how important we are in the great work we've done this is an interesting head

11:09.480 --> 11:14.560
space that is a startling number of words for a very simple concept to

11:14.560 --> 11:19.040
express yeah yeah I people other people have better reach than I do I think I

11:19.040 --> 11:24.480
need to probably yeah I could do but it is also like really shitting on the

11:24.480 --> 11:31.320
audience yeah yeah it's my job you guys you guys are so used to me being the

11:31.320 --> 11:39.080
best you don't even give a shit how great I am so good you don't even have

11:39.080 --> 11:43.200
to try I wish I was worse at my job so you guys would have to raise your level

11:43.200 --> 11:48.360
if only I kill time most of the time and then drop the bomb every now and again

11:48.360 --> 11:53.400
you would know to amplify that bomb exactly exactly that's my problem also

11:53.400 --> 11:57.680
why do you need to get a hold of Trump he's not the president anymore no he's

11:57.680 --> 12:01.800
the president president he's the secret president it's very strange very strange

12:01.800 --> 12:06.200
you ever you ever been at a comedy show Dan where for whatever reason the host

12:06.200 --> 12:12.280
has just like their opening set was just something really weird and everybody in

12:12.280 --> 12:15.640
the audience and all of the comics got the vibe of like this is gonna be a

12:15.640 --> 12:19.680
weird show mm-hmm that's not gonna change mm-hmm this just happened it

12:19.680 --> 12:23.200
doesn't matter that there's an hour and 20 minutes left yeah for the next hour

12:23.200 --> 12:27.000
and a half it's gonna be weird yeah you've set the energy exactly you could

12:27.000 --> 12:30.760
dig out of the hole and we might have some enjoyable whatever but it's still

12:30.760 --> 12:33.520
gonna be weird it's gonna be yeah yeah it's gonna be strange this is what I'm

12:33.520 --> 12:37.960
hearing right now yeah and you hear it a lot too like this this tone of like I

12:37.960 --> 12:43.580
don't even want to do the show anymore but it's particularly severe distance

12:43.580 --> 12:49.280
makes the heart grow fond familiarity braids content a contempt so I'm gonna go

12:49.280 --> 12:52.280
to rebroadcast for a while we're gonna get real re ready to shoot the show go

12:52.280 --> 12:57.800
live here today and then I may not do the show today just because this is too

12:57.800 --> 13:05.080
important I don't have the smoking gun absolute total complete master plan of

13:05.080 --> 13:10.760
the enemy we have them by the short hairs completely and no one is gonna

13:10.760 --> 13:15.400
care it's always the same it's always the same all of you listeners I bring

13:15.400 --> 13:21.840
light I give you all their plans that nothing happens I've got a call Tucker

13:21.840 --> 13:27.560
Carlson and Steven Crowder I'm gonna be honest with you I don't think that

13:27.560 --> 13:37.480
familiarity always breeds contempt you know it does though contempt that would

13:37.480 --> 13:42.960
breed I would also argue continually starting the show with my news is too

13:42.960 --> 13:46.520
big for me to do the show is something too familiar for me not to be

13:46.520 --> 13:50.400
contemptuous about yes yes there's a lot of there's a lot of intersections of

13:50.400 --> 13:58.520
familiarity in this equation so yeah Alex freaks out he's just screaming how

13:58.520 --> 14:01.760
he wants to quit sure but I'm here to tell you we're gonna we had to get back

14:01.760 --> 14:04.720
in the new studio today we weren't quite ready to launch it's okay not blaming

14:04.720 --> 14:12.840
the crew that's okay time ready to go and to prepare my broadcast because

14:12.840 --> 14:16.600
here's the deal I'm not just gonna sit here and put this information out and

14:16.600 --> 14:26.520
just have it nothing happened I'll quit today because we have all the evidence

14:26.520 --> 14:31.400
of what the enemy's done and I don't know why people don't have an instinct

14:31.400 --> 14:37.320
to victory but it's incredible it was bleeped out he said no one gives a shit

14:37.320 --> 14:44.200
he is very mad I like he is pretty mad I I do I mean there's something there's

14:44.200 --> 14:50.720
something weirdly noble about the tenacity he has because every other

14:50.720 --> 14:54.400
human being I think on the planet would at a certain point go like well I've

14:54.400 --> 14:59.680
seen every other major news organization release huge information and then change

14:59.680 --> 15:04.680
the world mm-hmm and I think I've done that literally every day for my entire

15:04.680 --> 15:11.200
career and not once have I changed the world yeah perhaps it is me yeah maybe

15:11.200 --> 15:17.360
my radar is busted maybe I can't tell what's big news maybe it's me maybe I

15:17.360 --> 15:23.720
should look a little bit harder at the stories I cover nope nope nope it's

15:23.720 --> 15:30.280
everybody else's fault forever gotta get so mad the end everyone else's fault

15:30.280 --> 15:34.200
always and one of the things I really love about his broadcast style when he

15:34.200 --> 15:39.920
gets into these moods is like he doesn't say what the news is yeah why would it

15:39.920 --> 15:47.440
it's too big you can't handle it I enjoy that busy being petulant I enjoy that

15:47.440 --> 15:51.760
because it's really the tell that this is performance yeah on some level yeah

15:51.760 --> 15:54.920
like I think he's really mad there's something that is definitely pissing

15:54.920 --> 15:59.960
him off for sure and it's probably financial and maybe the staff so I would

15:59.960 --> 16:03.440
imagine it has something to do with lawyers probably lawyers the staff

16:03.440 --> 16:07.460
probably also is incompetent and not not doing the job that he needs them to do

16:07.460 --> 16:12.080
yeah but it he's not that mad about what this big news is he's clearly still

16:12.080 --> 16:17.800
using this like this breakdown lashing out as a way of like anybody who's

16:17.800 --> 16:21.480
watching oh they'll tell people that he's saying he's gonna quit on air no

16:21.480 --> 16:24.680
it's him being like use it there's something else pissing him off I'm gonna

16:24.680 --> 16:29.240
use it in my speech today yeah yeah what am I talking about what's the big news

16:29.240 --> 16:36.480
no one cares I shouldn't even say it probably at least when I call other

16:36.480 --> 16:41.880
people that are influential they care and look into it and put it out I call

16:41.880 --> 16:44.960
Paul Watson with this oh he's busy out on a date or something I'm not mad at

16:44.960 --> 16:48.200
Paul he already wrote like five articles today it's just that I don't have the

16:48.200 --> 16:52.120
people I don't have the infrastructure I don't have anything and we can have the

16:52.120 --> 16:56.720
keys to put Lucifer into the pit of hell no one would care they'd be busy get

16:56.720 --> 17:01.120
their fucking nails done if I were Paul I would not appreciate the way Alex

17:01.120 --> 17:09.960
talks about him he seems professional oh man weird weird to have to work with

17:09.960 --> 17:14.360
that guy yeah it's almost like he lashes out at the people around him as well as

17:14.360 --> 17:20.920
the audience on a constant basis yeah yeah like he's a child almost yeah we

17:20.920 --> 17:26.200
get to the big news sure Alex does eventually let it rip what the story is

17:26.200 --> 17:34.200
and it is bullshit you understand ladies and gentlemen we have the smoking gun of

17:34.200 --> 17:39.120
what did the power outage 100% it was the Department of Energy and their order

17:39.120 --> 17:44.600
to keep the power off you understand we have that and no one gives a damn I I

17:44.600 --> 17:49.560
quit then screw this whole frickin place man I mean this is just all out of

17:49.560 --> 17:57.200
control unbelievable we have released so many smoking guns so much proof Joe

17:57.200 --> 18:02.480
Biden is on TV on CNN saying Gigi ping is doing a good job invading Hong Kong

18:02.480 --> 18:07.600
and running giant death camps fine if America wants that then frickin have it

18:07.600 --> 18:13.000
if you want your power turned off by the Department of Energy then enjoy it I'm

18:13.000 --> 18:22.800
gonna run some tapes I'm not even sure let it all burn then I mean we can't

18:22.800 --> 18:28.160
even admit aborting babies is murder so we don't deserve to have power

18:33.440 --> 18:42.000
I'm gonna lead you into the next okay Trump did win but it's a setback I'm

18:42.000 --> 18:46.520
still gonna lead you in it nope yeah everyone dies all this emotional

18:46.520 --> 18:52.400
outburst and this childish pageantry yeah but he's still able to say frickin

18:52.400 --> 18:55.760
he's still able to recognize he's on the radio and he doesn't want to get fine

18:55.760 --> 19:00.600
totally so I find this a little false yeah so also it appears that Alex is

19:00.600 --> 19:03.680
very mad about a document from the Department of Energy that he's been

19:03.680 --> 19:07.400
shown and I would guess that he hasn't read this document he claims that it's

19:07.400 --> 19:10.640
smoking gun evidence that the power outages in Texas were intentional which

19:10.640 --> 19:13.680
is why he's putting on this shamefully childish display of fake rage at the

19:13.680 --> 19:17.200
start of the show we'll get into the document as Alex covers it but at this

19:17.200 --> 19:21.200
point let me just sum things up to say that Alex is entirely wrong about it

19:21.200 --> 19:25.960
that's not hard no that's not hard to believe no but it does it does like the

19:25.960 --> 19:29.760
the level to which he's wrong about it makes all this outburst really really

19:29.760 --> 19:35.840
funny what I do appreciate about all of this is there is you can't deny that

19:35.840 --> 19:40.960
being your own boss is great right sure I mean he technically said I quit yeah

19:40.960 --> 19:46.800
exactly like that kind of outburst you just get that if you work for someone

19:46.800 --> 19:51.680
else and Wolf Blitzer is not going on TV on election night being like shit I

19:51.680 --> 19:55.840
don't even know what the results are I quit let's let's imagine that Alex did

19:55.840 --> 19:59.040
have a boss but he had such a good contract that they just couldn't get

19:59.040 --> 20:03.520
him out of it like firing him would require paying out ten years it's

20:03.520 --> 20:07.200
something ridiculous if he did that and he was yelled I quit on air and I was

20:07.200 --> 20:14.480
his boss would be like he said it he said he's gone he's gone I accept your

20:14.480 --> 20:19.800
letter of resignation immediately that's the other good thing about not having a

20:19.800 --> 20:26.520
boss means anything exactly so like this is a smoking gun sure there's another

20:26.520 --> 20:30.200
smoking gun and then there's another there's so many Alex has so many guns

20:30.200 --> 20:37.120
okay this is smoking gun stuff and then I've got a bunch of other big giant

20:37.120 --> 20:44.920
smoking guns but I'm too angry to do the show right now I am too damn angry to do

20:44.920 --> 20:50.200
this broadcast right now and there's a lot of other stuff going on so I'm gonna

20:50.200 --> 20:54.040
just I've got to go find my stack of news from yesterday I got to do a lot of

20:54.040 --> 20:58.640
stuff around here sure I watch somebody walk out oh no you've got the stack

20:58.640 --> 21:03.280
well I'll go get it myself but I'm not even bitching anymore I just can't do

21:03.280 --> 21:07.080
this six seven days a week and just with the public like zombies everywhere just

21:07.080 --> 21:10.580
like walking into globalist machine-gun fire and then that weird reanimated

21:10.580 --> 21:14.440
corpse Biden's stumbling around up there just all of it just it's just it's a

21:14.440 --> 21:18.960
joke because people are unconscious from watching TV and playing on their phones

21:18.960 --> 21:25.320
all day ah that's it yeah that's the problem yeah the public yeah hmm he's

21:25.320 --> 21:30.120
having a bad day yeah yeah you know I can't help but feel like I've been there

21:30.120 --> 21:35.240
before and what comforts me all the time is when I just go oh no I'm just an

21:35.240 --> 21:39.360
asshole yeah you know like everybody else is asleep and everybody no no I'm

21:39.360 --> 21:43.120
just being a dick my bad guys I'm an asshole I just I'm having a bad day I

21:43.120 --> 21:49.000
didn't like you know some I got too overcharged for something totally maybe

21:49.000 --> 21:52.440
I'm taking it out on the people around me subconsciously I'm sorry and you tell

21:52.440 --> 21:58.040
them and they're like you know what I get it yeah it happens and then you're

21:58.040 --> 22:02.040
just like we got a de-escalate for Alex it's an essential piece of his

22:02.040 --> 22:08.680
showmanship dwelling in that place he's having a bad day yeah and that means

22:08.680 --> 22:13.080
everyone's got to die yeah people are unconscious from watching TV and playing

22:13.080 --> 22:16.400
on their phones all day it manipulates all the dopamine receptors where people

22:16.400 --> 22:21.520
think that's the real world and the real world they're all like this and I just

22:21.520 --> 22:24.760
don't want to be around this anymore maybe Bill Gates is right just kill

22:24.760 --> 22:29.000
everybody but use a neutron bombs at least and kill them quick man don't

22:29.000 --> 22:33.560
mutate them and torture them and dumb them down but Bill Gates get a deal with

22:33.560 --> 22:38.960
the globalists and start neutron bombing the public just neutron bomb everybody

22:38.960 --> 22:42.720
then we don't kill the earth and the humans are gotten rid of baby he's right

22:42.720 --> 22:46.480
maybe I should go work for Gates and just come up with a neutron bomb plan I

22:46.480 --> 22:50.960
know Bertrand Russell had one before they call it a neutron bomb do you know

22:50.960 --> 22:57.280
anything about neutrons the answer how to start over you know God did it so I

22:57.280 --> 23:01.200
guess there's imitating God maybe I should just salute Bill Gates right now

23:01.200 --> 23:06.080
on there pledge allegiance to him nobody else cares do it at least he actually

23:06.080 --> 23:13.920
wants to run something it's me the devil do it I have the giant news but no one

23:13.920 --> 23:18.400
no one cares of course I'm serious no one cares maybe I freak out maybe I cut

23:18.400 --> 23:21.760
a few fingers off with loppers and people and this is really important this

23:21.760 --> 23:24.440
will bring down the globalists here let me cut my pinky off oh now you pay

23:24.440 --> 23:29.280
attention the Department of Energy on record told Texas you can't produce more

23:29.280 --> 23:33.200
power I have the damn document with a direct link to them they'll just have

23:33.200 --> 23:38.960
Snopes say it isn't real hell we want to be able to pull it up in there probably

23:41.760 --> 23:45.800
so anyways I'm gonna go to rebroadcast for a while I'm gonna try to settle down

23:45.800 --> 23:53.520
and then I'm gonna come back and lay all this out for you so incredible it's

23:53.520 --> 24:02.680
incredible that is what wasn't a display that was a show that was a baby just

24:02.680 --> 24:07.000
man you know what suck it would really suck if his conspiracies were actually

24:07.000 --> 24:12.080
true oh yeah cuz that now the movement about these things are so beholden to

24:12.080 --> 24:16.880
him that like like the imagined like having to fall in line behind him Oh

24:16.880 --> 24:21.880
brutal oh this guy's onto something brutal this whiny little asshole you

24:21.880 --> 24:25.840
know you know thankfully he's not you know goes down in history for being a

24:25.840 --> 24:29.880
hero people who weather adversity you know when you think of Nelson Mandela

24:29.880 --> 24:35.320
and you think of being put in prison for all those years and then not just

24:35.320 --> 24:40.120
surviving through it but then going on to help found a fucking country for a

24:40.120 --> 24:45.080
real opportunity at equality but you write you read his speech yeah no one

24:45.080 --> 24:50.400
cares you guys imprison me for 25 years and I don't even know if I want to help

24:50.400 --> 25:00.600
any of you people I quit no one gives a shit about me Bishop Desmond Tutu's an

25:00.600 --> 25:13.200
asshole yeah yeah that's who I want to follow it to the noble noble leader yeah

25:13.200 --> 25:17.640
so I think part of his anger is coming from a place of like he wasn't on this

25:17.640 --> 25:21.520
sooner cuz like this document was available before and he could have been

25:21.520 --> 25:26.400
covering the story at this way before and said he had the sort of childish oh

25:26.400 --> 25:30.880
it was the windmills narrative and what have you I think I think that's where a

25:30.880 --> 25:36.600
little bit of this anger comes from before I went live on air I got a bunch

25:36.600 --> 25:43.280
of extra news that I would already was told by a very close person to me and I

25:43.280 --> 25:50.120
dropped the ball on Monday and just I've been told by inside sources in Texas

25:50.120 --> 25:54.720
power plants that the feds ordered them not to increase power I should have

25:54.720 --> 25:57.560
followed up on that I already knew there was those agreements I already knew

25:57.560 --> 26:00.360
about those documents I should have gotten the current ones I should have

26:00.360 --> 26:03.920
found out well let me see the directive instead I just went and poured another

26:03.920 --> 26:11.960
glass of wine and set a fire in the dark and then son of a bitch a whistleblower

26:11.960 --> 26:16.000
inside Department of Energy contacted someone that works here and said why is

26:16.000 --> 26:20.720
Jones not covering this no one else is and I read it 20 minutes for I went on

26:20.720 --> 26:23.140
air and I already knew all that was real we went and checked it's on the

26:23.140 --> 26:26.560
Department of Energy website and it was like being punched in the chest and the

26:26.560 --> 26:32.440
stomach over and over again to read for sure they raped us for sure they're

26:32.440 --> 26:40.720
doing it I am so freaking pissed man I can't take much more of these people

26:42.720 --> 26:48.160
and the way it's you sound like the demons all slimy the way it's written is

26:48.160 --> 26:52.840
all slimy what is wrong with this man I don't know I'm not sure exactly what the

26:52.840 --> 26:57.120
definition of slimy documents are but I guess for Alex it's when the document

26:57.120 --> 26:59.880
says the opposite of what you need it to say and so you have to argue that when

26:59.880 --> 27:05.040
they say yes they really mean no exact is slimy is super slimy super slimy

27:05.040 --> 27:09.240
also I think that I think thug thinks it's slimy Dan I think Alex is really

27:09.240 --> 27:13.800
using the term whistleblower too loosely here is a publicly available document on

27:13.800 --> 27:17.120
the Department of Energy's website so I would say that this is a tipster if

27:17.120 --> 27:20.480
anything well maybe someone who's doing Alex's work for him I don't know maybe

27:20.480 --> 27:24.200
somebody who's just been to that website it's not a whistleblower no the document

27:24.200 --> 27:30.040
in question is titled order number 202 dash 2 1 dash 1 it's four pages long so

27:30.040 --> 27:34.040
there's no way I believe Alex read it and it's really easy to find and if you

27:34.040 --> 27:38.560
go do do find it yeah what you'll read is an order that is designed to increase

27:38.560 --> 27:42.000
the electric capacity of the Texas power grid in order to deal with the emergency

27:42.000 --> 27:46.280
that the state is going through sure on February 14th quote the Electric

27:46.280 --> 27:49.540
Reliability Council of Texas an independent system operator whose

27:49.540 --> 27:52.960
service territory includes 90% of the electric customers in the state of Texas

27:52.960 --> 27:57.820
filed a request for emergency order under section 202 C of the Federal Power

27:57.820 --> 28:02.840
Act the beginning of the document lays out how ERCOT had foreseen the possible

28:02.840 --> 28:06.800
issue and they quote this weather event is expected to result in record winter

28:06.800 --> 28:11.040
electricity demand that will exceed even ERCOT's most extreme seasonal load

28:11.040 --> 28:15.700
forecasts to try to adjust for this ERCOT attempted to maximize energy

28:15.700 --> 28:19.400
generation by doing things like having the Railroad Commission of Texas put out

28:19.400 --> 28:23.640
an emergency order that quote specified increasing the priority of gas supplies

28:23.640 --> 28:28.360
to ERCOT generators one of the main things that this order is about is that

28:28.360 --> 28:32.160
the electricity generation that they were needing to engage in would almost

28:32.160 --> 28:36.640
certainly not be possible quote without violating federal air quality or other

28:36.640 --> 28:41.200
permit limitations so ERCOT appealed to the Department of Energy to get an order

28:41.200 --> 28:45.040
allowing them to work outside those regulations due to the emergency

28:45.040 --> 28:49.880
situation right on page two of the order it says quote given the emergency nature

28:49.880 --> 28:53.280
of the expected load stress the responsibility of ERCOT to ensure

28:53.280 --> 28:57.560
maximum reliability on its system and the ability of ERCOT to identify and

28:57.560 --> 29:02.280
dispatch generation necessary to meet the additional load I have determined

29:02.280 --> 29:06.200
that the additional dispatch of the specified resources is necessary to best

29:06.200 --> 29:11.160
meet the emergency and serve the public interest for purposes of FPA section 202

29:11.160 --> 29:16.560
C okay so the document Alex Jones is saying is them saying you can't have

29:16.560 --> 29:21.160
more power is them saying yes you can have more power with some limitations

29:21.160 --> 29:25.760
well sure I mean you can't destroy the earth right yeah the order is the acting

29:25.760 --> 29:29.000
secretary of energy replying to ERCOT saying that they have permission to

29:29.000 --> 29:33.520
break regulations up to a point sure yeah yeah yeah the order literally says

29:33.520 --> 29:37.920
quote ERCOT anticipates that this order may result in exceedance of emissions as

29:37.920 --> 29:42.360
well as wastewater release limits to minimize adverse environmental impacts

29:42.360 --> 29:46.080
this order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within

29:46.080 --> 29:50.360
the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes that's great it's

29:50.360 --> 29:54.600
pretty simple this is just an order where ERCOT asked for permission to

29:54.600 --> 29:57.920
wiggle around some regulation in order to be able to meet the increased demand

29:57.920 --> 30:01.520
of the energy emergency the Department of Energy replied that they could do so

30:01.520 --> 30:04.800
but that wiggle room only existed for the purposes of re-establishing

30:04.800 --> 30:08.120
reliability of the power grid they couldn't just flout all federal

30:08.120 --> 30:12.640
pollution regulations but some be less rigidly enforced given the human need

30:12.640 --> 30:15.320
that existed yeah we don't want to destroy the earth but people are

30:15.320 --> 30:19.000
freezing to death so let's find a better place than find a way to make this work

30:19.000 --> 30:23.960
exactly there's nothing here honestly it doesn't sound like which is why Alex is

30:23.960 --> 30:28.000
doing this high school drama club play about how serious and smoking gun it all

30:28.000 --> 30:31.320
is it's actually a document that says the opposite of what he claims it does

30:31.320 --> 30:36.280
and because that is the case he has to claim that it's slimy this is the level

30:36.280 --> 30:39.600
of work that he's doing and it really makes you wonder why he doesn't just

30:39.600 --> 30:43.800
quit like it's it's this is nothing I don't know cuz he's his own boss I guess

30:43.800 --> 30:49.200
slimy slimy start all over again anyway I don't think he's even read it so I

30:49.200 --> 30:52.280
don't I wouldn't expect him to understand some of these like dynamics

30:52.280 --> 30:56.360
and all of this yeah but I think that he realizes like I don't know if I can

30:56.360 --> 31:01.200
really even fucking explain this to the audience in a way yeah it's gonna make

31:01.200 --> 31:06.800
them motivated this might be too hard for me yeah better call Tucker oh boy I

31:06.800 --> 31:11.680
can get more done if I call a bunch of influential people I know and tell them

31:11.680 --> 31:14.320
to look into this and let them break it I don't care about breaking it and then

31:14.320 --> 31:17.720
it will actually get have an effect instead the audience is great but I say

31:17.720 --> 31:20.960
so much stuff people just hear it and just think oh that's another thing Alex

31:20.960 --> 31:25.080
just said no it's not it's whatever happened to plan B smoke and God I ever

31:25.080 --> 31:33.720
saw to quote Robert Duvall in network it's a big titted head okay I mean this

31:33.720 --> 31:39.880
thing would hurt them so freakin bad I hate the New World Order I can't stand

31:39.880 --> 31:44.560
Bill Gates I can't stand Warren Buffett I can't stand Ted Turner I can't stand

31:44.560 --> 31:52.400
Barack Obama I can't stand them anymore I want them off my back now you mothers

31:52.400 --> 31:58.360
and then I sit there and I read exactly what I was told by my family that works

31:58.360 --> 32:03.920
in these damn plants that they're ordered to go at zero or quarter power

32:03.920 --> 32:09.160
under the frickin federal government because Biden put them back under the

32:09.160 --> 32:16.760
son-of-a-bitch two weeks ago now we all knew that did we I feel like we did not

32:16.760 --> 32:20.000
know that no and I don't know I read this document I died I don't I still

32:20.000 --> 32:24.560
don't know it yeah man you know I here's my pitch for Alex and I mean this is

32:24.560 --> 32:28.320
gonna sound crazy all right but he's sick of being under the backs of sure

32:28.320 --> 32:35.560
Bill Gates Warren Buffett Ted Turner for some reason uh-huh join the socialist

32:35.560 --> 32:38.800
buddy we want to try and get rid of these rich people and remove their power

32:38.800 --> 32:43.520
come on man no get rid of them let's go cuz socialists are working for Ted

32:43.520 --> 32:48.560
Turner they don't just don't know it oh well how about this all this what if Ted

32:48.560 --> 32:53.520
Turner here's here's my cell here's my cell back to you Alex yeah what if Ted

32:53.520 --> 32:58.400
Turner thinks we're working for him but we're actually working for our own goals

32:58.400 --> 33:04.080
using his money and power that he thinks he's bought us with another possibility

33:04.080 --> 33:07.960
would be moved to Antarctica okay now that's also a good one

33:07.960 --> 33:14.640
Alex you can also go to Antarctica so one of the features of Alex's coverage

33:14.640 --> 33:18.320
of this document from the Department of Energy is one of those

33:18.320 --> 33:22.480
strategies he uses a lot I call it making things up oh that's a good one

33:22.480 --> 33:27.000
and guess what's in the document the Department of Energy told Texas under

33:27.000 --> 33:33.200
federal law you'll be prosecuted unless you exhaust outside power supplies first

33:33.200 --> 33:37.960
there's no mention of prosecution the relevant part of the order that Alex is

33:37.960 --> 33:41.920
talking about is as follows quote consistent with good utility practice

33:41.920 --> 33:45.720
ERCOT shall exhaust all reasonably and practically available resources

33:45.720 --> 33:50.000
including available imports demand response and identified behind the meter

33:50.000 --> 33:55.200
generation resources selected to minimize increase in emissions to the

33:55.200 --> 33:58.800
extent that such resources provide support to maintain grid reliability

33:58.800 --> 34:03.360
prior to dispatching these specified resources this makes total sense and

34:03.360 --> 34:06.680
Alex is just writing a story about it to make things seem more nefarious when in

34:06.680 --> 34:09.920
reality this is very much a document that is the Department of Energy giving

34:09.920 --> 34:14.920
ERCOT a fair amount of leeway and trying to keep the system online frequently in

34:14.920 --> 34:18.360
the document you see it made clear that if the determination of what is

34:18.360 --> 34:23.880
necessary is that they need to put on more save lives now yeah save lives now

34:23.880 --> 34:28.480
the determinant the determination of when it's necessary to put on all these

34:28.480 --> 34:34.280
other things that's at the discretion of ERCOT yeah that is not that's that's

34:34.280 --> 34:41.600
left up to them yep and so like behind the meter generation resources for what

34:41.600 --> 34:47.600
it's worth is like solar and batteries and stuff like that so I don't know I

34:47.600 --> 34:52.200
just don't I don't I don't see I don't see what he's saying I don't find this

34:52.200 --> 34:55.600
very compelling at all no Texas always had more power than anybody we should

34:55.600 --> 34:59.440
supply before Obama came in the states all around us remember that our grid

34:59.440 --> 35:03.720
supplied much of the country that's what we were proud of it remember the US

35:03.720 --> 35:06.400
under Trump got to where it was the biggest supplier of energy in the world

35:06.400 --> 35:10.120
for the first time since the 50s again this is just something Alex is making

35:10.120 --> 35:13.680
up the power grid in Texas specifically exists in such a ways to not supply

35:13.680 --> 35:17.400
power to other states to avoid interstate energy sales regulation from

35:17.400 --> 35:20.760
the federal government someone's the pretend persona that Alex has should

35:20.760 --> 35:25.200
really understand that dynamic well and be proud of it also Alex is just

35:25.200 --> 35:28.480
reporting something Trump lied about and pretending it's real Trump basically

35:28.480 --> 35:31.880
lied in his State of the Union speech about how for the first time in 65 years

35:31.880 --> 35:38.120
we're net exporters of energy but that's not true no anyway prices for energy

35:38.120 --> 35:43.520
you're going up oh well yeah I imagine so Reuters Texas wholesale electric

35:43.520 --> 35:48.760
prices spiked more than 10,000 percent amid outages and what does this little

35:48.760 --> 35:53.080
sweet document show that I'll show you the print of the next segment they had

35:53.080 --> 35:59.440
to first only buy from outside sources including available imports and demand

35:59.440 --> 36:04.200
response you look those terms up that means demand response is a term meaning

36:04.200 --> 36:08.040
outside power when you don't have enough demand response is a key term means you

36:08.040 --> 36:13.280
buy from available imports these are all lawyer terms once again I think that

36:13.280 --> 36:18.200
one's just an economics term well making things up because he knows that his

36:18.200 --> 36:21.600
audience doesn't care and they're never gonna check on any why would they demand

36:21.600 --> 36:25.560
response according to Alex's lawyer speak for that means you got to buy

36:25.560 --> 36:30.040
outside power he knows this because he looked it up yeah this is made up out of

36:30.040 --> 36:34.000
thin air yeah demand response is an energy efficiency strategy that involves

36:34.000 --> 36:37.820
giving customers the ability to adjust their electricity usage away from peak

36:37.820 --> 36:41.760
hours by doing things like offering cut rates at other times when the burden on

36:41.760 --> 36:45.500
the electric grid is lower or putting small tariffs on power during peak

36:45.500 --> 36:49.120
periods this Department of Energy document is saying that in addition to

36:49.120 --> 36:53.180
using available reserves demand response strategies should be employed where

36:53.180 --> 36:56.360
possible to maintain the functioning of the power grid oh so you mean

36:56.360 --> 37:01.460
incentivizing people to spread out the usage of power yeah oh when possible yeah

37:01.460 --> 37:05.800
I was I'm fairly certain that you did just say buy all your power from China

37:05.800 --> 37:10.160
sure it would be easy for someone to hear me make this correction of Alex and

37:10.160 --> 37:12.680
say that I'm just nitpicking and fact-checking him pointlessly but

37:12.680 --> 37:16.520
there's a really serious phenomenon that I'm trying to illustrate here Alex Jones

37:16.520 --> 37:20.640
constantly pretends to know things he has a consistent pattern of just making

37:20.640 --> 37:24.120
up definitions of words and details about news stories and then pretending

37:24.120 --> 37:27.160
that the thing he's making up is the product of research or investigation

37:27.160 --> 37:31.420
it's important to recognize that he does this about the small details of his

37:31.420 --> 37:35.680
day-to-day conspiracies in the same way he does with the larger worldview level

37:35.680 --> 37:40.400
conspiracies his workflow is essentially like walking watching a shitty improv

37:40.400 --> 37:45.440
show rooted in terrible racist politics he uses headlines and words he skims and

37:45.440 --> 37:49.000
stories as the suggestions from the audience that he takes on any riffs a

37:49.000 --> 37:52.520
scene out of it I would implore anyone who takes him seriously to consider that

37:52.520 --> 37:55.800
dynamic and to critically engage with the things he's saying you'll almost

37:55.800 --> 37:59.680
always find him fabricating details about the stories that he's covering in

37:59.680 --> 38:02.640
order to make them fit his predetermined narrative and worldview which he

38:02.640 --> 38:06.800
absolutely wouldn't need to do if he wasn't full of shit as for the

38:06.800 --> 38:10.040
skyrocketing prices of energy some consumers are seeing that is being

38:10.040 --> 38:13.200
reported in reputable outlets and it does appear that some of this is going

38:13.200 --> 38:17.000
on the Public Utility Commission of Texas is opening an investigation into

38:17.000 --> 38:20.240
possible price gouging and I would guess that if they find companies that were

38:20.240 --> 38:23.480
engaging in that then the customers will not be responsible for paying those

38:23.480 --> 38:28.400
outrageous rates there's one thing to keep in mind however a small number of

38:28.400 --> 38:31.960
people in Texas use a company called gritty to provide their electricity

38:31.960 --> 38:36.680
which operates on wholesale prices most people use providers who have fixed

38:36.680 --> 38:40.720
rates but going through a company like gritty actually saves people money on

38:40.720 --> 38:44.480
their electric bill generally the downside is in a situation like this

38:44.480 --> 38:49.800
their rates are not fixed and they can skyrocket even so I would guess that

38:49.800 --> 38:53.920
these people won't be stuck with these exorbitant bills and the solution will

38:53.920 --> 38:59.480
be reached I I don't I just I find it hard to believe that but I don't know

38:59.480 --> 39:03.200
yeah I mean I don't know at this at this point in time it's safer to assume that

39:03.200 --> 39:08.360
people are going to get fucked over in some massive fashion possibly possibly

39:08.360 --> 39:14.280
but I I would I would guess that there will be some forgiveness yeah yeah but

39:14.280 --> 39:18.760
something but the examples that you see are these like really really high bills

39:18.760 --> 39:21.920
and the ones that I've been able to see and someone could correct me if I'm

39:21.920 --> 39:26.760
wrong but the ones that I've been able to find being reported are wholesale

39:26.760 --> 39:31.680
prices okay which are not the majority of electric users right in the state of

39:31.680 --> 39:35.960
Texas most people have fixed rate and they're obviously their prices will go

39:35.960 --> 39:40.720
up too but not per like the right right right they will need to use more

39:40.720 --> 39:44.060
electricity to heat their house because it's colder outside right yeah but they

39:44.060 --> 39:51.680
won't you know that's just a natural phenomenon you know and like I mean

39:51.680 --> 39:57.360
just price gouging is illegal yes that's going on people will get to the bottom

39:57.360 --> 40:02.520
I will help yeah so Alex you know he's got this document that he's lying about

40:02.520 --> 40:07.600
yes he feels really excited about this lie he's pretty pumped about it and he's

40:07.600 --> 40:13.920
like you know what these fucking people in Congress in Texas and our governor

40:13.920 --> 40:19.520
they need to lie about this document too oh no and all Ted Cruz has got to do to

40:19.520 --> 40:26.000
change the subject all Greg Abbott has to do to redeem himself all John Corn

40:26.000 --> 40:30.240
has to do is come out and read this on air and it's game over by the way I've

40:30.240 --> 40:32.880
had my problems with Ted Cruz but I think he's a good constitutionalist

40:32.880 --> 40:37.480
Ken Kuhn is like going out to get a cheeseburger in Texas it's an hour and

40:37.480 --> 40:41.440
45 minute flight his daughters were going down there why do I care if he

40:41.440 --> 40:43.880
flew down there with his daughters to get out of this hell when it turned out

40:43.880 --> 40:48.080
his power was off my powers was off a bunch my water just came back today most

40:48.080 --> 40:53.000
folks still don't have water now you're there out of school why not go Mexico

40:53.000 --> 40:57.200
see we live by Mexico folks we go down there but I'm not even defending that

40:57.200 --> 41:01.480
how is that the news how is he horrible and the Democrats are all oh look he

41:01.480 --> 41:05.640
doesn't care about you he didn't want the lockdowns he didn't want to wear the

41:05.640 --> 41:09.340
mask it's not like he's for a lockdown he's caught getting out of one ladies

41:09.340 --> 41:12.720
and gentlemen Alex Jones with a master class and intentionally missing the

41:12.720 --> 41:17.800
point yep yep yep remarkable I think the the point could very easily be made that

41:17.800 --> 41:22.120
he doesn't see that as something very difficult to do because he too is rich

41:22.120 --> 41:25.920
could be could have something to do with that could be could be one of those

41:25.920 --> 41:30.760
things where rich people don't really understand why poor people get mad yeah

41:30.760 --> 41:34.880
and I think that it's a it's a really interesting way that Alex engages with

41:34.880 --> 41:40.200
Ted Cruz and his responsibilities as an elected official yeah yeah as opposed to

41:40.200 --> 41:46.560
the responsibilities of other enemy yeah you know it's weird just because you

41:46.560 --> 41:53.200
don't need to be there doesn't mean you're sure so Alex is mad at ERCOT now

41:53.200 --> 41:56.560
I should say that he doesn't know that it's the Electric Reliability Council of

41:56.560 --> 42:00.640
Texas well he doesn't really know what it is he doesn't he thinks he seems to

42:00.640 --> 42:06.000
think that ERCOT is like basically Enron oh okay I get what you think it's a

42:06.000 --> 42:11.800
company yeah of course he does yeah it's weird and I'm just reading it made me so

42:11.800 --> 42:17.600
angry that I almost turned this desk over seriously man but you know what

42:17.600 --> 42:21.680
that's a normal response to learning they not just robbing our future they're

42:21.680 --> 42:24.680
blaming us they're starving people they're bankrupting all these

42:24.680 --> 42:28.480
communities they killed over 50 people and and then now they're gonna rape us

42:28.480 --> 42:32.640
more and are telling us permanent blackouts because the feds put ERCOT in

42:32.640 --> 42:37.120
control because you can't have the state managing it the feds put ERCOT the feds

42:37.120 --> 42:42.000
put ERCOT in control Alex has no idea what that is well he seems to think it's

42:42.000 --> 42:45.600
like a power company as opposed to being the management entity for Texas's power

42:45.600 --> 42:49.560
grid which is run by a board of directors that's overseen by the Public

42:49.560 --> 42:53.920
Utility Commission of Texas and the state's legislature the Public Utility

42:53.920 --> 42:58.040
Commissioners responsible for overseeing ERCOT are directly appointed by Texas's

42:58.040 --> 43:02.240
governor there could almost be no system imaginable where the state would have

43:02.240 --> 43:05.600
more direct control over the power system other than one where the state

43:05.600 --> 43:10.440
itself runs all the power plants itself which I can't imagine Alex advocating

43:10.440 --> 43:14.760
for no no no Alex knows nothing about the subjects he's covering and he's just

43:14.760 --> 43:18.080
making up a story to tell the audience that fits the show's larger themes and

43:18.080 --> 43:22.280
narratives none of this is based in reality at all yeah outrageous also you

43:22.280 --> 43:26.120
don't get to you don't get to care he doesn't get to care you already did the

43:26.120 --> 43:29.800
coronavirus thing where you denied all of that shit do you don't get to be like

43:29.800 --> 43:34.280
oh how dare they do this now now fuck off it's remarkable how everything is a

43:34.280 --> 43:39.600
conspiracy shit yeah anyway Alex gets back to this document and this is this

43:39.600 --> 43:44.040
is kind of I guess one of the other reasons I'm in a nice mood beyond the

43:44.040 --> 43:47.300
sort of slap happiness and sleep deprived ness cuz he's talking about the

43:47.300 --> 43:50.600
docks he's talking about a document yeah and I always like it when we can get

43:50.600 --> 43:55.680
ground you like the dock yeah in the ERCOT region that's Texas the

43:55.680 --> 44:00.200
generating unit specified resources that this order pertains to are listed on the

44:00.200 --> 44:05.240
order two zero two dash two one dash one resource list as described below and

44:05.240 --> 44:09.320
it's Oh hydroelectric and it's all this it takes them a week to turn a coal

44:09.320 --> 44:14.160
plant up didn't let him do that so Alex is reading this part of the document

44:14.160 --> 44:17.040
that he's skimming and it should come as no surprise but he's just making shit up

44:17.040 --> 44:21.100
the resource list that's referenced in that Department of Energy order is

44:21.100 --> 44:25.040
available and it's easy to find it's just a list of power generation plants

44:25.040 --> 44:29.680
in Texas that are relevant to the order each plant is listed in the third column

44:29.680 --> 44:34.720
in the spreadsheet is the type of energy that they use okay literally zero are

44:34.720 --> 44:38.120
solar or windmills or hydroelectric because that's not what the order

44:38.120 --> 44:41.800
pertains to it doesn't seem like those would be important no particular one

44:41.800 --> 44:47.320
these are all natural gas lignite bituminous coal or distillate fuel oil

44:47.320 --> 44:51.280
power generators which are being given special permission to operate in ways

44:51.280 --> 44:55.480
that would exceed environmental rules specifically only when doing so would be

44:55.480 --> 44:59.160
needed to maintain the reliability of the grid Alex hasn't read the actual

44:59.160 --> 45:02.880
document nor has he seen this resource list he's literally just making up what

45:02.880 --> 45:06.280
he thinks the story is then repeating that to his audience as a fact that's

45:06.280 --> 45:12.120
what he does yeah it makes up stories he's a storyteller yeah also this should

45:12.120 --> 45:18.200
make it more than abundantly clear we have an order saying that these evil

45:18.200 --> 45:22.240
power companies can destroy the earth in order to save lives but all the

45:22.240 --> 45:26.520
renewable energies are just like yeah you guys keep on going like it seems it

45:26.520 --> 45:31.200
seems very obvious that one of these is a serious polluter destroying the world

45:31.200 --> 45:36.400
and the other one they're like okay well you guys are fine mm-hmm yeah so Alex is

45:36.400 --> 45:42.200
you know again it's really confused about about ERCOT and what have you and

45:42.200 --> 45:47.280
the relationship with the federal government the feds are in charge man a

45:47.280 --> 45:50.840
lot of people are confused as to how this happened mm-hmm we're gonna come

45:50.840 --> 45:54.440
back and read all this for you it's really bad right here it's really really

45:54.440 --> 45:58.280
bad but the point is the feds are in control the feds wouldn't let them up

45:58.280 --> 46:02.080
the power till the power grid was going down and then limited what they can do

46:02.080 --> 46:05.720
and then sat back and said Texas is a bunch of idiots a bunch of hay seeds

46:05.720 --> 46:12.320
well I'm watching he-haw right now I'm aware no Joe Biden go take me over Joe

46:12.320 --> 46:17.040
Biden knows how to cook a possum oh yeah

46:17.320 --> 46:23.120
I'm not sure that's what's happening I'm fairly certain that I have heard many

46:23.120 --> 46:29.840
calm comments on Biden's ability to cook possum mm-hmm the jury's out on it from

46:29.840 --> 46:34.640
what I've heard sure some people like it some people don't yeah be just above

46:34.640 --> 46:39.120
board and totally clear any kind of like Texan bashing that's going on I think is

46:39.120 --> 46:43.640
wrong yeah I think it's misguided counterproductive yeah at least to the

46:43.640 --> 46:49.440
extent that that is going on I am I don't know what extent it is I have not

46:49.440 --> 46:53.880
really been exposed to much of it myself sure I imagine if I spent more time on

46:53.880 --> 46:58.360
Twitter maybe I would have seen some dumb comments yeah get him out but

46:58.360 --> 47:03.120
whatever that said what Alex is doing is trying to take valid criticisms about

47:03.120 --> 47:07.400
how Texas their power grid is operated and then he turns that into people

47:07.400 --> 47:11.200
saying that Texans just watch he-haw all day and cook possum he doesn't have a

47:11.200 --> 47:14.240
response to the arguments about the grid because he doesn't actually even

47:14.240 --> 47:17.680
understand the conversation the people are having not even a little bit but he

47:17.680 --> 47:20.640
can get his audience personally offended if he makes the whole thing about how

47:20.640 --> 47:24.000
the coastal elites think people in the middle of the country are stupid that's

47:24.000 --> 47:27.800
pretty much the tactic that you see being employed here it's infuriating I

47:27.800 --> 47:33.480
do not appreciate that he is talking about a problem that is almost entirely

47:33.480 --> 47:39.560
the result of a state desiring more than anything else for the federal government

47:39.560 --> 47:45.120
to get out of their fucking business and then to blame the feds for being in

47:45.120 --> 47:50.840
their business yeah I mean I think I think that I think that there's a piece

47:50.840 --> 47:55.120
of it that you can probably blame on the organizational structure short of the

47:55.120 --> 48:00.560
disconnection from the interstate yeah sales of energy but also like I think

48:00.560 --> 48:03.800
that you also have to be very careful with that because of how severe this

48:03.800 --> 48:08.280
storm is like oh totally like even in ideal circumstances there would have

48:08.280 --> 48:13.120
been power outages like it 100% perhaps not to the extent that it you know we

48:13.120 --> 48:18.480
have seen sure and maybe not as severe as we've seen but a storm like that in

48:18.480 --> 48:22.760
Texas is something that is just a recipe for there's going to be a lot of trouble

48:22.760 --> 48:27.960
sure sure I am I'm just saying that if the reports of them being that close to

48:27.960 --> 48:34.680
having no power for months are true right that is 100% look there are gonna

48:34.680 --> 48:39.840
be power outages they happen here they happen everywhere and it can be dealt

48:39.840 --> 48:45.360
with but if you have a system that is like well we were a James Bond moment

48:45.360 --> 48:51.480
away from fucking never having power for the next year then yeah you done fucked

48:51.480 --> 48:55.200
up in the planning somewhere along the line yeah and it's it's really tough to

48:55.200 --> 49:05.080
say if that problem is essentially related to the non interstate energy

49:05.080 --> 49:11.080
sales it's just unrelated mismanagement or something it's highly possible I

49:11.080 --> 49:14.200
don't know enough to say for sure but I think that those things are important to

49:14.200 --> 49:18.000
tease out sure before you make too much of a judgment but it does seem like

49:18.000 --> 49:24.120
whatever it is it's something yeah yeah I mean at the very least it would be

49:24.120 --> 49:32.720
hard to imagine if there was some sort of unified or greater area of power

49:32.720 --> 49:38.040
control where it wouldn't be able to be transported effectively much much better

49:38.040 --> 49:42.760
to the point where the we would have a better response time at the very least

49:42.760 --> 49:48.920
you know it may be yeah but who knows for now all we do know is that Alex

49:48.920 --> 49:53.960
over prepares indeed for his show that sounds true I want to be totally clear

49:53.960 --> 50:00.440
with you I massively prepared for the show I have one two three four five six

50:00.440 --> 50:04.240
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen

50:04.240 --> 50:08.520
stacks of news that I was a friend over and read and I've not even hit can't

50:08.520 --> 50:12.200
believe he counted all the way like one story a segment and they go coming up is

50:12.200 --> 50:19.240
this no no no no I will not sit here and watch the Department of Energy override

50:19.240 --> 50:24.240
Trump's executive orders and tell Texas they couldn't increase power when I have

50:24.240 --> 50:32.840
the smoking gun I just want to I just want to see this all over the news I

50:32.840 --> 50:36.920
want to see them go to prison got bad news yeah that's gonna be trouble yeah

50:36.920 --> 50:42.160
it's probably not gonna happen yeah good luck buddy so Alex is personally

50:42.160 --> 50:46.880
offended because this is about Texas yes of course you know yeah and what he

50:46.880 --> 50:50.200
wants you to know is the Texas what about you look at me I am looking

50:50.200 --> 50:55.640
straight on right on the eyes Texas what about it those people take action and

50:55.640 --> 51:02.600
Alex might have the worst example that he uses okay there's a mistake that this

51:02.600 --> 51:06.640
operation comes out of Texas there's a mistake Kennedy got his head blown off

51:06.640 --> 51:10.240
down here people are ready to take action down here ladies and gentlemen

51:10.240 --> 51:12.840
I'm not defending what happened to Kennedy I'm just saying the new oh what

51:12.840 --> 51:18.520
with a lot of fire and they take our kindness as weakness because they're

51:18.520 --> 51:22.480
stupid because they haven't studied history and they have no idea about

51:22.480 --> 51:29.160
people dedicated to an idea dedicated to their family dedicated to God dedicated

51:29.160 --> 51:35.040
to war to defend it if need be why did you say look Texicans Texans will

51:35.040 --> 51:39.160
fucking kill the president we'll do it right fucking now that's weird I thought

51:39.160 --> 51:44.840
it was a right now I guess I guess if there's one thing I know about the South

51:44.840 --> 51:49.340
it's that they murder presidents dad huh this this adds a wrinkle to the

51:49.340 --> 51:56.960
conspiracy I guess yep yep this is interesting it's not the mob is not the

51:56.960 --> 52:02.440
Russians it was not a single lone actor it was the lone star state George HW

52:02.440 --> 52:10.240
Bush Connecticut yeah yeah yeah I don't know this could be a tough one to sell

52:10.240 --> 52:13.820
do you think it's a coincidence that infowars comes out of the same state

52:13.820 --> 52:18.400
where Kennedy was killed what I don't think it is I don't think I was hoping

52:18.400 --> 52:24.840
it was a good no it's not Ted Cruz's dad did it no Alex Jones's dad did it he was

52:24.840 --> 52:30.200
a CIA dentist oh shit yeah shot him with a tooth exactly the magic bullet was

52:30.200 --> 52:34.160
actually a no it was an exploding tooth it was a dune situation yep totally

52:34.160 --> 52:42.600
that's dr. Jones's calling card so Alex goes to calls and not a lot of these are

52:42.600 --> 52:48.620
worth even mentioning although I will say that this next call is probably the

52:48.620 --> 52:54.920
saddest I've been listening to Alex in a long time nobody with my three kids I

52:54.920 --> 52:58.760
live close to the Memorial City Mall right in the suburbs right in the thick

52:58.760 --> 53:02.080
of this whole thing and I can just want to say thank you to you guys because

53:02.080 --> 53:06.240
there is not a chance I would have gotten through this with my myself my

53:06.240 --> 53:10.520
wife my three kids without two things first thing the water filtration system

53:10.520 --> 53:15.660
is incredible anybody listening please please get prepared you do not want to

53:15.660 --> 53:22.320
be a victim to this government to this squeeze bank info wars and Alex and this

53:22.320 --> 53:26.200
entire crew because every day you guys get uncomfortable and you have the

53:26.200 --> 53:30.320
uncomfortable conversation and you teach us here on the ground to be

53:30.320 --> 53:34.320
uncomfortable and to talk to people and to have the uncomfortable conversation

53:34.320 --> 53:38.480
and the reason why I let you so much much much so much Alex is you're real

53:38.480 --> 53:42.280
you stay when you make mistakes you say when something got by you and when the

53:42.280 --> 53:47.360
Q thing and you're just a real info wars is as real as it gets in America and I

53:47.360 --> 53:51.380
can tell you from listening to you guys from my generator power this week you

53:51.380 --> 53:55.560
kept my connection to humans you kept my connection to God Alex and I'm telling

53:55.560 --> 53:59.460
you I have been freezing my butt off me and my family in 40-degree weather all

53:59.460 --> 54:03.240
week long but I can promise you every morning when I wake up I was going to

54:03.240 --> 54:07.800
band on video waiting for your reports because you guys keep our connection to

54:07.800 --> 54:12.440
God and our human connection well that's exactly what John John the boom

54:12.440 --> 54:15.920
I'm ready said doesn't matter Jones you blew up earlier that's real looking for

54:15.920 --> 54:20.240
red blood and that's it all I've got is I'm real oh boy

54:20.240 --> 54:24.640
Wow that just bummed me out so much like everything that dude was saying is so

54:24.640 --> 54:31.600
wrong Wow just brutal just oh that is that's just so it's the uncomfortable

54:31.600 --> 54:36.320
conversation I don't know but that that guy has just enumerated a crime like

54:36.320 --> 54:42.680
what he is just described is somebody so destroying his mind mm-hmm that he is

54:42.680 --> 54:49.280
enthralled to the point of death the idea that in a in a disaster no I will

54:49.280 --> 54:53.920
say that this is one of the situations where some of Alex's products actually

54:53.920 --> 54:57.880
probably be quite useful like I take less issue with this guy saying I bought

54:57.880 --> 55:03.760
a water filter like hey man hey how about that it paid off yeah yeah so that

55:03.760 --> 55:09.120
I take less issue with yeah but the the idea that in a disaster in this in this

55:09.120 --> 55:13.700
scenario that he's in he goes to the generator to try and find Alex's videos

55:13.700 --> 55:19.960
to keep his connection with humanity and God is just dark yeah that is a dark

55:19.960 --> 55:24.120
thought yeah that is a dark thought especially when like okay your

55:24.120 --> 55:28.800
connection to humanity just quit earlier in the show no shit your humanities your

55:28.800 --> 55:32.720
connection to humanity said fuck this good Bill Gates should neutron bomb

55:32.720 --> 55:37.040
everybody I mean it just it just makes you like you think about all the

55:37.040 --> 55:40.320
horrible shit that's happened in the past and you're like why would people

55:40.320 --> 55:44.880
follow that guy and you're like oh people follow any old asshole apparently

55:44.880 --> 55:48.560
yeah I believe the expression they used to say in Missouri was it takes all

55:48.560 --> 55:54.720
kinds yeah it takes all kinds yeah so why would anyone listen to a 13 year old

55:54.720 --> 55:58.480
Pope and then you get that guy and you're like well yeah I guess believe

55:58.480 --> 56:01.600
whatever you want man so I gotta ask you I don't know I don't know a lot about

56:01.600 --> 56:06.640
this 13 year old Pope mm-hmm is that the young Pope was that that HBO show no no

56:06.640 --> 56:11.600
no that was a that was what what's his face I don't know British dude was he the

56:11.600 --> 56:15.960
type who told his audience to prepare kill lists yeah actually he was oh he and

56:15.960 --> 56:20.320
Alex have that in calm I believe you ladies and gentlemen I don't have words

56:20.320 --> 56:24.280
to describe to you how serious the times are I know you already know that and I'm

56:24.280 --> 56:27.200
not saying be violent either because that'll be misconstrued and used against

56:27.200 --> 56:32.720
us and the people we go after are just minions they don't count but they don't

56:32.720 --> 56:40.040
count the globalist and the people Bill Gates controls need to know in not a

56:40.040 --> 56:45.640
threatening way they're assaulting us they need to know that we're aware of

56:45.640 --> 56:49.560
what they're doing and that God is going to hold them accountable we're gonna

56:49.560 --> 56:53.600
pray for God to bring vengeance upon them and that as they officially assault

56:53.600 --> 56:58.000
us as they come after us that we reserve the right to defend ourselves he said

56:58.000 --> 57:01.920
threateningly I don't shoot my mouth off I'm not mr. big badass you know talk

57:01.920 --> 57:06.800
about I'm a big leader of the military and all this I'm not I just I can't sit

57:06.800 --> 57:11.480
there and lie to you and tell you that you're not being assaulted and so like

57:11.480 --> 57:15.120
Santa Claus you should be researching who's been naughty and who's been nice

57:15.120 --> 57:19.880
who's gonna get cold they're stalking and who's gonna get little bicycle or

57:19.880 --> 57:27.280
toys or candy so that's where we are we'll be right back stay with us your

57:27.280 --> 57:31.480
calls are straight ahead so Alex talks a lot about this idea of making kill list

57:31.480 --> 57:34.920
yeah and like I don't know I I don't know if it would hold up in court or

57:34.920 --> 57:40.400
anything but I could see somebody like trying to kill Bill Gates or something

57:40.400 --> 57:46.200
and then being like I was advised that he was trying to kill everyone with a

57:46.200 --> 57:51.520
vaccine yeah and that we needed it was a defensive really he was attacking us

57:51.520 --> 57:57.880
yeah well who told you that Alex Jones every day simply every day I don't I

57:57.880 --> 58:01.400
don't know if it's like the kind of thing that he could get in trouble for

58:01.400 --> 58:08.560
legally but like spiritually or or just morally yeah he's doing everything that

58:08.560 --> 58:13.480
would lead someone to do the thing yeah just the thing hasn't happened yeah I

58:13.480 --> 58:19.720
would I would just say that it's time to write a sequel to miracle on 34th Street

58:19.720 --> 58:24.440
where Alex claims that Santa is making kill lists out of this naughty and nice

58:24.440 --> 58:30.120
list listen we all know it's in the white papers it's uh no I'm Santa Claus

58:30.120 --> 58:34.660
I'm real oh we know you're fucking real you're killing all of our children they

58:34.660 --> 58:40.880
got kill teams of reindeer going around and elves why is that nose so blood-red

58:40.880 --> 58:46.440
huh Santa yeah so we get another caller here and he actually brings up

58:46.440 --> 58:52.600
interesting point that I have an answer for there were people in Oklahoma without

58:52.600 --> 58:56.760
power freezing that you know cuz we got hit with the same storm you guys got hit

58:56.760 --> 59:02.440
with them and they're sitting in the cold freezing and we've got a National

59:02.440 --> 59:07.280
Basketball Association team called Oklahoma City Thunder and the whole

59:07.280 --> 59:12.000
arena the power you know they played their basketball game and that was all

59:12.000 --> 59:15.880
good and fun while people sat in the cold freezing that's what technocracy

59:15.880 --> 59:21.360
is is they go Oh downtown Austin stays open all air caught stays open but I'm

59:21.360 --> 59:25.360
in the dark for six days so some of the places that retain power during the

59:25.360 --> 59:29.000
Texas storm seemed a little bit strange but a lot of it's actually really easy

59:29.000 --> 59:32.720
to understand if you take the time to care a lot of it have to do with

59:32.720 --> 59:36.280
sections of the grid where essential services were located like hospitals

59:36.280 --> 59:41.040
being a higher priority than ones that say didn't contain hospitals sure this

59:41.040 --> 59:44.500
could easily create the impression that there was power in downtown Austin but

59:44.500 --> 59:49.240
not in outlying areas but if you look at the proximity of downtown to not only

59:49.240 --> 59:53.920
the Capitol building but also Dell Seton Medical Center all kinds of warming

59:53.920 --> 59:57.880
centers and st. David's Medical Center you start to understand how it might be

59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.720
impossible to retain power to those buildings without also keeping power on

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.400
for some 6th Street businesses that maybe you were like why are they why

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.600
do they have a light also it appears that you do correctly understand why

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.680
people are mad at Ted Cruz mm-hmm oh is the basketball being played but people

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.020
are done oh are you flying to Mexico but people are dying yeah there we go now

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.400
you get it and and to be fair I would guess a similar thing is going on in

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.520
Oklahoma City where the Thunder play at the Chesapeake Energy Arena which is

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.260
within walking distance of the county courthouse the county detention center

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:36.200
and st. Anthony Hospital as well as the entire University of Oklahoma Medical

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.080
Center complex including the Children's Hospital and the VA yeah but you know

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:45.800
that everybody needs to suffer equally sure I mean it's it's a pretty simple

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.360
explanation I just don't I don't understand why people get mad or

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.560
confused about things that are like they're pretty easy to understand well

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:58.120
because it would be hard fine so Alex has max Kaiser on and they just talk

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.680
about Bitcoin yeah Alex gets really mad about how he could have bought Bitcoin

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.840
when it was like five dollars and now it's over 50 grand well the thing is or

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:15.840
whatever it is max ten years ago offered him 10,000 Bitcoin and Alex is like how

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.960
much would that be now it would be a lot of money buddy I was like I missed the

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.720
boat oh you might have missed the boat there was one funny clip but I actually

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.200
wish I would have pulled this but max's whole interview is just who gives a

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.160
shit it's just talking about how great Bitcoin is sure and Alex being like I'm

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.800
ambivalent stop giving out your web address makes it sound like you're a

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:41.120
sponsor but when when Alex is talking about how much this Bitcoin would be

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.440
worth now makes some kind of joke about like oh that's why you've got to sell

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:53.600
these boner pills it was really dishy nicely done man yeah max geyser has a

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.680
freedom as you are the Eve that is kind of enjoyable but it also makes his

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.840
interviews not really all that worthwhile for our show but after he

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:10.760
leaves Joel Skousen comes in oh shit Joel Skousen is a mess yeah he is a

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:16.720
weirdo and I just have four clips of Skousen's interview okay that are four

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.600
reasons why you should not take Joel Skousen series all right the first is

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:26.800
that he also along with Alex seems to think that ERCOT is of like a federal

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.920
agency or a company all right they want to set themselves up as the Savior's I

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.440
think it's important Joel that you grew me the evidence shows that it was

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.240
federal mismanagement and control with ERCOT removing the state from the

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.840
process that took one of our best power systems and made it one of our worst no

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.640
I completely agree with you Alex why the federal problem the federal EDX but so

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:54.800
why like shouldn't you correct him if you know that ERCOT is a Texas specific

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.840
if you understand the dynamics at play you shouldn't go along with Alex saying

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.120
a literally the opposite I completely agree with you sure what it is that he's

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:09.880
saying is 100% so that's not good and I'm maybe just not going to go ahead and

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.840
listen to anything that Joel has to say about the the storm and the power grid

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.680
if he doesn't know this basic yeah yeah that would be that would be a problem I

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.240
don't think I would want to learn calculus from somebody who doesn't know

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.380
algebra now here's where it gets weird reason number two not to take Joel

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:34.160
Skousen seriously where do you think fossil fuels and oil comes from oh god

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:41.440
no personally yes I think it comes from God and he put them there about 10,000

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.720
years ago to trick us in the big line petroleum geologists now it's becoming

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:51.680
recognized that that oil is not fossil fuel what is it well I'm afraid I have

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.280
to get theological here this was part of the creation of the earth oh my god you

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.200
know the Lord in his creation actually put oil deposits look if fossil fuels

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.800
exist if you create oil from deteriorating animals and you look at

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.200
all of the trillions and trillions and trillions of tons of oil which would

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.880
only represent a tiny fraction of the decaying bodies of any dinosaurs you

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.640
would have had to have the dinosaurs a hundred feet deep all over the entire

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:28.800
earth plants marine life Wow dude this is what's up yeah no Dan carbon only

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.280
comes from all dinosaurs thank God when he was making the earth put oil down

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:39.520
there I swear to God yeah I swear Dan yeah I mean I would I would say I don't

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.440
know this is really narcissistic and I'm gonna go ahead and preface this by

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.760
saying I don't actually believe it okay but it's kind of fun to think about I

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.640
felt a little bit of resistance on Joel Skousen's part to say that oh yeah and

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:56.880
part of it I'm hoping is him being like god damn it Dan's gonna make fun of this

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:03.400
him being like well to answer that question I have to get the whole okay okay

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.840
so Joel thinks that God put oil down there for us to to use that's another

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:13.720
reason not to take him all too serious I just I just suppose that look I'm

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:19.760
religion blah whatever but you can't do that you know like a demonstrably

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:25.000
ridiculous thing you can't just believe like that you can wrong you can that's

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.560
wrong no no you can you're more than free to believe whatever you want to

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.520
believe sure however it will implicate how I view your beliefs in other

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:41.720
subjects no I would like that to be true as well unfortunately that is not true

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:48.440
for most people sure yeah like if you want to believe anything like that God

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.260
put oil in the middle of the world I think it's harmless belief unless you're

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:56.640
using that to argue against climate change there we go right I'm going to

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:01.600
use your belief that God put oil down there for us to use I'm gonna use that

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.880
to inform my view of your arguments about anthropogenic sure I'm a chair

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.560
sure I just I would just prefer if we had if there if okay holy books now have

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.860
to have footnotes that's my new rule if something is demonstrably true it's a

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.840
footnote in your book I get it you stole that new rule from Bill Maher is that

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:27.360
from fuck off I swear to God if it is I'll kill myself sounds like something

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.800
he would say he's all anti-religion and shit any other segment called new rules

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.640
I just don't want oh that well that fine yeah yeah fine I quit that's the joke

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:41.680
I'm old and I'm useless Dan why don't you go turn into fossil fuel

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:46.400
nicely done cuz I'm not a dinosaur and I'm still only six feet below ground so

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:55.400
where do you think fossils come from Oh God no hmm I don't I I'm you know what

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.720
fuck it Samson every whenever he pulled the temple down he made all the fossils

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:04.640
okay that's interesting yeah it seems like it was intelligently designed

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:11.840
exactly intelligently designed and I I'm you know I'm not even sure that you know

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.280
desire you know a lot of the fossils we find of those actually lived on the

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.200
earth it's very very possible this earth was created by layers from other

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.560
previous planets where these things are previously grown and and put together oh

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:30.860
boy this is some this is Camelot this is some project right oh yes and to be

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:35.600
honest like I knew that Joel Skousen was a bit of like he has some weird beliefs

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:41.440
in such a lot of like it comes from his his family anti-communist royalty yeah

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.720
yeah yeah of course everything is a fucking false flag to him strange ideas

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:52.240
about what communism is and is not but this is this is out of my I did not know

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:59.800
that the planet itself was a false flag from other planets it could be could

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.760
possibly be right other planets false flagging us with themselves these

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:10.920
fossils they look weird that's well okay that's from space man all right so I

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.920
will admit that there are millions of people who have dedicated their entire

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:19.200
lives to studying and understanding what fossils are and I could listen to any

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.560
one of them however they look weirder to me than those people do so guess what

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.080
God space God yeah but see here's the thing that you don't understand about

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.040
all those people study fossils yes it's all a scam do you study fossils because

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.880
if you did you would get into it and then someone would come and put you put

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.440
their arm around you and be like listen it's all from fucking space we're

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.400
scamming people with I gotta get into this yeah yeah that's why Indiana Jones

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.600
was so cool he knew it was all a scam that was predictive program yeah exactly

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:55.720
it's a perfect grip that's why you steal it from the thuggy cult yeah yeah so

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.680
yeah I guess fossils coming from space is gonna be another reason I'm not gonna

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.840
take Joel Scousum too seriously that would be a good reason now I think he

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:07.120
might also believe in divine alchemy of some sort this is this is also kind of

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.880
weird you know when you look at the chance of this orbit of this earth being

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:18.000
so perfectly designed and the tilted ears to have the perfect seasons and the

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.400
moon is in the perfect spot there's just no way that these things can happen by

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:31.920
chance this earth was a design divine creation and you know most Christians

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.640
believe in and they should all believe in the fact that the Lord has power over

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.080
the Intel over the elements meaning the elements are intelligence enough

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:47.360
intelligent enough to obey commands no no it isn't natural no that most know

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:52.240
what the rock and water poured out it wasn't a natural spring you know the

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.720
Lord can command that elements reform and form any element necessary because

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.320
God is in command of everything created and we're made the small image of God

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.880
we'll be right back way that way to throw it to break now that that is a

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.760
thought process that I appreciate if God can command the elements then the

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.600
elements must be smart enough to understand God yeah see now I didn't

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.000
think of that yeah I didn't think that the elementals could also obey or

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.520
disobey commands I suppose yeah I guess the the staggering

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:33.760
unlikelihood of life leads one to just decide arbitrarily that it must be fully

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.920
designed and also the Bible is literal yeah how could how could we have such a

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.440
perfect environment a perfect planet where massive weather events are

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.240
occurring almost regularly due to our fault where people are being destroyed

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.320
over and over and over again by droughts because they get a perfect amount of

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.040
water wherever they go on the problem the problem I'm guessing is that we're

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.720
not burning enough oil well carbon is good for the planet is what I was told

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.680
that's what I'm hearing we're carbon dioxide starved damn where's my buddy

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:09.640
Mark Moreno at when you this dude is strange yeah yeah and I was listening to

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:15.360
this I was like wow you're a much weirder dude than I think I I can kind

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.320
of see why you normally stick to weird geopolitics as opposed to some of these

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.160
yeah more esoteric beliefs because they're very strange they kind of make

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.480
you look like a project Camelot person to answer that I'm gonna have to get

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.760
the object theological oh well then I'm gonna have to leave sir if the question

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.000
is why is there oil and I have to get a theological to answer it goodbye yes it

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:48.640
was lovely speaking to you don't have an answer I mostly bring this up and show

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.760
this to be like all right Joel Skousen is somebody who Alex thinks is super

01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:00.820
credible very important source on like geopolitics like is Iran up to

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.560
something sure and he's also a person who thinks that God injected oil in the

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.880
world for us to find it maybe fossils come from outer space yeah yeah cuz

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.720
they're weird look like this is this is the level of expert that is hanging

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.520
around here right right beneath the surface and you're going to find them

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:23.280
saying things like this it's which is not to say that you can't have some out

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.800
their beliefs and not be you know like Jack Parsons everybody who trusted him

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.440
as an expert when it came to rockets and shit mm-hmm not when it came to

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:39.200
elementals not not true sex magic was not real yeah yeah it would be good if

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.160
you stayed in your lane stay in your lane now unfortunately his lane is also

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.760
bullshit that's a problem the difference between what lane you're in

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.720
yeah huh I don't know this was really interesting experience for me because

01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.440
you know you start out with Alex furious and just like I quit fuck this I can't

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.200
do this yeah this sucks fuck this place I hate info wars I want to quit yeah but

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.760
if he does start quite that bad you know we're eventually gonna get to I'm gonna

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.060
have to get theological to answer that question Alex you go along the path you

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:18.320
find out what's making him so mad and it's just lying about this Department

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:24.920
of Energy document yeah and you know he mellows out says some bullshit and then

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:28.840
you get Skousen and I think that this this illustrates two really essential

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:34.600
points one is that Alex lies like this document he's just making shit up about

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.000
it's just over and over again finding little things that he can use as like

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.880
like as if he's climbing up a mountain little handholds that he can find to lie

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.360
about exactly and then the second thing I think this illustrates is that like

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:53.540
people like Skousen are not reliable sources no no so even if they have the

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:58.680
pretense and the aura and the the the attempted facade of being like a serious

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.680
minded I look at the documents and you know I go where you know I I've read

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:08.600
Carol Quigley's book and I am left to assume that all Democrats are evil or

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.560
whatever the fuck like even if you put on that hat underneath that hat is a

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:20.240
dude who's weird yeah about fossils and let's never forget that patient zero for

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:26.280
kovat 19 was indeed Steve Pachannik true and he cured it with antibiotics mm-hmm

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:32.920
so and he rigged up this whole election as a sting operation against the

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.880
Democrats yeah and Alex just can't handle his truth nope nope nope a lot of

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.640
his experts are reliable he also arrested the Pope forgot about that

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.680
year that's true that's true there are a lot of exploits that are regularly

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:52.720
unmentioned despite their very bombastic nature yeah so anyway Jordan this has
