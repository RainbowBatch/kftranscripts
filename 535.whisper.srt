00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,080
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,840
I have great respect for knowledgefight

knowledgefight

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,720
saying we are the bad guys

Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,800
Hello Alex, I'm a 6-ton color, I'm a huge fan

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,840
I love your word

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm Jordan

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,400
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, drink novelty beverages

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,960
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,080
Oh indeed we are Dan

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,600
Jordan

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,080
Dan

32
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,880
Jordan Dan

33
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,960
I have a quick question for you

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,640
What's up?

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,600
What's your bright spot today?

36
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,280
My bright spot today, Jordan, is a combination of two of my great loves

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,360
As people who listen to the podcast regularly, eagle-eared listeners will know

38
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,760
Sure

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,800
Um, I have been on a little bit of a rice adventure

40
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,280
Mm-hmm

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,080
Um, mochi, certainly

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
The forbidden rice

43
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,400
That is un-forbidden

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,520
Yes, no, it's forbidden

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,640
Oh, it's still forbidden?

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,800
Oh, it's re-forbidden?

47
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,640
Shit

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Um, and another sort of, a little bit in the past love of mine, which is vinegar

49
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:39,920
Yes

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,440
The invariant of vinegar

51
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,280
I didn't know that you could, maybe you're supposed to put vinegar in rice when you're cooking it?

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,560
I did not know that either

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,200
I don't know if you're supposed to, but some people recommend that you do it

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,480
Oh

55
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:58,040
So I put some vinegar, some fancy garlic vinegar, in with some rice I was cooking last night

56
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,160
Alright, alright

57
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,200
Pretty good

58
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,920
Two great flavors that go great together, Dan

59
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
Yup

60
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,480
Can't be a hundred percent certain it was that much better

61
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,120
Meh

62
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,480
But it smelled like a garlic while it was cooking

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,280
Well, that's fun

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,680
Yes

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,480
That helps

66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:14,920
Yup

67
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
Yeah, there's no problem there

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,320
It felt like I was doing something

69
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,960
And that really counts for a lot

70
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,480
Yeah, I think cooking alchemy is a good feeling

71
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,880
Yeah, definitely, so I had a pretty nice time with that, making up some rice and vegetables last night

72
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,480
That's nice

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
Yeah, how about you?

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,560
Uh, Dan, my bright spot is that we are doing this episode at all

75
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Uh-huh

76
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,480
In a very short period of time

77
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,440
You're not fired

78
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,240
In a very short period of time, you turned around an episode which was amazing

79
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,160
Well, we've had a weird couple of days, kind of

80
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,200
Yeah

81
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,120
We set out to, the plan initially was, because I had kind of a strange schedule and a little bit of a

82
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,600
I need a little bit of a step back kind of feel

83
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,320
So I asked you to cover Friday

84
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,680
Yup

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
Two episodes of Friday

86
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,120
I put together an episode

87
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,640
You did

88
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,120
And we recorded it

89
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,160
Two hours

90
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,720
And it was okay

91
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,120
Yeah

92
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
It was thoroughly okay

93
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,200
It was a very interesting exploration of some guys on YouTube

94
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I gave it a shot

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah, I realized that there's like, you know, a lot of sort of monotony going on with Alex

96
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
And it would be a good time to take a little bit of a break

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,120
Sure

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,080
See something else

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,760
And I don't know if I'm really capable of finding new things anymore

100
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,680
Like I brought Alex and Project Camelot to the table

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
And I'm thrilled that those have worked

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,240
Yup

103
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,760
And Bill Cooper to some extent

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,600
But like some of my other efforts have not been great

105
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:42,840
There's been some trouble

106
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,560
And so I wanted to farm it out to you

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,240
And I think you found something, no spoilers

108
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,080
It's not possible to spoil it

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
It's already been spoiled

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,800
I was thinking we should just release it the way it was with a half hour that's recorded

111
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,720
And then two hours of dead silence

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,440
No, I mean it's not dead silence

113
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,040
And then call it Jordan crashed the car

114
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,760
Yes, Jordan

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Get away from the wheel

116
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,320
Yeah, exactly

117
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah, so we recorded it and somehow, you know, tech glitch

118
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,640
Yup

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,600
Something happened

120
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,320
There's audio of us talking for the first half hour

121
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,320
And then after that point, it's just the drops

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,920
That's almost like one of those coloring book prompts, you know

123
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,120
Like, hey, you guys listen to the first half hour of us talking

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
And then fill in the rest whenever you feel like you didn't

125
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,480
You know what we're gonna say

126
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Yeah, you got it

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,640
Try your, make your own knowledge fight

128
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,760
There's gonna be 20 minute stretches where there's nothing

129
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,200
There's no audio

130
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah, have a nice little chat

131
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
That's for meditating, that's where we do that

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Find you

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah, so

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,320
Center

135
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,640
So in a period of mere hours, you've put together another episode for us to release

136
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,520
By wiping away my failure

137
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
Only for us to share it for the rest of us

138
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
No one will ever know

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,920
No one will ever know

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, and you know, hey man

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
I don't want you to feel too bad

142
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,320
Well

143
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,480
Anything, it happens, these things happen and it's not your fault

144
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,640
I think the only problem really is that puts me at like a, what?

145
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,480
One out of every five episodes I do it disappears

146
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,840
That would wipe off a hundred episodes from our tally

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,120
So it's a good thing you run it

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Yeah, I'm more used to the sort of troubleshooting

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Knowing when something's wrong and that kind of thing

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,560
And I think that, you know, it's no big deal

151
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
I feel bad for the listeners and for you

152
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,040
Because, you know, you did bring something interesting to the table

153
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,680
And maybe, you know, maybe there's something that we'll dip back into later

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
But certainly not that episode

156
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,360
No

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,080
We can't redo it

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,120
We can't redo that one

159
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,680
No

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
No, that one was baffling enough as it is

161
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
Let alone trying to do it again

162
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,760
Yeah

163
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,160
Yep

164
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,120
Lost episode

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,680
Oh well

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,640
So Jordan, today we have an interesting thing to go over that I have scrounged up

167
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,040
Yes

168
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,920
Today we're going to be talking about October 16th, 2014

169
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,640
Double Down!

170
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
Oh shit!

171
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
Double Down on 14

172
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,640
What's a Double Down?

173
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,160
Like in a Blackjack table

174
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
Jesus Christ!

175
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,680
You have thought, you thought of that last night

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
Maybe this morning while I was laying in bed

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,680
There's no way I was supposed to pick up on that one

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,920
Yeah

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,320
Also bad advice, don't Double Down on 14

180
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,600
No, don't Double Down on a 14

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:31,840
No

182
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,680
Very bad Blackjack hand

183
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
Well, I guess it depends on what the dealer has

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,080
Eh!

185
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:44,240
But, yeah, so I decided I wanted to go back to a time before Alex was quite as,

186
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
I don't know, overtly amphetimined out

187
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,000
Sure

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,120
For, before the time of Trump, I wanted to get a little bit more of a taste of that

189
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,440
Sure

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,040
And I just sort of scrolled around randomly and I saw a name in the description of the episode

191
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm like, alright, here we go

192
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,120
And actually, I was listening to this, it is hauntingly appropriate

193
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,600
Really?

194
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,880
You're a witch

196
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,680
Yes, I think

197
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
We've done this too many times for you not to be officially a witch

198
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
Yeah, I think this might boost some of my credibility as a witch

199
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Either that or nothing ever, ever changes and it is all the same

200
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,440
Or everything is the reverse

201
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,080
Yeah, that's true

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
Of always the same

203
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,680
Yeah

204
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
So I'm excited to get down to business on this episode

205
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,600
But before we do, Jordan, we're gonna take a moment to say thank you to some folks who signed up

206
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,440
And are wonking it up

207
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,160
That's a good idea

208
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,640
So first, this is a two-named person

209
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,000
This is a very exciting, rare double alias

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,480
Okay

211
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,000
But they're both good, so I'm gonna allow it

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,320
Alright

213
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
The first is North Korean ballot boat

214
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
Hell yeah

215
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
Piloted by the skipper Roger Stone

216
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,120
And the other is private chef of Alex's wife's tennis partner

217
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

218
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm a policy wonk

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Thank you very much

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,280
Thank you

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
Next, Captain Details, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

222
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm a policy wonk

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,640
Thank you very much, person I'm not good at emulating

224
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,800
Next, Caitlin Dingo, girl, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,840
I'm a policy wonk

226
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,640
Thanks Caitlin

227
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,040
Thank you

228
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,600
Next, Nuttsack, father of Theo, Parker, and Tucker, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

229
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm a policy wonk

230
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
Thank you very much

231
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,480
Thank you

232
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,760
Next, Adrenochrome Annie, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

233
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,520
I'm a policy wonk

234
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,360
Thank you very much Adrenochrome Annie

235
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,480
Do you prefer adrenochrome or adrenochrome?

236
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,160
I prefer a drenachrome, I think dren has a nice little more dreadful feel to it, you

237
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
know what I'm saying?

238
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,160
It has a sort of phonem similarity, sound similarity.

239
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,880
It feels good.

240
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I prefer a drenachrome.

241
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Really?

242
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Why?

243
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
It seems classier.

244
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,600
Well yes, I see we have a, that clearly illuminates the differences between our personalities.

245
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Sure.

246
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,520
Next, Glitch the cat, thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk.

247
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm a policy wonk.

248
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Thank you Glitch.

249
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Thank you.

250
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,480
I'd like to say thank you to someone who is now a technocrat.

251
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,840
So thank you so much, Raptor King William the Impaler.

252
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,440
You are now a technocrat.

253
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm a policy wonk.

254
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Crikey mate, that's fantastic.

255
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Have yourself a brew.

256
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
How's your 401k doing, bro?

257
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,760
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

258
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,320
Let's just get down to business.

259
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,400
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

260
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,320
Why you pimps so good?

261
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
My neck is freakishly large.

262
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,600
I declare info war on you.

263
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,800
Thank you so much, Raptor King William the Impaler.

264
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,840
Yes, thank you very much, RKWI.

265
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,160
You don't go with a T. Never put the the in a...

266
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,660
I've never put a the in an abbreviation.

267
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,280
We can agree to disagree on that.

268
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Always.

269
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Put a...

270
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Nope.

271
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
What about that?

272
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
So what about...

273
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Articles never go in.

274
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,720
Okay, so Game of Thrones is GT?

275
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,880
Uh, yeah.

276
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Not got?

277
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,320
There's a reason O is lowercase in that.

278
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,720
O is simply there as a placeholder.

279
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,240
Everyone abbreviates Game of Thrones as GOT.

280
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
And maybe they should.

281
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Okay.

282
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Yep.

283
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Hey, Jordan.

284
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Let me ask you a question.

285
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
What's up?

286
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,560
Do you ever get spanked on your birthday?

287
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,200
You ever get birthday spankings?

288
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,520
Have I ever been birthday spanked?

289
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,320
I think I was birthday spanked one time as like a 11 or 12 year old.

290
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,960
And everyone immediately went, no, this wasn't a good idea.

291
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,680
That's gotta be really weird because like you didn't on your 10th birthday.

292
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,760
It's not like it happened up till then.

293
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,960
So it was just a new innovation?

294
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,820
It was very much like somebody at my birthday party had just heard of birthday spankings

295
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,600
and was real excited to try it out like, ooh, this will be a new thing.

296
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
And everybody stopped and was just like, no.

297
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
What is...

298
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
No!

299
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,640
I don't think I have ever, I don't think that spankings have ever been a fun thing in our

300
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
family.

301
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
I don't think it was ever playful.

302
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,520
No, that's probably, that's true of my family.

303
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Yeah.

304
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,160
But there are some people who are celebrating a birthday.

305
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,360
Okay, well let's spank the shit out of them.

306
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,160
I'd like to give them a little bit of a spanking by way of a podcast.

307
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,640
All wonks line up.

308
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Wait a second.

309
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,680
All wonks line up for the birthday spanking.

310
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,160
I think I might have gone down the wrong road with this setup, but earlier this week on

311
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,880
Monday, Pat had a birthday and wanted to say happy birthday to you, Pat.

312
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Oh, happy birthday, Pat.

313
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,760
Sorry we missed that on Monday, but I'm not great with inboxes.

314
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,600
So tomorrow, Greg G out in Cary, NC, North Carolina, it rhymes.

315
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Oh, G and NC?

316
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Yeah.

317
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
All right.

318
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Having a birthday.

319
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Happy birthday, Greg G.

320
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Happy birthday, G G.

321
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,280
I hope you're having a good one out there and I hope, Pat, you had a great one on Monday.

322
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Indeed.

323
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Happy birthday.

324
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Happy birthday.

325
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,000
Blow out those candles, make a wish.

326
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Spanks all around.

327
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,800
I was trying to transition to candle talking, so spanking, because I realized it's a little

328
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
weird.

329
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Well, what you gonna do?

330
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm gonna get into this episode.

331
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's a good transition.

332
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,160
Jordan, October 16th, 2014, what do you know was going on around that time?

333
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,440
What do you have a feeling?

334
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Let's see.

335
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:08,760
2014, I would have just woken up from a three-year sleep or a fugue state, if you will.

336
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,720
Rip Van Winkle over here.

337
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,520
So I was just welcoming awareness once again and I had moved to Bloomingdale, Illinois,

338
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,400
gorgeous one-bedroom apartment.

339
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,960
This episode is, shockingly, mostly about residential pricing in Bloomingdale.

340
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,360
All I'm saying is those are the only things I remember from 2014.

341
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,880
This is surprisingly right in your wheelhouse.

342
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,120
I may be a witch.

343
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Excellent.

344
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,960
No, in October, it was Ebola season.

345
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,840
It was during the middle of the period where there were a couple cases of Ebola here in

346
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,080
the United States.

347
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:54,120
The primary patient, the first patient that came into the United States, had passed away.

348
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,840
And we are right on the cusp of the second nurse who had treated him has been diagnosed

349
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,040
now with Ebola.

350
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,400
So we're remembering when a possible pandemic was averted.

351
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:17,640
We have done an episode, I think two years ago, about the first day when there was a

352
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,520
case in the United States and Alex's response to it.

353
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,480
And it's really interesting to take a little bit of a look and see what is going on a couple

354
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
weeks later.

355
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
Sure, sure.

356
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Absolutely.

357
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,640
I mean, did he go from there will be lone survivors back to there's no problem at all?

358
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
It's interesting.

359
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,840
So I would say his trajectory has a lot of similarities and a lot of differences.

360
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Yeah.

361
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,800
And that's what made this particularly fascinating for me.

362
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
So here we go.

363
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,560
We're going to start off with him talking about some sort of fear-ish narratives.

364
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,440
I'm your host, Alex Jones.

365
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:03,480
They are telling 911 dispatchers, Fox Television out of DC is reporting not to say Ebola over

366
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:11,360
the radio or when they're basically talking about a call that they're on.

367
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,440
We have Obama saying there's nothing to fear, that it's a low probability that an epidemic

368
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,960
will start in the U.S.

369
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,240
Even as we learn that the second nurse to contract Ebola traveled all over the place

370
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,920
on aircraft and that the plane was not even cleaned, that is wiped down.

371
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,280
They picked up the trash on the floor, but not a deep clean for five more flights after

372
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,920
she was on it.

373
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,060
Five more flights.

374
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,440
So this story that Alex is opening the show with about the 911 dispatchers not being allowed

375
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,560
to say Ebola on the radio is not from Fox DC.

376
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,000
Fox DC did run a story about it with the headline that Alex is reading, but that article is

377
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,680
just a link to the original story, which is from the New York Post.

378
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
The reasoning behind this- Trustworthy New York Post.

379
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,400
But the reasoning makes total sense.

380
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,320
There's tons of people who aren't first responders who listen in on emergency radio channels

381
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,960
and you could easily imagine how a panic could break out if every call that came in where

382
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,160
someone was worried that they had Ebola was misinterpreted by someone listening in as

383
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,660
a definite or probable case.

384
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,280
People would lose their minds.

385
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,640
You could really do some damage.

386
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,760
Did you know that words can have an effect in real life?

387
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
That's weird.

388
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,120
If you actually read the New York Post article, this is exactly what it's about.

389
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,260
A source speaking to the post said, quote, just like you can't say bomb on an airplane,

390
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,740
we can't say Ebola.

391
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,480
Back in the 80s and 90s, taking universal precautions meant someone had AIDS.

392
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,840
We weren't allowed to say AIDS then either.

393
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,920
Dr. Jay Varma, the deputy commissioner of the city department of health, gave some idea

394
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,240
of how many opportunities there had been for false panics to start.

395
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,300
Quote, we have now had about 133 calls since July concerning patients with possible Ebola

396
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,360
symptoms and all 133 were false alarms.

397
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,320
That's alarming.

398
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,900
Yeah, and people listening in could have taken any one of those 133 and tried to present

399
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,080
it as like, look, look at all these people, they're covering up all these cases.

400
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,000
It could be really dangerous.

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,240
You could definitely get into a fear mongering panic where somebody like Alex Jones convinces

402
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,480
you that you need to buy survival food.

403
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,640
Yeah, so from an emergency response perspective, I do see how it could be best practices to

404
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,080
use language that wouldn't necessarily be exploitable by people who may have ill will

405
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,800
and are listening in on your communication.

406
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,520
Right, which is unfortunate because, boy, it would be nice if we were just allowed to

407
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
say words.

408
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,860
Or even, let me even walk what I'm saying back.

409
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,920
It's not even necessarily people with ill will.

410
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,600
Some people could just get confused.

411
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,680
Just panic entirely, just already be paranoid.

412
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,920
So as for that nurse story, that was true, sort of.

413
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,800
It's true that she did fly the day before she was diagnosed with Ebola, but experts

414
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
don't believe that it was as big a deal as it sounds.

415
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,360
The first reason is that at the time of her flying, she wasn't exhibiting symptoms that

416
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,540
would put people at high risk, like vomiting.

417
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,160
Even so, Thomas Frieden, then the director of the CDC, was clear that, quote, she should

418
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,560
not have flown on a commercial airplane.

419
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,940
And he immediately put in place guidelines that anyone who had been exposed to somebody

420
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,680
with Ebola would only travel by way of controlled movement like private flights and chartered

421
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
vehicles.

422
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, immediate?

423
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Well, prior to that, this was just recommended by the CDC.

424
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,720
But after, quote, the agency would work with state and local authorities to enforce this

425
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
restriction.

426
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,480
I found a Washington Post article about this, and it seems to directly contradict Alex's

427
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,960
claims about there being five more flights before the plane was cleaned.

428
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,720
From that article, quote, the plane, Vinton, that's the nurse, traveled on, arrived in

429
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,480
Dallas at 816 p.m. on Monday and remained overnight because it was done with flights

430
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
for that day.

431
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,440
And then when we found out she had Ebola, we blew that shit to the moon.

432
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,280
We exploded it all over the fucking place.

433
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,200
After that, the plane received a thorough cleaning per our normal procedures before

434
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,800
resuming service Tuesday, Frontier said in a statement.

435
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,120
I was able to find the article that Alex is misrepresenting.

436
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,760
There was a piece in the Denver Post with the headline, quote, emails out to passengers

437
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,500
on five Frontier flights after Ebola patient flew.

438
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,920
As it turns out, the airline did send notification to the people who were on the same plane that

439
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,280
the nurse had flown on, but it wasn't because they hadn't cleaned it.

440
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,540
It was out of an abundance of caution.

441
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,740
The plane had been cleaned, but later the nurse was diagnosed with Ebola, and by that

442
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,960
point that anyone knew anything, the plane had already flown five additional flights

443
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,640
the next day.

444
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,280
Informing the customers is definitely the right thing to do in terms of making sure

445
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,520
everyone's informed.

446
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
Totally.

447
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,720
Even if you followed every preventative, appropriate step, it's still above board to tell people.

448
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Yeah, absolutely.

449
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,640
So they can make their own choices from a healthcare perspective.

450
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,720
Yeah, no, and not telling people would be a far greater scandal for you.

451
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,800
You know, if everybody found out a week later, they'd be like, fuck you guys!

452
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
It would be wrong.

453
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

454
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
It would be negligent.

455
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,880
This article points out that after this nurse was diagnosed, the plane was going to undergo

456
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,600
even further cleaning, quote, including replacement of seat covers and carpet in the vicinity

457
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,280
of the passenger's seat, but this still doesn't support Alex's all they did was pick up trash

458
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
narrative.

459
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Sure, sure.

460
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,160
I think he's just trying to scare people.

461
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,440
I think we should treat all diseases like the Velveteen Rabbit and just immediately

462
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,240
burn everything involved.

463
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Everywhere.

464
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,000
I think that might be going a little bit...

465
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The plane.

466
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Pendulum the other direction.

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The airport.

468
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Everything.

469
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The whole place.

470
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Uh huh.

471
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah.

472
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
All stocks and bonds in the airline.

473
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
We've seen what it's like to live through a pandemic.

474
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,520
We have not seen what it's like to burn everything to the ground in case one starts.

475
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,800
I'm just saying that we should go the other direction.

476
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
You make some interesting points.

477
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Yeah.

478
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I would love to live in a world where we still have a pandemic and then also everything is

479
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
burning.

480
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Great.

481
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,480
That would be, that would probably be an issue.

482
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
You're probably right.

483
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,520
So Alex is covering this news and I will say he has a classy take on things.

484
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,480
He's dealing with things in a really, just a newsman.

485
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:37,440
We are the Ebola vomit bag, the Obama, excuse me, Ebola toilet.

486
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,000
You know, memes are very, very powerful and that's why we've launched this contest that's

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,360
only running for another week to go to infoawards.com forward slash contest, print off the flyers,

488
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,080
hang them up, shoot video of it, send us the video, we'll post it and then a week later

489
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,960
on Halloween, I will announce the winner.

490
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,240
Hashtag Ebola contest.

491
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,560
Oh boy.

492
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Wow.

493
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,040
Hashtag Ebola contest.

494
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Wow.

495
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,160
Hashtag Ebola contest.

496
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,840
And it's contest, as best I can tell, is he has posters that are advertising for info

497
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,880
wars and you record yourself putting them up faces or something.

498
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
I think this is a weird contest.

499
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,040
I think it's just, Hey, could you be my street team?

500
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,760
I think what we've realized here is that Alex is paid by big disease in order to spread

501
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
disease.

502
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,400
Man, it's, it's really weird.

503
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,320
You would think that somebody engaging responsibly with the topics they were covering wouldn't

504
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,960
be like, Hey, let me try and use this as a cheap stunt meme promotional opportunity.

505
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,900
Here's a possible pandemic that could murder and incapacitate millions of people.

506
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,920
We need a contest to advertise my shit based on that.

507
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Yeah.

508
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
That's a good dude.

509
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Yup.

510
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,600
So, um, to Alex's credit or not, I'm not sure I'll let you decide.

511
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,160
He doesn't spend the entire show talking about Ebola.

512
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Well, that's nice.

513
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,280
He also gets around to some nonsense narratives about how Christians are under attack.

514
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Oh, that's good.

515
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,560
We have just absolutely over the top important news on the Ebola front, on the economic front,

516
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:24,680
on the second amendment front, on the police state front with Houston, literally trying

517
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,880
to intimidate churches and to not giving sermons that criticize transsexual, uh, behavior or

518
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,760
homosexuality and a lot of libertarian groups have been coming out.

519
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,260
And even though they are open to other lifestyles, cause the libertarians, uh, they are defending

520
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,400
these preachers because if you're going to have your right to live the way you want somebody

521
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:55,000
else has to have their right to live and, and, and, and speak as they see fit, flaming

522
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,600
authoritarianism pun intended out of the Houston mayor and the rest of them at best that's

523
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,920
wordplay suing churches.

524
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,600
This is what Europe and Canada are doing.

525
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,980
This is the model.

526
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,860
Everything you see with political correctness out of Europe and Canada is coming here.

527
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,720
They arrest preachers that criticize homosexuality.

528
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,640
So this isn't going to surprise you, but Alex is lying about this story.

529
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,760
I'm not surprised.

530
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,160
Here's what happened in 2014 Houston passed an equal rights ordinance that included protections

531
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,960
for members of the LGBTQ community in terms of housing, employment and what have you.

532
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,660
This was on the vanguard of the right wing panic about trans people in bathrooms.

533
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,840
So one of the hot button issues was that, uh, according to an article in the Washington

534
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,060
post quote, transgender people barred access to a restroom would be able to file a discrimination

535
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
complaint.

536
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Right.

537
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,560
It's worth noting that religious entities were also exempted from this ruling.

538
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,440
So they weren't even, so they weren't even involved, right?

539
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,360
A group of citizens filed a lawsuit aimed at repealing the ordinance as part of the

540
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,540
uh, and as part of that lawsuit, quote, city attorneys issued subpoenas to five local pastors

541
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,380
during the cases discovery phase.

542
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,300
These pastors were alleged to have connections to the people who filed the lawsuit and were

543
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,680
active in the effort to repeal the ordinance.

544
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,880
So the attorneys requested quote, all speeches, presentations or sermons related to hero.

545
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,620
That's the ordinance, the petition mayor, a niece, Parker, homosexuality or gender identity

546
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,740
prepared by delivered by revised by or approved by you or in your possession.

547
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
Sure.

548
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,920
The question that was being posed by these subpoenas were whether or not these pastors

549
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,960
were using their churches as political organizing grounds, which would put their tax exempt

550
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,400
status in jeopardy.

551
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,800
Since Texas exempt churches, quote, are not allowed to engage in partisan politics.

552
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,780
By October 16th, the day that Alex is here on air, controversy had been raging about

553
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,300
this and the subpoena was revised to just ask for quote, all speeches or presentations

554
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,320
related to hero or the petition prepared by delivered by revised by or approved by you

555
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,560
or in your possession.

556
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Right.

557
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,640
And as we know now that we live in the future, the government really cracked down on that

558
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,200
and churches were no longer allowed to advocate for political positions from the pulpit.

559
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,280
That would just be wrong, Dan.

560
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,820
Didn't you see so many churches across this country after Trump was elected?

561
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,460
Didn't you see them lose their five oh one C three status all over the place for advocating

562
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,920
for political positions?

563
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,360
I, it's just terrible.

564
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,800
Anyway, this is a complex topic that gets into a lot of those issues more than anything

565
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
else.

566
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,040
You know, you could make an, uh, an argument that there was overreach and over broadness

567
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,520
in terms of the subpoenas that were, uh, put out by the city attorneys.

568
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Oh sure.

569
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,380
I think that is a fair position you could take.

570
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,160
But Alex is reporting this as like they're suing these churches.

571
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,240
No, no.

572
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,960
Someone sued the city and the city is doing discovery.

573
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Yeah.

574
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,120
Anyway, he just wants to take this and uh, you know, he wants to boil it down into a

575
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,160
misrepresentation that's easier for his audience to understand and more importantly, be mad

576
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
about.

577
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Yeah.

578
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,400
Just trying to make it about fucking out of control PC culture.

579
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
It's nonsense.

580
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,760
It would be nice if Christ had lived and just been super cool because then maybe Christians

581
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,720
wouldn't constantly feel like playing the victim is the only way to deal with life.

582
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I don't know.

583
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,000
What if Christ was just a cool dude?

584
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,620
What if Christ was just like the Buddha and he got old and everybody's like, man, you

585
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,620
kicked ass.

586
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,620
Good work.

587
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,120
That would be great.

588
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,360
He uh, invented hang loose.

589
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Exactly.

590
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,760
First person to say cowabunga.

591
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,920
So Jordan, I gotta say one of the things I didn't expect, um, on this episode as I was

592
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,400
getting into it, because you know, Ebola is a pretty big topic and it certainly has mirrors

593
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,040
and echoes in our current, uh, COVID-19, uh, situation, but I didn't expect as a large

594
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,240
portion of this episode would end up becoming a movie review.

595
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,440
That I believe and did expect.

596
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Yeah.

597
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I was a little bit surprised.

598
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,400
Is he still on Oblivion?

599
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
No.

600
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Okay.

601
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,520
The movie review is about the movie Kill the Messenger about Gary Webb.

602
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Okay.

603
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,400
It's very personal for Alex because he apparently knew Gary Webb.

604
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,040
Oh, I did not know that.

605
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,760
Now, this might be a little too personal.

606
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Okay.

607
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,160
Alex seems to be dealing with some stuff after watching this movie and he might make a confession

608
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,320
that first of all, I don't believe is true, but if true proves that Alex Jones is the

609
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:37,200
worst fucking, uh, outlaw radio truth teller, whistleblower guy, listen to this bullshit.

610
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,320
I went and saw Kill the Messenger last night and I expected it to be a whitewash.

611
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,960
I expected it to imply that he killed himself and it was absolute truth because I remember

612
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,600
Gary Webb being on the show more than 10 times.

613
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,520
I had all these incredible conversations with Gary Webb off air.

614
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,560
He wanted me to build a website for him.

615
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,000
He sent me all these documents that the CIA had broken in his house a bunch to try to

616
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
get.

617
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,800
I was too busy making films and making babies with my wife.

618
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,400
He was, I remember he called back the last time I talked to him a few months before he

619
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,320
committed suicide and he said, Hey man, Alex, I thought you had the courage to put this

620
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
up and do something.

621
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,500
I said, yeah, there's thousands of pages of this stuff and a lot of this is court records

622
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
and stuff.

623
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,480
And I go, I guess I'll put it out because, well, I thought you've got balls.

624
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,840
I mean, these are epic conversations I have with Gary Webb.

625
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,880
Now a hit movie out about him and it was so surreal to be sitting there in the movie theater.

626
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,000
I ignored that guy and knowing his whole story and it was so accurate.

627
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,640
I am baffled by this movie review.

628
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,360
I think there's a small part of Alex that's pissed off that he's not in the movie.

629
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,920
And then second, it's very weird that he's like, yeah, you know what?

630
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,080
I had that dude giving me all this secret documentation that the CIA was trying to kill

631
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,440
him for having.

632
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,720
I was busy, I didn't do shit with him.

633
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,080
I was making babies with my wife, so I wasn't interested in those thousands of CIA coveted

634
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,280
documents that would blow the lid off of everything.

635
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,520
But come on guys, she's ovulating.

636
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,800
What am I going to do?

637
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,840
I do think this isn't true.

638
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,560
Like I think that his story is not true, but it's interesting the way he gets himself off

639
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,520
the hook for having not broken things.

640
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,960
Like, he's like, I was busy, I was making documentaries.

641
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,640
I was busy breaking other stories.

642
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,700
I didn't have time for this.

643
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,740
So let me ask you a question.

644
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,160
In the beginning, I thought I heard him say, I thought they were going to whitewash it

645
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,240
and heavily imply that he did commit suicide.

646
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,280
Which he did.

647
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,600
And then he said, which suggests to me that he thinks he didn't.

648
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
He did.

649
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Yeah, Alex thinks that he didn't.

650
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,120
But then later on, he said a few days before he committed suicide.

651
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Right.

652
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Okay.

653
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Yep.

654
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
All right.

655
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
So.

656
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Yeah.

657
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
Okay.

658
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,040
That might've just been Alex's like sort of subconscious sneaking through and being

659
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
like, you know.

660
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
You know he killed himself.

661
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
He wasn't murdered.

662
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Come on, man.

663
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,480
You know, one of the reasons I think this is all bullshit is this.

664
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I'm not even here bragging.

665
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,280
Oh my gosh, this show is important.

666
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:22,960
I felt incredibly guilty.

667
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,880
That I don't even know where that disk is.

668
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:33,000
That CD-ROM that I opened up and it was just, I don't know how to process all this stuff.

669
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,440
I need to tear apart our storage buildings and find that.

670
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,600
And then I don't even want to talk about how I had that disk because you're like killing

671
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,760
people over this stuff.

672
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,000
And then I went and searched last night when I got home, I went to bed and then I woke

673
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,680
up in the middle of the night and went and searched for like an hour at 3 AM, 4 AM.

674
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,860
And I couldn't even find one interview I did with Gary Webb.

675
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,160
Kind of makes me think maybe you didn't interview him.

676
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
I mean, I bet he did.

677
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,200
I could see that absolutely having happened, but like I wonder at a certain point, you

678
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,280
kind of got to wonder, it's like, did you imagine all of this?

679
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,320
Did you dream this?

680
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,720
Did you have a quiet conversation with Gary Webb in your head?

681
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Yeah.

682
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,260
You know, like you have the CIA to kill anybody who has all this information and like Alex

683
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,160
has the CD-ROM that Gary Webb had given him.

684
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,320
CIA was following him.

685
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,780
They wouldn't know that he made the handoff with Alex, absolutely.

686
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,400
But the CIA is like, fuck it, Alex is just going to lose it.

687
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Come on.

688
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,520
I mean, he's got a, it's in an AOL sheath.

689
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,680
We don't need to worry about this.

690
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,120
That fucking dude doesn't even have a file cabinet.

691
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,720
Look, I was surveilling him the other night.

692
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,600
He's just too busy fucking his wife.

693
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,800
They're trying to make babies.

694
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
I'm sorry.

695
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,360
He just doesn't have time to expose us.

696
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
It's not even like that disc.

697
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,280
It's not even in an AOL sleeve.

698
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,480
It's in a Moody Blues album cover that he is just, it's lost.

699
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,120
He's never going to find that thing.

700
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
16-bit floppy.

701
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,680
That's what he's got.

702
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,180
This is weird.

703
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
I don't know.

704
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,520
I put myself even in the foot shoes.

705
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
The foot shoes.

706
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
The foot shoes.

707
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Of Alex.

708
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I imagine.

709
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,640
When there was only one set of foot shoes.

710
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
That's when I was carrying you.

711
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,080
That's when I was carrying Gary Webb.

712
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:31,280
I feel like if there was a bone of authenticity in Alex's body, the second that the guy who

713
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:39,000
wrote Dark Alliance is giving you a CD of secret documents.

714
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,660
You drop everything.

715
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,920
This is a priority.

716
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,120
Do you remember when Snowden released shit?

717
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,280
Every news organization was like, okay, we're going to put 15 people on this.

718
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,080
We're all going to read every single one of these documents and we're going to write stories

719
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,480
about it immediately.

720
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,640
Greenwald wasn't like, I'm making Police State 2000.

721
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm busy.

722
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
I'm sorry, guys.

723
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm busy.

724
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I want to start a family.

725
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
I'm adopting kids.

726
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Yeah.

727
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah.

728
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
What am I supposed to do?

729
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,600
Have you ever tried to adopt kids in America from Brazil?

730
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,560
I don't want to shit on the idea of prioritizing family and what have you.

731
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
That's all good.

732
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Sure.

733
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,140
If you're somebody who fancies yourself an investigative journalist whose mission it

734
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:25,840
is to get to the bottom of the nefarious doings of the globalists, this behavior strikes me

735
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,640
as very out of character.

736
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,960
The tip of the spear was busy elsewhere, if you know what I'm saying.

737
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,440
That spear was a.

738
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,000
So there's a sense that I got from listening to this that like Alex seems to think that

739
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,840
that movie might be about him.

740
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,360
And then watching how they demonized him and how they tried to kill his name before they

741
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:56,040
physically killed him and experiencing a lot of this myself, it was a surreal, I've never

742
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:04,120
gone and seen a movie where from what I know, it was so incredibly accurate and so incredibly

743
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,320
sad.

744
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,000
And then I resonated with it because they always make it about the individual.

745
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,280
If they can't disprove your facts, they just demonize and destroy the individual themselves.

746
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,320
And I got a sick feeling in my stomach as I realized that the clocks just tick until

747
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,480
they come and shoot me in the head twice or plant drugs on me or shoot me at a checkpoint

748
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
or something.

749
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,140
And it just it made me sad to watch all the cowards, his editors and like you, you literally

750
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:41,040
said that you didn't have Jesus Christ, so sad for watching his cowards.

751
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,320
He gave all those documents to those editors and they didn't do shit with them.

752
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,920
They told him, we're not going to put those out.

753
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,360
He gave a CD-ROM to every one of his editors.

754
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
A little bit of an asshole.

755
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
A bunch of cowards.

756
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,960
A little bit of an asshole-ish review.

757
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,760
I mean, I was just out of, I was just doing a documentary.

758
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Sure.

759
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm not a coward.

760
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Yeah.

761
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Hey, look, I don't get into Shadowgate.

762
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Yeah, exactly.

763
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,560
Look, I don't get into that kind of deep shit.

764
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,240
Turns out that behavior has been pretty consistent throughout his career.

765
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,200
I think he might be faking a lot of this.

766
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,640
I think he might be.

767
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,240
So we get back to Ebola here and this clip to me was actually one of the more interesting,

768
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,440
the glimpses into how Alex operates in these circumstances.

769
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,120
The people that are supposed to be cleaning the aircraft are told that they can't wear

770
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,120
masks and gloves.

771
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,080
Aircraft coming in out of West Africa in some cases with vomit in them because it'll quote

772
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
scare people.

773
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,800
We're going to get to those articles in a moment.

774
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,920
Experts offer steps for avoiding public hysteria, a different contagious threat.

775
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,320
So we've been talking about the hysteria being a bigger problem than Ebola itself.

776
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,200
Well, now the New York Times is reporting on it today.

777
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,840
I just thought that the juxtaposition of those two stories is fascinating.

778
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,520
In the first one, Alex is claiming that vomit filled airplanes are arriving in the United

779
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,560
States from West Africa and not being cleaned, obviously trying to create the impression

780
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,960
in his audience's mind.

781
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,000
There are so many more cases of Ebola in the United States than were being told.

782
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Correct.

783
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,120
It's a narrative that can really only lead to people freaking out and behaving irrationally.

784
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Right.

785
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,720
But the New York Times says that freaking out in hysteria is just as bad as the Ebola.

786
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:25,120
And Alex, he's saying then that Infowars has been saying all along that public hysteria

787
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
is a bigger problem.

788
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,480
Don't freak out about this!

789
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,600
Ebola's everywhere, but freaking out is crazy.

790
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
How can he possibly not understand that everything he does exists only to heighten hysteria?

791
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Yeah.

792
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Thinking about how the border is wide open and vomit planes are arriving is not only

793
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,080
factually untrue, but it's also designed to scare people.

794
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,800
Alex understands that, and it's one of the things that he does on his show that I think

795
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,720
is incredibly abusive.

796
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,200
It's that trying to push and pull simultaneously in people's minds, and it's not good.

797
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,240
No, he's in a weird, almost experiment of...

798
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,480
His experiment to me of listening to his show would be somebody sitting in a chair strapped

799
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,760
down and every five minutes just a little jolt is given to the emotional center of their

800
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,560
brain, and you just have to sit there for four hours and feel this constant emotional

801
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
pressure.

802
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Yeah.

803
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah?

804
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Yeah.

805
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
In my experience, I don't think...

806
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
That's not wrong.

807
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
It's not that far off.

808
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,400
I disconnect from it so it doesn't affect me as much listening to it.

809
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,120
You removed that little part of your brain.

810
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,160
I imagine that that part of the brain would be very antagonized if you believed anything

811
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
he said.

812
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
Yeah, totally.

813
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,560
But since I don't, I'm a little bit immune.

814
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,960
You got rubber on your brain.

815
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Yeah.

816
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,040
Alex is kind of right in some sense that public hysteria is a very serious concern when it

817
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,120
comes to public health matters.

818
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,360
It's just that in this case, he's one of the most hysterical voices you can imagine.

819
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
It's nonsense.

820
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,280
No, and it's cruel.

821
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,100
It's cruel to be like, hey, hysteria is crazy, and you're gonna die!

822
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Like okay, man.

823
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
But maybe not.

824
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
You won't die.

825
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Maybe not.

826
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
The human's killing you!

827
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,100
But maybe not.

828
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,100
Bad!

829
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,240
Now hold on.

830
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
What's up?

831
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:17,400
I thought, listening to the original episode about this period of time and the Ebola situation,

832
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,480
and listening to the beginning of this episode, I thought, you know, this is horrible, this

833
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,480
is irresponsible, and then I think it's kind of tasteless to have this Ebola meme contest.

834
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,920
Right, right, right, right.

835
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,480
But I didn't think it was that weird.

836
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,880
It's not weird enough for Alex Jones.

837
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
Here's where it gets weird.

838
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Okay, good.

839
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,000
They'd first said that it was her fault and she shouldn't have done it, but now it's admitted

840
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,780
in NBC News that an Ebola patient who contacted the CDC before a flight agency says was told

841
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,640
that she could fly even though she was an Ebola nurse, and even though she told them

842
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
she had a fever.

843
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,000
By the way, I treated the guy that has Ebola, and I'm sick.

844
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,440
Can I fly?

845
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
You can fly.

846
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,440
That's like saying, my dog has rabies, and it's foaming at the mouth.

847
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,560
Should I put it into a schoolyard of kids?

848
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Yes, put the dog with rabies into the schoolyard.

849
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,280
Or I found a bat crawling around hissing on the ground.

850
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,800
Should I pick it up and kiss it?

851
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,000
Yes, that's a good idea.

852
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,200
There's a cliff by my house, a thousand feet to Jagged Bottom.

853
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,680
Should I jump off without a parachute?

854
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Yes, jump off immediately.

855
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,680
You have four more examples.

856
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,480
Ring, hi, I'm a nurse that treated the Ebola patient, CDC.

857
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

858
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Yeah, we know who you are.

859
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Yeah, you're all over the news.

860
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Yeah.

861
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
I'm going to fly.

862
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,200
Of course, this time it wasn't on the news, just had been around an Ebola patient.

863
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,640
So I was treating an Ebola patient.

864
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
I'm going to fly.

865
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
I have a fever.

866
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,600
Oh, but dearie, that's a great idea.

867
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,440
They're not just turning off the defaults.

868
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,180
They're sending the Ebola kids to school.

869
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,360
They're not cleaning up the apartment.

870
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,520
Something weird is going on.

871
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,240
And why are nurses getting it, but the family isn't getting it?

872
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:06,360
Either they're covering up that they have it, or it's what that CIA whistleblower said

873
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,260
back in the middle of last month here, Mr. Steele, and we should cue that clip up later.

874
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,080
He said he believed they would release a biological stimulant that wasn't Ebola, but would make

875
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,640
people sick or even kill them to create a false flag.

876
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
There we go.

877
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,160
It's a false flag.

878
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Possibly.

879
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Hold on.

880
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,280
Is that Mr. Steele, our buddy?

881
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
That's Robert David Steele.

882
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Oh yeah, it is.

883
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,440
I was about to say, yep, that one's got the, yep.

884
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,120
Multiple time Project Camelot guest who Alex had to disavow after he claimed on Infowars

885
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,520
that the globalists had children enslaved on Mars bases, Robert David Steele.

886
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,240
That dude's credibility is incredibly low.

887
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Yeah.

888
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Well, you know what?

889
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,520
When you can't disprove his facts, Dan, you try and go after the guy.

890
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,120
And I can clearly see you just taking this to a personal place.

891
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,720
You can't prove that it's not a bioweapon.

892
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
Sure.

893
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,280
Not my job.

894
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,480
Steele had been on Alex's show in September to speculate about the possibility of a false

895
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,160
flag Ebola attack.

896
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,680
But the fact that he was creating narratives about Ebola at that point isn't really all

897
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,920
that weird.

898
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,880
The first case in West Africa from this outbreak was reported in December 2013.

899
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,840
And by March 2014, there was spreading happening.

900
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,040
By July, it had reached the capital cities of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

901
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,640
And according to the CDC, quote, this was the first time Ebola extended out from more

902
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,120
isolated rural areas and into densely populated urban centers, providing an unprecedented

903
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,740
opportunity for transmission.

904
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,940
So Ebola is on the brain as far as any infectious disease is concerned, yeah.

905
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,960
By August, there were Ebola scares being reported to hospitals in the United States.

906
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,600
According to the advisory board's timeline, quote, before the end of the month, more than

907
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,640
60 hospitals reported some type of scare to the CDC, but none of the tests sent to the

908
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,140
agency returned positive for the virus.

909
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,000
So at this point, it was in people's minds.

910
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Right, right, right.

911
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,920
No, that's what you would be talking about.

912
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,520
If you were going to say there's an infectious disease coming to the United States, you're

913
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
going to say Ebola.

914
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,840
It's 100% what you would do.

915
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,400
Yeah, you're not going to be like, it's the flu.

916
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,440
No, everybody's thinking about Ebola and is worried about it.

917
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

918
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,780
Robert David Steele had every reason to shoot the shot when he did.

919
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,720
There was growing insecurity around the outbreak, and it was affecting the psyche of the American

920
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
public.

921
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,240
If a case did end up coming to the United States, he would look like he was way ahead

922
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,680
of the story and he had a narrative in place.

923
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,000
If no case ever arrived here, he could just ignore it or claim that the globalists decided

924
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,560
to go a different way with their evil plans.

925
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,520
There's no downside to this kind of spitballing in a consequence-free environment like Infowars.

926
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Yeah, exactly.

927
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,400
As for the story about the nurse on the plane, Alex isn't making up that NBC News reported

928
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,280
that she did in fact check in with the CDC before getting on the plane.

929
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,740
The problem is that Alex is acting like the CDC has a staff of like 12 people and everyone

930
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,940
knows everything that's going on.

931
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,180
This very article that Alex is referencing explains how everything happened.

932
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,020
At the time, it was believed that this nurse had worn all the appropriate protective gear,

933
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,880
and as such, she was considered a lower risk category of person, technically titled quote

934
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,840
uncertain risk.

935
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,720
Before she flew, the nurse called the CDC and talked to a staffer who quote, looked

936
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,320
on the agency's website for guidance, the spokesperson said.

937
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,360
The category for uncertain risk has guidance saying a person could fly commercially if

938
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,960
they did not meet the threshold of a temperature of 100.4.

939
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,600
She had a slight fever, but it was below that reading, so technically she wouldn't have

940
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,560
been barred from flying.

941
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,280
Director Frieden didn't know that she had contacted the CDC when he made his comment

942
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
that she shouldn't have flown.

943
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,420
From the NBC News article quote, the spokesperson says he believes Frieden said that because

944
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,640
it should have been common sense to Vincent that she should not fly with a slight temperature.

945
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,560
Even though we have a CDC guideline that says you're fine.

946
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,240
Yeah, I mean look, don't get me wrong, I'm not going to defend all of that, it's bungled.

947
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,800
It's him kind of saying that the CDC is wrong, not her.

948
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,280
Probably, yeah.

949
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,640
We need better guidelines.

950
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Yeah, exactly.

951
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:09,400
This guideline is clearly oversight of some kind.

952
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,480
I can't see anything more responsible, if you are this person, than literally going

953
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,480
direct to the CD-fucking-C. Not going to the website, I think it also frustrates me a little

954
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
bit.

955
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
The staffer went to the website.

956
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
The staffer went to the website.

957
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
I don't like that at all.

958
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
That's not lost on me either.

959
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
That's not good.

960
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
I don't like that at all.

961
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,480
No.

962
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Seems like maybe, in this case, you should have rotted up the flagpole.

963
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,040
Yeah, yeah.

964
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,680
I see no fault of hers at all, other than just being like, why are you flying?

965
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:47,320
I see bases being covered in terms of like, clearly no one was acting with malicious intent.

966
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Absolutely not.

967
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:55,560
And there wasn't even like overt negligence, it's just this is how an oversight can happen.

968
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,880
Maybe we should revise our guidelines.

969
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,900
It seems like, basically what I'm saying is iffy decisions happened, but it makes sense

970
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,280
how everything happened the way it did.

971
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,680
There's certainly not enough here to justify speculating this is a false flag outbreak.

972
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,960
I would argue the details would suggest anything but a false flag.

973
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,240
Yeah, and Jordan, I don't know if you're picking up on this, but from where I'm sitting, that

974
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,080
sounds hysterical as shit.

975
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,760
Ah, why?

976
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,760
Oh, God.

977
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:29,520
Look, false flags happen, honestly, it's more hysterical for it to not be a false flag.

978
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,960
Because then it's something surprising.

979
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,440
As we know, false flags happen every day.

980
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,560
Does this sound hysterical?

981
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,560
Let's see.

982
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,680
Also, does this sound familiar?

983
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,940
Okay.

984
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,200
Let's continue here.

985
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:51,480
911 emergency dispatcher's instructed not to say Ebola over the radio.

986
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,220
That's out of Fox News DC.

987
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:00,020
They're being told not to create panic and are being given a secret code to describe

988
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,020
Ebola.

989
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,240
See, the cover-up's already on.

990
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,280
As I said, Ebola probably is already spreading in the US.

991
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,240
They had to let it in and let it breed first, and then they'll say they don't know where

992
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,260
it all began or where it started and, oh, it's all Obama's fault.

993
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,240
And it's going to bring in a medical tyranny, forced inoculation, and the Bill and Melinda

994
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,520
Gates Foundation dedicated to population reduction and the Monsanto vaccine they produced.

995
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,080
I'm going to say that again.

996
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,900
Bill Gates, we keep warning you about, people are like, why do you talk about Bill Gates

997
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,900
so much?

998
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,900
Because I've studied him.

999
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,440
He wants to put an Ebola shot in you.

1000
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,880
You think that's going to be good for you?

1001
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,640
God, it's exactly the same.

1002
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,640
Wow.

1003
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,640
Yeah.

1004
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,640
Jesus.

1005
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,640
It's shockingly the same.

1006
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
Yep.

1007
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,880
And that probably felt just as real to his audience in 2014 as it does to people listening

1008
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,320
to him now.

1009
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Yep.

1010
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,320
It's outrageous.

1011
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,800
It's just that circumstances were handled differently and, of course, Ebola and COVID-19

1012
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,800
are different.

1013
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1014
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,560
They transmit differently.

1015
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,040
They require different responses.

1016
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,040
I heard that.

1017
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,520
I was like, this is amazing.

1018
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,920
It's almost a script.

1019
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,080
It almost felt like you could just take Ebola out and put COVID or coronavirus in and it

1020
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,320
would have just been exactly the same.

1021
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,320
Anything.

1022
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,320
Anything.

1023
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,320
It is kind of-

1024
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,840
Seven years ago.

1025
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:34,120
It is, I think, illustrative of the level of power that Alex and his ilk had in 2014

1026
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,240
as opposed to in 2019.

1027
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,680
That level of influence was far lesser and their effect was far lesser.

1028
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,880
It's hard not to look at this as a... And it's not, again, there are different diseases.

1029
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,660
It's not a one-to-one comparison by any stretch.

1030
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:58,400
But it is hard not to look at the difference between 2014 and 2019 and think, no one should

1031
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,200
be held accountable for, at the very least, negligence.

1032
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,760
This is truly a fucked up thing that people need to be held accountable for.

1033
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,780
Well, I think that one of the differences that you see is that people responded kind

1034
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,680
of more appropriately- That's what I'm saying about negligence.

1035
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:21,380
To people like Alex at that time, or at least people who are actually making decisions and

1036
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,380
being adults.

1037
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,360
We would be like, oh, I don't care.

1038
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,480
And the president wasn't repeating things Alex said.

1039
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,480
Yeah.

1040
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
So that's nice.

1041
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
Yeah.

1042
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,760
And I think it was better.

1043
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,760
One could make that argument.

1044
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,760
I'm gonna.

1045
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,760
Yeah.

1046
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,120
I don't think it would be a hard one to convince me of.

1047
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,420
So now, if you're somebody who's, I don't know, in the past and you're listening to

1048
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,120
Alex and you're taking some of the stuff that he's saying about Ebola seriously, I would

1049
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,480
say, maybe you should hear this and be like, I'm going to turn this off.

1050
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,120
I mean, I hate to get gross here, but you've heard about the phenomenon in government buildings

1051
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,080
suddenly that people are peeing on the walls and going to the bathroom and cubby holes

1052
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,600
and in the hallways, even though the bathrooms are working perfectly fine and smearing it

1053
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,980
all over the walls.

1054
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,720
This is what mental patients do.

1055
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,560
This is what people who are above the law start doing, is just running around going

1056
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:17,760
to the bathroom as poop bandits as they're known.

1057
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,460
This is what has now happened.

1058
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,460
This is what's happening.

1059
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,240
There's poop bandits.

1060
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,320
The government is so out of control and drunk on power that they were poop bandits now.

1061
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Hold on.

1062
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Hold on.

1063
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,320
I just literally wrote a screenplay.

1064
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,880
Give me one second.

1065
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,880
Jesus.

1066
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,080
So I didn't know what Alex was talking about and this seemed really silly.

1067
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,600
So I decided to look into it and see if I could figure it out.

1068
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,600
Sure.

1069
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
I figured it out.

1070
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,160
So in late August, 2014, there was, there were some stories going around about a particular

1071
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,800
EPA office in Denver, which had quote, been beset by roughly a dozen suspected incidents

1072
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,920
of restroom shenanigans since late 2013, according to emails, memorandums and incident reports.

1073
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Restroom shenanigans.

1074
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,920
Yes.

1075
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,920
That's fun.

1076
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,120
Apparently someone was fucking around and clogging toilets with paper and putting shit

1077
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
in the hallway.

1078
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Sure.

1079
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,700
Getting up to all sorts of disgusting nonsense.

1080
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,480
This was clearly the work of an unstable individual who worked at that office.

1081
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,800
Yeah, who is this fucking guy?

1082
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,840
But here, Alex is reporting this as some kind of proof of the corrupt decadence of the government

1083
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
elites.

1084
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,360
They're so bored with being tyrants that there's a new phenomenon of everyone shitting in the

1085
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
hallway.

1086
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,920
It's just a weirdo getting his rocks off in a really uncomfortable way.

1087
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Yeah.

1088
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Yeah.

1089
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
All right.

1090
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Okay.

1091
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,560
I love like being able to look back in the past and like seeing the way that these stories

1092
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,400
get like twisted by Alex into being so much larger than they actually are.

1093
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,820
He does in a way create more fantastical, interesting stories because I mean it's obviously

1094
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,880
a fairly interesting story that someone's putting shit in the hallway in an NBA building.

1095
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Sure.

1096
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,880
Sure.

1097
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,880
That's kind of interesting.

1098
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,160
It's more fun to imagine that our government is run by demon tyrants who are so bored that

1099
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,860
they have to shit in the hallway to get off.

1100
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,280
It is kind of funny.

1101
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,880
It implies a lot more interesting stuff is happening.

1102
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,120
See, that's the problem.

1103
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:16,680
I remember when we lived in a world that wasn't so much like Alex's weird dark circus versions

1104
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,680
of government, and then we lived in one.

1105
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,680
It was bad.

1106
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Yep.

1107
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,680
Yep.

1108
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,680
No good.

1109
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,720
So at this point in 2014, you really had like gentlemen speak freely kind of vibe going

1110
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,720
on at Infowars.

1111
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,720
Oh, that's not good.

1112
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:37,360
They didn't really have the lawsuits to worry about, so things like this happen.

1113
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,620
Why no protective gear for a man with Dallas Ebola patient?

1114
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,620
We have video of this.

1115
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,000
We'll roll some of it in the background.

1116
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,320
The video from CBS News is up on Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.

1117
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,800
This lends credence to Rob Dew running around the office thinking this is crisis actors

1118
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,620
because he's been analyzing video and he's worked at national TV, home shopping network.

1119
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:04,480
You know, he used to be a director there, and so he knows state stuff, and he says that,

1120
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,120
you know, why are people not wearing protective gear with the Ebola patient as we have right

1121
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,040
there?

1122
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,240
And is it people just don't care and they're idiots?

1123
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,560
Or is it staged?

1124
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,880
Or is there a third possibility?

1125
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,040
What would that be?

1126
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,640
So there was a video of people putting that nurse into a plane that was making the rounds,

1127
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,240
and all but one of the people are wearing hazmat suits.

1128
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,240
It definitely looks like fodder for Alex to make a conspiracy out of and for Rob Dew to

1129
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,440
use to justify crisis actor theories, but it's not really that crazy when you get down

1130
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,640
to it or you ask the question and get an answer from somebody.

1131
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,240
This person in the video is not in any direct contact with the patient who's wearing her

1132
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,760
own set of protective gear as well.

1133
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,040
The chances of transmission are incredibly low based on how Ebola goes from person to

1134
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,040
person.

1135
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,600
That being said, I wouldn't do what this dude is doing, but that's just because of me.

1136
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,780
But it might not be that really fucked up or dangerous.

1137
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,400
This very article that Alex is citing in order to talk about the headline includes this passage.

1138
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,120
Quote, when a member of the Dallas CDC team was shown in the video and asked if it was

1139
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,360
a safe moment or not, he said he didn't have a problem with what he saw.

1140
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,560
The situations apparently met CDC protocol because the people in the hazmat suits were

1141
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,700
the ones assisting Vincent, and the plainclothes man was not.

1142
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,620
The CDC spokesman said that the man maintained an appropriate distance from the patient for

1143
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,600
the amount of time on the tarmac, and it must be taken into account that Vincent was

1144
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,040
also wearing protective gear.

1145
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,280
This is how little some idiot like Rob Do needs to justify denying people's illnesses

1146
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
and deaths.

1147
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,080
He just needs some video that looks strange that he didn't care to look into at all.

1148
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,060
The thing that I still have a hard time wrapping my head around that we found out from all

1149
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:57,620
those depositions is at this point in time, apparently only PJ Dubs in the entire InfoWars

1150
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:02,080
sphere was listening to this going like, yeee, this is a bad idea!

1151
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,080
Stop!

1152
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,080
Blokes!

1153
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Stop it, blokes!

1154
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,080
Yes, exactly!

1155
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,080
Yeah.

1156
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,080
Of all people!

1157
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,560
You know what, that might not be true, but it's the only one we know for sure.

1158
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1159
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,480
Because there might have been some lower level functionaries who were being like, this is

1160
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
irresponsible.

1161
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,000
There might have been some people who quit, too.

1162
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,880
There might have been some people who got fired, yeah.

1163
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,800
And I think it's probably in those people's best interests that we not know that.

1164
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,960
Because for them to be able to bury the part of their lives that they worked there might

1165
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,960
be.

1166
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,960
It's important.

1167
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,960
Yeah.

1168
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
Yeah.

1169
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,960
Good for them if they've succeeded.

1170
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
Yeah.

1171
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
And if they have gone on to live a better life.

1172
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,960
Yeah.

1173
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,960
Let's hope.

1174
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,200
So, it's staged, man.

1175
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,280
This stuff's probably staged.

1176
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,600
I don't think it's staged, but okay.

1177
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,800
I don't know exactly what's going on, but I'll tell you this.

1178
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,200
Most of this is staged, it's scripted, and they clearly want Ebola to spread.

1179
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,440
Now you can fill in the blank of why.

1180
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:02,040
My head is spinning at this point, and I'm trying to contain my anger, even during the

1181
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,680
breaks I'm trying to contain it.

1182
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,600
Because I think about how they're trying to bring down this country, now they're trying

1183
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,960
to kill our prosperity, it makes me angry.

1184
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,280
But you don't want people to be hysterical.

1185
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,280
No.

1186
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,280
Right?

1187
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,280
No, no, no.

1188
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,280
I mean, I'm furious because they're killing all of us and destroying proper prosperity.

1189
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,080
And they clearly are trying to intentionally spread Ebola, possibly by staging things.

1190
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,080
Yeah, but as the New York Times said.

1191
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,720
As you said, as the New York Times said, hysteria is a big problem too.

1192
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,360
Well, let's keep it grounded.

1193
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,360
Yeah, absolutely.

1194
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,360
Let's keep this real.

1195
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,360
Let's make sure nobody goes too far.

1196
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,200
And Bloomberg two days ago was asking, why weren't they sent to the government facilities

1197
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,040
that are designed for this?

1198
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:48,580
Because they want it to spread, they want plausible deniability, they probably got sleeper

1199
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,040
cells walking around spreading it.

1200
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,520
I didn't think they'd use Muslim radicals to bring it in before, I thought that was

1201
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,080
just some Islamophobe hype.

1202
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,640
But now it's starting to click that God only knows.

1203
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,180
I think the other shoe is about to drop.

1204
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,560
I think something big is about to happen.

1205
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,160
I've been saying that for months.

1206
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,160
And now you see this breaking loose.

1207
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,160
You can say that for years.

1208
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,360
I think what you're seeing right now might be a diversion for nukes they're about to

1209
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,360
set off.

1210
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,360
Cool.

1211
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,360
Remember all the missing nukes?

1212
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,360
There you go.

1213
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,360
This might be hysterical.

1214
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,360
There you go.

1215
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
That might be an issue.

1216
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
Might be a little bit hysterical.

1217
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
That might be a little bit going too far there.

1218
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Yeah.

1219
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
All right.

1220
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,360
Hey, guess what?

1221
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,880
I believe that the government is intentionally spreading Ebola all over the place and it's

1222
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,880
a false flag.

1223
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,680
It's also a diversion from nukes they're about to drop.

1224
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,620
Listen, I don't know what's going on.

1225
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,640
Let me preface by saying I don't know what's going on.

1226
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,280
Now let me certainly describe a false flag attack that, and honestly, I'm going to go

1227
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,600
with a 50-50 shot.

1228
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,520
It's a diversion and you're all going to die immediately.

1229
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,600
Let me go over the top in a comically scary scenario that I'm painting for you as a very

1230
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,960
distinct possibility based on my years of research about how these globalists operate.

1231
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,960
Yep.

1232
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,680
Also, this whole Islamophobic thing, I was like, oh no, I'm not going to engage in Islamophobia.

1233
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,960
But then I saw a video where a guy was walking on a tarmac, so obviously it's the Islamic

1234
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,960
people's fault.

1235
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,960
Probably.

1236
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Yeah.

1237
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
That makes sense.

1238
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
It's interesting.

1239
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,200
So he's going down this road, you know, like hysteria about Ebola, and then also they're

1240
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,600
going to nuke you.

1241
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,240
Man, we're just in trouble.

1242
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,240
Uh-oh.

1243
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,200
It is just, we have enemies in control that there is no doubt that we are in the most

1244
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,800
grave danger this country has faced in 240 years.

1245
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,520
And I just got hardcore chills.

1246
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:40,720
I got goosebumps on my face right now that the camera can probably pick up.

1247
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,160
They are getting ready to drop the hammer.

1248
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,160
This is the takedown of the country.

1249
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,640
I'm getting my immune system ready.

1250
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,640
I know that.

1251
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,640
InfoWarsLife.com.

1252
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,880
Boom.

1253
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,080
I'm getting my immune system ready.

1254
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
InfoWarsLife.com.

1255
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,080
Boom.

1256
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:59,240
See, now that is a good, that's a good little super transition there.

1257
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,080
That's a good little ad switch compared to what he does now.

1258
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,920
It kind of hurts the preceding passage for me.

1259
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,920
Absolutely.

1260
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,160
The insanely out of control fear mongering that led up to that kind of.

1261
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,160
Well there's that.

1262
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,280
The relationship between the two does suffer.

1263
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,120
But yes, I guess making people really afraid of a nuke and Ebola would lead them to take

1264
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,120
zinc.

1265
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Uh, yeah.

1266
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:30,480
I would say that InfoWarsLife plug really only solves one of the two problems that he's

1267
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,480
describing.

1268
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,840
And in fact I would argue the second one kind of wipes out the gains of the first, if you

1269
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,840
will.

1270
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:43,400
So whatever gains we've lost shall now be recouped.

1271
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,120
Because Alex has a guest.

1272
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,840
And boy howdy.

1273
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
This guest.

1274
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Mic down for this.

1275
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Okay.

1276
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
Because what this guest says.

1277
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Spoiler alert.

1278
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
It's Steve Pajanik.

1279
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
Okay.

1280
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
What he says.

1281
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
It's Stevie Pease?

1282
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
Yes.

1283
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,840
Okay.

1284
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,840
Did he cure himself of Ebola?

1285
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
No.

1286
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,840
Oh, dammit.

1287
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
If we had a complete repeat of the present.

1288
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,840
No.

1289
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,840
That'd be brutal.

1290
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
I was hoping.

1291
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
Yeah, that would be great.

1292
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,840
No.

1293
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:12,160
They do mention how like he had recently reported from the demilitarized zone for Alex.

1294
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,680
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1295
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
I recall.

1296
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,120
Noted info wars correspondent Steve Pajanik.

1297
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,480
I recall that he was in Korea for a while.

1298
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,560
He's in the shit.

1299
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:29,560
So Steve is on and they're talking about Ebola and he directly contradicts something that

1300
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,120
he says in the present.

1301
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,120
Sure.

1302
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,420
That's amazing.

1303
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:37,280
You're also a medical doctor on top of that so you can speak to Ebola.

1304
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,840
Yes, correctly.

1305
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,720
And more importantly, I was trained at Cornell University Medical College between 64 and

1306
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:51,240
1968 by a very competent infectious disease doctor who was really the foremost infectious

1307
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,240
disease doctor.

1308
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
Don't do it.

1309
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,240
You see him on television.

1310
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,240
That is Anthony Fauci.

1311
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,240
God dammit.

1312
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,240
The director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases.

1313
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,240
Oh, God dammit.

1314
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,440
God dammit, Dan.

1315
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,080
One you're a witch and two Steve Pajanik is a monster.

1316
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:11,680
Steve, when he's coming on the show now, talks about how incompetent Fauci is.

1317
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,120
My fucking God.

1318
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,120
I swear to you.

1319
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,320
I hated him ever since I was at Cornell.

1320
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,320
He's a loser.

1321
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,600
This is the worst fucking news you could give me.

1322
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,120
This is so brutal.

1323
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,120
You know who's great?

1324
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,120
Anthony Fauci.

1325
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,560
Oh, it breaks my heart.

1326
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,840
It really breaks my heart.

1327
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:32,000
It's pretty remarkable to dig back a little bit and see like, you know, this mirror, this

1328
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,760
echo is so, the funhouse mirror is the only way I can describe it.

1329
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,760
It's so bizarre.

1330
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,760
Yeah.

1331
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:45,520
No, I mean, listen, it's not that I believe the entire world is a prank on me.

1332
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,520
But when Steve says stuff like that, I'm just like, eh, you know what?

1333
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,520
This isn't real.

1334
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,680
So Steve, Steve thinks that the Ebola situation is pretty serious.

1335
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,880
And I would say that outside of it being hilarious that he likes Fauci now and then in the present

1336
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,200
claims to have always hated him or whatever.

1337
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,200
Yeah.

1338
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,960
That's funny, but yeah, a lot of the stuff he's saying, I really don't take much issue

1339
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
with.

1340
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,960
Yeah.

1341
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,520
He's saying that this is serious and that Ebola is a very nasty disease and we have

1342
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,240
to do what we can to make sure that responsible steps are taken.

1343
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,880
This isn't bullshit.

1344
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:28,640
But he does have a, I would say possibly maybe not good plan of action.

1345
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,720
And what I have recommended and repeatedly recommended is that Dr. Friesen of the CDC

1346
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:41,240
resigned that the CDC be placed on stand down because they really have no, they're not effective.

1347
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:46,560
They've been inefficient and they have no authoritative capacity to demand either the

1348
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,400
city, the state or any institution to do what's mandatory.

1349
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:58,200
Instead, I think that Fauci, Dr. Tony Fauci should be given executive privilege or executive

1350
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:03,520
authority by the president of the United States consistent with 1892 constitutional authority

1351
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,800
on both military powers if need be, because we no longer have the public health service

1352
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,800
which is not functioning.

1353
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,800
Yeah.

1354
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:21,260
So Fauci should be given executive control to use military resources to deal with Ebola.

1355
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,880
These people are just a joke.

1356
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,880
I can't.

1357
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,240
I love it.

1358
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,880
I can't believe this.

1359
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,880
Yeah.

1360
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,920
This is, this is one of those, you know what's funny?

1361
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,760
It's almost like, it's almost like the Mandela effect.

1362
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:44,800
It's almost like we're looking back into a past that didn't happen in the present.

1363
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,800
You know what I'm saying?

1364
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,800
Yeah.

1365
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,080
Like this is an alternate universe where.

1366
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:54,040
But it actually helps me put some pieces together because I always did think it was a little

1367
01:02:54,040 --> 01:03:01,000
bit weird that at the beginning of the coronavirus situation, Alex was painting Fauci as a good

1368
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
guy.

1369
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yeah.

1370
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,760
And he said he made some calls and looked into him and hearing Steve talk about him

1371
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,280
like this, talk about Fauci like this at this point makes me think like, oh, Alex called

1372
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,760
Steve and Steve told him he's cool.

1373
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,040
Steve was like, this is a good guy.

1374
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,240
And then they got the lines from.

1375
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,600
The right wing media decided he's a villain.

1376
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,640
That's interesting.

1377
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:27,320
Maybe the biggest thing that happens that we need to go back and, and kind of analyze

1378
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:33,400
is the creation of the feedback loop between the right wing propaganda, creating Trump

1379
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:37,560
and then Trump echoing right wing propaganda back at them.

1380
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
Yeah.

1381
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,720
I don't know how you would ever, I don't know where you would look for that.

1382
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,840
Um, I don't know.

1383
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
Kill all the baby Hitlers.

1384
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,200
I think that's what we do.

1385
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,680
I blame Drudge.

1386
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
Yeah.

1387
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,680
I would do that too.

1388
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,680
Let's just say it's Drudge.

1389
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,680
It's Drudge's fault.

1390
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,680
It's a bad guy.

1391
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,200
So Alex really wants this to be fake and a false flag.

1392
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,480
Um, and so I was listening to this, uh, part of the episode and it really felt like Alex

1393
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,760
was essentially begging Steve to be like, come on, help me out, man, please.

1394
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,160
Uh, doc, I mean, you believe Sandy hook was staged more and more experts have come out

1395
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:16,080
and agreed, uh, the Boston bombing, uh, you know, rigged so many other events, nine 11,

1396
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:22,420
the open funding of ISIS, changing the name from Al Qaeda, all of this is coming out.

1397
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:26,400
But when you look at this Ebola situation, I'm not saying it's not ravaging Africa.

1398
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,280
I'm not saying it isn't, uh, you know, living in the body longer before the symptoms show

1399
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,560
up 21 days instead of three, it's clearly mutating, getting stronger, but it just, I

1400
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,380
can't believe that this type of ineptitude to bring in Ebola patients, they never did

1401
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:49,080
that before to let people fly in from West Africa, from ravaged areas.

1402
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,120
When other countries had already banned it months ago, I mean, it appears that ineptitude

1403
01:04:54,120 --> 01:05:01,680
wouldn't be this precise at doing everything they could to grease the skids for Ebola.

1404
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,840
Are you getting any information on them allowing this to spread, to kind of bring in a medical

1405
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,200
tyranny to create a political distraction?

1406
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,560
Are there any motives for this to be a false flag?

1407
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,520
No, not really, because number one, it is very hard to create an epidemic to create

1408
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,520
a false flag.

1409
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:24,720
Newtown was a false flag because Eric Holder had funded a very dysfunctional governor and

1410
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:30,680
a dysfunctional town and a bunch of Connecticut State Troopers who were just pathetic and

1411
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,720
it was easy to create and that scenario was nonsense.

1412
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,720
Oh boy.

1413
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,720
Okay.

1414
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,720
Well, interesting answer.

1415
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,720
Yep.

1416
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,720
Yep.

1417
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,500
Although this did, this did make me think, here's what we should do.

1418
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,920
We should call the right-wing terrorists all-white-a.

1419
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,920
That?

1420
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,200
I thought, I thought like the one that was going around before was y'all-kida.

1421
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,200
Was that what it was?

1422
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,920
That was, that was something that I heard Alex yell about before.

1423
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,000
I think I used to say white-kida.

1424
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,560
I think I remember that one.

1425
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,560
Yeah.

1426
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,560
I like all-white-a.

1427
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:04,280
I'll let you do a meme contest about it.

1428
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:10,040
Look, dude, the thing that I think is really funny beyond just Steve being like Fauci is

1429
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,280
a great guy, he should have control over everything in the response.

1430
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,760
Yeah, that's brutal.

1431
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,400
Alex being a over-the-top.

1432
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,400
Give me something.

1433
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,040
Give me any reason.

1434
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,120
I mean, and blue sky thinking.

1435
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,120
I don't care.

1436
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,120
Steve.

1437
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
I'm begging.

1438
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,120
I don't care what it is.

1439
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,120
Give me even the slightest hint.

1440
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,120
Is there a possible motive?

1441
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,120
Yes.

1442
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,120
Give me the-

1443
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,120
No.

1444
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,120
Just money.

1445
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,120
Just say money.

1446
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,120
You could just say money.

1447
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,120
Ugh.

1448
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,120
No.

1449
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Nah, you're kidding.

1450
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,480
The answer is even more illuminating and that is that it's really difficult to create a

1451
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,900
fake epidemic.

1452
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,900
People wouldn't do that.

1453
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,900
It's not wise.

1454
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,160
It would be a bad idea.

1455
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,160
Yeah.

1456
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Very easy to get out of hand.

1457
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,600
Millions of people could die.

1458
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Yeah.

1459
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,600
Pretty much impossible to control.

1460
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Yep.

1461
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:58,080
Not a supervillain plan that would really work outside of a movie.

1462
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,020
But the thing that I think is really interesting is that Alex is talking about all of these

1463
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,600
things in almost identical ways.

1464
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,920
Medical tyranny.

1465
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,920
All this stuff.

1466
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:12,040
He doesn't mention Lockstep at all because he didn't know about that document in 2014.

1467
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,040
No, no, no.

1468
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,040
He knew about it 20 years ago.

1469
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
And it wasn't a document called Lockstep.

1470
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,240
He found it back then.

1471
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,240
It's been in there-

1472
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,440
He pretends to have known about all this stuff and is like, no, you didn't.

1473
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,320
This wasn't part of your narratives then.

1474
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,840
No one had shown you this.

1475
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,840
Nope.

1476
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,840
It hadn't made the-

1477
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:29,840
Because it didn't exist.

1478
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,840
No.

1479
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,840
It existed in 2010.

1480
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,840
Oh, no.

1481
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,840
I mean in the right-wing sphere.

1482
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,840
That's what I'm saying.

1483
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,840
Yeah.

1484
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,840
It hadn't been posted on a stupid blog yet.

1485
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:41,840
It misrepresented what it was in a way that was profitable.

1486
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,480
And you just see it very clearly.

1487
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,860
Like he just didn't have the mana to do that attack at this point.

1488
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,880
It's kind of telling.

1489
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,240
Yeah.

1490
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,960
I'm just so bummed.

1491
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,120
It's so easy.

1492
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,680
The right-wing propagandist's job is so easy.

1493
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,460
You do the same shit every five years for five years and then restart.

1494
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,460
Every time.

1495
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,460
It's the same shit.

1496
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,460
Yeah.

1497
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,460
It's so boring.

1498
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:18,440
And God forbid Ebola would have spread more in the United States at this point, but I

1499
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,280
could easily see Alex going a very similar way.

1500
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,040
It's like, they're trying to lock down our businesses because they're afraid of this

1501
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,040
disease.

1502
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,920
Just don't have people cough on you or throw up.

1503
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,920
And the more effort the government puts into stopping it, the more he'd argue that that's

1504
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,920
what they're-

1505
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,360
That's the reason that they released this on us to encroach on our civil liberties.

1506
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:50,800
You can almost easily see how the playbook operates based on the incredible similar parallels

1507
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,800
you have here.

1508
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Yeah.

1509
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,800
It is really surprising.

1510
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,800
Oh, maybe not.

1511
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,800
No, really.

1512
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:01,720
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

1513
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:07,080
You can see it going down the same exact train of thought no matter what time period it is

1514
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:13,040
because it's the thought process itself that leads you to believe action towards aversion

1515
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,680
is actually causing things.

1516
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:23,080
It's the thought process itself, not the circumstances.

1517
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:29,120
What changes is the circumstances allow it to balloon out of control or it's contained.

1518
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,120
Yeah.

1519
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:37,280
It's deeply cynical and cruel the way that Alex operates in this respect.

1520
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:45,480
It really is a denial and disregard for the fact that there are people who are suffering

1521
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:51,480
and dealing with this and a rank disregard for the people who are listening who are probably

1522
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,840
scared and need information.

1523
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:59,700
They need to have conveyed accurate information that allows them to make appropriate decisions

1524
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,840
like the emails that were sent out to the people who were on the plane after, even though

1525
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,520
there probably wasn't a reason to be worried.

1526
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,520
That's appropriate.

1527
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,240
You're giving the people the information that they need to be able to make appropriate decisions.

1528
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:16,080
These listeners are tuning into Alex because they think that they're going to get some

1529
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,560
kind of insight that they're not going to get elsewhere and he's lying to them in a

1530
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:28,720
way that's designed to scare them and just to get them to get their immune system ready

1531
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:34,240
with the products that he sells over at inflowars.com and...

1532
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,260
As the world economy melts down, gold will go up even as other commodities go down because

1533
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:44,880
it's an ultimate store of wealth and a hedge against imploding economies and it is up.

1534
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,760
When I heard that bond markets had imploded and the stock market was down so much today,

1535
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,680
I thought, man, I bet gold goes down.

1536
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:56,360
I said this aloud, but I said, or maybe it'll go up because when I saw that oil was way

1537
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:01,160
down, I thought, man, I wonder, but man, when I saw gold going up, that's pretty serious

1538
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,160
right there.

1539
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:07,920
So the other thing is that there are economic impacts that are happening because of the

1540
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,800
Ebola situation.

1541
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,120
There's some like airline stocks are going down.

1542
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:18,340
There are impacts that are happening and Alex is using that to funnel gold sales.

1543
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:29,360
Gold started 2014 at $12.05.77 an ounce, peaking on June 30th at $1,327.39 an ounce.

1544
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:35,240
On October 16th, the day this show was recorded, the price was $12.39, down almost $3 an ounce

1545
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,840
from the day before.

1546
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:42,040
It would close the year at $1,184.31.

1547
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,760
Nothing Alex says means anything.

1548
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,660
His syndicator at this point is still a guy who owns a gold sales business, so gold is

1549
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:54,060
super important to his world view in 2014 and it's weird how it's so much less so now.

1550
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,440
So in order to talk about the bond markets falling apart and how gold is great, Alex

1551
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,040
brings in his financial buddy, Max Kaiser.

1552
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,280
Oh God.

1553
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,480
Max Kaiser, I will say, does not give a shit.

1554
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,480
That sounds right.

1555
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,280
He is not taking this seriously at all.

1556
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,280
That sounds right.

1557
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:18,400
I was so close to Gary North and then it's like all the other crazy stuff in my life.

1558
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:23,480
Not Gary North, Gary Webb, Gary North, another writer with Oliver North and Gary North.

1559
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:27,920
And then I didn't break these big CIA drug dealing stories with him because I was just

1560
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,400
like, yeah, I already know all that.

1561
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
Sure.

1562
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,400
Come on the air.

1563
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,400
Sure.

1564
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Sell your book.

1565
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,400
Yeah.

1566
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,400
You're a hero.

1567
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,400
Yeah.

1568
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,400
They're trying to destroy you.

1569
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,400
But why?

1570
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,400
Why put out new documents?

1571
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,400
Why put out a website with you, Gary Webb?

1572
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,400
Because they killed him.

1573
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,100
And then he attacked me for saying they killed him.

1574
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,800
But the movie basically says they killed.

1575
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,840
You said, you know, they show that and his wife, his kids, and that they kill him.

1576
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,580
I'm just, I just am speechless.

1577
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,640
How powerful kill the messenger and the story about Gary Webb and his whole surprise and

1578
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,680
all the rest of it is, I mean, it's simply amazing how all his so-called friends turned

1579
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,820
against him when the mainstream media said he was a fraud with no proof.

1580
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,560
Have you seen kill the messenger yet, Kaiser?

1581
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,560
No, no.

1582
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,000
I'm not scared to.

1583
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,300
I just felt like I dropped the ball monumentally, not working with him more, helping get his

1584
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,300
material out, man.

1585
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,300
Oh.

1586
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,300
Coward.

1587
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,300
Why do you think we're still alive?

1588
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,360
We're too pretty.

1589
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,880
You know, people, they, they don't want to kill off such a beautiful, beautiful, especially

1590
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,040
examples of a human species.

1591
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,760
It would just destroy their souls more than what they do on a day to day basis.

1592
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,760
No, come on.

1593
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,520
Gary Webb had a beautiful soul.

1594
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,400
Man, Max Kaiser does not give a shit.

1595
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,400
Wow.

1596
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,400
He is not taking this seriously at all.

1597
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,400
Yep.

1598
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,400
Nope.

1599
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,400
And I kind of, it's a breath of fresh air.

1600
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,400
Yeah, I do like that.

1601
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,360
I do like a little bit of eh, fucking, you know, who gives a shit?

1602
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,360
Come on.

1603
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,360
Come on.

1604
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,360
We're too pretty.

1605
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,440
Too pretty.

1606
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,440
Their interview ends with Alex comes in from break and he's singing along with balls to

1607
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,440
the wall.

1608
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Sure.

1609
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,240
And he's talking about how this is a, you know, an air, like a pilot term, you know,

1610
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,240
jam in the throttle.

1611
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1612
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,480
And then it's also about the Berlin Wall, you know, and, uh, he's talking about how

1613
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:19,160
this is a protest song and a little bit later, Max Geiser's like, I gotta make a correction.

1614
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:25,640
That's about going balls deep.

1615
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:32,280
It's actually a sincerely kind of funny moment and Alex, I think he knows that it's funny

1616
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,120
that he doesn't know how to play along with it.

1617
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,760
So he's like, this is a family show, Max Geiser, oh, he's a dirty, but he's a dirty guy.

1618
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,320
Can't do a two man game.

1619
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,320
Just can't do it.

1620
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,320
He's a bad scene partner.

1621
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:47,880
But again, it was this Max Geiser just kind of like, he operates outside of the grifts

1622
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,880
that are going on.

1623
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,960
Cause he's scamming and stuff, but I think he's so rich that he doesn't care.

1624
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,960
That's fair.

1625
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,960
Yeah.

1626
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,960
That's the type of rich that, uh.

1627
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,960
He's got fuck you money.

1628
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,960
Yeah.

1629
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,960
Yeah.

1630
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,960
Yeah.

1631
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,440
I think that's nobody, you know, only insane people want to be billionaires.

1632
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,760
I think everybody wants that point of just like, uh, fuck these guys, you know, that's

1633
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,760
what you really want.

1634
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,760
Yeah.

1635
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:14,840
I can go on to Alex's show and perpetuate max coin or whatever.

1636
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:20,480
I can try and sell whatever thing that I'm doing and that can be fun, but I don't need

1637
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,480
it.

1638
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,480
I can also fuck with Alex.

1639
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,480
Just a millionaire.

1640
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,480
Yeah.

1641
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,480
I also have a show on RT.

1642
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,480
I don't need his platform either.

1643
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,480
Yeah.

1644
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,480
I don't know.

1645
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,480
It's weird.

1646
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:33,600
But someone who does need Alex's platform very desperately.

1647
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,600
All right.

1648
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:40,280
Ted Anderson joining us on short notice from California, uh, the owner of the GCN radio

1649
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,280
network.

1650
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,680
He also is one of the biggest private gold dealers with a triple a rating from the better

1651
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,720
business Bureau.

1652
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,560
Something you can't say of most other gold dealers out there.

1653
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:54,040
This ride by my gold for 20 years, about 19 years, he's been a sponsor for 19.

1654
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:58,280
I've worked in this time slot for 18 years.

1655
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,760
I never wanted to go up against rush Limbaugh.

1656
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,000
Ted said, no, we're going to do it.

1657
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,920
You know, he's got a monopoly in cities and a lot of stations, you know, want to have

1658
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,040
a show to go up against it.

1659
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,560
You're on here, not at night, if you want to work at this network.

1660
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,560
So here I am.

1661
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,080
And funny enough, I'm now beating rush Limbaugh in ratings wherever I'm put up against him,

1662
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,080
even on smaller stations.

1663
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,080
Are you, I highly doubt that.

1664
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,080
Do you think so?

1665
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,080
No.

1666
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,080
Do you really think so?

1667
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:24,480
I mean like, yeah, some stations can't afford Russia syndication rates and Alex's is free.

1668
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,480
So yeah, sure.

1669
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,480
It makes sense.

1670
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,480
I imagine.

1671
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:33,080
So, yeah, Ted's Ted's just on to sell gold.

1672
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,280
Alex is out here like Ted Ebola is causing problems.

1673
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,880
We need you on quick to sell gold.

1674
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,880
Yeah.

1675
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,960
I've been panicking people all day, but he's not onto pitch gold.

1676
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,960
Now is the time.

1677
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,880
And I didn't mean to even get him onto pitch gold with Midas.

1678
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,880
But folks, if you wait until the fall where it historically goes up, if you wait until

1679
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,080
there is a big rush, it's already up 20 something bucks today.

1680
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,880
Can we pull that up for me CNBC?

1681
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,600
Now is the time, I believe, to get into gold and silver, or at least get some of the books

1682
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,880
or financial prospectus documents that Midas Resources has.

1683
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,480
And then like a year later, Ted would lose his license because he's a...

1684
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,480
Because he's a scamming.

1685
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,480
Thief.

1686
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,480
Scammy guy.

1687
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,480
He's a fraudster.

1688
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,480
Yeah.

1689
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:20,520
And so, I mean, like this is kind of the payoff, the prestige of the panic and the fear that

1690
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:27,300
Alex has been building throughout the episode with his hysterical nonsense, his talking

1691
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:31,200
about the bond markets falling apart.

1692
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:36,700
That part with Max Keiser is a nice bridge to the interview with Ted Anderson in order

1693
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:40,560
to funnel people to give them the solution to the problem.

1694
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,640
We've created this problem that is...

1695
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,240
False flag Ebola, a nuclear strike.

1696
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,240
Right?

1697
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1698
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,240
You've got to retain your money somehow.

1699
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:53,800
And the only way your assets are going to be safe is with this guy, Ted, my buddy who

1700
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,860
I've been working with for 19 years.

1701
01:17:55,860 --> 01:18:00,760
Buy some bullion you've never seen and have him put it in a lockbox you don't know is

1702
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,760
real.

1703
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,760
It's safe.

1704
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,760
It's fine.

1705
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,760
Yeah.

1706
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,760
Yeah, so I mean, I look back on this.

1707
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,000
I mean, I don't care what Ted has to say.

1708
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It's just about gold.

1709
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yeah, of course.

1710
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,200
But looking back on this episode, it was shocking to me.

1711
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:17,240
I mean, the reason that I chose it, like honestly, had nothing to do with Ebola.

1712
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,360
I didn't know that this episode was about Ebola.

1713
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,060
I just saw Steve Pacanik's name.

1714
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,060
You're a witch.

1715
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,060
Yeah.

1716
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,060
You're a witch.

1717
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,680
So I was like, I got a fucking 2014 Steve Pacanik, boom, let's do this.

1718
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,520
Let's see what he's bringing to the table.

1719
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,520
And I started listening to it.

1720
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,280
Love Dr. Fauci is what he's bringing to the table.

1721
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,280
God damn it.

1722
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,280
So bizarre.

1723
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,280
Fuck you.

1724
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,280
It's so bizarre.

1725
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,280
Fuck you.

1726
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,280
I want to throw a tomato at Steve Pacanik because of this now.

1727
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,360
You see the dark, twisted, like distorted version of the narratives that are being

1728
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:51,440
sold in the present about coronavirus being applied to Ebola in seven years prior, just

1729
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:57,360
with completely different clothes.

1730
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,000
Back then, they could fuck around with crisis actor stuff because they hadn't been checked

1731
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
on that front.

1732
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,800
And so Rob Doo thinks that maybe these people with Ebola are fake.

1733
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,480
Anthony Fauci wasn't somebody that Trump got into a fight with.

1734
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:18,840
And so he's a hero that Steve studied under at Cornell and they're tight.

1735
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:24,040
He should have control of the military apparatus to deal with Ebola.

1736
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,400
I think it's fascinating.

1737
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:32,000
It does strongly reinforce my theory that Alex is full of shit.

1738
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:39,240
I would say that if not definitive proof, I would argue that the totality of our work

1739
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,240
is definitive proof.

1740
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,560
This might be a good argument not to take them seriously.

1741
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,400
Although if you need further proof, go to Dr. Fauci.

1742
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,400
Poop bandits.

1743
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,400
Yes.

1744
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,400
Poop bandits.

1745
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,400
Poop bandits.

1746
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,400
Yeah.

1747
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,400
Oh boy.

1748
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,400
So I hope you had fun.

1749
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,400
I did.

1750
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,400
Enjoying my wizardry.

1751
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,400
I do.

1752
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,320
I love when you bring witchcraft to the table, Dan.

1753
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,680
I'm uncomfortable with how kind of regular an occurrence it is.

1754
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,600
It is really kind of frustrating.

1755
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,280
Again, Dan, everything is a prank on me.

1756
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,080
I'm beginning to believe that thoroughly.

1757
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,960
Well, here's Ashton Kutcher.

1758
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,960
Yeah.

1759
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:14,960
Goddamn it.

1760
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,960
The coronavirus didn't happen.

1761
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,960
Son of a bitch, Ashton.

1762
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,960
That would be an elaborate plan.

1763
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,960
Yeah.

1764
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,200
If I was the only one who actually quarantined this entire time, yeah.

1765
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,520
That would be interesting.

1766
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,520
Yep.

1767
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,520
I don't think it's feasible.

1768
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,120
Although I did read a white paper.

1769
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,960
I've seen a lot of false flags in the past.

1770
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,320
Also, the other thing, before we get out of here, that I was thinking about.

1771
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,440
That was with Alex.

1772
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,760
It's just a joke that he says, I have the documents.

1773
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,760
Yeah.

1774
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,760
Yeah.

1775
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,760
Yeah.

1776
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,040
I mean, he's claiming that he has these documents from Gary Webb.

1777
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,240
It's like, do you?

1778
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,240
Or are they lost?

1779
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,240
Yeah.

1780
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,240
Or did they ever exist?

1781
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:01,640
So anytime that he says he has the documents, it might be just some CD rom that may or may

1782
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:06,240
not exist in a warehouse somewhere that he has no fucking idea that should be protected

1783
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,560
like the Holy Grail.

1784
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:16,640
You would think that that would be so fastidiously organized, seeing as how it's proof of all

1785
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,800
the conspiracies that have ever been.

1786
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,640
Well, maybe not proof of all of them, but at least the building block that would get

1787
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:27,880
you to where something is solidly proven that you can maybe build from.

1788
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,880
Yeah.

1789
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,200
And I think that would be really important for him because as far as I can tell from

1790
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:38,080
the bedrock of so many of these conspiracies, primary sources that you go back to, they

1791
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,740
just don't hold up.

1792
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:49,760
So if he did have these secret classified documents, you would fucking handcuff it

1793
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,760
to your wrist.

1794
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,760
Yeah.

1795
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,760
Yeah.

1796
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,920
That would be ridiculous to imagine that you would.

1797
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:55,920
No, absolutely.

1798
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,380
Especially after Gary Webb dies.

1799
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:03,800
In the episode that we did not record, I played this clip for you.

1800
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,440
The two guys that we were talking about watched a 20 minute conspiracy theory video and I

1801
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:13,220
only played you one clip from it and it was the guy narrating it say, about a month ago

1802
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,920
I lost all of it and it's like, oh, fuck off.

1803
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,540
There is a certain irony to us complaining about this when we're only recording this

1804
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:28,520
episode because of a tech glitch, although we didn't prove anything in that episode.

1805
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,920
No, I think that was more an observation.

1806
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,920
Yeah.

1807
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,160
It was just some laughs were had that will never be had publicly.

1808
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:38,040
Anyway, Jordan, this has been fun.

1809
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,040
This has been fun.

1810
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,040
Yeah.

1811
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,040
Sorry that your episode got lost.

1812
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,040
Oh, it'll be okay.

1813
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,480
We'll let you take the wheel again here in the near future.

1814
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,480
Sometimes soon.

1815
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,120
I'm sure you can find something that we can go over.

1816
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:53,200
Anyway, but, uh, but for now, let's, uh, let's end this.

1817
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,200
Okay.

1818
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,080
Let's travel back to the present.

1819
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,080
All right.

1820
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,080
All right.

1821
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,080
All right.

1822
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,080
Uh, we'll be back.

1823
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,080
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

1824
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,080
We do have a website.

1825
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,240
It's a thanks to Mr. Peabody for bringing us back to the present.com.

1826
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,240
We're also on Twitter.

1827
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,240
We are on Twitter.

1828
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,240
It's that knowledge.

1829
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,240
I'll just go right now.

1830
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,240
Go to bed.

1831
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,240
Jordan.

1832
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,240
We're also on Facebook.

1833
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,480
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1834
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,480
doing God's work right now.

1835
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,480
Yep.

1836
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,480
We'll be back.

1837
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,480
But until then, I'm Neo.

1838
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,480
I'm Leo.

1839
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,480
I'm DZX Clark.

1840
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,480
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1841
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,600
I am the leader of the Poop Bandits.

1842
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,600
Andy in Kansas.

1843
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,600
You're on the air.

1844
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,600
Thanks for holding.

1845
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,600
Hello, Alex.

1846
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,600
I'm a first time caller.

1847
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,600
I'm a huge fan.

1848
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,600
I love your work.

1849
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:59,600
I love you.
