knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

I have great respect for knowledgefight

knowledgefight

00:25.120 --> 00:27.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.360 --> 00:28.720
saying we are the bad guys

00:28.720 --> 00:30.000

Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

Hello Alex, I'm a 6-ton color, I'm a huge fan

00:51.800 --> 00:52.840
I love your word

00:57.240 --> 00:59.480
I love you

00:59.480 --> 01:01.480
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.480 --> 01:02.080
I'm Jordan

01:02.080 --> 01:04.400
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:04.400 --> 01:05.960
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.960 --> 01:08.080
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:08.080 --> 01:08.600
Jordan

01:08.600 --> 01:09.080
Dan

01:09.080 --> 01:09.880
Jordan Dan

01:09.880 --> 01:10.960
I have a quick question for you

01:10.960 --> 01:11.640
What's up?

01:11.640 --> 01:12.600
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.600 --> 01:16.280
My bright spot today, Jordan, is a combination of two of my great loves

01:16.280 --> 01:20.360
As people who listen to the podcast regularly, eagle-eared listeners will know

01:20.360 --> 01:20.760
Sure

01:20.760 --> 01:23.800
Um, I have been on a little bit of a rice adventure

01:23.800 --> 01:24.280
Mm-hmm

01:24.280 --> 01:26.080
Um, mochi, certainly

01:26.080 --> 01:27.080
The forbidden rice

01:27.080 --> 01:28.400
That is un-forbidden

01:28.400 --> 01:29.520
Yes, no, it's forbidden

01:29.520 --> 01:30.640
Oh, it's still forbidden?

01:30.640 --> 01:31.800
Oh, it's re-forbidden?

01:31.800 --> 01:32.640
Shit

01:32.640 --> 01:39.640
Um, and another sort of, a little bit in the past love of mine, which is vinegar

01:39.640 --> 01:39.920
Yes

01:39.920 --> 01:41.440
The invariant of vinegar

01:41.440 --> 01:47.280
I didn't know that you could, maybe you're supposed to put vinegar in rice when you're cooking it?

01:47.280 --> 01:48.560
I did not know that either

01:48.560 --> 01:51.200
I don't know if you're supposed to, but some people recommend that you do it

01:51.200 --> 01:51.480
Oh

01:51.480 --> 01:58.040
So I put some vinegar, some fancy garlic vinegar, in with some rice I was cooking last night

01:58.040 --> 01:59.160
Alright, alright

01:59.160 --> 02:00.200
Pretty good

02:00.200 --> 02:02.920
Two great flavors that go great together, Dan

02:02.920 --> 02:04.400
Yup

02:04.400 --> 02:08.480
Can't be a hundred percent certain it was that much better

02:08.480 --> 02:09.120
Meh

02:09.120 --> 02:12.480
But it smelled like a garlic while it was cooking

02:12.480 --> 02:13.280
Well, that's fun

02:13.280 --> 02:13.680
Yes

02:13.680 --> 02:14.480
That helps

02:14.480 --> 02:14.920
Yup

02:14.920 --> 02:16.400
Yeah, there's no problem there

02:16.400 --> 02:20.320
It felt like I was doing something

02:20.320 --> 02:21.960
And that really counts for a lot

02:21.960 --> 02:25.480
Yeah, I think cooking alchemy is a good feeling

02:25.480 --> 02:31.880
Yeah, definitely, so I had a pretty nice time with that, making up some rice and vegetables last night

02:31.880 --> 02:32.480
That's nice

02:32.480 --> 02:33.760
Yeah, how about you?

02:33.760 --> 02:37.560
Uh, Dan, my bright spot is that we are doing this episode at all

02:37.560 --> 02:38.360
Uh-huh

02:38.360 --> 02:39.480
In a very short period of time

02:39.480 --> 02:40.440
You're not fired

02:40.440 --> 02:46.240
In a very short period of time, you turned around an episode which was amazing

02:46.240 --> 02:49.160
Well, we've had a weird couple of days, kind of

02:49.160 --> 02:50.200
Yeah

02:50.200 --> 02:58.120
We set out to, the plan initially was, because I had kind of a strange schedule and a little bit of a

02:58.120 --> 03:00.600
I need a little bit of a step back kind of feel

03:00.600 --> 03:03.320
So I asked you to cover Friday

03:03.320 --> 03:03.680
Yup

03:03.680 --> 03:04.760
Two episodes of Friday

03:04.760 --> 03:06.120
I put together an episode

03:06.120 --> 03:06.640
You did

03:06.640 --> 03:08.120
And we recorded it

03:08.120 --> 03:09.160
Two hours

03:09.160 --> 03:09.720
And it was okay

03:09.720 --> 03:10.120
Yeah

03:10.120 --> 03:11.400
It was thoroughly okay

03:11.400 --> 03:18.200
It was a very interesting exploration of some guys on YouTube

03:18.200 --> 03:19.200
I gave it a shot

03:19.200 --> 03:24.400
Yeah, I realized that there's like, you know, a lot of sort of monotony going on with Alex

03:24.400 --> 03:26.720
And it would be a good time to take a little bit of a break

03:26.720 --> 03:27.120
Sure

03:27.120 --> 03:28.080
See something else

03:28.080 --> 03:32.760
And I don't know if I'm really capable of finding new things anymore

03:32.760 --> 03:35.680
Like I brought Alex and Project Camelot to the table

03:35.680 --> 03:37.840
And I'm thrilled that those have worked

03:37.840 --> 03:38.240
Yup

03:38.240 --> 03:39.760
And Bill Cooper to some extent

03:39.760 --> 03:42.600
But like some of my other efforts have not been great

03:42.600 --> 03:42.840
There's been some trouble

03:42.840 --> 03:44.560
And so I wanted to farm it out to you

03:44.560 --> 03:48.240
And I think you found something, no spoilers

03:48.240 --> 03:52.080
It's not possible to spoil it

03:52.080 --> 03:53.920
It's already been spoiled

03:53.920 --> 03:58.800
I was thinking we should just release it the way it was with a half hour that's recorded

03:58.800 --> 04:00.720
And then two hours of dead silence

04:00.720 --> 04:01.440
No, I mean it's not dead silence

04:01.440 --> 04:05.040
And then call it Jordan crashed the car

04:05.040 --> 04:05.760
Yes, Jordan

04:06.640 --> 04:07.440
Get away from the wheel

04:07.440 --> 04:08.320
Yeah, exactly

04:10.240 --> 04:14.160
Yeah, so we recorded it and somehow, you know, tech glitch

04:14.160 --> 04:14.640
Yup

04:14.640 --> 04:15.600
Something happened

04:15.600 --> 04:18.320
There's audio of us talking for the first half hour

04:19.200 --> 04:22.320
And then after that point, it's just the drops

04:24.720 --> 04:27.920
That's almost like one of those coloring book prompts, you know

04:27.920 --> 04:31.120
Like, hey, you guys listen to the first half hour of us talking

04:31.120 --> 04:33.440
And then fill in the rest whenever you feel like you didn't

04:33.440 --> 04:34.480
You know what we're gonna say

04:34.480 --> 04:35.680
Yeah, you got it

04:36.400 --> 04:38.640
Try your, make your own knowledge fight

04:38.640 --> 04:41.760
There's gonna be 20 minute stretches where there's nothing

04:42.320 --> 04:43.200
There's no audio

04:43.200 --> 04:44.400
Yeah, have a nice little chat

04:44.400 --> 04:46.400
That's for meditating, that's where we do that

04:48.000 --> 04:49.120
Find you

04:49.120 --> 04:49.600
Yeah, so

04:49.600 --> 04:50.320
Center

04:50.320 --> 04:56.640
So in a period of mere hours, you've put together another episode for us to release

04:56.640 --> 04:59.520
By wiping away my failure

05:00.400 --> 05:03.520
Only for us to share it for the rest of us

05:03.520 --> 05:04.560
No one will ever know

05:04.560 --> 05:05.920
No one will ever know

05:08.240 --> 05:10.000
Yeah, and you know, hey man

05:10.000 --> 05:12.080
I don't want you to feel too bad

05:12.080 --> 05:12.320
Well

05:12.320 --> 05:16.480
Anything, it happens, these things happen and it's not your fault

05:16.480 --> 05:20.640
I think the only problem really is that puts me at like a, what?

05:21.200 --> 05:24.480
One out of every five episodes I do it disappears

05:24.480 --> 05:27.840
That would wipe off a hundred episodes from our tally

05:27.840 --> 05:29.120
So it's a good thing you run it

05:29.120 --> 05:33.120
Yeah, I'm more used to the sort of troubleshooting

05:33.120 --> 05:35.120
Knowing when something's wrong and that kind of thing

05:35.120 --> 05:38.560
And I think that, you know, it's no big deal

05:38.560 --> 05:40.960
I feel bad for the listeners and for you

05:40.960 --> 05:45.040
Because, you know, you did bring something interesting to the table

05:45.040 --> 05:45.520
Yeah

05:45.520 --> 05:49.680
And maybe, you know, maybe there's something that we'll dip back into later

05:49.680 --> 05:51.120
But certainly not that episode

05:51.120 --> 05:51.360
No

05:51.360 --> 05:52.080
We can't redo it

05:52.080 --> 05:53.120
We can't redo that one

05:53.120 --> 05:53.680
No

05:53.680 --> 05:55.840
No, that one was baffling enough as it is

05:55.840 --> 05:57.280
Let alone trying to do it again

05:57.280 --> 05:57.760
Yeah

05:57.760 --> 05:58.160
Yep

05:58.160 --> 05:59.120
Lost episode

05:59.120 --> 05:59.680
Oh well

06:00.800 --> 06:06.640
So Jordan, today we have an interesting thing to go over that I have scrounged up

06:06.640 --> 06:07.040
Yes

06:07.040 --> 06:11.920
Today we're going to be talking about October 16th, 2014

06:11.920 --> 06:12.640
Double Down!

06:12.640 --> 06:14.080
Oh shit!

06:14.080 --> 06:15.280
Double Down on 14

06:15.280 --> 06:16.640
What's a Double Down?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.160
Like in a Blackjack table

06:18.160 --> 06:19.440
Jesus Christ!

06:19.440 --> 06:21.680
You have thought, you thought of that last night

06:22.960 --> 06:24.720
Maybe this morning while I was laying in bed

06:24.720 --> 06:27.680
There's no way I was supposed to pick up on that one

06:27.680 --> 06:27.920
Yeah

06:28.720 --> 06:30.320
Also bad advice, don't Double Down on 14

06:30.320 --> 06:31.600
No, don't Double Down on a 14

06:31.600 --> 06:31.840
No

06:32.480 --> 06:33.680
Very bad Blackjack hand

06:33.680 --> 06:35.360
Well, I guess it depends on what the dealer has

06:35.360 --> 06:36.080
Eh!

06:36.080 --> 06:44.240
But, yeah, so I decided I wanted to go back to a time before Alex was quite as,

06:45.680 --> 06:48.880
I don't know, overtly amphetimined out

06:49.520 --> 06:50.000
Sure

06:50.000 --> 06:55.120
For, before the time of Trump, I wanted to get a little bit more of a taste of that

06:55.120 --> 06:55.440
Sure

06:56.000 --> 07:03.040
And I just sort of scrolled around randomly and I saw a name in the description of the episode

07:03.040 --> 07:04.480
I'm like, alright, here we go

07:04.480 --> 07:09.120
And actually, I was listening to this, it is hauntingly appropriate

07:09.120 --> 07:09.600
Really?

07:09.600 --> 07:10.000
Yes

07:10.000 --> 07:10.880
You're a witch

07:10.880 --> 07:11.680
Yes, I think

07:11.680 --> 07:15.120
We've done this too many times for you not to be officially a witch

07:15.120 --> 07:19.280
Yeah, I think this might boost some of my credibility as a witch

07:19.280 --> 07:23.920
Either that or nothing ever, ever changes and it is all the same

07:23.920 --> 07:25.440
Or everything is the reverse

07:25.440 --> 07:26.080
Yeah, that's true

07:26.080 --> 07:27.440
Of always the same

07:27.440 --> 07:27.680
Yeah

07:28.240 --> 07:30.560
So I'm excited to get down to business on this episode

07:30.560 --> 07:33.600
But before we do, Jordan, we're gonna take a moment to say thank you to some folks who signed up

07:33.600 --> 07:35.440
And are wonking it up

07:35.440 --> 07:36.160
That's a good idea

07:36.160 --> 07:38.640
So first, this is a two-named person

07:38.640 --> 07:42.000
This is a very exciting, rare double alias

07:42.000 --> 07:42.480
Okay

07:42.480 --> 07:44.000
But they're both good, so I'm gonna allow it

07:44.000 --> 07:44.320
Alright

07:44.320 --> 07:46.320
The first is North Korean ballot boat

07:46.320 --> 07:46.880
Hell yeah

07:47.520 --> 07:49.840
Piloted by the skipper Roger Stone

07:51.280 --> 07:55.120
And the other is private chef of Alex's wife's tennis partner

07:55.120 --> 07:57.040
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

07:57.040 --> 07:58.000
I'm a policy wonk

07:58.000 --> 07:58.800
Thank you very much

07:58.800 --> 07:59.280
Thank you

07:59.280 --> 08:02.720
Next, Captain Details, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

08:02.720 --> 08:03.680
I'm a policy wonk

08:03.680 --> 08:06.640

08:07.520 --> 08:10.800
Next, Caitlin Dingo, girl, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

08:10.800 --> 08:11.840
I'm a policy wonk

08:11.840 --> 08:12.640
Thanks Caitlin

08:12.640 --> 08:13.040

08:20.000 --> 08:20.480

Next, Adrenochrome Annie, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

08:23.760 --> 08:25.520
I'm a policy wonk

08:25.520 --> 08:27.360
Thank you very much Adrenochrome Annie

08:27.360 --> 08:30.480
Do you prefer adrenochrome or adrenochrome?

08:30.480 --> 08:36.160
I prefer a drenachrome, I think dren has a nice little more dreadful feel to it, you

08:36.160 --> 08:37.160
know what I'm saying?

08:37.160 --> 08:41.160
It has a sort of phonem similarity, sound similarity.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.880
It feels good.

08:42.880 --> 08:43.880
I prefer a drenachrome.

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
Really?

08:44.880 --> 08:45.880
Why?

08:45.880 --> 08:46.880
It seems classier.

08:46.880 --> 08:51.600
Well yes, I see we have a, that clearly illuminates the differences between our personalities.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
Sure.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.520
Next, Glitch the cat, thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk.

08:55.520 --> 08:56.880
I'm a policy wonk.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.880
Thank you Glitch.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.880
Thank you.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.480
I'd like to say thank you to someone who is now a technocrat.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.840
So thank you so much, Raptor King William the Impaler.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.440
You are now a technocrat.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.440
I'm a policy wonk.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
Crikey mate, that's fantastic.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.440
Have yourself a brew.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.440
How's your 401k doing, bro?

09:11.440 --> 09:14.760
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

09:14.760 --> 09:16.320
Let's just get down to business.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.400
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.320
Why you pimps so good?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.960
My neck is freakishly large.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.600
I declare info war on you.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.800
Thank you so much, Raptor King William the Impaler.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.840
Yes, thank you very much, RKWI.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.160
You don't go with a T. Never put the the in a...

09:35.160 --> 09:37.660
I've never put a the in an abbreviation.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.280
We can agree to disagree on that.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
Always.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
Put a...

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
Nope.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
What about that?

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
So what about...

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
Articles never go in.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.720
Okay, so Game of Thrones is GT?

09:47.720 --> 09:48.880
Uh, yeah.

09:48.880 --> 09:49.880
Not got?

09:49.880 --> 09:52.320
There's a reason O is lowercase in that.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.720
O is simply there as a placeholder.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.240
Everyone abbreviates Game of Thrones as GOT.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.240
And maybe they should.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.240
Okay.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.240
Yep.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.240
Hey, Jordan.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
Let me ask you a question.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.240
What's up?

10:02.240 --> 10:06.560
Do you ever get spanked on your birthday?

10:06.560 --> 10:08.200
You ever get birthday spankings?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.520
Have I ever been birthday spanked?

10:09.520 --> 10:15.320
I think I was birthday spanked one time as like a 11 or 12 year old.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.960
And everyone immediately went, no, this wasn't a good idea.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.680
That's gotta be really weird because like you didn't on your 10th birthday.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.760
It's not like it happened up till then.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.960
So it was just a new innovation?

10:27.960 --> 10:32.820
It was very much like somebody at my birthday party had just heard of birthday spankings

10:32.820 --> 10:36.600
and was real excited to try it out like, ooh, this will be a new thing.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.600
And everybody stopped and was just like, no.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
What is...

10:40.600 --> 10:41.600
No!

10:41.600 --> 10:49.640
I don't think I have ever, I don't think that spankings have ever been a fun thing in our

10:49.640 --> 10:50.640
family.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.640
I don't think it was ever playful.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.520
No, that's probably, that's true of my family.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.520
Yeah.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.160
But there are some people who are celebrating a birthday.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.360
Okay, well let's spank the shit out of them.

11:00.360 --> 11:05.160
I'd like to give them a little bit of a spanking by way of a podcast.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.640
All wonks line up.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.640
Wait a second.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.680
All wonks line up for the birthday spanking.

11:09.680 --> 11:15.160
I think I might have gone down the wrong road with this setup, but earlier this week on

11:15.160 --> 11:18.880
Monday, Pat had a birthday and wanted to say happy birthday to you, Pat.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.880
Oh, happy birthday, Pat.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.760
Sorry we missed that on Monday, but I'm not great with inboxes.

11:23.760 --> 11:29.600
So tomorrow, Greg G out in Cary, NC, North Carolina, it rhymes.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
Oh, G and NC?

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
Yeah.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
All right.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.600
Having a birthday.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.600
Happy birthday, Greg G.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.600
Happy birthday, G G.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.280
I hope you're having a good one out there and I hope, Pat, you had a great one on Monday.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.280
Indeed.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.280
Happy birthday.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.280
Happy birthday.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.000
Blow out those candles, make a wish.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Spanks all around.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.800
I was trying to transition to candle talking, so spanking, because I realized it's a little

11:47.800 --> 11:48.800
weird.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
Well, what you gonna do?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.000
I'm gonna get into this episode.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
That's a good transition.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.160
Jordan, October 16th, 2014, what do you know was going on around that time?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.440
What do you have a feeling?

11:59.440 --> 12:00.440
Let's see.

12:00.440 --> 12:08.760
2014, I would have just woken up from a three-year sleep or a fugue state, if you will.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.720
Rip Van Winkle over here.

12:10.720 --> 12:17.520
So I was just welcoming awareness once again and I had moved to Bloomingdale, Illinois,

12:17.520 --> 12:22.400
gorgeous one-bedroom apartment.

12:22.400 --> 12:27.960
This episode is, shockingly, mostly about residential pricing in Bloomingdale.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.360
All I'm saying is those are the only things I remember from 2014.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.880
This is surprisingly right in your wheelhouse.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.120
I may be a witch.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.120
Excellent.

12:35.120 --> 12:39.960
No, in October, it was Ebola season.

12:39.960 --> 12:45.840
It was during the middle of the period where there were a couple cases of Ebola here in

12:45.840 --> 12:47.080
the United States.

12:47.080 --> 12:54.120
The primary patient, the first patient that came into the United States, had passed away.

12:54.120 --> 13:00.840
And we are right on the cusp of the second nurse who had treated him has been diagnosed

13:00.840 --> 13:04.040
now with Ebola.

13:04.040 --> 13:09.400
So we're remembering when a possible pandemic was averted.

13:09.400 --> 13:17.640
We have done an episode, I think two years ago, about the first day when there was a

13:17.640 --> 13:20.520
case in the United States and Alex's response to it.

13:20.520 --> 13:27.480
And it's really interesting to take a little bit of a look and see what is going on a couple

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
weeks later.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.480
Sure, sure.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.480
Absolutely.

13:30.480 --> 13:36.640
I mean, did he go from there will be lone survivors back to there's no problem at all?

13:36.640 --> 13:37.640
It's interesting.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.840
So I would say his trajectory has a lot of similarities and a lot of differences.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.840
Yeah.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.800
And that's what made this particularly fascinating for me.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
So here we go.

13:46.800 --> 13:51.560
We're going to start off with him talking about some sort of fear-ish narratives.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.440
I'm your host, Alex Jones.

13:53.440 --> 14:03.480
They are telling 911 dispatchers, Fox Television out of DC is reporting not to say Ebola over

14:03.480 --> 14:11.360
the radio or when they're basically talking about a call that they're on.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.440
We have Obama saying there's nothing to fear, that it's a low probability that an epidemic

14:15.440 --> 14:18.960
will start in the U.S.

14:18.960 --> 14:24.240
Even as we learn that the second nurse to contract Ebola traveled all over the place

14:24.240 --> 14:30.920
on aircraft and that the plane was not even cleaned, that is wiped down.

14:30.920 --> 14:35.280
They picked up the trash on the floor, but not a deep clean for five more flights after

14:35.280 --> 14:38.920
she was on it.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.060
Five more flights.

14:40.060 --> 14:44.440
So this story that Alex is opening the show with about the 911 dispatchers not being allowed

14:44.440 --> 14:47.560
to say Ebola on the radio is not from Fox DC.

14:47.560 --> 14:52.000
Fox DC did run a story about it with the headline that Alex is reading, but that article is

14:52.000 --> 14:55.680
just a link to the original story, which is from the New York Post.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.480
The reasoning behind this- Trustworthy New York Post.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.400
But the reasoning makes total sense.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.320
There's tons of people who aren't first responders who listen in on emergency radio channels

15:04.320 --> 15:08.960
and you could easily imagine how a panic could break out if every call that came in where

15:08.960 --> 15:13.160
someone was worried that they had Ebola was misinterpreted by someone listening in as

15:13.160 --> 15:15.660
a definite or probable case.

15:15.660 --> 15:17.280
People would lose their minds.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.640
You could really do some damage.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.760
Did you know that words can have an effect in real life?

15:22.760 --> 15:23.760
That's weird.

15:23.760 --> 15:27.120
If you actually read the New York Post article, this is exactly what it's about.

15:27.120 --> 15:31.260
A source speaking to the post said, quote, just like you can't say bomb on an airplane,

15:31.260 --> 15:32.740
we can't say Ebola.

15:32.740 --> 15:37.480
Back in the 80s and 90s, taking universal precautions meant someone had AIDS.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.840
We weren't allowed to say AIDS then either.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.920
Dr. Jay Varma, the deputy commissioner of the city department of health, gave some idea

15:44.920 --> 15:48.240
of how many opportunities there had been for false panics to start.

15:48.240 --> 15:54.300
Quote, we have now had about 133 calls since July concerning patients with possible Ebola

15:54.300 --> 15:58.360
symptoms and all 133 were false alarms.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.320
That's alarming.

16:00.320 --> 16:07.900
Yeah, and people listening in could have taken any one of those 133 and tried to present

16:07.900 --> 16:11.080
it as like, look, look at all these people, they're covering up all these cases.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.000
It could be really dangerous.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.240
You could definitely get into a fear mongering panic where somebody like Alex Jones convinces

16:19.240 --> 16:21.480
you that you need to buy survival food.

16:21.480 --> 16:26.640
Yeah, so from an emergency response perspective, I do see how it could be best practices to

16:26.640 --> 16:34.080
use language that wouldn't necessarily be exploitable by people who may have ill will

16:34.080 --> 16:35.800
and are listening in on your communication.

16:35.800 --> 16:41.520
Right, which is unfortunate because, boy, it would be nice if we were just allowed to

16:41.520 --> 16:42.520
say words.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.860
Or even, let me even walk what I'm saying back.

16:45.860 --> 16:48.920
It's not even necessarily people with ill will.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.600
Some people could just get confused.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.680
Just panic entirely, just already be paranoid.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.920
So as for that nurse story, that was true, sort of.

16:58.920 --> 17:04.800
It's true that she did fly the day before she was diagnosed with Ebola, but experts

17:04.800 --> 17:07.800
don't believe that it was as big a deal as it sounds.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.360
The first reason is that at the time of her flying, she wasn't exhibiting symptoms that

17:11.360 --> 17:14.540
would put people at high risk, like vomiting.

17:14.540 --> 17:19.160
Even so, Thomas Frieden, then the director of the CDC, was clear that, quote, she should

17:19.160 --> 17:21.560
not have flown on a commercial airplane.

17:21.560 --> 17:25.940
And he immediately put in place guidelines that anyone who had been exposed to somebody

17:25.940 --> 17:30.680
with Ebola would only travel by way of controlled movement like private flights and chartered

17:30.680 --> 17:31.680
vehicles.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, immediate?

17:33.800 --> 17:37.800
Well, prior to that, this was just recommended by the CDC.

17:37.800 --> 17:42.720
But after, quote, the agency would work with state and local authorities to enforce this

17:42.720 --> 17:43.960
restriction.

17:43.960 --> 17:48.480
I found a Washington Post article about this, and it seems to directly contradict Alex's

17:48.480 --> 17:52.960
claims about there being five more flights before the plane was cleaned.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.720
From that article, quote, the plane, Vinton, that's the nurse, traveled on, arrived in

17:57.720 --> 18:02.480
Dallas at 816 p.m. on Monday and remained overnight because it was done with flights

18:02.480 --> 18:03.480
for that day.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.440
And then when we found out she had Ebola, we blew that shit to the moon.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.280
We exploded it all over the fucking place.

18:10.280 --> 18:14.200
After that, the plane received a thorough cleaning per our normal procedures before

18:14.200 --> 18:18.800
resuming service Tuesday, Frontier said in a statement.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.120
I was able to find the article that Alex is misrepresenting.

18:22.120 --> 18:25.760
There was a piece in the Denver Post with the headline, quote, emails out to passengers

18:25.760 --> 18:29.500
on five Frontier flights after Ebola patient flew.

18:29.500 --> 18:33.920
As it turns out, the airline did send notification to the people who were on the same plane that

18:33.920 --> 18:37.280
the nurse had flown on, but it wasn't because they hadn't cleaned it.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.540
It was out of an abundance of caution.

18:39.540 --> 18:43.740
The plane had been cleaned, but later the nurse was diagnosed with Ebola, and by that

18:43.740 --> 18:47.960
point that anyone knew anything, the plane had already flown five additional flights

18:47.960 --> 18:49.640
the next day.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.280
Informing the customers is definitely the right thing to do in terms of making sure

18:53.280 --> 18:54.520
everyone's informed.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.520
Totally.

18:55.520 --> 19:00.720
Even if you followed every preventative, appropriate step, it's still above board to tell people.

19:00.720 --> 19:01.720
Yeah, absolutely.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.640
So they can make their own choices from a healthcare perspective.

19:03.640 --> 19:08.720
Yeah, no, and not telling people would be a far greater scandal for you.

19:08.720 --> 19:13.800
You know, if everybody found out a week later, they'd be like, fuck you guys!

19:13.800 --> 19:14.800
It would be wrong.

19:14.800 --> 19:15.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:15.800 --> 19:16.800
It would be negligent.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.880
This article points out that after this nurse was diagnosed, the plane was going to undergo

19:20.880 --> 19:25.600
even further cleaning, quote, including replacement of seat covers and carpet in the vicinity

19:25.600 --> 19:30.280
of the passenger's seat, but this still doesn't support Alex's all they did was pick up trash

19:30.280 --> 19:31.280
narrative.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.280
Sure, sure.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.160
I think he's just trying to scare people.

19:34.160 --> 19:39.440
I think we should treat all diseases like the Velveteen Rabbit and just immediately

19:39.440 --> 19:41.240
burn everything involved.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.240
Everywhere.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.000
I think that might be going a little bit...

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
The plane.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Pendulum the other direction.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
The airport.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Everything.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
The whole place.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Uh huh.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.200
All stocks and bonds in the airline.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.320
We've seen what it's like to live through a pandemic.

19:56.320 --> 20:01.520
We have not seen what it's like to burn everything to the ground in case one starts.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.800
I'm just saying that we should go the other direction.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.800
You make some interesting points.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.800
Yeah.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.800
I would love to live in a world where we still have a pandemic and then also everything is

20:08.800 --> 20:09.800
burning.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.800
Great.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.480
That would be, that would probably be an issue.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.480
You're probably right.

20:14.480 --> 20:22.520
So Alex is covering this news and I will say he has a classy take on things.

20:22.520 --> 20:28.480
He's dealing with things in a really, just a newsman.

20:28.480 --> 20:37.440
We are the Ebola vomit bag, the Obama, excuse me, Ebola toilet.

20:37.440 --> 20:43.000
You know, memes are very, very powerful and that's why we've launched this contest that's

20:43.000 --> 20:49.360
only running for another week to go to infoawards.com forward slash contest, print off the flyers,

20:49.360 --> 20:54.080
hang them up, shoot video of it, send us the video, we'll post it and then a week later

20:54.080 --> 20:59.960
on Halloween, I will announce the winner.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.240
Hashtag Ebola contest.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.560
Oh boy.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.560
Wow.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.040
Hashtag Ebola contest.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.040
Wow.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.160
Hashtag Ebola contest.

21:08.160 --> 21:12.840
And it's contest, as best I can tell, is he has posters that are advertising for info

21:12.840 --> 21:18.880
wars and you record yourself putting them up faces or something.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.200
I think this is a weird contest.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.040
I think it's just, Hey, could you be my street team?

21:24.040 --> 21:30.760
I think what we've realized here is that Alex is paid by big disease in order to spread

21:30.760 --> 21:31.760
disease.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.400
Man, it's, it's really weird.

21:33.400 --> 21:39.320
You would think that somebody engaging responsibly with the topics they were covering wouldn't

21:39.320 --> 21:44.960
be like, Hey, let me try and use this as a cheap stunt meme promotional opportunity.

21:44.960 --> 21:51.900
Here's a possible pandemic that could murder and incapacitate millions of people.

21:51.900 --> 21:55.920
We need a contest to advertise my shit based on that.

21:55.920 --> 21:56.920
Yeah.

21:56.920 --> 21:57.920
That's a good dude.

21:57.920 --> 21:58.920
Yup.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.600
So, um, to Alex's credit or not, I'm not sure I'll let you decide.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.160
He doesn't spend the entire show talking about Ebola.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
Well, that's nice.

22:06.160 --> 22:10.280
He also gets around to some nonsense narratives about how Christians are under attack.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.280
Oh, that's good.

22:11.280 --> 22:17.560
We have just absolutely over the top important news on the Ebola front, on the economic front,

22:17.560 --> 22:24.680
on the second amendment front, on the police state front with Houston, literally trying

22:24.680 --> 22:31.880
to intimidate churches and to not giving sermons that criticize transsexual, uh, behavior or

22:31.880 --> 22:36.760
homosexuality and a lot of libertarian groups have been coming out.

22:36.760 --> 22:43.260
And even though they are open to other lifestyles, cause the libertarians, uh, they are defending

22:43.260 --> 22:47.400
these preachers because if you're going to have your right to live the way you want somebody

22:47.400 --> 22:55.000
else has to have their right to live and, and, and, and speak as they see fit, flaming

22:55.000 --> 23:01.600
authoritarianism pun intended out of the Houston mayor and the rest of them at best that's

23:01.600 --> 23:03.920
wordplay suing churches.

23:03.920 --> 23:08.600
This is what Europe and Canada are doing.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.980
This is the model.

23:09.980 --> 23:13.860
Everything you see with political correctness out of Europe and Canada is coming here.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.720
They arrest preachers that criticize homosexuality.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.640
So this isn't going to surprise you, but Alex is lying about this story.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.760
I'm not surprised.

23:20.760 --> 23:26.160
Here's what happened in 2014 Houston passed an equal rights ordinance that included protections

23:26.160 --> 23:31.960
for members of the LGBTQ community in terms of housing, employment and what have you.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.660
This was on the vanguard of the right wing panic about trans people in bathrooms.

23:35.660 --> 23:39.840
So one of the hot button issues was that, uh, according to an article in the Washington

23:39.840 --> 23:46.060
post quote, transgender people barred access to a restroom would be able to file a discrimination

23:46.060 --> 23:47.060
complaint.

23:47.060 --> 23:48.060
Right.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.560
It's worth noting that religious entities were also exempted from this ruling.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.440
So they weren't even, so they weren't even involved, right?

23:54.440 --> 23:58.360
A group of citizens filed a lawsuit aimed at repealing the ordinance as part of the

23:58.360 --> 24:03.540
uh, and as part of that lawsuit, quote, city attorneys issued subpoenas to five local pastors

24:03.540 --> 24:06.380
during the cases discovery phase.

24:06.380 --> 24:10.300
These pastors were alleged to have connections to the people who filed the lawsuit and were

24:10.300 --> 24:12.680
active in the effort to repeal the ordinance.

24:12.680 --> 24:17.880
So the attorneys requested quote, all speeches, presentations or sermons related to hero.

24:17.880 --> 24:22.620
That's the ordinance, the petition mayor, a niece, Parker, homosexuality or gender identity

24:22.620 --> 24:27.740
prepared by delivered by revised by or approved by you or in your possession.

24:27.740 --> 24:28.740
Sure.

24:28.740 --> 24:31.920
The question that was being posed by these subpoenas were whether or not these pastors

24:31.920 --> 24:35.960
were using their churches as political organizing grounds, which would put their tax exempt

24:35.960 --> 24:37.400
status in jeopardy.

24:37.400 --> 24:42.800
Since Texas exempt churches, quote, are not allowed to engage in partisan politics.

24:42.800 --> 24:47.780
By October 16th, the day that Alex is here on air, controversy had been raging about

24:47.780 --> 24:52.300
this and the subpoena was revised to just ask for quote, all speeches or presentations

24:52.300 --> 24:58.320
related to hero or the petition prepared by delivered by revised by or approved by you

24:58.320 --> 24:59.560
or in your possession.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
Right.

25:00.560 --> 25:04.640
And as we know now that we live in the future, the government really cracked down on that

25:04.640 --> 25:10.200
and churches were no longer allowed to advocate for political positions from the pulpit.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.280
That would just be wrong, Dan.

25:12.280 --> 25:17.820
Didn't you see so many churches across this country after Trump was elected?

25:17.820 --> 25:22.460
Didn't you see them lose their five oh one C three status all over the place for advocating

25:22.460 --> 25:23.920
for political positions?

25:23.920 --> 25:25.360
I, it's just terrible.

25:25.360 --> 25:30.800
Anyway, this is a complex topic that gets into a lot of those issues more than anything

25:30.800 --> 25:31.800
else.

25:31.800 --> 25:36.040
You know, you could make an, uh, an argument that there was overreach and over broadness

25:36.040 --> 25:39.520
in terms of the subpoenas that were, uh, put out by the city attorneys.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.520
Oh sure.

25:40.520 --> 25:43.380
I think that is a fair position you could take.

25:43.380 --> 25:46.160
But Alex is reporting this as like they're suing these churches.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.240
No, no.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.960
Someone sued the city and the city is doing discovery.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
Yeah.

25:51.960 --> 25:56.120
Anyway, he just wants to take this and uh, you know, he wants to boil it down into a

25:56.120 --> 26:01.160
misrepresentation that's easier for his audience to understand and more importantly, be mad

26:01.160 --> 26:02.160
about.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.160
Yeah.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.400
Just trying to make it about fucking out of control PC culture.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
It's nonsense.

26:06.400 --> 26:11.760
It would be nice if Christ had lived and just been super cool because then maybe Christians

26:11.760 --> 26:16.720
wouldn't constantly feel like playing the victim is the only way to deal with life.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.720
I don't know.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.000
What if Christ was just a cool dude?

26:19.000 --> 26:22.620
What if Christ was just like the Buddha and he got old and everybody's like, man, you

26:22.620 --> 26:23.620
kicked ass.

26:23.620 --> 26:24.620
Good work.

26:24.620 --> 26:26.120
That would be great.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.360
He uh, invented hang loose.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.360
Exactly.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.760
First person to say cowabunga.

26:31.760 --> 26:38.920
So Jordan, I gotta say one of the things I didn't expect, um, on this episode as I was

26:38.920 --> 26:44.400
getting into it, because you know, Ebola is a pretty big topic and it certainly has mirrors

26:44.400 --> 26:50.040
and echoes in our current, uh, COVID-19, uh, situation, but I didn't expect as a large

26:50.040 --> 26:53.240
portion of this episode would end up becoming a movie review.

26:53.240 --> 26:56.440
That I believe and did expect.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.440
Yeah.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.440
I was a little bit surprised.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.400
Is he still on Oblivion?

27:00.400 --> 27:01.400
No.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
Okay.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.520
The movie review is about the movie Kill the Messenger about Gary Webb.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
Okay.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.400
It's very personal for Alex because he apparently knew Gary Webb.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.040
Oh, I did not know that.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.760
Now, this might be a little too personal.

27:17.760 --> 27:18.760
Okay.

27:18.760 --> 27:25.160
Alex seems to be dealing with some stuff after watching this movie and he might make a confession

27:25.160 --> 27:29.320
that first of all, I don't believe is true, but if true proves that Alex Jones is the

27:29.320 --> 27:37.200
worst fucking, uh, outlaw radio truth teller, whistleblower guy, listen to this bullshit.

27:37.200 --> 27:42.320
I went and saw Kill the Messenger last night and I expected it to be a whitewash.

27:42.320 --> 27:48.960
I expected it to imply that he killed himself and it was absolute truth because I remember

27:48.960 --> 27:51.600
Gary Webb being on the show more than 10 times.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.520
I had all these incredible conversations with Gary Webb off air.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.560
He wanted me to build a website for him.

27:57.560 --> 28:02.000
He sent me all these documents that the CIA had broken in his house a bunch to try to

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
get.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.800
I was too busy making films and making babies with my wife.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.400
He was, I remember he called back the last time I talked to him a few months before he

28:13.400 --> 28:16.320
committed suicide and he said, Hey man, Alex, I thought you had the courage to put this

28:16.320 --> 28:17.320
up and do something.

28:17.320 --> 28:21.500
I said, yeah, there's thousands of pages of this stuff and a lot of this is court records

28:21.500 --> 28:22.500
and stuff.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.480
And I go, I guess I'll put it out because, well, I thought you've got balls.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.840
I mean, these are epic conversations I have with Gary Webb.

28:28.840 --> 28:35.880
Now a hit movie out about him and it was so surreal to be sitting there in the movie theater.

28:35.880 --> 28:41.000
I ignored that guy and knowing his whole story and it was so accurate.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.640
I am baffled by this movie review.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.360
I think there's a small part of Alex that's pissed off that he's not in the movie.

28:48.360 --> 28:52.920
And then second, it's very weird that he's like, yeah, you know what?

28:52.920 --> 28:59.080
I had that dude giving me all this secret documentation that the CIA was trying to kill

28:59.080 --> 29:00.440
him for having.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.720
I was busy, I didn't do shit with him.

29:03.720 --> 29:10.080
I was making babies with my wife, so I wasn't interested in those thousands of CIA coveted

29:10.080 --> 29:15.280
documents that would blow the lid off of everything.

29:15.280 --> 29:18.520
But come on guys, she's ovulating.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.800
What am I going to do?

29:19.800 --> 29:21.840
I do think this isn't true.

29:21.840 --> 29:26.560
Like I think that his story is not true, but it's interesting the way he gets himself off

29:26.560 --> 29:28.520
the hook for having not broken things.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.960
Like, he's like, I was busy, I was making documentaries.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.640
I was busy breaking other stories.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.700
I didn't have time for this.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.740
So let me ask you a question.

29:37.740 --> 29:42.160
In the beginning, I thought I heard him say, I thought they were going to whitewash it

29:42.160 --> 29:45.240
and heavily imply that he did commit suicide.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.280
Which he did.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.600
And then he said, which suggests to me that he thinks he didn't.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.600
He did.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.600
Yeah, Alex thinks that he didn't.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.120
But then later on, he said a few days before he committed suicide.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.120
Right.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.120
Okay.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.120
Yep.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.120
All right.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.120
So.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.120
Yeah.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.120
Okay.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.040
That might've just been Alex's like sort of subconscious sneaking through and being

30:04.040 --> 30:05.040
like, you know.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.040
You know he killed himself.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.040
He wasn't murdered.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.040
Come on, man.

30:08.040 --> 30:13.480
You know, one of the reasons I think this is all bullshit is this.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.480
I'm not even here bragging.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.280
Oh my gosh, this show is important.

30:16.280 --> 30:22.960
I felt incredibly guilty.

30:22.960 --> 30:25.880
That I don't even know where that disk is.

30:25.880 --> 30:33.000
That CD-ROM that I opened up and it was just, I don't know how to process all this stuff.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.440
I need to tear apart our storage buildings and find that.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.600
And then I don't even want to talk about how I had that disk because you're like killing

30:40.600 --> 30:42.760
people over this stuff.

30:42.760 --> 30:47.000
And then I went and searched last night when I got home, I went to bed and then I woke

30:47.000 --> 30:52.680
up in the middle of the night and went and searched for like an hour at 3 AM, 4 AM.

30:52.680 --> 30:56.860
And I couldn't even find one interview I did with Gary Webb.

30:56.860 --> 31:00.160
Kind of makes me think maybe you didn't interview him.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.160
I mean, I bet he did.

31:01.160 --> 31:07.200
I could see that absolutely having happened, but like I wonder at a certain point, you

31:07.200 --> 31:11.280
kind of got to wonder, it's like, did you imagine all of this?

31:11.280 --> 31:13.320
Did you dream this?

31:13.320 --> 31:16.720
Did you have a quiet conversation with Gary Webb in your head?

31:16.720 --> 31:17.720
Yeah.

31:17.720 --> 31:22.260
You know, like you have the CIA to kill anybody who has all this information and like Alex

31:22.260 --> 31:26.160
has the CD-ROM that Gary Webb had given him.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.320
CIA was following him.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.780
They wouldn't know that he made the handoff with Alex, absolutely.

31:30.780 --> 31:34.400
But the CIA is like, fuck it, Alex is just going to lose it.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.400
Come on.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.520
I mean, he's got a, it's in an AOL sheath.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.680
We don't need to worry about this.

31:39.680 --> 31:43.120
That fucking dude doesn't even have a file cabinet.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.720
Look, I was surveilling him the other night.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.600
He's just too busy fucking his wife.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.800
They're trying to make babies.

31:48.800 --> 31:49.800
I'm sorry.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.360
He just doesn't have time to expose us.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.360
It's not even like that disc.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.280
It's not even in an AOL sleeve.

31:55.280 --> 32:01.480
It's in a Moody Blues album cover that he is just, it's lost.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.120
He's never going to find that thing.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.120
16-bit floppy.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.680
That's what he's got.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.180
This is weird.

32:07.180 --> 32:08.180
I don't know.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.520
I put myself even in the foot shoes.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.520
The foot shoes.

32:12.520 --> 32:13.520
The foot shoes.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.520
Of Alex.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
I imagine.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.640
When there was only one set of foot shoes.

32:17.640 --> 32:18.640
That's when I was carrying you.

32:18.640 --> 32:22.080
That's when I was carrying Gary Webb.

32:22.080 --> 32:31.280
I feel like if there was a bone of authenticity in Alex's body, the second that the guy who

32:31.280 --> 32:39.000
wrote Dark Alliance is giving you a CD of secret documents.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.660
You drop everything.

32:40.660 --> 32:41.920
This is a priority.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.120
Do you remember when Snowden released shit?

32:45.120 --> 32:49.280
Every news organization was like, okay, we're going to put 15 people on this.

32:49.280 --> 32:53.080
We're all going to read every single one of these documents and we're going to write stories

32:53.080 --> 32:54.480
about it immediately.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.640
Greenwald wasn't like, I'm making Police State 2000.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.640
I'm busy.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.640
I'm sorry, guys.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.640
I'm busy.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.640
I want to start a family.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.640
I'm adopting kids.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.640
Yeah.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.640
Yeah.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.640
What am I supposed to do?

33:05.640 --> 33:09.600
Have you ever tried to adopt kids in America from Brazil?

33:09.600 --> 33:13.560
I don't want to shit on the idea of prioritizing family and what have you.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.560
That's all good.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.560
Sure.

33:15.560 --> 33:19.140
If you're somebody who fancies yourself an investigative journalist whose mission it

33:19.140 --> 33:25.840
is to get to the bottom of the nefarious doings of the globalists, this behavior strikes me

33:25.840 --> 33:27.640
as very out of character.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.960
The tip of the spear was busy elsewhere, if you know what I'm saying.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.440
That spear was a.

33:34.440 --> 33:39.000
So there's a sense that I got from listening to this that like Alex seems to think that

33:39.000 --> 33:41.840
that movie might be about him.

33:41.840 --> 33:46.360
And then watching how they demonized him and how they tried to kill his name before they

33:46.360 --> 33:56.040
physically killed him and experiencing a lot of this myself, it was a surreal, I've never

33:56.040 --> 34:04.120
gone and seen a movie where from what I know, it was so incredibly accurate and so incredibly

34:04.120 --> 34:05.320
sad.

34:05.320 --> 34:12.000
And then I resonated with it because they always make it about the individual.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.280
If they can't disprove your facts, they just demonize and destroy the individual themselves.

34:17.280 --> 34:21.320
And I got a sick feeling in my stomach as I realized that the clocks just tick until

34:21.320 --> 34:26.480
they come and shoot me in the head twice or plant drugs on me or shoot me at a checkpoint

34:26.480 --> 34:27.480
or something.

34:27.480 --> 34:34.140
And it just it made me sad to watch all the cowards, his editors and like you, you literally

34:34.140 --> 34:41.040
said that you didn't have Jesus Christ, so sad for watching his cowards.

34:41.040 --> 34:45.320
He gave all those documents to those editors and they didn't do shit with them.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.920
They told him, we're not going to put those out.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.360
He gave a CD-ROM to every one of his editors.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.360
A little bit of an asshole.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
A bunch of cowards.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.960
A little bit of an asshole-ish review.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.760
I mean, I was just out of, I was just doing a documentary.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.760
Sure.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
I'm not a coward.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.760
Yeah.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.760
Hey, look, I don't get into Shadowgate.

35:01.760 --> 35:02.760
Yeah, exactly.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.560
Look, I don't get into that kind of deep shit.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.240
Turns out that behavior has been pretty consistent throughout his career.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.200
I think he might be faking a lot of this.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.640
I think he might be.

35:11.640 --> 35:17.240
So we get back to Ebola here and this clip to me was actually one of the more interesting,

35:17.240 --> 35:21.440
the glimpses into how Alex operates in these circumstances.

35:21.440 --> 35:26.120
The people that are supposed to be cleaning the aircraft are told that they can't wear

35:26.120 --> 35:28.120
masks and gloves.

35:28.120 --> 35:34.080
Aircraft coming in out of West Africa in some cases with vomit in them because it'll quote

35:34.080 --> 35:35.080
scare people.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.800
We're going to get to those articles in a moment.

35:37.800 --> 35:42.920
Experts offer steps for avoiding public hysteria, a different contagious threat.

35:42.920 --> 35:47.320
So we've been talking about the hysteria being a bigger problem than Ebola itself.

35:47.320 --> 35:52.200
Well, now the New York Times is reporting on it today.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.840
I just thought that the juxtaposition of those two stories is fascinating.

35:55.840 --> 35:59.520
In the first one, Alex is claiming that vomit filled airplanes are arriving in the United

35:59.520 --> 36:03.560
States from West Africa and not being cleaned, obviously trying to create the impression

36:03.560 --> 36:04.960
in his audience's mind.

36:04.960 --> 36:09.000
There are so many more cases of Ebola in the United States than were being told.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Correct.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.120
It's a narrative that can really only lead to people freaking out and behaving irrationally.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.120
Right.

36:15.120 --> 36:19.720
But the New York Times says that freaking out in hysteria is just as bad as the Ebola.

36:19.720 --> 36:25.120
And Alex, he's saying then that Infowars has been saying all along that public hysteria

36:25.120 --> 36:26.120
is a bigger problem.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.480
Don't freak out about this!

36:27.480 --> 36:30.600
Ebola's everywhere, but freaking out is crazy.

36:30.600 --> 36:35.600
How can he possibly not understand that everything he does exists only to heighten hysteria?

36:35.600 --> 36:36.600
Yeah.

36:36.600 --> 36:40.400
Thinking about how the border is wide open and vomit planes are arriving is not only

36:40.400 --> 36:44.080
factually untrue, but it's also designed to scare people.

36:44.080 --> 36:47.800
Alex understands that, and it's one of the things that he does on his show that I think

36:47.800 --> 36:49.720
is incredibly abusive.

36:49.720 --> 36:55.200
It's that trying to push and pull simultaneously in people's minds, and it's not good.

36:55.200 --> 37:00.240
No, he's in a weird, almost experiment of...

37:00.240 --> 37:05.480
His experiment to me of listening to his show would be somebody sitting in a chair strapped

37:05.480 --> 37:09.760
down and every five minutes just a little jolt is given to the emotional center of their

37:09.760 --> 37:15.560
brain, and you just have to sit there for four hours and feel this constant emotional

37:15.560 --> 37:16.560
pressure.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.560
Yeah.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.560
Yeah?

37:18.560 --> 37:19.560
Yeah.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.560
In my experience, I don't think...

37:20.560 --> 37:21.560
That's not wrong.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.560
It's not that far off.

37:22.560 --> 37:26.400
I disconnect from it so it doesn't affect me as much listening to it.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.120
You removed that little part of your brain.

37:28.120 --> 37:32.160
I imagine that that part of the brain would be very antagonized if you believed anything

37:32.160 --> 37:33.160
he said.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.160
Yeah, totally.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.560
But since I don't, I'm a little bit immune.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.960
You got rubber on your brain.

37:38.960 --> 37:39.960
Yeah.

37:39.960 --> 37:45.040
Alex is kind of right in some sense that public hysteria is a very serious concern when it

37:45.040 --> 37:47.120
comes to public health matters.

37:47.120 --> 37:52.360
It's just that in this case, he's one of the most hysterical voices you can imagine.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.360
It's nonsense.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.280
No, and it's cruel.

37:55.280 --> 38:00.100
It's cruel to be like, hey, hysteria is crazy, and you're gonna die!

38:00.100 --> 38:01.100
Like okay, man.

38:01.100 --> 38:02.100
But maybe not.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.100
You won't die.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.100
Maybe not.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.100
The human's killing you!

38:05.100 --> 38:06.100
But maybe not.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.100
Bad!

38:07.100 --> 38:08.240
Now hold on.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.240
What's up?

38:09.240 --> 38:17.400
I thought, listening to the original episode about this period of time and the Ebola situation,

38:17.400 --> 38:21.480
and listening to the beginning of this episode, I thought, you know, this is horrible, this

38:21.480 --> 38:27.480
is irresponsible, and then I think it's kind of tasteless to have this Ebola meme contest.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.920
Right, right, right, right.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.480
But I didn't think it was that weird.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.880
It's not weird enough for Alex Jones.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.880
Here's where it gets weird.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.880
Okay, good.

38:36.880 --> 38:42.000
They'd first said that it was her fault and she shouldn't have done it, but now it's admitted

38:42.000 --> 38:50.780
in NBC News that an Ebola patient who contacted the CDC before a flight agency says was told

38:50.780 --> 38:55.640
that she could fly even though she was an Ebola nurse, and even though she told them

38:55.640 --> 38:56.640
she had a fever.

38:56.640 --> 39:01.000
By the way, I treated the guy that has Ebola, and I'm sick.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.440
Can I fly?

39:02.440 --> 39:03.440
You can fly.

39:03.440 --> 39:07.440
That's like saying, my dog has rabies, and it's foaming at the mouth.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.560
Should I put it into a schoolyard of kids?

39:09.560 --> 39:13.560
Yes, put the dog with rabies into the schoolyard.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.280
Or I found a bat crawling around hissing on the ground.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.800
Should I pick it up and kiss it?

39:18.800 --> 39:21.000
Yes, that's a good idea.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.200
There's a cliff by my house, a thousand feet to Jagged Bottom.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.680
Should I jump off without a parachute?

39:25.680 --> 39:26.680
Yes, jump off immediately.

39:26.680 --> 39:27.680
You have four more examples.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.480
Ring, hi, I'm a nurse that treated the Ebola patient, CDC.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.480
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

39:31.480 --> 39:32.480
Yeah, we know who you are.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.480
Yeah, you're all over the news.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.480
Yeah.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.480
I'm going to fly.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.200
Of course, this time it wasn't on the news, just had been around an Ebola patient.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.640
So I was treating an Ebola patient.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
I'm going to fly.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.640
I have a fever.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.600
Oh, but dearie, that's a great idea.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.440
They're not just turning off the defaults.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.180
They're sending the Ebola kids to school.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.360
They're not cleaning up the apartment.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.520
Something weird is going on.

39:53.520 --> 39:58.240
And why are nurses getting it, but the family isn't getting it?

39:58.240 --> 40:06.360
Either they're covering up that they have it, or it's what that CIA whistleblower said

40:06.360 --> 40:12.260
back in the middle of last month here, Mr. Steele, and we should cue that clip up later.

40:12.260 --> 40:17.080
He said he believed they would release a biological stimulant that wasn't Ebola, but would make

40:17.080 --> 40:19.640
people sick or even kill them to create a false flag.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.640
There we go.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.160
It's a false flag.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.160
Possibly.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.160
Hold on.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.280
Is that Mr. Steele, our buddy?

40:25.280 --> 40:26.280
That's Robert David Steele.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
Oh yeah, it is.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.440
I was about to say, yep, that one's got the, yep.

40:30.440 --> 40:35.120
Multiple time Project Camelot guest who Alex had to disavow after he claimed on Infowars

40:35.120 --> 40:39.520
that the globalists had children enslaved on Mars bases, Robert David Steele.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.240
That dude's credibility is incredibly low.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.240
Yeah.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.240
Well, you know what?

40:44.240 --> 40:47.520
When you can't disprove his facts, Dan, you try and go after the guy.

40:47.520 --> 40:51.120
And I can clearly see you just taking this to a personal place.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.720
You can't prove that it's not a bioweapon.

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
Sure.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.280
Not my job.

40:56.280 --> 41:00.480
Steele had been on Alex's show in September to speculate about the possibility of a false

41:00.480 --> 41:02.160
flag Ebola attack.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.680
But the fact that he was creating narratives about Ebola at that point isn't really all

41:05.680 --> 41:06.920
that weird.

41:06.920 --> 41:11.880
The first case in West Africa from this outbreak was reported in December 2013.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.840
And by March 2014, there was spreading happening.

41:14.840 --> 41:20.040
By July, it had reached the capital cities of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

41:20.040 --> 41:24.640
And according to the CDC, quote, this was the first time Ebola extended out from more

41:24.640 --> 41:30.120
isolated rural areas and into densely populated urban centers, providing an unprecedented

41:30.120 --> 41:31.740
opportunity for transmission.

41:31.740 --> 41:35.940
So Ebola is on the brain as far as any infectious disease is concerned, yeah.

41:35.940 --> 41:40.960
By August, there were Ebola scares being reported to hospitals in the United States.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.600
According to the advisory board's timeline, quote, before the end of the month, more than

41:44.600 --> 41:49.640
60 hospitals reported some type of scare to the CDC, but none of the tests sent to the

41:49.640 --> 41:52.140
agency returned positive for the virus.

41:52.140 --> 41:55.000
So at this point, it was in people's minds.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Right, right, right.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.920
No, that's what you would be talking about.

41:57.920 --> 42:02.520
If you were going to say there's an infectious disease coming to the United States, you're

42:02.520 --> 42:03.520
going to say Ebola.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.840
It's 100% what you would do.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.400
Yeah, you're not going to be like, it's the flu.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.440
No, everybody's thinking about Ebola and is worried about it.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.780
Robert David Steele had every reason to shoot the shot when he did.

42:13.780 --> 42:17.720
There was growing insecurity around the outbreak, and it was affecting the psyche of the American

42:17.720 --> 42:18.720
public.

42:18.720 --> 42:22.240
If a case did end up coming to the United States, he would look like he was way ahead

42:22.240 --> 42:24.680
of the story and he had a narrative in place.

42:24.680 --> 42:29.000
If no case ever arrived here, he could just ignore it or claim that the globalists decided

42:29.000 --> 42:31.560
to go a different way with their evil plans.

42:31.560 --> 42:36.520
There's no downside to this kind of spitballing in a consequence-free environment like Infowars.

42:36.520 --> 42:37.520
Yeah, exactly.

42:37.520 --> 42:42.400
As for the story about the nurse on the plane, Alex isn't making up that NBC News reported

42:42.400 --> 42:46.280
that she did in fact check in with the CDC before getting on the plane.

42:46.280 --> 42:50.740
The problem is that Alex is acting like the CDC has a staff of like 12 people and everyone

42:50.740 --> 42:52.940
knows everything that's going on.

42:52.940 --> 42:57.180
This very article that Alex is referencing explains how everything happened.

42:57.180 --> 43:02.020
At the time, it was believed that this nurse had worn all the appropriate protective gear,

43:02.020 --> 43:06.880
and as such, she was considered a lower risk category of person, technically titled quote

43:06.880 --> 43:08.840
uncertain risk.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.720
Before she flew, the nurse called the CDC and talked to a staffer who quote, looked

43:12.720 --> 43:17.320
on the agency's website for guidance, the spokesperson said.

43:17.320 --> 43:21.360
The category for uncertain risk has guidance saying a person could fly commercially if

43:21.360 --> 43:25.960
they did not meet the threshold of a temperature of 100.4.

43:25.960 --> 43:29.600
She had a slight fever, but it was below that reading, so technically she wouldn't have

43:29.600 --> 43:31.560
been barred from flying.

43:31.560 --> 43:35.280
Director Frieden didn't know that she had contacted the CDC when he made his comment

43:35.280 --> 43:37.040
that she shouldn't have flown.

43:37.040 --> 43:43.420
From the NBC News article quote, the spokesperson says he believes Frieden said that because

43:43.420 --> 43:48.640
it should have been common sense to Vincent that she should not fly with a slight temperature.

43:48.640 --> 43:52.560
Even though we have a CDC guideline that says you're fine.

43:52.560 --> 43:58.240
Yeah, I mean look, don't get me wrong, I'm not going to defend all of that, it's bungled.

43:58.240 --> 44:01.800
It's him kind of saying that the CDC is wrong, not her.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.280
Probably, yeah.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.640
We need better guidelines.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.640
Yeah, exactly.

44:05.640 --> 44:09.400
This guideline is clearly oversight of some kind.

44:09.400 --> 44:15.480
I can't see anything more responsible, if you are this person, than literally going

44:15.480 --> 44:21.480
direct to the CD-fucking-C. Not going to the website, I think it also frustrates me a little

44:21.480 --> 44:22.480
bit.

44:22.480 --> 44:23.480
The staffer went to the website.

44:23.480 --> 44:24.480
The staffer went to the website.

44:24.480 --> 44:25.480
I don't like that at all.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
That's not lost on me either.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.480
That's not good.

44:27.480 --> 44:28.480
I don't like that at all.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.480
No.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.480
Seems like maybe, in this case, you should have rotted up the flagpole.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.040
Yeah, yeah.

44:34.040 --> 44:39.680
I see no fault of hers at all, other than just being like, why are you flying?

44:39.680 --> 44:47.320
I see bases being covered in terms of like, clearly no one was acting with malicious intent.

44:47.320 --> 44:48.320
Absolutely not.

44:48.320 --> 44:55.560
And there wasn't even like overt negligence, it's just this is how an oversight can happen.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.880
Maybe we should revise our guidelines.

44:57.880 --> 45:02.900
It seems like, basically what I'm saying is iffy decisions happened, but it makes sense

45:02.900 --> 45:05.280
how everything happened the way it did.

45:05.280 --> 45:10.680
There's certainly not enough here to justify speculating this is a false flag outbreak.

45:10.680 --> 45:13.960
I would argue the details would suggest anything but a false flag.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.240
Yeah, and Jordan, I don't know if you're picking up on this, but from where I'm sitting, that

45:17.240 --> 45:19.080
sounds hysterical as shit.

45:19.080 --> 45:20.760
Ah, why?

45:20.760 --> 45:21.760
Oh, God.

45:21.760 --> 45:29.520
Look, false flags happen, honestly, it's more hysterical for it to not be a false flag.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.960
Because then it's something surprising.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.440
As we know, false flags happen every day.

45:33.440 --> 45:34.560
Does this sound hysterical?

45:34.560 --> 45:35.560
Let's see.

45:35.560 --> 45:37.680
Also, does this sound familiar?

45:37.680 --> 45:38.940
Okay.

45:38.940 --> 45:41.200
Let's continue here.

45:41.200 --> 45:51.480
911 emergency dispatcher's instructed not to say Ebola over the radio.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.220
That's out of Fox News DC.

45:54.220 --> 46:00.020
They're being told not to create panic and are being given a secret code to describe

46:00.020 --> 46:01.020
Ebola.

46:01.020 --> 46:02.240
See, the cover-up's already on.

46:02.240 --> 46:06.280
As I said, Ebola probably is already spreading in the US.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.240
They had to let it in and let it breed first, and then they'll say they don't know where

46:10.240 --> 46:14.260
it all began or where it started and, oh, it's all Obama's fault.

46:14.260 --> 46:18.240
And it's going to bring in a medical tyranny, forced inoculation, and the Bill and Melinda

46:18.240 --> 46:23.520
Gates Foundation dedicated to population reduction and the Monsanto vaccine they produced.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.080
I'm going to say that again.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.900
Bill Gates, we keep warning you about, people are like, why do you talk about Bill Gates

46:27.900 --> 46:28.900
so much?

46:28.900 --> 46:29.900
Because I've studied him.

46:29.900 --> 46:32.440
He wants to put an Ebola shot in you.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.880
You think that's going to be good for you?

46:33.880 --> 46:35.640
God, it's exactly the same.

46:35.640 --> 46:36.640
Wow.

46:36.640 --> 46:37.640
Yeah.

46:37.640 --> 46:38.640
Jesus.

46:38.640 --> 46:39.640
It's shockingly the same.

46:39.640 --> 46:40.640
Yep.

46:40.640 --> 46:47.880
And that probably felt just as real to his audience in 2014 as it does to people listening

46:47.880 --> 46:49.320
to him now.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.320
Yep.

46:51.320 --> 46:52.320
It's outrageous.

46:52.320 --> 46:57.800
It's just that circumstances were handled differently and, of course, Ebola and COVID-19

46:57.800 --> 46:58.800
are different.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.560
They transmit differently.

47:01.560 --> 47:06.040
They require different responses.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.040
I heard that.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.520
I was like, this is amazing.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.920
It's almost a script.

47:11.920 --> 47:17.080
It almost felt like you could just take Ebola out and put COVID or coronavirus in and it

47:17.080 --> 47:19.320
would have just been exactly the same.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.320
Anything.

47:20.320 --> 47:21.320
Anything.

47:21.320 --> 47:22.320
It is kind of-

47:22.320 --> 47:23.840
Seven years ago.

47:23.840 --> 47:34.120
It is, I think, illustrative of the level of power that Alex and his ilk had in 2014

47:34.120 --> 47:38.240
as opposed to in 2019.

47:38.240 --> 47:43.680
That level of influence was far lesser and their effect was far lesser.

47:43.680 --> 47:49.880
It's hard not to look at this as a... And it's not, again, there are different diseases.

47:49.880 --> 47:52.660
It's not a one-to-one comparison by any stretch.

47:52.660 --> 47:58.400
But it is hard not to look at the difference between 2014 and 2019 and think, no one should

47:58.400 --> 48:03.200
be held accountable for, at the very least, negligence.

48:03.200 --> 48:07.760
This is truly a fucked up thing that people need to be held accountable for.

48:07.760 --> 48:11.780
Well, I think that one of the differences that you see is that people responded kind

48:11.780 --> 48:13.680
of more appropriately- That's what I'm saying about negligence.

48:13.680 --> 48:21.380
To people like Alex at that time, or at least people who are actually making decisions and

48:21.380 --> 48:22.380
being adults.

48:22.380 --> 48:25.360
We would be like, oh, I don't care.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.480
And the president wasn't repeating things Alex said.

48:28.480 --> 48:29.480
Yeah.

48:29.480 --> 48:30.480
So that's nice.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.480
Yeah.

48:31.480 --> 48:36.760
And I think it was better.

48:36.760 --> 48:37.760
One could make that argument.

48:37.760 --> 48:38.760
I'm gonna.

48:38.760 --> 48:39.760
Yeah.

48:39.760 --> 48:42.120
I don't think it would be a hard one to convince me of.

48:42.120 --> 48:45.420
So now, if you're somebody who's, I don't know, in the past and you're listening to

48:45.420 --> 48:49.120
Alex and you're taking some of the stuff that he's saying about Ebola seriously, I would

48:49.120 --> 48:52.480
say, maybe you should hear this and be like, I'm going to turn this off.

48:52.480 --> 48:56.120
I mean, I hate to get gross here, but you've heard about the phenomenon in government buildings

48:56.120 --> 49:00.080
suddenly that people are peeing on the walls and going to the bathroom and cubby holes

49:00.080 --> 49:04.600
and in the hallways, even though the bathrooms are working perfectly fine and smearing it

49:04.600 --> 49:05.980
all over the walls.

49:05.980 --> 49:07.720
This is what mental patients do.

49:07.720 --> 49:12.560
This is what people who are above the law start doing, is just running around going

49:12.560 --> 49:17.760
to the bathroom as poop bandits as they're known.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.460
This is what has now happened.

49:19.460 --> 49:20.460
This is what's happening.

49:20.460 --> 49:22.240
There's poop bandits.

49:22.240 --> 49:26.320
The government is so out of control and drunk on power that they were poop bandits now.

49:26.320 --> 49:27.320
Hold on.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.320
Hold on.

49:28.320 --> 49:29.320
I just literally wrote a screenplay.

49:29.320 --> 49:30.880
Give me one second.

49:30.880 --> 49:31.880
Jesus.

49:31.880 --> 49:35.080
So I didn't know what Alex was talking about and this seemed really silly.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.600
So I decided to look into it and see if I could figure it out.

49:37.600 --> 49:38.600
Sure.

49:38.600 --> 49:39.600
I figured it out.

49:39.600 --> 49:45.160
So in late August, 2014, there was, there were some stories going around about a particular

49:45.160 --> 49:50.800
EPA office in Denver, which had quote, been beset by roughly a dozen suspected incidents

49:50.800 --> 49:57.920
of restroom shenanigans since late 2013, according to emails, memorandums and incident reports.

49:57.920 --> 49:58.920
Restroom shenanigans.

49:58.920 --> 49:59.920
Yes.

49:59.920 --> 50:00.920
That's fun.

50:00.920 --> 50:04.120
Apparently someone was fucking around and clogging toilets with paper and putting shit

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
in the hallway.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.120
Sure.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.700
Getting up to all sorts of disgusting nonsense.

50:07.700 --> 50:11.480
This was clearly the work of an unstable individual who worked at that office.

50:11.480 --> 50:13.800
Yeah, who is this fucking guy?

50:13.800 --> 50:17.840
But here, Alex is reporting this as some kind of proof of the corrupt decadence of the government

50:17.840 --> 50:18.840
elites.

50:18.840 --> 50:22.360
They're so bored with being tyrants that there's a new phenomenon of everyone shitting in the

50:22.360 --> 50:23.360
hallway.

50:23.360 --> 50:27.920
It's just a weirdo getting his rocks off in a really uncomfortable way.

50:27.920 --> 50:28.920
Yeah.

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
Yeah.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.920
All right.

50:30.920 --> 50:31.920
Okay.

50:31.920 --> 50:35.560
I love like being able to look back in the past and like seeing the way that these stories

50:35.560 --> 50:41.400
get like twisted by Alex into being so much larger than they actually are.

50:41.400 --> 50:47.820
He does in a way create more fantastical, interesting stories because I mean it's obviously

50:47.820 --> 50:51.880
a fairly interesting story that someone's putting shit in the hallway in an NBA building.

50:51.880 --> 50:52.880
Sure.

50:52.880 --> 50:53.880
Sure.

50:53.880 --> 50:54.880
That's kind of interesting.

50:54.880 --> 51:00.160
It's more fun to imagine that our government is run by demon tyrants who are so bored that

51:00.160 --> 51:02.860
they have to shit in the hallway to get off.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.280
It is kind of funny.

51:04.280 --> 51:07.880
It implies a lot more interesting stuff is happening.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.120
See, that's the problem.

51:09.120 --> 51:16.680
I remember when we lived in a world that wasn't so much like Alex's weird dark circus versions

51:16.680 --> 51:19.680
of government, and then we lived in one.

51:19.680 --> 51:20.680
It was bad.

51:20.680 --> 51:21.680
Yep.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.680
Yep.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.680
No good.

51:23.680 --> 51:29.720
So at this point in 2014, you really had like gentlemen speak freely kind of vibe going

51:29.720 --> 51:30.720
on at Infowars.

51:30.720 --> 51:31.720
Oh, that's not good.

51:31.720 --> 51:37.360
They didn't really have the lawsuits to worry about, so things like this happen.

51:37.360 --> 51:40.620
Why no protective gear for a man with Dallas Ebola patient?

51:40.620 --> 51:41.620
We have video of this.

51:41.620 --> 51:43.000
We'll roll some of it in the background.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.320
The video from CBS News is up on Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.

51:47.320 --> 51:52.800
This lends credence to Rob Dew running around the office thinking this is crisis actors

51:52.800 --> 51:58.620
because he's been analyzing video and he's worked at national TV, home shopping network.

51:58.620 --> 52:04.480
You know, he used to be a director there, and so he knows state stuff, and he says that,

52:04.480 --> 52:11.120
you know, why are people not wearing protective gear with the Ebola patient as we have right

52:11.120 --> 52:13.040
there?

52:13.040 --> 52:17.240
And is it people just don't care and they're idiots?

52:17.240 --> 52:18.560
Or is it staged?

52:18.560 --> 52:19.880
Or is there a third possibility?

52:19.880 --> 52:21.040
What would that be?

52:21.040 --> 52:26.640
So there was a video of people putting that nurse into a plane that was making the rounds,

52:26.640 --> 52:30.240
and all but one of the people are wearing hazmat suits.

52:30.240 --> 52:34.240
It definitely looks like fodder for Alex to make a conspiracy out of and for Rob Dew to

52:34.240 --> 52:38.440
use to justify crisis actor theories, but it's not really that crazy when you get down

52:38.440 --> 52:42.640
to it or you ask the question and get an answer from somebody.

52:42.640 --> 52:47.240
This person in the video is not in any direct contact with the patient who's wearing her

52:47.240 --> 52:49.760
own set of protective gear as well.

52:49.760 --> 52:54.040
The chances of transmission are incredibly low based on how Ebola goes from person to

52:54.040 --> 52:55.040
person.

52:55.040 --> 52:59.600
That being said, I wouldn't do what this dude is doing, but that's just because of me.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.780
But it might not be that really fucked up or dangerous.

53:02.780 --> 53:07.400
This very article that Alex is citing in order to talk about the headline includes this passage.

53:07.400 --> 53:12.120
Quote, when a member of the Dallas CDC team was shown in the video and asked if it was

53:12.120 --> 53:16.360
a safe moment or not, he said he didn't have a problem with what he saw.

53:16.360 --> 53:20.560
The situations apparently met CDC protocol because the people in the hazmat suits were

53:20.560 --> 53:24.700
the ones assisting Vincent, and the plainclothes man was not.

53:24.700 --> 53:28.620
The CDC spokesman said that the man maintained an appropriate distance from the patient for

53:28.620 --> 53:32.600
the amount of time on the tarmac, and it must be taken into account that Vincent was

53:32.600 --> 53:35.040
also wearing protective gear.

53:35.040 --> 53:40.280
This is how little some idiot like Rob Do needs to justify denying people's illnesses

53:40.280 --> 53:41.280
and deaths.

53:41.280 --> 53:46.080
He just needs some video that looks strange that he didn't care to look into at all.

53:46.080 --> 53:50.060
The thing that I still have a hard time wrapping my head around that we found out from all

53:50.060 --> 53:57.620
those depositions is at this point in time, apparently only PJ Dubs in the entire InfoWars

53:57.620 --> 54:02.080
sphere was listening to this going like, yeee, this is a bad idea!

54:02.080 --> 54:03.080
Stop!

54:03.080 --> 54:04.080
Blokes!

54:04.080 --> 54:05.080
Stop it, blokes!

54:05.080 --> 54:06.080
Yes, exactly!

54:06.080 --> 54:07.080
Yeah.

54:07.080 --> 54:08.080
Of all people!

54:08.080 --> 54:11.560
You know what, that might not be true, but it's the only one we know for sure.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:12.560 --> 54:15.480
Because there might have been some lower level functionaries who were being like, this is

54:15.480 --> 54:16.480
irresponsible.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.000
There might have been some people who quit, too.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.880
There might have been some people who got fired, yeah.

54:20.880 --> 54:27.800
And I think it's probably in those people's best interests that we not know that.

54:27.800 --> 54:31.960
Because for them to be able to bury the part of their lives that they worked there might

54:31.960 --> 54:32.960
be.

54:32.960 --> 54:33.960
It's important.

54:33.960 --> 54:34.960
Yeah.

54:34.960 --> 54:35.960
Yeah.

54:35.960 --> 54:36.960
Good for them if they've succeeded.

54:36.960 --> 54:37.960
Yeah.

54:37.960 --> 54:38.960
And if they have gone on to live a better life.

54:38.960 --> 54:39.960
Yeah.

54:39.960 --> 54:40.960
Let's hope.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.200
So, it's staged, man.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.280
This stuff's probably staged.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.600
I don't think it's staged, but okay.

54:45.600 --> 54:48.800
I don't know exactly what's going on, but I'll tell you this.

54:48.800 --> 54:53.200
Most of this is staged, it's scripted, and they clearly want Ebola to spread.

54:53.200 --> 54:56.440
Now you can fill in the blank of why.

54:56.440 --> 55:02.040
My head is spinning at this point, and I'm trying to contain my anger, even during the

55:02.040 --> 55:05.680
breaks I'm trying to contain it.

55:05.680 --> 55:08.600
Because I think about how they're trying to bring down this country, now they're trying

55:08.600 --> 55:12.960
to kill our prosperity, it makes me angry.

55:12.960 --> 55:15.280
But you don't want people to be hysterical.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.280
No.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.280
Right?

55:17.280 --> 55:18.280
No, no, no.

55:18.280 --> 55:19.280
I mean, I'm furious because they're killing all of us and destroying proper prosperity.

55:19.280 --> 55:24.080
And they clearly are trying to intentionally spread Ebola, possibly by staging things.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.080
Yeah, but as the New York Times said.

55:26.080 --> 55:30.720
As you said, as the New York Times said, hysteria is a big problem too.

55:30.720 --> 55:32.360
Well, let's keep it grounded.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.360
Yeah, absolutely.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.360
Let's keep this real.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.360
Let's make sure nobody goes too far.

55:36.360 --> 55:40.200
And Bloomberg two days ago was asking, why weren't they sent to the government facilities

55:40.200 --> 55:42.040
that are designed for this?

55:42.040 --> 55:48.580
Because they want it to spread, they want plausible deniability, they probably got sleeper

55:48.580 --> 55:51.040
cells walking around spreading it.

55:51.040 --> 55:54.520
I didn't think they'd use Muslim radicals to bring it in before, I thought that was

55:54.520 --> 55:58.080
just some Islamophobe hype.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.640
But now it's starting to click that God only knows.

56:01.640 --> 56:04.180
I think the other shoe is about to drop.

56:04.180 --> 56:05.560
I think something big is about to happen.

56:05.560 --> 56:07.160
I've been saying that for months.

56:07.160 --> 56:08.160
And now you see this breaking loose.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.160
You can say that for years.

56:09.160 --> 56:12.360
I think what you're seeing right now might be a diversion for nukes they're about to

56:12.360 --> 56:13.360
set off.

56:13.360 --> 56:14.360
Cool.

56:14.360 --> 56:15.360
Remember all the missing nukes?

56:15.360 --> 56:16.360
There you go.

56:16.360 --> 56:17.360
This might be hysterical.

56:17.360 --> 56:18.360
There you go.

56:18.360 --> 56:19.360
That might be an issue.

56:19.360 --> 56:20.360
Might be a little bit hysterical.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.360
That might be a little bit going too far there.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.360
Yeah.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.360
All right.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.360
Hey, guess what?

56:24.360 --> 56:27.880
I believe that the government is intentionally spreading Ebola all over the place and it's

56:27.880 --> 56:28.880
a false flag.

56:28.880 --> 56:31.680
It's also a diversion from nukes they're about to drop.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.620
Listen, I don't know what's going on.

56:33.620 --> 56:36.640
Let me preface by saying I don't know what's going on.

56:36.640 --> 56:42.280
Now let me certainly describe a false flag attack that, and honestly, I'm going to go

56:42.280 --> 56:43.600
with a 50-50 shot.

56:43.600 --> 56:47.520
It's a diversion and you're all going to die immediately.

56:47.520 --> 56:53.600
Let me go over the top in a comically scary scenario that I'm painting for you as a very

56:53.600 --> 56:57.960
distinct possibility based on my years of research about how these globalists operate.

56:57.960 --> 56:58.960
Yep.

56:58.960 --> 57:04.680
Also, this whole Islamophobic thing, I was like, oh no, I'm not going to engage in Islamophobia.

57:04.680 --> 57:08.960
But then I saw a video where a guy was walking on a tarmac, so obviously it's the Islamic

57:08.960 --> 57:09.960
people's fault.

57:09.960 --> 57:10.960
Probably.

57:10.960 --> 57:11.960
Yeah.

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
That makes sense.

57:12.960 --> 57:13.960
It's interesting.

57:13.960 --> 57:19.200
So he's going down this road, you know, like hysteria about Ebola, and then also they're

57:19.200 --> 57:20.600
going to nuke you.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.240
Man, we're just in trouble.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.240
Uh-oh.

57:23.240 --> 57:28.200
It is just, we have enemies in control that there is no doubt that we are in the most

57:28.200 --> 57:31.800
grave danger this country has faced in 240 years.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.520
And I just got hardcore chills.

57:34.520 --> 57:40.720
I got goosebumps on my face right now that the camera can probably pick up.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.160
They are getting ready to drop the hammer.

57:42.160 --> 57:44.160
This is the takedown of the country.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.640
I'm getting my immune system ready.

57:45.640 --> 57:46.640
I know that.

57:46.640 --> 57:47.640
InfoWarsLife.com.

57:47.640 --> 57:48.880
Boom.

57:48.880 --> 57:52.080
I'm getting my immune system ready.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.080
InfoWarsLife.com.

57:53.080 --> 57:54.080
Boom.

57:54.080 --> 57:59.240
See, now that is a good, that's a good little super transition there.

57:59.240 --> 58:03.080
That's a good little ad switch compared to what he does now.

58:03.080 --> 58:06.920
It kind of hurts the preceding passage for me.

58:06.920 --> 58:07.920
Absolutely.

58:07.920 --> 58:14.160
The insanely out of control fear mongering that led up to that kind of.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.160
Well there's that.

58:15.160 --> 58:17.280
The relationship between the two does suffer.

58:17.280 --> 58:23.120
But yes, I guess making people really afraid of a nuke and Ebola would lead them to take

58:23.120 --> 58:24.120
zinc.

58:24.120 --> 58:25.120
Uh, yeah.

58:25.120 --> 58:30.480
I would say that InfoWarsLife plug really only solves one of the two problems that he's

58:30.480 --> 58:31.480
describing.

58:31.480 --> 58:36.840
And in fact I would argue the second one kind of wipes out the gains of the first, if you

58:36.840 --> 58:37.840
will.

58:37.840 --> 58:43.400
So whatever gains we've lost shall now be recouped.

58:43.400 --> 58:46.120
Because Alex has a guest.

58:46.120 --> 58:47.840
And boy howdy.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.840
This guest.

58:48.840 --> 58:49.840
Mic down for this.

58:49.840 --> 58:50.840
Okay.

58:50.840 --> 58:51.840
Because what this guest says.

58:51.840 --> 58:52.840
Spoiler alert.

58:52.840 --> 58:53.840
It's Steve Pajanik.

58:53.840 --> 58:54.840
Okay.

58:54.840 --> 58:55.840
What he says.

58:55.840 --> 58:56.840
It's Stevie Pease?

58:56.840 --> 58:57.840
Yes.

58:57.840 --> 58:58.840
Okay.

58:58.840 --> 58:59.840
Did he cure himself of Ebola?

58:59.840 --> 59:00.840
No.

59:00.840 --> 59:01.840
Oh, dammit.

59:01.840 --> 59:02.840
If we had a complete repeat of the present.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.840
No.

59:03.840 --> 59:04.840
That'd be brutal.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.840
I was hoping.

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
Yeah, that would be great.

59:06.840 --> 59:07.840
No.

59:07.840 --> 59:12.160
They do mention how like he had recently reported from the demilitarized zone for Alex.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.680
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

59:13.680 --> 59:14.680
I recall.

59:14.680 --> 59:17.120
Noted info wars correspondent Steve Pajanik.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.480
I recall that he was in Korea for a while.

59:19.480 --> 59:22.560
He's in the shit.

59:22.560 --> 59:29.560
So Steve is on and they're talking about Ebola and he directly contradicts something that

59:29.560 --> 59:31.120
he says in the present.

59:31.120 --> 59:32.120
Sure.

59:32.120 --> 59:33.420
That's amazing.

59:33.420 --> 59:37.280
You're also a medical doctor on top of that so you can speak to Ebola.

59:37.280 --> 59:38.840
Yes, correctly.

59:38.840 --> 59:44.720
And more importantly, I was trained at Cornell University Medical College between 64 and

59:44.720 --> 59:51.240
1968 by a very competent infectious disease doctor who was really the foremost infectious

59:51.240 --> 59:52.240
disease doctor.

59:52.240 --> 59:53.240
Don't do it.

59:53.240 --> 59:54.240
You see him on television.

59:54.240 --> 59:55.240
That is Anthony Fauci.

59:55.240 --> 59:56.240
God dammit.

59:56.240 --> 59:58.240
The director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.240
Oh, God dammit.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.440
God dammit, Dan.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.080
One you're a witch and two Steve Pajanik is a monster.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.680
Steve, when he's coming on the show now, talks about how incompetent Fauci is.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.120
My fucking God.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120
I swear to you.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.320
I hated him ever since I was at Cornell.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.320
He's a loser.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.600
This is the worst fucking news you could give me.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.120
This is so brutal.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.120
You know who's great?

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.120
Anthony Fauci.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.560
Oh, it breaks my heart.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.840
It really breaks my heart.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:32.000
It's pretty remarkable to dig back a little bit and see like, you know, this mirror, this

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.760
echo is so, the funhouse mirror is the only way I can describe it.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.760
It's so bizarre.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760
Yeah.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:45.520
No, I mean, listen, it's not that I believe the entire world is a prank on me.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.520
But when Steve says stuff like that, I'm just like, eh, you know what?

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.520
This isn't real.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:55.680
So Steve, Steve thinks that the Ebola situation is pretty serious.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.880
And I would say that outside of it being hilarious that he likes Fauci now and then in the present

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.200
claims to have always hated him or whatever.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.200
Yeah.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.960
That's funny, but yeah, a lot of the stuff he's saying, I really don't take much issue

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.960
with.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960
Yeah.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.520
He's saying that this is serious and that Ebola is a very nasty disease and we have

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:18.240
to do what we can to make sure that responsible steps are taken.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.880
This isn't bullshit.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:28.640
But he does have a, I would say possibly maybe not good plan of action.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.720
And what I have recommended and repeatedly recommended is that Dr. Friesen of the CDC

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:41.240
resigned that the CDC be placed on stand down because they really have no, they're not effective.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.560
They've been inefficient and they have no authoritative capacity to demand either the

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.400
city, the state or any institution to do what's mandatory.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:58.200
Instead, I think that Fauci, Dr. Tony Fauci should be given executive privilege or executive

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.520
authority by the president of the United States consistent with 1892 constitutional authority

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.800
on both military powers if need be, because we no longer have the public health service

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800
which is not functioning.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800
Yeah.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:21.260
So Fauci should be given executive control to use military resources to deal with Ebola.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.880
These people are just a joke.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.880
I can't.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.240
I love it.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.880
I can't believe this.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880
Yeah.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.920
This is, this is one of those, you know what's funny?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:38.760
It's almost like, it's almost like the Mandela effect.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.800
It's almost like we're looking back into a past that didn't happen in the present.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800
You know what I'm saying?

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800
Yeah.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.080
Like this is an alternate universe where.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:54.040
But it actually helps me put some pieces together because I always did think it was a little

01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:01.000
bit weird that at the beginning of the coronavirus situation, Alex was painting Fauci as a good

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
guy.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Yeah.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.760
And he said he made some calls and looked into him and hearing Steve talk about him

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.280
like this, talk about Fauci like this at this point makes me think like, oh, Alex called

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.760
Steve and Steve told him he's cool.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.040
Steve was like, this is a good guy.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.240
And then they got the lines from.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.600
The right wing media decided he's a villain.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.640
That's interesting.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.320
Maybe the biggest thing that happens that we need to go back and, and kind of analyze

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:33.400
is the creation of the feedback loop between the right wing propaganda, creating Trump

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.560
and then Trump echoing right wing propaganda back at them.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
Yeah.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.720
I don't know how you would ever, I don't know where you would look for that.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.840
Um, I don't know.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840
Kill all the baby Hitlers.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.200
I think that's what we do.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.680
I blame Drudge.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680
Yeah.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680
I would do that too.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.680
Let's just say it's Drudge.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.680
It's Drudge's fault.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680
It's a bad guy.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.200
So Alex really wants this to be fake and a false flag.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.480
Um, and so I was listening to this, uh, part of the episode and it really felt like Alex

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.760
was essentially begging Steve to be like, come on, help me out, man, please.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.160
Uh, doc, I mean, you believe Sandy hook was staged more and more experts have come out

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:16.080
and agreed, uh, the Boston bombing, uh, you know, rigged so many other events, nine 11,

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:22.420
the open funding of ISIS, changing the name from Al Qaeda, all of this is coming out.

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.400
But when you look at this Ebola situation, I'm not saying it's not ravaging Africa.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.280
I'm not saying it isn't, uh, you know, living in the body longer before the symptoms show

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:37.560
up 21 days instead of three, it's clearly mutating, getting stronger, but it just, I

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.380
can't believe that this type of ineptitude to bring in Ebola patients, they never did

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:49.080
that before to let people fly in from West Africa, from ravaged areas.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:54.120
When other countries had already banned it months ago, I mean, it appears that ineptitude

01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:01.680
wouldn't be this precise at doing everything they could to grease the skids for Ebola.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:06.840
Are you getting any information on them allowing this to spread, to kind of bring in a medical

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.200
tyranny to create a political distraction?

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.560
Are there any motives for this to be a false flag?

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:17.520
No, not really, because number one, it is very hard to create an epidemic to create

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.520
a false flag.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:24.720
Newtown was a false flag because Eric Holder had funded a very dysfunctional governor and

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:30.680
a dysfunctional town and a bunch of Connecticut State Troopers who were just pathetic and

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.720
it was easy to create and that scenario was nonsense.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.720
Oh boy.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.720
Okay.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.720
Well, interesting answer.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.720
Yep.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.720
Yep.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.500
Although this did, this did make me think, here's what we should do.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.920
We should call the right-wing terrorists all-white-a.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920
That?

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.200
I thought, I thought like the one that was going around before was y'all-kida.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200
Was that what it was?

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.920
That was, that was something that I heard Alex yell about before.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.000
I think I used to say white-kida.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.560
I think I remember that one.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.560
Yeah.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.560
I like all-white-a.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.280
I'll let you do a meme contest about it.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:10.040
Look, dude, the thing that I think is really funny beyond just Steve being like Fauci is

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.280
a great guy, he should have control over everything in the response.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.760
Yeah, that's brutal.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.400
Alex being a over-the-top.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.400
Give me something.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.040
Give me any reason.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.120
I mean, and blue sky thinking.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120
I don't care.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.120
Steve.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.120
I'm begging.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.120
I don't care what it is.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.120
Give me even the slightest hint.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.120
Is there a possible motive?

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.120
Yes.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.120
Give me the-

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120
No.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.120
Just money.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.120
Just say money.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.120
You could just say money.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120
Ugh.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.120
No.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.120
Nah, you're kidding.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.480
The answer is even more illuminating and that is that it's really difficult to create a

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.900
fake epidemic.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:42.900
People wouldn't do that.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:43.900
It's not wise.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.160
It would be a bad idea.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.160
Yeah.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160
Very easy to get out of hand.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.600
Millions of people could die.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600
Yeah.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.600
Pretty much impossible to control.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600
Yep.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:58.080
Not a supervillain plan that would really work outside of a movie.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.020
But the thing that I think is really interesting is that Alex is talking about all of these

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.600
things in almost identical ways.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.920
Medical tyranny.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920
All this stuff.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:12.040
He doesn't mention Lockstep at all because he didn't know about that document in 2014.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040
No, no, no.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040
He knew about it 20 years ago.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040
And it wasn't a document called Lockstep.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.240
He found it back then.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.240
It's been in there-

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.440
He pretends to have known about all this stuff and is like, no, you didn't.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.320
This wasn't part of your narratives then.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.840
No one had shown you this.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.840
Nope.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.840
It hadn't made the-

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.840
Because it didn't exist.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.840
No.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.840
It existed in 2010.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.840
Oh, no.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.840
I mean in the right-wing sphere.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840
That's what I'm saying.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840
Yeah.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840
It hadn't been posted on a stupid blog yet.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:41.840
It misrepresented what it was in a way that was profitable.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.480
And you just see it very clearly.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.860
Like he just didn't have the mana to do that attack at this point.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.880
It's kind of telling.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.240
Yeah.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.960
I'm just so bummed.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.120
It's so easy.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.680
The right-wing propagandist's job is so easy.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.460
You do the same shit every five years for five years and then restart.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.460
Every time.

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:08.460
It's the same shit.

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.460
Yeah.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.460
It's so boring.

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:18.440
And God forbid Ebola would have spread more in the United States at this point, but I

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.280
could easily see Alex going a very similar way.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.040
It's like, they're trying to lock down our businesses because they're afraid of this

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.040
disease.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.920
Just don't have people cough on you or throw up.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.920
And the more effort the government puts into stopping it, the more he'd argue that that's

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.920
what they're-

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.360
That's the reason that they released this on us to encroach on our civil liberties.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:50.800
You can almost easily see how the playbook operates based on the incredible similar parallels

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.800
you have here.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.800
Yeah.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.800
It is really surprising.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.800
Oh, maybe not.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.800
No, really.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:01.720
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.080
You can see it going down the same exact train of thought no matter what time period it is

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:13.040
because it's the thought process itself that leads you to believe action towards aversion

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.680
is actually causing things.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.080
It's the thought process itself, not the circumstances.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:29.120
What changes is the circumstances allow it to balloon out of control or it's contained.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120
Yeah.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:37.280
It's deeply cynical and cruel the way that Alex operates in this respect.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:45.480
It really is a denial and disregard for the fact that there are people who are suffering

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.480
and dealing with this and a rank disregard for the people who are listening who are probably

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.840
scared and need information.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.700
They need to have conveyed accurate information that allows them to make appropriate decisions

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.840
like the emails that were sent out to the people who were on the plane after, even though

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.520
there probably wasn't a reason to be worried.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.520
That's appropriate.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.240
You're giving the people the information that they need to be able to make appropriate decisions.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.080
These listeners are tuning into Alex because they think that they're going to get some

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.560
kind of insight that they're not going to get elsewhere and he's lying to them in a

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:28.720
way that's designed to scare them and just to get them to get their immune system ready

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:34.240
with the products that he sells over at inflowars.com and...

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.260
As the world economy melts down, gold will go up even as other commodities go down because

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:44.880
it's an ultimate store of wealth and a hedge against imploding economies and it is up.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.760
When I heard that bond markets had imploded and the stock market was down so much today,

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.680
I thought, man, I bet gold goes down.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.360
I said this aloud, but I said, or maybe it'll go up because when I saw that oil was way

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.160
down, I thought, man, I wonder, but man, when I saw gold going up, that's pretty serious

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.160
right there.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.920
So the other thing is that there are economic impacts that are happening because of the

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.800
Ebola situation.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.120
There's some like airline stocks are going down.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.340
There are impacts that are happening and Alex is using that to funnel gold sales.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:29.360
Gold started 2014 at $12.05.77 an ounce, peaking on June 30th at $1,327.39 an ounce.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:35.240
On October 16th, the day this show was recorded, the price was $12.39, down almost $3 an ounce

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.840
from the day before.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:42.040
It would close the year at $1,184.31.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.760
Nothing Alex says means anything.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.660
His syndicator at this point is still a guy who owns a gold sales business, so gold is

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:54.060
super important to his world view in 2014 and it's weird how it's so much less so now.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:58.440
So in order to talk about the bond markets falling apart and how gold is great, Alex

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.040
brings in his financial buddy, Max Kaiser.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.280
Oh God.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.480
Max Kaiser, I will say, does not give a shit.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.480
That sounds right.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.280
He is not taking this seriously at all.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.280
That sounds right.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:18.400
I was so close to Gary North and then it's like all the other crazy stuff in my life.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.480
Not Gary North, Gary Webb, Gary North, another writer with Oliver North and Gary North.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.920
And then I didn't break these big CIA drug dealing stories with him because I was just

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.400
like, yeah, I already know all that.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.400
Sure.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.400
Come on the air.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.400
Sure.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400
Sell your book.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.400
Yeah.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.400
You're a hero.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.400
Yeah.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.400
They're trying to destroy you.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.400
But why?

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.400
Why put out new documents?

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.400
Why put out a website with you, Gary Webb?

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.400
Because they killed him.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.100
And then he attacked me for saying they killed him.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.800
But the movie basically says they killed.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.840
You said, you know, they show that and his wife, his kids, and that they kill him.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.580
I'm just, I just am speechless.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.640
How powerful kill the messenger and the story about Gary Webb and his whole surprise and

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.680
all the rest of it is, I mean, it's simply amazing how all his so-called friends turned

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.820
against him when the mainstream media said he was a fraud with no proof.

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.560
Have you seen kill the messenger yet, Kaiser?

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.560
No, no.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.000
I'm not scared to.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.300
I just felt like I dropped the ball monumentally, not working with him more, helping get his

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.300
material out, man.

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.300
Oh.

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.300
Coward.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.300
Why do you think we're still alive?

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.360
We're too pretty.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.880
You know, people, they, they don't want to kill off such a beautiful, beautiful, especially

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.040
examples of a human species.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.760
It would just destroy their souls more than what they do on a day to day basis.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.760
No, come on.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.520
Gary Webb had a beautiful soul.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.400
Man, Max Kaiser does not give a shit.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.400
Wow.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.400
He is not taking this seriously at all.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.400
Yep.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.400
Nope.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.400
And I kind of, it's a breath of fresh air.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.400
Yeah, I do like that.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.360
I do like a little bit of eh, fucking, you know, who gives a shit?

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360
Come on.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360
Come on.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360
We're too pretty.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.440
Too pretty.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:59.440
Their interview ends with Alex comes in from break and he's singing along with balls to

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.440
the wall.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440
Sure.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.240
And he's talking about how this is a, you know, an air, like a pilot term, you know,

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.240
jam in the throttle.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.480
And then it's also about the Berlin Wall, you know, and, uh, he's talking about how

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:19.160
this is a protest song and a little bit later, Max Geiser's like, I gotta make a correction.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:25.640
That's about going balls deep.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:32.280
It's actually a sincerely kind of funny moment and Alex, I think he knows that it's funny

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.120
that he doesn't know how to play along with it.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.760
So he's like, this is a family show, Max Geiser, oh, he's a dirty, but he's a dirty guy.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.320
Can't do a two man game.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.320
Just can't do it.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.320
He's a bad scene partner.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.880
But again, it was this Max Geiser just kind of like, he operates outside of the grifts

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:48.880
that are going on.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.960
Cause he's scamming and stuff, but I think he's so rich that he doesn't care.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960
That's fair.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.960
Yeah.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:56.960
That's the type of rich that, uh.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.960
He's got fuck you money.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.960
Yeah.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.960
Yeah.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.960
Yeah.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.440
I think that's nobody, you know, only insane people want to be billionaires.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.760
I think everybody wants that point of just like, uh, fuck these guys, you know, that's

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.760
what you really want.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.760
Yeah.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.840
I can go on to Alex's show and perpetuate max coin or whatever.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:20.480
I can try and sell whatever thing that I'm doing and that can be fun, but I don't need

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.480
it.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.480
I can also fuck with Alex.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.480
Just a millionaire.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.480
Yeah.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480
I also have a show on RT.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.480
I don't need his platform either.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480
Yeah.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480
I don't know.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480
It's weird.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.600
But someone who does need Alex's platform very desperately.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.600
All right.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:40.280
Ted Anderson joining us on short notice from California, uh, the owner of the GCN radio

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.280
network.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.680
He also is one of the biggest private gold dealers with a triple a rating from the better

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.720
business Bureau.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.560
Something you can't say of most other gold dealers out there.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:54.040
This ride by my gold for 20 years, about 19 years, he's been a sponsor for 19.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.280
I've worked in this time slot for 18 years.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.760
I never wanted to go up against rush Limbaugh.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.000
Ted said, no, we're going to do it.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.920
You know, he's got a monopoly in cities and a lot of stations, you know, want to have

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.040
a show to go up against it.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.560
You're on here, not at night, if you want to work at this network.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.560
So here I am.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.080
And funny enough, I'm now beating rush Limbaugh in ratings wherever I'm put up against him,

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.080
even on smaller stations.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.080
Are you, I highly doubt that.

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.080
Do you think so?

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.080
No.

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080
Do you really think so?

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:24.480
I mean like, yeah, some stations can't afford Russia syndication rates and Alex's is free.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480
So yeah, sure.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.480
It makes sense.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.480
I imagine.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.080
So, yeah, Ted's Ted's just on to sell gold.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.280
Alex is out here like Ted Ebola is causing problems.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.880
We need you on quick to sell gold.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.880
Yeah.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.960
I've been panicking people all day, but he's not onto pitch gold.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960
Now is the time.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.880
And I didn't mean to even get him onto pitch gold with Midas.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.880
But folks, if you wait until the fall where it historically goes up, if you wait until

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.080
there is a big rush, it's already up 20 something bucks today.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.880
Can we pull that up for me CNBC?

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.600
Now is the time, I believe, to get into gold and silver, or at least get some of the books

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.880
or financial prospectus documents that Midas Resources has.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.480
And then like a year later, Ted would lose his license because he's a...

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.480
Because he's a scamming.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.480
Thief.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.480
Scammy guy.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480
He's a fraudster.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480
Yeah.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:20.520
And so, I mean, like this is kind of the payoff, the prestige of the panic and the fear that

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:27.300
Alex has been building throughout the episode with his hysterical nonsense, his talking

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:31.200
about the bond markets falling apart.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.700
That part with Max Keiser is a nice bridge to the interview with Ted Anderson in order

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:40.560
to funnel people to give them the solution to the problem.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.640
We've created this problem that is...

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.240
False flag Ebola, a nuclear strike.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.240
Right?

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.240
You've got to retain your money somehow.

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.800
And the only way your assets are going to be safe is with this guy, Ted, my buddy who

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.860
I've been working with for 19 years.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:00.760
Buy some bullion you've never seen and have him put it in a lockbox you don't know is

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:01.760
real.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.760
It's safe.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.760
It's fine.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760
Yeah.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760
Yeah, so I mean, I look back on this.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.000
I mean, I don't care what Ted has to say.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's just about gold.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yeah, of course.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.200
But looking back on this episode, it was shocking to me.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:17.240
I mean, the reason that I chose it, like honestly, had nothing to do with Ebola.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.360
I didn't know that this episode was about Ebola.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.060
I just saw Steve Pacanik's name.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.060
You're a witch.

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.060
Yeah.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.060
You're a witch.

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.680
So I was like, I got a fucking 2014 Steve Pacanik, boom, let's do this.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.520
Let's see what he's bringing to the table.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520
And I started listening to it.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.280
Love Dr. Fauci is what he's bringing to the table.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.280
God damn it.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.280
So bizarre.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.280
Fuck you.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280
It's so bizarre.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.280
Fuck you.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.280
I want to throw a tomato at Steve Pacanik because of this now.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:43.360
You see the dark, twisted, like distorted version of the narratives that are being

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:51.440
sold in the present about coronavirus being applied to Ebola in seven years prior, just

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:57.360
with completely different clothes.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.000
Back then, they could fuck around with crisis actor stuff because they hadn't been checked

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
on that front.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.800
And so Rob Doo thinks that maybe these people with Ebola are fake.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:12.480
Anthony Fauci wasn't somebody that Trump got into a fight with.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.840
And so he's a hero that Steve studied under at Cornell and they're tight.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.040
He should have control of the military apparatus to deal with Ebola.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.400
I think it's fascinating.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:32.000
It does strongly reinforce my theory that Alex is full of shit.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:39.240
I would say that if not definitive proof, I would argue that the totality of our work

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.240
is definitive proof.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.560
This might be a good argument not to take them seriously.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.400
Although if you need further proof, go to Dr. Fauci.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.400
Poop bandits.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.400
Yes.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.400
Poop bandits.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400
Poop bandits.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400
Yeah.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400
Oh boy.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.400
So I hope you had fun.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.400
I did.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.400
Enjoying my wizardry.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.400
I do.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.320
I love when you bring witchcraft to the table, Dan.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.680
I'm uncomfortable with how kind of regular an occurrence it is.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.600
It is really kind of frustrating.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:07.280
Again, Dan, everything is a prank on me.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.080
I'm beginning to believe that thoroughly.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.960
Well, here's Ashton Kutcher.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:13.960
Yeah.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.960
Goddamn it.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.960
The coronavirus didn't happen.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.960
Son of a bitch, Ashton.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960
That would be an elaborate plan.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:20.960
Yeah.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.200
If I was the only one who actually quarantined this entire time, yeah.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.520
That would be interesting.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.520
Yep.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.520
I don't think it's feasible.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.120
Although I did read a white paper.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.960
I've seen a lot of false flags in the past.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.320
Also, the other thing, before we get out of here, that I was thinking about.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.440
That was with Alex.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.760
It's just a joke that he says, I have the documents.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.760
Yeah.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.760
Yeah.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.760
Yeah.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.040
I mean, he's claiming that he has these documents from Gary Webb.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.240
It's like, do you?

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240
Or are they lost?

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.240
Yeah.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.240
Or did they ever exist?

01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:01.640
So anytime that he says he has the documents, it might be just some CD rom that may or may

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:06.240
not exist in a warehouse somewhere that he has no fucking idea that should be protected

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.560
like the Holy Grail.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:16.640
You would think that that would be so fastidiously organized, seeing as how it's proof of all

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.800
the conspiracies that have ever been.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.640
Well, maybe not proof of all of them, but at least the building block that would get

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.880
you to where something is solidly proven that you can maybe build from.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880
Yeah.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.200
And I think that would be really important for him because as far as I can tell from

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:38.080
the bedrock of so many of these conspiracies, primary sources that you go back to, they

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.740
just don't hold up.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:49.760
So if he did have these secret classified documents, you would fucking handcuff it

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.760
to your wrist.

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.760
Yeah.

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:52.760
Yeah.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.920
That would be ridiculous to imagine that you would.

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.920
No, absolutely.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.380
Especially after Gary Webb dies.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:03.800
In the episode that we did not record, I played this clip for you.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:08.440
The two guys that we were talking about watched a 20 minute conspiracy theory video and I

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.220
only played you one clip from it and it was the guy narrating it say, about a month ago

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.920
I lost all of it and it's like, oh, fuck off.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.540
There is a certain irony to us complaining about this when we're only recording this

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:28.520
episode because of a tech glitch, although we didn't prove anything in that episode.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.920
No, I think that was more an observation.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920
Yeah.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.160
It was just some laughs were had that will never be had publicly.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.040
Anyway, Jordan, this has been fun.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.040
This has been fun.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.040
Yeah.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.040
Sorry that your episode got lost.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.040
Oh, it'll be okay.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.480
We'll let you take the wheel again here in the near future.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480
Sometimes soon.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.120
I'm sure you can find something that we can go over.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:53.200
Anyway, but, uh, but for now, let's, uh, let's end this.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.200
Okay.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.080
Let's travel back to the present.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.080
All right.

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.080
All right.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.080
All right.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.080
Uh, we'll be back.

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.080
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.080
We do have a website.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.240
It's a thanks to Mr. Peabody for bringing us back to the present.com.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.240
We're also on Twitter.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240
We are on Twitter.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.240
It's that knowledge.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.240
I'll just go right now.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.240
Go to bed.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.240
Jordan.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.240
We're also on Facebook.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.480
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.480
doing God's work right now.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.480
Yep.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.480
We'll be back.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.480
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.480
I'm Leo.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.480
I'm DZX Clark.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.480
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.600
I am the leader of the Poop Bandits.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.600
Andy in Kansas.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.600
You're on the air.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.600
Thanks for holding.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600
Hello, Alex.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600
I'm a first time caller.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.600
I'm a huge fan.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.600
I love your work.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:59.600
I love you.
