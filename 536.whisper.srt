N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,120
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Dan and Jordan.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Knowledgefight.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Riddle her.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Riddle her.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
Riddle her.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
Need money.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Riddle her.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
Riddle her.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,120
Riddle her.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Andy Enchanze.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Andy Enchanze.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Stop it.

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Andy Enchanze.

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Andy Enchanze.

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
It's time to pray.

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
Andy Enchanze.

24
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
You're on the air.

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Thanks for holding.

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Hello Alex.

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
I'm a first time caller.

28
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm a huge fan.

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
I love your work.

30
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Knowledgefight.

31
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
Knowledgefight.com.

32
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,440
I love you.

33
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Hey everybody.

34
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
I'm Dan.

36
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
I'm Jordan.

37
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
We're a couple dudes.

38
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,200
We like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

39
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,840
Oh indeed we are Dan.

40
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Jordan.

41
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Dan.

42
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
Yeah.

43
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Quick question for you.

44
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
What's up?

45
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
What's your bright spot?

46
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,040
My bright spot today is, why don't you go first.

47
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Okay.

48
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,000
I think we might wind up having a very similar bright spot.

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,240
My bright spot was last night we celebrated our friend's birthday.

50
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,640
Not a health ranger.

51
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,200
Our friend who is not a health ranger.

52
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
No, no.

53
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Not, very strongly not a health ranger.

54
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
John.

55
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,680
And it was a fantastic time.

56
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
We hung out.

57
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
We played video, played games together over Zoom.

58
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
It was fantastic.

59
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
I had a great night.

60
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Yes.

61
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Delightful time.

62
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Yeah.

63
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
It was had.

64
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,960
Later on the bartender asked me to leave, but other than that it was a good night.

65
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Uh huh.

66
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Yeah.

67
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,760
You know, since you've claimed that, I guess I can't have that be my bright spot.

68
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
I think you could.

69
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
That's what I shall say.

70
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
What?

71
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,880
I got a message from one of our listeners, a policy wonk out there, who had some music

72
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,800
that they had made that they wanted a review of.

73
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Oh, okay.

74
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,320
And I gave it a little bit of a spin.

75
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
All right.

76
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,320
And this is a gentleman by the name of Derek Avery.

77
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
And I checked it out.

78
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,600
You can find some albums on Spotify.

79
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I enjoyed it.

80
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
It's great.

81
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
It's a pop punk kind of vibe.

82
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
That's awesome.

83
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,440
I listened to his album, Here's to Better Misery.

84
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,400
And I enjoyed it quite a bit.

85
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
That's awesome.

86
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
And I can say that sincerely.

87
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
And I think that's probably why it's a bright spot.

88
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Yes.

89
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Because I don't have to be...

90
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
I don't have to be like, it's good.

91
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah.

92
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
No, no, no.

93
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It's great.

94
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
It's...

95
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I love it when a fan does stuff.

96
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah.

97
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah.

98
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I enjoyed it.

99
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
So thanks for sharing that with me, Derek.

100
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
I appreciate it.

101
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,960
And if people want some pop punk, you should go check that out.

102
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
So Jordan.

103
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Yes, sir.

104
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,560
Today we are back into the present day.

105
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
Oh, shit.

106
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,800
I've got February 28th, 2021, Blackjack.

107
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Ah, za-za.

108
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Yep.

109
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,560
I waited until you had your vape in your mouth so you couldn't respond.

110
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
That was different.

111
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,680
That was kind of cheating on my part.

112
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Just comically easy.

113
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
Yeah.

114
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,880
So that's Sunday, today's episode as we're recording this.

115
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

116
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,720
One of the reasons why I wanted to do this episode for the Sunday is I wanted to see

117
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,320
like, hey, CPAC has run its course.

118
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Sure.

119
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,560
I just, I remember last year, such heights.

120
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
It was a big deal last year.

121
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
CPAC was...

122
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,480
So much, so much going on.

123
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,520
It was a celebrity-filled affair.

124
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,000
Alex went there.

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Exactly.

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And the bartender told him to leave.

127
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,320
He missed his own speech at the end.

128
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,840
He was supposed to be the headliner.

129
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,160
Nick Fuentes basically took over the show.

130
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
There were fireworks.

131
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
It was great.

132
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Yeah.

133
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,240
It was Enrique Tarrio made a joke about how there's probably an FBI informant in the room.

134
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Which is funny.

135
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
Because it was him.

136
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,780
It was outrageous.

137
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,700
It was such a good time, that CPAC event.

138
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:12,200
There was so much going on, so much nonsense, and it's just such a sign how sad it is now.

139
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
He's not even going to DC, he's not going to CPAC.

140
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,840
He's just sitting in his studio, having a show.

141
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Yeah!

142
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,280
I mean, last year, it was full-on the gathering of the Juggalos level, but for white nationalists

143
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
instead of cool people.

144
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,160
Yeah, Mike Flynn's son showed up.

145
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Yeah, exactly.

146
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,720
Kind of almost cried, talking about how great his dad is.

147
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm so grateful to not have to have paid a single iota of attention to CPAC this year.

148
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah, I saw a little bit.

149
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,240
I didn't watch as much as some have, because I just don't care.

150
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,680
But the value of this episode, of Alex's show, is that it's going on during Trump's speech

151
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
at CPAC.

152
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Ooooh!

153
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
So he's counter-programming.

154
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,220
He's counter-programming against his God-King!

155
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,340
Which means that Alex just plays the speech mostly for the first hour, and does a little

156
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,440
bit of commentary.

157
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,720
But there's still a couple of things that I find particularly important, and one thing

158
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,520
that drove me a little bit crazy.

159
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
What's that?

160
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Well, we'll get to it.

161
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
We'll get to it.

162
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
God damn it.

163
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
I don't want to spoil it.

164
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
You're so good.

165
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,060
But before we do any of that, we've got to take a moment to say thank you to the folks

166
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,440
who have signed up and are supporting the show.

167
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
That's a great idea.

168
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,880
So first, Miss Elanius.

169
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
That's Miss Elanius.

170
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Yes and no, no, no.

171
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
I understand.

172
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Thank you so much.

173
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
You are now a policy wonk.

174
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
I'm a policy wonk.

175
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Thank you very much, Mademoiselle Elanius.

176
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Thank you.

177
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Next.

178
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm a huge fan.

179
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
I love your work.

180
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Thank you so much.

181
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
You are now a policy wonk.

182
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm a policy wonk.

183
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Thank you very much.

184
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Thank you.

185
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Next.

186
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Guisapina, the juiciest ice cube.

187
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Thank you so much.

188
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
You are now a policy wonk.

189
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I'm a policy wonk.

190
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
I guess I'm the second.

191
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Wait.

192
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Guisapina or Giuseppe?

193
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Giuseppina?

194
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Giuseppina?

195
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Yeah.

196
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
I don't know.

197
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
I'm not good with names.

198
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
I don't know.

199
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
I'm just asking.

200
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
Okay.

201
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
All right.

202
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Next.

203
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Etta and Nessa P. Thank you so much.

204
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
You are now a policy wonk.

205
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm a policy wonk.

206
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
All right.

207
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Next.

208
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Sully the Canadian youth.

209
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,880
From what I hear, this Sully refers to Alex Jones as the shouty man with demon voices.

210
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Yeah.

211
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
That sounds about right.

212
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
You are now a policy wonk.

213
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm a policy wonk.

214
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Thank you very much.

215
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Thank you.

216
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
And then I got a couple of technocrat shout-outs to jump into here.

217
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
First, Ben.

218
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Thank you so much.

219
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,880
You are now a technocrat.

220
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
This is tough.

221
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Lauren B. Thank you so much.

222
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
You're a technocrat.

223
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
And also happy birthday two weeks ago.

224
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
This is what we're doing now.

225
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Birthday shout-outs retroactive.

226
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
That's what you get.

228
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
That's what you get.

229
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
We're not doing this current anymore.

230
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Yeah.

231
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,880
We will do six month late.

232
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Exactly.

233
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Sliding birthday shout-outs.

234
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Anyway, Lauren, I hope two weeks ago you had a great birthday and you are now a technocrat.

235
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
I'm a policy wonk.

236
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Crikey, mate.

237
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
That's fantastic.

238
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Have yourself a brew.

239
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
How's your 401k doing, bro?

240
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,880
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

241
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Let's just get down to business.

242
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

243
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Why you pimps so good?

244
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
My neck is freakishly large.

245
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I declare info war on you.

246
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Thank you so much.

247
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

248
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,880
So, Jordan, you know, this is going to be a little bit of a briefer episode.

249
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
It's going to be a little bit shorter.

250
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
And one of the reasons, like I said, is because-

251
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Well, an hour of it is Trump's speech.

252
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Right.

253
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Yeah.

254
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,880
He had set out to, you know, get this CPAC wrap up.

255
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,880
I thought there would be, like, a lot of, some dense things to get into, some reflections.

256
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
And no.

257
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
It's a big old nothing.

258
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Yeah.

259
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,880
It's a little bit of running commentary of Trump's speech.

260
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Sure.

261
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,880
With a couple of completely absurd things thrown in.

262
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,880
And so, you know, it starts pretty much how you would expect it to.

263
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,880
It's February 28th on the Sunday live transmission.

264
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:06,880
President Trump has just started speaking from Florida at the 2021 CPAC that the controlled

265
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,880
corporate press and big tech are trying to censor and block everywhere.

266
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,880
But before we hear from the real president, let's hear from the imposter.

267
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Let's hear from the puppet who just did a victory lap Friday in Houston, Texas.

268
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Yeah.

269
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,880
So, Alex says, you know, he's setting the table with Trump is the real president.

270
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Sure.

271
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
Sure.

272
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Which is good.

273
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
That's great.

274
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
It's healthy.

275
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
It's good stuff.

276
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Yeah.

277
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Yeah.

278
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
The denial is fantastic.

279
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
And he has a clip of Biden saying some words that sound like he is confused.

280
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Sure.

281
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Sure.

282
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,880
And so this is evidence that his brain is deteriorating.

283
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
All right.

284
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Fine.

285
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Yeah.

286
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,880
And I think that this next clip is kind of, like, indicative of how the large chunk of

287
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
this show goes.

288
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
It's really just Alex getting excited while Trump gives a speech.

289
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Okay.

290
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
That's gross.

291
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Let there be no doubt we will be victorious and America will be stronger and greater than

292
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
ever before.

293
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Yes.

294
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Yes.

295
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
We will defeat the globalist.

296
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Woo.

297
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Yes.

298
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Yeah.

299
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
He's pretty.

300
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
He's Ed McMahon-ing it?

301
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Yeah.

302
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
All right.

303
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,440
A large portion of the speech that airs on Alex's version of Trump's speech is a lot

304
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,680
of fear mongering about immigrants.

305
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Sure.

306
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Sure.

307
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Why not?

308
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
What are we doing?

309
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
It's pretty heavily hitting that tone.

310
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Yeah.

311
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,240
And I found it to be alarming, upsetting.

312
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah.

313
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,440
But I was surprised by one thing, and that is that, you know, there's a little bit of

314
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,280
time to fuck around in this speech, too.

315
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Sure.

316
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Sure.

317
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,480
I also want to pay my love and respect to the great Rush Limbaugh.

318
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Absolutely.

319
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Kill him again.

320
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,840
Call him a call in.

321
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Call him a rush.

322
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
That betrayals.

323
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Rush wasn't perfect.

324
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
He was pro-America.

325
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I believe in the country.

326
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,520
Who is watching closely and smiling down on us.

327
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,680
He's watching and he's loving it.

328
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
He's loving it.

329
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you think he's up there, buddies?

330
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,040
Do you really?

331
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,520
I find that fun.

332
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Yeah.

333
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,720
You know, just to give a shout out to my boy Rush.

334
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
He's looking down at us.

335
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
He's loving it.

336
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
He's loving what he's seeing here at CPAC.

337
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Oh, man.

338
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
What is he...

339
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Did he do the cross?

340
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,480
Did he cross himself?

341
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Did he pour one out?

342
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
He might have been crossing his fingers.

343
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,320
Did he strangle a parole in front of everyone to celebrate?

344
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
Yeah, that seemed a little pandery.

345
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
Yeah, maybe.

346
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
But also probably sincere.

347
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Yeah.

348
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
I don't know.

349
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,880
Without him, he wouldn't have been elected.

350
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,080
So a while back, 50 years ago, right after the election.

351
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Okay.

352
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,960
There was talk after Trump had lost that he was going to start his own party.

353
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
The Patriot Party.

354
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Right.

355
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
The Patriot Party.

356
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Yes.

357
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,600
People are pretty excited about this because they're nuts.

358
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,440
And of course, rightfully, people on the left are like, please do that.

359
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Yes.

360
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Absolutely.

363
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Completely splinter the right wing.

364
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
No, no, no.

365
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Do that.

366
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Do that.

367
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Go white nationalists and quieter white nationalists.

368
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
That's what we would like you to do.

369
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Thank you.

370
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Yeah.

371
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Divide the voting block.

372
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,560
That's a very smart thing to do.

373
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Turns out this is fake news.

374
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,920
Trump was never going to do that.

375
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Wow.

376
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
And so...

377
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Why would he?

378
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
He already owns the Republican Party.

379
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Yeah.

380
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Yeah.

381
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
And he basically announces that.

382
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Oh, okay.

383
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
We're not starting new parties.

384
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,880
You know, they kept saying, he's going to start a brand new party.

385
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,360
We have the Republican Party.

386
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,960
It's going to unite and be stronger than it was before.

387
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
That's right.

388
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I am not starting a new party.

389
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Yes.

390
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
That was fake news.

391
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,240
Fake news.

392
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
No.

393
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,520
Wouldn't that be brilliant?

394
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,880
Let's start a new party and let's divide our vote so that you can never win.

395
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
No, we're not interested in that.

396
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,160
Someone had to explain that to you.

397
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,640
Shut the fuck up.

398
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Tremendous.

399
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,680
Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody's ever heard of before.

400
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
More popular than anybody.

401
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
That's all of us.

402
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
It's all numbers.

403
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah.

404
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Hit pause.

405
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
We're going to come back with this.

406
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Let's do four.

407
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,320
We're going to come back in Georgia and other people winning with 75 points, 71 points,

408
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
69 points, 70 points.

409
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,880
All the super hardcore Trump candidates were winning in districts that had been about 50-50

410
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,200
before by huge 20-point extra margins never before seen.

411
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,140
So Marjorie Taylor Greene won her race essentially unopposed.

412
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,480
The Democrat candidate had withdrawn from the race due to personal matters and that's

413
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
why she won.

414
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Yeah.

415
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,560
Also, a simple scan of the history of that district, Georgia's 14th.

416
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
It disproves what Alex is saying.

417
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,240
In the 2018 election, Republican Tom Graves won with 76.5% of the vote.

418
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,600
On a pro-slavery platform.

419
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,600
In 2016, 2014, and 2010, Graves ran unopposed.

420
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,720
In 2012, he won with 73% of the vote.

421
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,920
According to the Cook Partisan Voter Index, this is a Republican plus 27 district, which

422
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,400
means it skews heavily Republican.

423
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
That would make sense.

424
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,200
That, in addition to her opponent withdrawing, is why Marjorie Taylor Greene won.

425
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,360
Not because pro-Trump candidates are so exciting and they're super mega popular.

426
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
Also, how dare you?

427
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,320
You don't care about voting.

428
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,280
You think that the election was stolen.

429
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,560
Don't tell me that they won elections.

430
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,080
Well, yeah.

431
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,440
No, because the election was stolen, but if it hadn't have been stolen, they would have

432
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,040
won with like 80% of the vote.

433
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Sure.

434
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
90% of the vote.

435
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Okay.

436
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
That's how popular people are who like Trump.

437
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
All right.

438
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
All right.

439
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Thanks for that, Dan.

440
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Yep.

441
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
You should know better.

442
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,480
I really should at this point.

443
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:57,880
So Jordan, I have, you know, around the Super Bowl, I definitely got into Alex's commercial

444
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
stylings.

445
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Yes, they were fantastic.

446
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,160
He was doing some very weird ad reads.

447
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,360
It was super bizarre.

448
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Now, this episode I'm listening to through the GCN, the Genesis Communications Network

449
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,000
feeds, which is the company that does Alex's syndication.

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,800
So all of the radio stations get this feed, all the radio stations that play Alex's show

451
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
get this feed.

452
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,240
And these are the commercials that are put on along with the package.

453
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,360
These are the people who sponsor Genesis Communications Network.

454
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,960
And I listened to one of these commercials and it really, really upset me.

455
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Oh, no.

456
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,280
Here is the thing that blew my mind and almost drove me crazy.

457
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Okay.

458
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,160
The days of extermination is set to commence now.

459
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,480
And as population die-off becomes evident, you know it is the time of punishment in all

460
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,560
that is written.

461
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,120
The cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming frauds, also used as false

462
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,780
proof of their Christ.

463
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,400
They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago.

464
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,280
Now they claim to be his Christ based upon blood type, DNA, and long lifespan.

465
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,320
Go to unveilingthem.com.

466
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,280
That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com.

467
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Whoa.

468
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Wow.

469
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Wow.

470
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,240
Do you have any idea?

471
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Wow.

472
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
First, first.

473
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,120
Could you make sense of that?

474
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,080
First, his voice and the way he's delivering it and the kind of choppy nature of the end

475
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,880
of the sentence and the beginning of a new one makes it sound a little bit like he's

476
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,520
a synthetic robot voice or somebody speaking, like somebody wearing a mask speaking through

477
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,120
a vocalizer or something like that.

478
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,600
Well, I know from my time of trying to get into voiceovers for commercials that a lot

479
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,560
of the time, if you're not a pretty good editor, it'll sound rough because you're trying to

480
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,520
jam it into a very specific span of time.

481
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,280
You buy a 30 second block and it's got to be 30 seconds.

482
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,440
It cannot be 28.

483
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,760
It cannot be 32.

484
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Yeah.

485
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,080
And that leads to whenever you're not that good, you'll end up sounding like that.

486
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Sure.

487
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Sure.

488
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
And that's kind of unfortunate.

489
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,640
But I'm more interested in the content and how that...

490
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,760
What did you take away from that?

491
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,760
What I thought I heard was that some people are claiming to be Christ or related to Christ.

492
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Maybe.

493
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
All right.

494
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,520
And because it is unveiling them, so there's a group of people who are doing that.

495
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,340
Now what I don't understand is how the population die off and the fake climate change and such

496
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,360
ties into the group of people.

497
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,200
What do you think they're selling?

498
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,960
Oh boy.

499
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
That's a good question.

500
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Spoiler alert.

501
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
It's nothing.

502
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
They're not selling anything.

503
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Okay.

504
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
All right.

505
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
All right.

506
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
That commercial hit me a little weird.

507
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,520
And honestly, it speaks to the level of sponsors that Genesis Communications Network is able

508
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,920
to attract at this point.

509
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Yeah.

510
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
That's rough.

511
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
That's terrifying.

512
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Yeah.

513
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,040
I checked out this website and apparently the person behind it believes that the MMR

514
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,320
vaccine has created iron poisoning in the population, which is the cause of all disease.

515
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Oh, well, I'm glad that that's cleared up.

516
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,760
Now I should be clear.

517
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,400
There's actually, the iron poisoning goes much deeper than this and it goes back quite

518
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
a long ways.

519
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,920
And the MMR vaccine isn't really creating it as much as exacerbating it and causing

520
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,240
problems for people who are already iron poisoned.

521
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Okay.

522
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Okay.

523
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
All right.

524
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,360
So even if you didn't get the MMR vaccine is what they're saying.

525
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,760
Don't worry.

526
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Don't worry.

527
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
You're still fucked.

528
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
You're still iron poisoned.

529
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
You can still join us.

530
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Yeah.

531
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,680
Apparently the Euphrates River is actually the Mississippi and the real population of

532
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,600
the United States is just about 200 million.

533
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Okay.

534
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,640
As it turns out, only people with AB blood type are safe from this iron poisoning.

535
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,200
And I have to admit this site's argument is a little bit difficult to follow.

536
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
All right.

537
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
I'm trying my best here.

538
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Sell me on this one.

539
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,560
It kind of inevitably drifts into a little bit of British Israelism.

540
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,720
Well, yeah, of course.

541
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,560
And it starts to feel a little bit anti-Semitic as you're reading through this.

542
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,360
There's one page on the site titled, quote, round them up, which argues that everyone

543
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,440
in any position of influence in the world is in on this plan to poison everyone with

544
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
iron.

545
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
Uh, I mean, they would have to be.

546
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,240
This includes quote, all of mainstream and alternative media, which I think would include

547
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
InfoWars.

548
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,800
That includes damn near everybody.

549
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Yeah.

550
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,960
About these media entities, there's a note in bold letters, quote, commandeer these immediately.

551
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,660
Commandeer these immediately?

552
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
There's a note?

553
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
Mm-hmm.

554
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Wait, on the website?

555
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,660
Yes.

556
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,720
Like, like it's something that somebody put up on their to-do list.

557
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Yes.

558
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,360
Like it's on the refrigerator of like commandeer those first.

559
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Mm-hmm.

560
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Gotcha.

561
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Like literally everyone is in on the plan, including quote, all nursing and assisted

562
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,520
living homes, all corporations, water treatment facilities, and food and beverage industry

563
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
farms and ranches.

564
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,680
Well, then I think that kind of, that counts half the world, right?

565
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,800
So I think half the world is iron poisoning the other half.

566
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,840
Well, see, apparently this is how this breaks down.

567
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Okay.

568
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,280
There are these people who are AB blood type and thus are, they're not iron poisoned.

569
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Okay.

570
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,000
Their blood type is not susceptible to the iron poisoning.

571
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
All right.

572
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Iron can't touch AB.

573
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes.

574
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But it can touch A and B.

575
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,080
And it has something to do with, I wasn't quite able to figure this out, but it has

576
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,800
something to do with like AB blood being found on the Shroud of Turin.

577
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Okay.

578
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
All right.

579
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm listening.

580
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I'm listening.

581
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,680
Everybody with AB blood is related to Jesus.

582
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,600
And they are not susceptible to iron poisoning.

583
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Good stuff.

584
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,440
So they're not going to be hurt by things like the COVID-19 vaccine, which will take

585
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,200
out all of the people who have iron poisoning.

586
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,220
The vaccine will like exacerbate these parasites or whatever that's inside you due to iron

587
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,520
poisoning.

588
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,640
Can we do a follow up on that?

589
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,080
Like can they, because we will know in the future whether or not they're correct.

590
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:06,200
So I would imagine that next year, let's make a gentleman's wager, me and the British Israelites.

591
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,180
I don't know if this is mainstream British Israelist thought as much as this is a very

592
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:18,400
weird GeoCities ass page that's spouting a very convoluted conspiracy.

593
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,240
I think that that's basically what's going on.

594
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,820
There's these people who are AB blood type and they're poisoned.

595
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,560
They want to get the vaccine in people who have A, O, or B because it'll kill all of

596
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
them off.

597
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Sure.

598
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,040
And in order to avoid this horrifying conclusion, the page literally says, quote, round up every

599
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,600
one of them, account for all 14.3 million in the United States, place them in holding

600
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
areas for out-processing.

601
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Okay.

602
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,080
So wait, now I'm against AB blood type people?

603
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
They're evil now.

605
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Yes.

606
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
They're the Gs.

607
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
They think they are.

608
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
Oh, those idiots.

609
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,180
I found this very confusing.

610
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,480
That's a little, that's a little, I don't think they're going to win in the end.

611
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,560
I'll put it that way.

612
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,300
On the one hand, this is a deeply pathetic state of affairs that Alex's radio syndication

613
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,920
would stoop to accepting an ad from a website like this that doesn't actually appear to

614
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
be selling anything.

615
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Nope.

616
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,560
On the other hand, it's deeply disturbing as a thing for them to be intentionally or

617
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,080
accidentally promoting to their audience.

618
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,560
This website is explicitly accusing people, everyone who has AB blood type of being part

619
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,120
of a conspiracy to kill off the public and that they need to be rounded up.

620
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
That seems a little irresponsible.

621
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Yeah.

622
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,120
So I was curious about this and I dug around a little bit more.

623
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Sure.

624
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,820
Apparently this page has been up since 2003 and there are some snapshots of what it used

625
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,960
to promote on the way back machine.

626
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Okay.

627
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,840
It turns out my feelings about this seeming a bit antisemitic were accurate.

628
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,040
From the page, as it existed in 2004, quote, they are murderers and thieves and destroy

629
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,960
the truth and destroy the earth and mankind.

630
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,640
Now is the time to destroy these destroyers.

631
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,240
They are the ones who claim to be Jews who are not.

632
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
All right.

633
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
There we go.

634
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Oh boy.

635
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
All right.

636
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Toss that one on the board.

637
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Yeah.

638
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,800
The site at this point does not appear to have any connection to the iron poisoning

639
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
conspiracy, but instead it's just classic antisemitic screeds.

640
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,560
It's basically just protocols of the elders of Zion shit.

641
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Great.

642
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,080
By 2008, the site had added the iron poisoning shit and it seems pretty clear that the argument

643
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,920
being laid out by this website is that Jewish people who aren't really Jewish are running

644
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,240
around and they're going to poison the world with iron in order to kill everyone off down

645
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
the road.

646
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,240
All right.

647
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,640
So this AB blood type, I think is a way of talking.

648
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Yeah.

649
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Yeah.

650
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Jews, but I'm saying AB blood type.

651
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Right.

652
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Gotcha.

653
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,320
It's not about how everyone thinks he's a Nazi, it's important to remember that his

654
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,760
radio buddy, uh, you know, who runs all of his, uh, like radio syndication and affiliates,

655
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,640
uh, is, you know, he's, he's, he's responsible for Alex's radio career.

656
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,000
That guy is willing to accept advertising money to promote a website that essentially

657
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,040
advocates rounding up Jewish people.

658
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,200
I would really prefer, and I'm going to go out on a limb here.

659
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,500
And I think this, look, this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I don't care what

660
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,840
side of the political aisle you're on.

661
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
I think rounding people up is usually a bad sign.

662
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Yeah.

663
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
I'm just going to go out there.

664
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
I'm going to say that.

665
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,440
I know it's an unpopular thought, Dan.

666
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Yeah.

667
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,880
It's, uh, it's, it's not a sign of a healthy, uh, body politic.

668
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Let's think of all the historical examples of people being rounded up.

669
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,960
All of them worked out well.

670
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Nevermind.

671
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,760
Uh, I found this bizarre, um, confusing.

672
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,200
I would never have imagined that something like this would be like able to secure an

673
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,760
advertising slot on Alex Jones's show.

674
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,160
I was going to say, it must be really fucking cheap.

675
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,760
It's gotta be dirt cheap for, uh, for just a random ass website to be like, yeah, I'll

676
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
buy 30 seconds.

677
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,500
Well, there's two things to consider.

678
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,840
One is maybe this person is independently wealthy.

679
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Sure.

680
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,640
So maybe it's not that cheap and there's like, fuck it.

681
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
I got to get the word out about iron possible.

682
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,080
Second possibility is that it is that cheap because think about it, like there's no big

683
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,580
businesses knocking down Ted Anderson's door to get ads on, on this shit.

684
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,720
No one wants this bottom of the barrel stuff.

685
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,560
I could absolutely also see this as just a favor.

686
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,520
I could see almost all advertising on GCN just being Ted being like, man, I know a guy,

687
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
come on, do a 30 second spot, man.

688
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,400
If that's a favor, then that opens up another can of worms and that is like, this is, they

689
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,720
know what's being pushed and they are willingly disseminating and supporting this and that's

690
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
fucked up.

691
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,600
I would have to, I mean, there's no way that somebody doesn't know what's being pushed.

692
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,120
You know what, I would, I would believe a world exists where no one knows what's going

693
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
on.

694
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
That's fair.

695
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
They're just like, wait, the check cleared?

696
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Put the eye on it.

697
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
I don't give a shit.

698
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,700
He's saying that people are going to be exterminated.

699
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
That works for us.

700
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Yeah.

701
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh, what's this?

702
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Iron poisoning?

703
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
Uh, okay.

704
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Yeah, sure.

705
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
Why not?

706
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,800
I'm going to wait for just a little while to find out that you are a deeply anti-Semitic

707
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
website.

708
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Yeah.

709
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Hmm.

710
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Uh, iron poisoning.

711
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
We sell zinc.

712
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
They're close enough.

713
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Get it on, get on the network.

714
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Come on, buddy.

715
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Oh, I'm also not going to check in on what you're, what you're espousing, uh, to the

716
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:26,640
point where I run, uh, alternative media thing, which you think needs to be commandeered immediately.

717
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
There is that.

718
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,640
I do like the idea that there is a 30 second spot.

719
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Yeah.

720
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,360
With the website in it and no one bothered to look at the website.

721
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Yeah.

722
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,960
I honestly, I'm not positive what I think is more upsetting.

723
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Yeah.

724
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,840
The idea that they didn't check or that someone checked and they're like, yeah, it's fine.

725
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
It's either, either is pretty, pretty scary.

726
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,680
And the, the idea that like some of Alex's audience might go to that website and be like,

727
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,800
oh my God, if Alex would promote this, if he would allow this on his show, then there's

728
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,120
gotta be something to it.

729
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,920
I think the only thing we can do is get our own ad spot on GCN, Dan.

730
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Wow.

731
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,760
I think we, I think we should try it.

732
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,160
Maybe, you know, we could, I, yeah, we got to get another website though.

733
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Oh yeah.

734
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,920
No, we can't be, we can't be too obvious.

735
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Yeah.

736
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Yeah.

737
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,640
It's good that we're planning this on air in terms of, well, look, if you're not going

738
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,000
to look at that motherfucker's website, we're going to be fine.

739
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

740
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
All right.

741
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm going to, I'm going to work on this.

742
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,680
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to see if we can, the point is, they'll never know

743
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,520
when it's coming, Dan, we can announce it's going to happen and maybe that's the real

744
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
torture there.

745
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
They'll always be wondering, right?

746
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Is this the one?

747
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,880
When is it going to, when is it going to, which ad is the prank?

748
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,200
When's the hammer going to drop?

749
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,160
Um, all right, so, uh, we get back to Alex now, uh, that it was a deeply upsetting little

750
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,400
road that I went down.

751
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
It's real dangerous.

752
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Um, and, uh, also deeply upsetting, Alex is really thrilled that no one is wearing masks

753
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
at CPAC.

754
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Great.

755
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,200
Don't you love how almost no one's wearing a mask in the CPAC event?

756
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,160
These were some, even though they've been haranguing them too, isn't that great?

757
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
These are good people.

758
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,280
These are the smart people.

759
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
These are the smart people.

760
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Jesus.

761
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
It's not going to look great in hindsight.

762
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Wow.

763
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I would assume.

764
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Wow.

765
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,400
So Alex started the show talking about how Trump is the rightful president.

766
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,920
Um, and that's upsetting.

767
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,280
Sure.

768
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,300
It's more upsetting when Trump himself, uh, says that on stage at CPAC.

769
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,300
That's pretty upsetting.

770
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,840
Again, ladies and gentlemen, you're watching coverage of president Trump's ongoing live

771
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
speech.

772
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,720
We're about 20 minutes behind because we are going through the live show.

773
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,680
Actually, as you know, they just lost the white house, but it's one of those things.

774
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:56,800
But who knows, who knows, I may even decide to beat them for a third time.

775
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Okay.

776
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Yeah.

777
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
Yeah.

778
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,800
He just came out and said it was a fraud again.

779
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Football spike bitches.

780
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Boom.

781
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Yeah.

782
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
That's what you need.

783
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
That's alarming.

784
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,640
I mean, we just can't, we can't keep doing this.

785
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

786
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Yeah.

787
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
We refuse.

788
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
Yeah.

789
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,120
You know, like when, uh, 2000 happened, the election in 2000, that, uh, the Supreme Court

790
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,480
awarded the presidency to Bush.

791
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,240
Using all of the precedent that was available to them at the time, which is none.

792
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,720
And then they were just like, yeah, sure.

793
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,360
Well, and I think that a lot of people, uh, rightfully or inaccurately felt like that

794
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,880
was a stolen election.

795
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,200
I don't recall people insisting that Al Gore was the rightful president and I don't recall

796
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,280
Al Gore giving speeches where he said, I'm actually the president.

797
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
No, no.

798
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,480
Instead he went and focused on climate change.

799
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,280
Man, Trump, go focus on climate change.

800
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
No, don't.

801
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,920
Oh, no, no, no, not him.

802
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,080
No, no, no, no, no.

803
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,320
He would, he would bungle that.

804
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
No, no, no, no.

805
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,280
Go back inside of a very small hole and stay there.

806
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,040
I just find this to be untenable.

807
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:15,320
Like I, I can't, I can't imagine these kinds of rhetorics, uh, these, these kinds of things

808
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,760
leading anywhere positive.

809
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,480
It's going to get another storming of the Capitol at this rate.

810
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,460
It happened on the sixth and in response to that, they changed none of their rhetoric.

811
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,840
So it will happen again.

812
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
That's how it, it, it works.

813
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,160
It does seem that way.

814
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Yeah.

815
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,360
So Alex is one of the most influential voices in the world.

816
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,760
Ah, until he's commandeered by those guys.

817
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,480
Those guys.

818
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,120
The true most influential voices in the world.

819
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,260
And uh, you know, you might be surprised who, uh, who listens to Alex.

820
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,040
It's a famous Alex Jones saying, my son always says it as a joke.

821
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,160
He wants to start a podcast called I'm not bragging.

822
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm not bragging.

823
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,520
In fact, I'm a target and to even say this is dangerous.

824
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Okay.

825
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,000
But the globalists know how authoritative and how influential we are, not just with

826
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,880
the general public, but with thought leaders here and across the planet.

827
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,680
You can probably imagine who listens to the show.

828
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,360
I'm not going to name drop.

829
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,960
One of them died just a week and a half ago.

830
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,600
He listened every day.

831
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Okay.

832
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Really?

833
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,600
So this is not about bragging, it's about understanding.

834
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,440
This broadcast is a brain trust.

835
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,640
This broadcast does not have corporate sponsorship.

836
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
This broadcast is hunted and lied about and demonized because we go to the source documents

837
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,640
and we're over the targets.

838
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,520
So we're getting the most flat.

839
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,720
We've got great products you already need.

840
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Great.

841
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
Um, yeah, there's no way Rush Limbaugh listened to Alex every day.

842
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,840
I can't think of anything Rush Limbaugh did less than listen to Alex Jones.

843
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,520
You know what's, I mean, like he's on air for hours himself and then you imagine like,

844
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,320
oh yeah, he's going to spend his off time listening to someone do a shittier him and

845
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,960
a cartoony version.

846
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Yeah, exactly.

847
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Yeah.

848
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Yeah.

849
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Or he just yells about demons.

850
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Right.

851
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Like I find this to be so fascinating.

852
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,040
The idea that Alex thinks that his audience, and I mean, maybe he's right, but he thinks

853
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,280
that his audience will believe that like really serious people take him seriously.

854
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,360
I mean, they must.

855
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,280
I can't imagine anybody who is like, you know, critical thinking, engaged, uh, listening

856
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,200
to his show and not being like, this is stupid.

857
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,520
This is insanely stupid.

858
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Yeah.

859
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,920
It is, it is, uh, stupid on a level that like I can't really comprehend.

860
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,920
I understand being tricked by like little clips or snippets or something into thinking

861
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,360
that Alex's show is something that it's not, but it is dumb.

862
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,040
It is incredibly dumb.

863
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,660
Um, it's meandering.

864
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,240
It's often pointless.

865
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,160
It's full of emotional outbursts.

866
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Yeah.

867
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,520
Um, it's a psycho drama that he's having that he's engaging the audience in and it's just

868
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
bizarre.

869
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:59,220
Well, I mean, we saw, I mean, literally he's playing a clip of somebody doing just that

870
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,840
to Republicans at a conference.

871
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,720
You know, like he's playing a clip of Trump saying nonsense that no reasonable person

872
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,560
would take seriously at all.

873
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,800
And it turns out 50% of the goddamn world is like, yay, imagination.

874
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,160
It's it's wild.

875
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Yeah.

876
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,640
So, um, Alex is a creature of comedy.

877
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
We know that.

878
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Yeah.

879
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
He's the meme machine.

880
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
He is indeed.

881
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,380
Um, but sometimes he has to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing horribly racist and

882
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,600
disgusting comedy.

883
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Yeah.

884
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Drag.

885
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Oh.

886
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
So yeah.

887
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Yeah.

888
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Yeah.

889
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Just pulling teeth with this guy.

890
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,200
He doesn't want to do it, but demands it.

891
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
He got it.

892
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,560
There have been a lot of requests for fentanyl, the communist Chinese dragon to make a return.

893
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,280
And so we hadn't done one probably in six months because I get bummed out with the news,

894
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,920
but I've decided to be more pumped out with the dress side to have more fun because the

895
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,240
globalist want to get our spirits down.

896
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
So I'm going to do it.

897
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,960
This is a little racy, a little, a little gross.

898
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,900
My wife thought it was a little much.

899
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,640
I told McBreen who made it with a Rob do to make the, when he pulls the anal probe out

900
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,000
to have it be green slime or something and said it's bloody.

901
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,720
But I think I'm gonna have him edit it again and just make it green, green dragon slime.

902
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
But kids love it.

903
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,960
Adults love it.

904
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,280
But it's also horrifying.

905
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Yeah.

906
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,880
It sounds like it.

907
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,120
What did you just describe to me?

908
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,440
What did you just describe to me in a way that makes me want to see it?

909
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,360
Black demand is so high that Alex bring back his racist Chinese dragon character, which

910
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,400
by the way has not been gone for six months.

911
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,520
I have seen recently videos.

912
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,160
There was one making fun of that, um, what was that, uh, that guy who had his cat on

913
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
zoom.

914
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Oh yeah.

915
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,080
Alex did a version of that, but with the dragon, like instead of the cat.

916
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,080
Wow.

917
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Yeah.

918
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,800
So I mean like he's made those videos as recently as that.

919
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
It's not been six months.

920
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,960
He's doing this pretty regularly.

921
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
All right.

922
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,600
So he's got one apparently that involves a bloody anal probe.

923
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,840
I am really confused as to why you told me about the anal probe part.

924
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Yeah.

925
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,120
I feel like that's something, look, that's a no spoiler situation for sure.

926
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,120
Yeah.

927
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Okay.

928
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
I also love the kids love it.

929
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Adults love it.

930
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Kids love it.

931
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Adults love it.

932
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
It's like kicks.

933
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,680
It's some shit coming out of a dragon's asshole.

934
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,960
What are we, what are we going to be bad?

935
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,800
It's kid tested mother approved.

936
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,200
Yeah, absolutely.

937
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,920
Oh, choosy moms choose anal probes covered in blood.

938
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Yeah.

939
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
This is, this is wild.

940
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,560
I mean, like I would have listened to his wife in this situation does sound like it's

941
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
a little bit much.

942
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,040
I would have listened to her tennis partner.

943
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Yeah.

944
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Wonder what they think.

945
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Yeah.

946
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,080
So, um, Alex plays this video of an Australian journalist, uh, or, you know, I don't know.

947
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,080
I don't, I feel like journalists might be a little bit generous.

948
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,480
Seems like a editorial commentator type.

949
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,440
Oh, he plays this video of an Australian.

950
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Yeah.

951
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,120
This guy is, uh, giving a speech about, uh, globalism and how, uh, it's evil.

952
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
Sure.

953
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Sure.

954
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
And fine, whatever.

955
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,760
I also thought maybe this was a little bit racist.

956
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,760
He's talking about like how you gotta be skeptical of any organization that has the word world

957
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
in it.

958
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,840
Like the world, uh, world health organization, the world food program, uh, and then he throws

959
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
this in.

960
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,080
Then of course there's the world food program.

961
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,880
It too is part of the United nations and it actually won the Nobel peace prize in 2020.

962
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,920
Now all that sounds pretty impressive until you remember that Barack Obama won it in 2008

963
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,200
just for having the right skin color.

964
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Eeee.

965
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Wow.

966
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,120
I, I, I think it's a problem that Alex can't seem to find any, anybody who breaks down

967
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,040
complaints about globalism that doesn't veer into that direction.

968
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,320
Ultimately boils down to somebody's going to say skin color.

969
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Yeah.

970
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Yep.

971
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Ooh.

972
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,120
He understands how he got to Australia, right?

973
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,840
Um, like he understands the route that it took.

974
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,520
It was, it was perhaps a worldwide journey, if you will.

975
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,640
Uh, like he understands that, right?

976
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,720
Is that a concept that he gets?

977
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
I would assume so.

978
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Yeah.

979
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,040
I mean, cause it seems like he is absolutely, if he's making this argument, uh, white people

980
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,520
should leave Australia.

981
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,160
You should go away.

982
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,640
Well that's, that's, that's interesting.

983
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,600
I just, I, I find it really interesting the way that like you can, and I obviously I think

984
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,440
it's partially because these kinds of things are attractive to Alex and he enjoys it.

985
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Sure, sure, sure.

986
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,120
But you can't like find somebody to talk about these issues of like the challenges of globalized

987
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,740
connections and, uh, you know, living in a modern world where there's so much interconnectedness.

988
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:53,240
You can't find somebody to play that doesn't say Obama won a peace prize cause he has black

989
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
skin.

990
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,800
Like that's fucked up.

991
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,640
You can't find somebody that isn't like subtly racist or not subtly.

992
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,000
And it's the same thing with like, you know, the, uh, the Genesis Communications Network

993
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
can't take ads.

994
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,680
They can't attract anyone to give ads except for completely nonsensical, uh, websites.

995
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,080
I mean, what's wild about that is not since, uh, you know, like there are plenty of great

996
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,480
reasons to say that Obama shouldn't have that Nobel fucking peace prize.

997
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Sure.

998
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
There are tons of great reasons.

999
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
There's a lot of critiques.

1000
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
None of them have to do with his skin color.

1001
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
No.

1002
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,560
Ansance Yuki shouldn't have her Nobel peace prize either.

1003
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
But here we are.

1004
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Well, yeah.

1005
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,380
And, and the fact that like you have to distill it down to throw that kind of like that, uh,

1006
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,480
you know, what the audience wants, that sort of poking, Oh, he only got it because he has

1007
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
black skin.

1008
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,280
Uh, he could have said he, he got it and they didn't know that he was going to drone bomb

1009
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,480
the fucking world and it would be very reasonable.

1010
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Yeah.

1011
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,500
But the audience wouldn't find that funny or satisfied because they kind of want him

1012
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,520
to drone bomb the world and they just don't like the, he has the wrong skin color according

1013
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
to them.

1014
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Yeah.

1015
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,720
So, uh, one of the more delightful things that came out of the CPAC I think was the

1016
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,880
video of, uh, the, the people getting booed for trying to tell people to wear masks.

1017
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
Oh boy.

1018
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Did you see that?

1019
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
No, I didn't see.

1020
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,760
I, I want, I wanted nothing to do with this year's CPAC.

1021
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,400
So a guy comes on stage and he, we're going to listen to this too, but I'm just going

1022
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,960
to give you like a little bit of a breakdown.

1023
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Sure, sure, sure.

1024
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,840
Um, he comes on stage and he's like, Hey, look, masks.

1025
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,400
I know you all don't want to wear them, but we believe in property rights and we are in

1026
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
someone else's hotel.

1027
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Wow.

1028
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,160
So they get to make the rules.

1029
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
Good angle.

1030
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Good angle.

1031
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Way to do it.

1032
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,400
Way to fucking pull that one through.

1033
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,680
Hey, that's a good landing.

1034
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
Hey, yeah.

1035
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,280
It's like, okay, I understand you don't want to wear a mask, but our conservative principles

1036
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,160
demand that we respect the property rights of the owners of this hotel that are allowing

1037
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,020
us to hold this convention here.

1038
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,820
And I assume all the people there were like, uh, we don't have principles.

1039
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,820
Go fuck yourself.

1040
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,820
People weren't thrilled.

1041
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:07,160
And so he hands the mic off to a young woman and she, uh, she says, uh, you know, I know

1042
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,480
you don't want to wear masks, but can you work on that?

1043
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,040
That's also fair.

1044
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,500
It's like, that's also fair.

1045
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
It's like talking to children.

1046
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
It's amazing.

1047
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,120
And then someone yells freedom.

1048
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,600
Oh my God, somebody.

1049
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:31,340
That's outrageously funny because it is, it is so, um, just so, uh, so much of a clear

1050
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:37,540
illustration of this defiance, this oppositional defiance that characterizes, um, these crowds.

1051
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,040
It's just like, no, fuck you.

1052
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Yeah.

1053
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
That's insane.

1054
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
It's childish.

1055
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Here's, here's my pitch.

1056
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
All right.

1057
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,560
CPAC, but we get all the conservatives in there and we just play schoolhouse rock for

1058
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
them.

1059
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,460
And maybe we would be at least a better off place, you know, it wouldn't fix everything,

1060
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,020
but maybe when they understand how bills become law, they might be, you know, that's a, that's

1061
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,520
a globalist Soros brainwashing for the kids, man.

1062
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
You're probably right.

1063
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Yep.

1064
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,280
So anyway, Alex plays this clip of the people booing because he's, uh, he loves it.

1065
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
It's very weird.

1066
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,720
Um, this is a, uh, I saw this on CNN too, so I tuned in and found the actual clip.

1067
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,640
They were like, oh my gosh, they told them all wear their mask and they didn't and they

1068
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,620
booed and almost no one was wearing the stupid mask.

1069
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,620
They tried to enforce it.

1070
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,960
Oh, this is private property.

1071
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Do it.

1072
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
No, it's all a giant fraud.

1073
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,680
It's saying, I'm not wearing your little burka, your little face diaper scumbags.

1074
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
So here it is.

1075
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,200
CPAC host booed for asking attendees to wear their muzzles.

1076
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,340
We conservatives believe in the rule of law because we know that when the law is enforced,

1077
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,920
our rights are protected.

1078
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Our rights are protected.

1079
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
The laws of fraud.

1080
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,560
Such a big effort to talk about the bill of rights, but I also want to mention one thing

1081
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,120
and I know this might sound like a little bit of a downer, but we also believe in property

1082
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,520
rights and this is a private hotel and we believe in the rule of law.

1083
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,320
So we need to comply with the laws of this county that we're in.

1084
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
There is no law.

1085
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,720
Private hotel, just like your house gets to set its own rules.

1086
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Statement.

1087
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
I am the law.

1088
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,360
Our CPAC director.

1089
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Well, as Dan mentioned, we are in a private facility and we do want to be respectful of

1090
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,920
the ordinances that they have as their private property.

1091
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,480
So this woman looks like she's had a lot of vaccines in the ballroom when you're seated

1092
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,640
or she has her soul sucked wearing a mask.

1093
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,600
So if everybody can go ahead, work on that.

1094
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Work on that.

1095
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
I know.

1096
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
I know.

1097
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
It's, it's not.

1098
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,120
You'll work on that.

1099
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,440
William Wallace, ladies and gentlemen, you have the right to set the own rules in your

1100
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,640
own house and we're borrowing them down.

1101
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Thank you.

1102
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:58,000
It's, it's just, I can't imagine having a response to that other than like, wow, that's

1103
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
bummer.

1104
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,080
Like if, even if I were somebody who was like opposed to wearing masks or being required

1105
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,680
to, I was just like, Hey, we're, we're here.

1106
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,120
It's the rules of the place.

1107
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Yeah.

1108
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Okay.

1109
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
I understand.

1110
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,560
All of these people should be embarrassed.

1111
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
Yeah.

1112
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,000
They should really be embarrassed because they're fucking children and it's kind of

1113
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
sad.

1114
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's not kind of sad.

1115
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,520
It's incredibly sad.

1116
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,600
It bums me out.

1117
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,320
And the fact that I'm going to go home and think about how stupid they are is an even

1118
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,720
bigger bummer to me.

1119
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Yeah.

1120
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,080
And I think that that clip just so fully like demonstrates that behavior.

1121
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:39,480
Someone gently trying to come up with an excuse for why you need to do this.

1122
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,640
Yeah.

1123
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,840
Trying to, it's like trying to trick kids into eating vegetables.

1124
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
No, totally.

1125
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,400
It's the idea that you would have to, somebody, a group of people got together and were like,

1126
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,840
we've got to try and get these people to wear masks.

1127
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,360
They're not going to listen to medical ideas.

1128
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,000
They're not going to listen to, they don't give a shit about other people.

1129
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That person could die right now.

1130
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,320
And if they didn't like them, they would all cheer.

1131
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,320
Yeah.

1132
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
So what do we do?

1133
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,400
Oh, you know, these people really love property rights.

1134
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Yeah.

1135
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
That's something that they're really into.

1136
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,000
Hey guys, it's borderline.

1137
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,040
Like you have to be, Hey, if we want to carry guns in this place, we got to wear a mask

1138
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
in this place.

1139
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,840
Those are the rules.

1140
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,160
That would, that would might work.

1141
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
Yeah.

1142
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,360
I mean, that's about all you can do to deal with these fucking children.

1143
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Yeah.

1144
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,400
But like I said, there's a little bit of a shorter episode because it's so much of just

1145
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,960
Trump's speech and you know, whatever.

1146
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
Yeah.

1147
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,720
I'm, I feel like it is the greatest privilege in the world not to listen to him speak ever

1148
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
a gun.

1149
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Yeah.

1150
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,280
And it's, uh, there was one, there's one part where Alex was saying like, Oh, isn't this

1151
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,520
refreshing after weeks of Biden, Oh, just so much, I was like, I don't have to disagree.

1152
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Wow.

1153
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,120
Um, but you know, uh, I, I, I, what was the policy platform that came out of CPAC this

1154
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
year?

1155
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,120
Dan?

1156
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,120
And avoid canceling things.

1157
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:09,320
Did they do, did they, no bother with like, we want lower taxes, none of that.

1158
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,040
Just straight up, nonstop bile and cheering.

1159
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Yeah.

1160
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
Great.

1161
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,560
I was looking at the speaker's list and it was pretty surprising.

1162
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,120
Like, you know, you got Trump, you got Trump Jr.

1163
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,280
Then that's like, well, don't know why Trump Jr. needs to be there anymore.

1164
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,000
I kind of understand Trump.

1165
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,840
You gotta appease the lunatics and what have you, but then he had like, James O'Keefe was

1166
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
giving a speech.

1167
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Really?

1168
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,480
Charlie Kirk and then Lauren Boebert.

1169
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Oh my God.

1170
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Yeah.

1171
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,760
I was like, wow, this is, this is not subtle.

1172
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
Whoa boy.

1173
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Yeah.

1174
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
We are white nationalists.

1175
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:55,000
Um, so we have one last clip here and it's Alex, uh, someone has found a clip of him

1176
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,320
talking about his Rockefeller document that he calls the lockstep document, which is not,

1177
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
that's not what it is.

1178
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
It doesn't have anything to do with it.

1179
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,640
Um, that lockstep is one of the four scenarios that have painted, uh, about possible ways

1180
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,280
that technology and, uh, governance can, uh, uh, progress into the future.

1181
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
Right.

1182
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,160
Um, and it's interesting.

1183
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,800
Someone found a clip of him talking about it back in 2010.

1184
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
Did they?

1185
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Oh really?

1186
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,280
And Alex plays this clip as if like this proves I've always been right.

1187
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,280
Everything.

1188
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,260
But I will make an argument on the other side of this clip that this makes things worse

1189
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,260
for Alex.

1190
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,260
It makes sense.

1191
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,260
All right.

1192
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,260
Let's end this with my prediction.

1193
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:40,640
11 years ago, the lockdowns and then Owen Schroyer is coming up with Sunday live.

1194
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,640
Please spread the word.

1195
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
God bless you all.

1196
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,200
The Alex Jones show, there is a war on for your mind.

1197
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,840
I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.

1198
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,520
And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've

1199
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,520
had chills, uh, since last night.

1200
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,640
This just confirms everything else we've already researched Rockefeller study and visions future

1201
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,200
dictatorship controlled by elite millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints,

1202
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,560
the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.

1203
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,600
But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller foundation documents about the GMO food to

1204
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,360
sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in.

1205
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,880
This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back.

1206
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,400
So I mean, it's just another headline for him at this point.

1207
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,140
He doesn't call it operation lockstep because that wasn't the branding on it at this point.

1208
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,880
Now here is why I think this makes things worse.

1209
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,320
And if I were Alex, I wouldn't have played this.

1210
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,520
He didn't keep talking about this.

1211
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,000
It's not like it's shocking that someone was able to find a clip from 2010 of him covering

1212
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,980
this back then when I guess it probably someone picked it up and ran with it.

1213
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,980
Didn't have much legs.

1214
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,240
And so people just forgot about it.

1215
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,920
It's not like 2011, 2012, he's still talking about this document.

1216
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:08,120
He completely forgets about it until Jim Fetzer starts yelling about it on his blog in 2020.

1217
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,160
Like he doesn't, like this is, this is worse because if you actually believe, like Alex

1218
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,640
is pretending to, that this document lays out the globalist plan, you had it and you

1219
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,640
whiffed.

1220
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,640
Yeah.

1221
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,640
You dropped the ball.

1222
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,640
Again.

1223
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
Yeah.

1224
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
For the millionth time.

1225
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,760
And it's, it's astounding to me the way, the way in which he, he just like, he, he thinks

1226
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,920
that this is a win and it's actually like, it's, it kind of raises more questions about

1227
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
his process.

1228
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Yeah.

1229
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,920
I mean, it makes him look more full of shit.

1230
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,560
I would probably argue that the, it is really bad for him because it's basically saying

1231
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,560
that this is, cause it's not the same document.

1232
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Yeah.

1233
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
I think it is.

1234
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
That he's talking about?

1235
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,560
I think it is.

1236
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Oh, okay.

1237
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,560
Yeah.

1238
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,920
It's the same thing about goddamn near every document since 2010.

1239
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,920
Yeah.

1240
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah.

1241
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:02,480
It's been 10 years and not only has he not kept talking about it, none of it has happened.

1242
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,480
True.

1243
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,480
So.

1244
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,480
Ugh.

1245
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,480
But he's a prophet.

1246
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Sure.

1247
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,840
And he's a psychic, but he's not like a psychic psychic, everyone's a little bit psychic.

1248
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,320
Well, everybody's a little bit psychic, it's called, uh, memory.

1249
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,760
So I found that a little weird and one of the things that I decided that I think I want

1250
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,320
to do is I think I want to go try and find that episode.

1251
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,320
The 2010?

1252
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,320
Yeah.

1253
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,320
Yeah.

1254
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
I think I want to go try and do that.

1255
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,320
I think that's a good one.

1256
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,600
Maybe we'll do that for Wednesday or something since this is a shorter episode.

1257
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
Yeah.

1258
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
I think that would be a good idea.

1259
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
Yeah.

1260
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Cause I'm very curious to hear his coverage of it and compare it to the present day coverage

1261
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,720
of this document.

1262
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,040
I wonder if he knows what the document is back in 2010.

1263
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,560
That would be a really good, oh yeah.

1264
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,960
You gotta do that now.

1265
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,960
Yeah.

1266
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
You literally have no choice.

1267
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,560
I'm getting to work on it now.

1268
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,560
Click!

1269
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Yeah.

1270
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Um, so.

1271
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,560
Yeah.

1272
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,560
At underscore.

1273
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,800
I, I, you know, I think this is, this is a shorter episode, but I think it's worth it

1274
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:04,080
if only for the weird commercial, that commercial is fantastic.

1275
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:11,400
That is the kind of thing that not only should you not accept a commercial advertising money

1276
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,800
from that, you should denounce it.

1277
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,160
This is the kind of thing that Ted Anderson should be forced to apologize for accepting

1278
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:24,560
advertising money to air that is something that like, there would be a scandal in any

1279
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,880
other media outlet, like getting in bed with something like this.

1280
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,880
No, I know.

1281
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:36,720
That's like, uh, that's like fucking somebody running a advertisement from Hitler in 1937

1282
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,200
in the New York Times.

1283
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,680
Just like straight up, Hey, well, let's kill juice.

1284
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,960
It's it's a, it's a bit much.

1285
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
Yeah.

1286
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,560
And I would, uh, I would humbly request that Ted Anderson, uh, pull that commercial and

1287
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,640
also apologize.

1288
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,640
That's really the point.

1289
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,200
And sell the network and go away forever.

1290
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,960
That is the point of this episode, really.

1291
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,960
Go away.

1292
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,960
Fuck you, Ted Anderson.

1293
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,960
Fuck you, Ted Anderson.

1294
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Uh, but we'll be back.

1295
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,560
I'm going to try and dig up that episode and, uh, hopefully we'll be able to put that together

1296
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,560
for Wednesday.

1297
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,560
Sounds like a plan.

1298
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,560
Uh, but until then, Jordan, we have a website.

1299
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
We do have a website.

1300
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,560
It's knowledgefight.com.

1301
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,560
Yeah.

1302
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,560
We're also on Twitter.

1303
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,560
We are on Twitter.

We're also on Facebook.

1307
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,680
And if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1308
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,680
doing God's work right now.

1309
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,680
Yeah.

1310
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
We'll be back.

1311
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
But until then, I'm Neo.

1312
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,680
I'm Leo.

1313
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680

You're on the air.

1318
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,560
Thanks for holding.

1319
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
Hello, Alex.
