N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.440
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.120
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.120
Knowledgefight.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.120
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.120
Knowledgefight.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.120
Riddle her.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
Riddle her.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.120
Riddle her.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.120
Need money.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
Riddle her.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.120
Riddle her.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.120
Riddle her.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.120
Andy Enchanze.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.120
Andy Enchanze.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.120
Stop it.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.120
Andy Enchanze.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.120
Andy Enchanze.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.120
It's time to pray.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.120
Andy Enchanze.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.120
You're on the air.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.120
Thanks for holding.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
Hello Alex.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
I'm a first time caller.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.120
I'm a huge fan.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
I love your work.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.120
Knowledgefight.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.120
Knowledgefight.com.

00:54.120 --> 00:59.440
I love you.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.440
Hey everybody.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.440
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.440
I'm Dan.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.440
I'm Jordan.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
We're a couple dudes.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.200
We like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.840
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
Jordan.

01:08.840 --> 01:09.840
Dan.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.840
Yeah.

01:10.840 --> 01:11.840
Quick question for you.

01:11.840 --> 01:12.840
What's up?

01:12.840 --> 01:13.840
What's your bright spot?

01:13.840 --> 01:15.040
My bright spot today is, why don't you go first.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
Okay.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.000
I think we might wind up having a very similar bright spot.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.240
My bright spot was last night we celebrated our friend's birthday.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.640
Not a health ranger.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.200
Our friend who is not a health ranger.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
No, no.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.920
Not, very strongly not a health ranger.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.920
John.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.680
And it was a fantastic time.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.680
We hung out.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.240
We played video, played games together over Zoom.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.240
It was fantastic.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.240
I had a great night.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
Yes.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.240
Delightful time.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.240
Yeah.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.240
It was had.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.960
Later on the bartender asked me to leave, but other than that it was a good night.

01:45.960 --> 01:46.960
Uh huh.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.960
Yeah.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.760
You know, since you've claimed that, I guess I can't have that be my bright spot.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.760
I think you could.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.760
That's what I shall say.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.760
What?

01:53.760 --> 02:00.880
I got a message from one of our listeners, a policy wonk out there, who had some music

02:00.880 --> 02:03.800
that they had made that they wanted a review of.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
Oh, okay.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.320
And I gave it a little bit of a spin.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
All right.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.320
And this is a gentleman by the name of Derek Avery.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.320
And I checked it out.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.600
You can find some albums on Spotify.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.600
I enjoyed it.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
It's great.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.600
It's a pop punk kind of vibe.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.600
That's awesome.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.440
I listened to his album, Here's to Better Misery.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.400
And I enjoyed it quite a bit.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.400
That's awesome.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.400
And I can say that sincerely.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.400
And I think that's probably why it's a bright spot.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.400
Yes.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.400
Because I don't have to be...

02:29.400 --> 02:31.400
I don't have to be like, it's good.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
Yeah.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
No, no, no.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.400
It's great.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
It's...

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
I love it when a fan does stuff.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.400
Yeah.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
Yeah.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.400
I enjoyed it.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.520
So thanks for sharing that with me, Derek.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.520
I appreciate it.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.960
And if people want some pop punk, you should go check that out.

02:45.960 --> 02:46.960
So Jordan.

02:46.960 --> 02:47.960
Yes, sir.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.560
Today we are back into the present day.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.720
Oh, shit.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.800
I've got February 28th, 2021, Blackjack.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.800
Ah, za-za.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
Yep.

02:57.800 --> 03:03.560
I waited until you had your vape in your mouth so you couldn't respond.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.560
That was different.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.680
That was kind of cheating on my part.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.680
Just comically easy.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.680
Yeah.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.880
So that's Sunday, today's episode as we're recording this.

03:10.880 --> 03:11.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.720
One of the reasons why I wanted to do this episode for the Sunday is I wanted to see

03:16.720 --> 03:20.320
like, hey, CPAC has run its course.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.320
Sure.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.560
I just, I remember last year, such heights.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.560
It was a big deal last year.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.560
CPAC was...

03:27.560 --> 03:29.480
So much, so much going on.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.520
It was a celebrity-filled affair.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.000
Alex went there.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Exactly.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
And the bartender told him to leave.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.320
He missed his own speech at the end.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.840
He was supposed to be the headliner.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.160
Nick Fuentes basically took over the show.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
There were fireworks.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.160
It was great.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.160
Yeah.

03:47.160 --> 03:54.240
It was Enrique Tarrio made a joke about how there's probably an FBI informant in the room.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.240
Which is funny.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.400
Because it was him.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.780
It was outrageous.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.700
It was such a good time, that CPAC event.

04:01.700 --> 04:12.200
There was so much going on, so much nonsense, and it's just such a sign how sad it is now.

04:12.200 --> 04:16.200
He's not even going to DC, he's not going to CPAC.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.840
He's just sitting in his studio, having a show.

04:18.840 --> 04:19.840
Yeah!

04:19.840 --> 04:27.280
I mean, last year, it was full-on the gathering of the Juggalos level, but for white nationalists

04:27.280 --> 04:28.280
instead of cool people.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.160
Yeah, Mike Flynn's son showed up.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
Yeah, exactly.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.720
Kind of almost cried, talking about how great his dad is.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.160
I'm so grateful to not have to have paid a single iota of attention to CPAC this year.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.400
Yeah, I saw a little bit.

04:41.400 --> 04:47.240
I didn't watch as much as some have, because I just don't care.

04:47.240 --> 04:55.680
But the value of this episode, of Alex's show, is that it's going on during Trump's speech

04:55.680 --> 04:56.680
at CPAC.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.680
Ooooh!

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
So he's counter-programming.

04:58.680 --> 05:02.220
He's counter-programming against his God-King!

05:02.220 --> 05:06.340
Which means that Alex just plays the speech mostly for the first hour, and does a little

05:06.340 --> 05:07.440
bit of commentary.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.720
But there's still a couple of things that I find particularly important, and one thing

05:12.720 --> 05:15.520
that drove me a little bit crazy.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
What's that?

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
Well, we'll get to it.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
We'll get to it.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
God damn it.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.520
I don't want to spoil it.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.520
You're so good.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.060
But before we do any of that, we've got to take a moment to say thank you to the folks

05:24.060 --> 05:25.440
who have signed up and are supporting the show.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.440
That's a great idea.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.880
So first, Miss Elanius.

05:27.880 --> 05:28.880
That's Miss Elanius.

05:28.880 --> 05:29.880
Yes and no, no, no.

05:29.880 --> 05:30.880
I understand.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.880
Thank you so much.

05:31.880 --> 05:32.880
You are now a policy wonk.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.880
I'm a policy wonk.

05:33.880 --> 05:34.880
Thank you very much, Mademoiselle Elanius.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
Thank you.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.880
Next.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.880
I'm a huge fan.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
I love your work.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
Thank you so much.

05:39.880 --> 05:40.880
You are now a policy wonk.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.880
I'm a policy wonk.

05:41.880 --> 05:42.880
Thank you very much.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.880
Thank you.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
Next.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.880
Guisapina, the juiciest ice cube.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
Thank you so much.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
You are now a policy wonk.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
I'm a policy wonk.

05:48.880 --> 05:49.880
I guess I'm the second.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.880
Wait.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
Guisapina or Giuseppe?

05:51.880 --> 05:52.880
Giuseppina?

05:52.880 --> 05:53.880
Giuseppina?

05:53.880 --> 05:54.880
Yeah.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
I don't know.

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
I'm not good with names.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
I don't know.

05:57.880 --> 05:58.880
I'm just asking.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.880
Okay.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
All right.

06:00.880 --> 06:01.880
Next.

06:01.880 --> 06:02.880
Etta and Nessa P. Thank you so much.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.880
You are now a policy wonk.

06:03.880 --> 06:04.880
I'm a policy wonk.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.880
All right.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.880
Next.

06:07.880 --> 06:08.880
Sully the Canadian youth.

06:08.880 --> 06:14.880
From what I hear, this Sully refers to Alex Jones as the shouty man with demon voices.

06:14.880 --> 06:15.880
Yeah.

06:15.880 --> 06:16.880
That sounds about right.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.880
You are now a policy wonk.

06:17.880 --> 06:18.880
I'm a policy wonk.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.880
Thank you very much.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.880
Thank you.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.880
And then I got a couple of technocrat shout-outs to jump into here.

06:22.880 --> 06:23.880
First, Ben.

06:23.880 --> 06:24.880
Thank you so much.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.880
You are now a technocrat.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.880
This is tough.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.880
Lauren B. Thank you so much.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.880
You're a technocrat.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.880
And also happy birthday two weeks ago.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.880
This is what we're doing now.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.880
Birthday shout-outs retroactive.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:40.880 --> 06:41.880
That's what you get.

06:41.880 --> 06:42.880
That's what you get.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.880
We're not doing this current anymore.

06:44.880 --> 06:45.880
Yeah.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.880
We will do six month late.

06:48.880 --> 06:49.880
Exactly.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.880
Sliding birthday shout-outs.

06:51.880 --> 06:57.880
Anyway, Lauren, I hope two weeks ago you had a great birthday and you are now a technocrat.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.880
I'm a policy wonk.

06:59.880 --> 07:00.880
Crikey, mate.

07:00.880 --> 07:01.880
That's fantastic.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.880
Have yourself a brew.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.880
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:03.880 --> 07:06.880
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

07:06.880 --> 07:07.880
Let's just get down to business.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.880
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.880
Why you pimps so good?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.880
My neck is freakishly large.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.880
I declare info war on you.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.880
Thank you so much.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.880
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

07:19.880 --> 07:24.880
So, Jordan, you know, this is going to be a little bit of a briefer episode.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.880
It's going to be a little bit shorter.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.880
And one of the reasons, like I said, is because-

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
Well, an hour of it is Trump's speech.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.880
Right.

07:29.880 --> 07:30.880
Yeah.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.880
He had set out to, you know, get this CPAC wrap up.

07:33.880 --> 07:39.880
I thought there would be, like, a lot of, some dense things to get into, some reflections.

07:39.880 --> 07:40.880
And no.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.880
It's a big old nothing.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.880
Yeah.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.880
It's a little bit of running commentary of Trump's speech.

07:46.880 --> 07:47.880
Sure.

07:47.880 --> 07:51.880
With a couple of completely absurd things thrown in.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.880
And so, you know, it starts pretty much how you would expect it to.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.880
It's February 28th on the Sunday live transmission.

07:58.880 --> 08:06.880
President Trump has just started speaking from Florida at the 2021 CPAC that the controlled

08:06.880 --> 08:10.880
corporate press and big tech are trying to censor and block everywhere.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.880
But before we hear from the real president, let's hear from the imposter.

08:16.880 --> 08:22.880
Let's hear from the puppet who just did a victory lap Friday in Houston, Texas.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.880
Yeah.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.880
So, Alex says, you know, he's setting the table with Trump is the real president.

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
Sure.

08:28.880 --> 08:29.880
Sure.

08:29.880 --> 08:30.880
Which is good.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.880
That's great.

08:31.880 --> 08:32.880
It's healthy.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.880
It's good stuff.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.880
Yeah.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.880
Yeah.

08:35.880 --> 08:36.880
The denial is fantastic.

08:36.880 --> 08:37.880
And he has a clip of Biden saying some words that sound like he is confused.

08:37.880 --> 08:38.880
Sure.

08:38.880 --> 08:39.880
Sure.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.880
And so this is evidence that his brain is deteriorating.

08:42.880 --> 08:43.880
All right.

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
Fine.

08:44.880 --> 08:45.880
Yeah.

08:45.880 --> 08:51.880
And I think that this next clip is kind of, like, indicative of how the large chunk of

08:51.880 --> 08:52.880
this show goes.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.880
It's really just Alex getting excited while Trump gives a speech.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.880
Okay.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.880
That's gross.

08:58.880 --> 09:04.680
Let there be no doubt we will be victorious and America will be stronger and greater than

09:04.680 --> 09:05.680
ever before.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.680
Yes.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.680
Yes.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.680
We will defeat the globalist.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
Woo.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.680
Yes.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.680
Yeah.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
He's pretty.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
He's Ed McMahon-ing it?

09:14.680 --> 09:15.680
Yeah.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
All right.

09:16.680 --> 09:23.440
A large portion of the speech that airs on Alex's version of Trump's speech is a lot

09:23.440 --> 09:26.680
of fear mongering about immigrants.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.680
Sure.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
Sure.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.680
Why not?

09:29.680 --> 09:30.680
What are we doing?

09:30.680 --> 09:32.680
It's pretty heavily hitting that tone.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
Yeah.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.240
And I found it to be alarming, upsetting.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
Yeah.

09:38.240 --> 09:43.440
But I was surprised by one thing, and that is that, you know, there's a little bit of

09:43.440 --> 09:46.280
time to fuck around in this speech, too.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.280
Sure.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.280
Sure.

09:48.280 --> 09:52.480
I also want to pay my love and respect to the great Rush Limbaugh.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
Absolutely.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
Kill him again.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.840
Call him a call in.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
Call him a rush.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.840
That betrayals.

09:58.840 --> 09:59.840
Rush wasn't perfect.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
He was pro-America.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.840
I believe in the country.

10:03.840 --> 10:09.520
Who is watching closely and smiling down on us.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.680
He's watching and he's loving it.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
He's loving it.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.000
Do you think he's up there, buddies?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.040
Do you really?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.520
I find that fun.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
Yeah.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.720
You know, just to give a shout out to my boy Rush.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.720
He's looking down at us.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.720
He's loving it.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.720
He's loving what he's seeing here at CPAC.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.720
Oh, man.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.720
What is he...

10:28.720 --> 10:29.720
Did he do the cross?

10:29.720 --> 10:31.480
Did he cross himself?

10:31.480 --> 10:32.480
Did he pour one out?

10:32.480 --> 10:34.480
He might have been crossing his fingers.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.320
Did he strangle a parole in front of everyone to celebrate?

10:38.320 --> 10:40.480
Yeah, that seemed a little pandery.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.560
Yeah, maybe.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.560
But also probably sincere.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.560
Yeah.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.560
I don't know.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.880
Without him, he wouldn't have been elected.

10:45.880 --> 10:52.080
So a while back, 50 years ago, right after the election.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.080
Okay.

10:53.080 --> 10:57.960
There was talk after Trump had lost that he was going to start his own party.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
The Patriot Party.

10:58.960 --> 10:59.960
Right.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.960
The Patriot Party.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
Yes.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.600
People are pretty excited about this because they're nuts.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.440
And of course, rightfully, people on the left are like, please do that.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.440
Yes.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.440
Yeah, yeah.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.440
Absolutely.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.440
Completely splinter the right wing.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.440
No, no, no.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
Do that.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.440
Do that.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
Go white nationalists and quieter white nationalists.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.440
That's what we would like you to do.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.440
Thank you.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
Yeah.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Divide the voting block.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.560
That's a very smart thing to do.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.560
Turns out this is fake news.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.920
Trump was never going to do that.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.920
Wow.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.920
And so...

11:27.920 --> 11:28.920
Why would he?

11:28.920 --> 11:29.920
He already owns the Republican Party.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
Yeah.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
Yeah.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
And he basically announces that.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
Oh, okay.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
We're not starting new parties.

11:34.920 --> 11:40.880
You know, they kept saying, he's going to start a brand new party.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.360
We have the Republican Party.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.960
It's going to unite and be stronger than it was before.

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
That's right.

11:46.960 --> 11:47.960
I am not starting a new party.

11:47.960 --> 11:48.960
Yes.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.760
That was fake news.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.240
Fake news.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.240
No.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.520
Wouldn't that be brilliant?

11:54.520 --> 11:58.880
Let's start a new party and let's divide our vote so that you can never win.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.880
No, we're not interested in that.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.160
Someone had to explain that to you.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.640
Shut the fuck up.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.640
Tremendous.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.680
Mr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody's ever heard of before.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.440
More popular than anybody.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.440
That's all of us.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.440
It's all numbers.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.440
Yeah.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.440
Hit pause.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.440
We're going to come back with this.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.440
Let's do four.

12:15.440 --> 12:20.320
We're going to come back in Georgia and other people winning with 75 points, 71 points,

12:20.320 --> 12:22.160
69 points, 70 points.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.880
All the super hardcore Trump candidates were winning in districts that had been about 50-50

12:26.880 --> 12:31.200
before by huge 20-point extra margins never before seen.

12:31.200 --> 12:35.140
So Marjorie Taylor Greene won her race essentially unopposed.

12:35.140 --> 12:39.480
The Democrat candidate had withdrawn from the race due to personal matters and that's

12:39.480 --> 12:40.480
why she won.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.480
Yeah.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.560
Also, a simple scan of the history of that district, Georgia's 14th.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.480
It disproves what Alex is saying.

12:46.480 --> 12:51.240
In the 2018 election, Republican Tom Graves won with 76.5% of the vote.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.600
On a pro-slavery platform.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.600
In 2016, 2014, and 2010, Graves ran unopposed.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.720
In 2012, he won with 73% of the vote.

13:01.720 --> 13:06.920
According to the Cook Partisan Voter Index, this is a Republican plus 27 district, which

13:06.920 --> 13:09.400
means it skews heavily Republican.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
That would make sense.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.200
That, in addition to her opponent withdrawing, is why Marjorie Taylor Greene won.

13:14.200 --> 13:19.360
Not because pro-Trump candidates are so exciting and they're super mega popular.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.920
Also, how dare you?

13:21.920 --> 13:24.320
You don't care about voting.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.280
You think that the election was stolen.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.560
Don't tell me that they won elections.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.080
Well, yeah.

13:30.080 --> 13:36.440
No, because the election was stolen, but if it hadn't have been stolen, they would have

13:36.440 --> 13:38.040
won with like 80% of the vote.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.040
Sure.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.040
90% of the vote.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.040
Okay.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.040
That's how popular people are who like Trump.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.040
All right.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.040
All right.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.040
Thanks for that, Dan.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.040
Yep.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.040
You should know better.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.480
I really should at this point.

13:48.480 --> 13:57.880
So Jordan, I have, you know, around the Super Bowl, I definitely got into Alex's commercial

13:57.880 --> 13:58.880
stylings.

13:58.880 --> 13:59.880
Yes, they were fantastic.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.160
He was doing some very weird ad reads.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.360
It was super bizarre.

14:06.360 --> 14:12.360
Now, this episode I'm listening to through the GCN, the Genesis Communications Network

14:12.360 --> 14:16.000
feeds, which is the company that does Alex's syndication.

14:16.000 --> 14:23.800
So all of the radio stations get this feed, all the radio stations that play Alex's show

14:23.800 --> 14:24.800
get this feed.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.240
And these are the commercials that are put on along with the package.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.360
These are the people who sponsor Genesis Communications Network.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.960
And I listened to one of these commercials and it really, really upset me.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.960
Oh, no.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.280
Here is the thing that blew my mind and almost drove me crazy.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.280
Okay.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.160
The days of extermination is set to commence now.

14:45.160 --> 14:49.480
And as population die-off becomes evident, you know it is the time of punishment in all

14:49.480 --> 14:50.560
that is written.

14:50.560 --> 14:55.120
The cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming frauds, also used as false

14:55.120 --> 14:56.780
proof of their Christ.

14:56.780 --> 15:00.400
They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.280
Now they claim to be his Christ based upon blood type, DNA, and long lifespan.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.320
Go to unveilingthem.com.

15:07.320 --> 15:11.280
That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
Whoa.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.280
Wow.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.280
Wow.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.240
Do you have any idea?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.240
Wow.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.240
First, first.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.120
Could you make sense of that?

15:20.120 --> 15:26.080
First, his voice and the way he's delivering it and the kind of choppy nature of the end

15:26.080 --> 15:29.880
of the sentence and the beginning of a new one makes it sound a little bit like he's

15:29.880 --> 15:35.520
a synthetic robot voice or somebody speaking, like somebody wearing a mask speaking through

15:35.520 --> 15:38.120
a vocalizer or something like that.

15:38.120 --> 15:42.600
Well, I know from my time of trying to get into voiceovers for commercials that a lot

15:42.600 --> 15:47.560
of the time, if you're not a pretty good editor, it'll sound rough because you're trying to

15:47.560 --> 15:51.520
jam it into a very specific span of time.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.280
You buy a 30 second block and it's got to be 30 seconds.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.440
It cannot be 28.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.760
It cannot be 32.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.760
Yeah.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.080
And that leads to whenever you're not that good, you'll end up sounding like that.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.080
Sure.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.080
Sure.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
And that's kind of unfortunate.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.640
But I'm more interested in the content and how that...

16:06.640 --> 16:08.760
What did you take away from that?

16:08.760 --> 16:14.760
What I thought I heard was that some people are claiming to be Christ or related to Christ.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.760
Maybe.

16:15.760 --> 16:16.760
All right.

16:16.760 --> 16:23.520
And because it is unveiling them, so there's a group of people who are doing that.

16:23.520 --> 16:30.340
Now what I don't understand is how the population die off and the fake climate change and such

16:30.340 --> 16:32.360
ties into the group of people.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.200
What do you think they're selling?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.960
Oh boy.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
That's a good question.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.960
Spoiler alert.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.960
It's nothing.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.960
They're not selling anything.

16:39.960 --> 16:40.960
Okay.

16:40.960 --> 16:41.960
All right.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
All right.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.960
That commercial hit me a little weird.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.520
And honestly, it speaks to the level of sponsors that Genesis Communications Network is able

16:47.520 --> 16:48.920
to attract at this point.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.920
Yeah.

16:49.920 --> 16:50.920
That's rough.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
That's terrifying.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.920
Yeah.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.040
I checked out this website and apparently the person behind it believes that the MMR

16:56.040 --> 17:01.320
vaccine has created iron poisoning in the population, which is the cause of all disease.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.520
Oh, well, I'm glad that that's cleared up.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.760
Now I should be clear.

17:05.760 --> 17:11.400
There's actually, the iron poisoning goes much deeper than this and it goes back quite

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
a long ways.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.920
And the MMR vaccine isn't really creating it as much as exacerbating it and causing

17:16.920 --> 17:19.240
problems for people who are already iron poisoned.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.240
Okay.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
Okay.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.240
All right.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.360
So even if you didn't get the MMR vaccine is what they're saying.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.760
Don't worry.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.760
Don't worry.

17:26.760 --> 17:27.760
You're still fucked.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
You're still iron poisoned.

17:28.760 --> 17:29.760
You can still join us.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.760
Yeah.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.680
Apparently the Euphrates River is actually the Mississippi and the real population of

17:33.680 --> 17:36.600
the United States is just about 200 million.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
Okay.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.640
As it turns out, only people with AB blood type are safe from this iron poisoning.

17:42.640 --> 17:46.200
And I have to admit this site's argument is a little bit difficult to follow.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.200
All right.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.200
I'm trying my best here.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.200
Sell me on this one.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.560
It kind of inevitably drifts into a little bit of British Israelism.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.720
Well, yeah, of course.

17:53.720 --> 17:59.560
And it starts to feel a little bit anti-Semitic as you're reading through this.

17:59.560 --> 18:04.360
There's one page on the site titled, quote, round them up, which argues that everyone

18:04.360 --> 18:08.440
in any position of influence in the world is in on this plan to poison everyone with

18:08.440 --> 18:09.440
iron.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.880
Uh, I mean, they would have to be.

18:10.880 --> 18:15.240
This includes quote, all of mainstream and alternative media, which I think would include

18:15.240 --> 18:16.240
InfoWars.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.800
That includes damn near everybody.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.800
Yeah.

18:18.800 --> 18:23.960
About these media entities, there's a note in bold letters, quote, commandeer these immediately.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.660
Commandeer these immediately?

18:25.660 --> 18:26.660
There's a note?

18:26.660 --> 18:27.660
Mm-hmm.

18:27.660 --> 18:28.660
Wait, on the website?

18:28.660 --> 18:29.660
Yes.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.720
Like, like it's something that somebody put up on their to-do list.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
Yes.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.360
Like it's on the refrigerator of like commandeer those first.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
Mm-hmm.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
Gotcha.

18:38.360 --> 18:41.840
Like literally everyone is in on the plan, including quote, all nursing and assisted

18:41.840 --> 18:47.520
living homes, all corporations, water treatment facilities, and food and beverage industry

18:47.520 --> 18:48.520
farms and ranches.

18:48.520 --> 18:53.680
Well, then I think that kind of, that counts half the world, right?

18:53.680 --> 18:57.800
So I think half the world is iron poisoning the other half.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.840
Well, see, apparently this is how this breaks down.

19:01.840 --> 19:02.840
Okay.

19:02.840 --> 19:08.280
There are these people who are AB blood type and thus are, they're not iron poisoned.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
Okay.

19:09.280 --> 19:12.000
Their blood type is not susceptible to the iron poisoning.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
All right.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Iron can't touch AB.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yes.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
But it can touch A and B.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.080
And it has something to do with, I wasn't quite able to figure this out, but it has

19:20.080 --> 19:24.800
something to do with like AB blood being found on the Shroud of Turin.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.800
Okay.

19:25.800 --> 19:26.800
All right.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.800
I'm listening.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
I'm listening.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.680
Everybody with AB blood is related to Jesus.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.600
And they are not susceptible to iron poisoning.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.600
Good stuff.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.440
So they're not going to be hurt by things like the COVID-19 vaccine, which will take

19:39.440 --> 19:44.200
out all of the people who have iron poisoning.

19:44.200 --> 19:49.220
The vaccine will like exacerbate these parasites or whatever that's inside you due to iron

19:49.220 --> 19:50.520
poisoning.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.640
Can we do a follow up on that?

19:52.640 --> 19:57.080
Like can they, because we will know in the future whether or not they're correct.

19:57.080 --> 20:06.200
So I would imagine that next year, let's make a gentleman's wager, me and the British Israelites.

20:06.200 --> 20:11.180
I don't know if this is mainstream British Israelist thought as much as this is a very

20:11.180 --> 20:18.400
weird GeoCities ass page that's spouting a very convoluted conspiracy.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.240
I think that that's basically what's going on.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.820
There's these people who are AB blood type and they're poisoned.

20:24.820 --> 20:30.560
They want to get the vaccine in people who have A, O, or B because it'll kill all of

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
them off.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.560
Sure.

20:32.560 --> 20:37.040
And in order to avoid this horrifying conclusion, the page literally says, quote, round up every

20:37.040 --> 20:42.600
one of them, account for all 14.3 million in the United States, place them in holding

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
areas for out-processing.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.600
Okay.

20:44.600 --> 20:48.080
So wait, now I'm against AB blood type people?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.080
They're evil now.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.080
Yes.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.080
They're the Gs.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.080
They think they are.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.080
Oh, those idiots.

20:55.080 --> 21:01.180
I found this very confusing.

21:01.180 --> 21:06.480
That's a little, that's a little, I don't think they're going to win in the end.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.560
I'll put it that way.

21:07.560 --> 21:12.300
On the one hand, this is a deeply pathetic state of affairs that Alex's radio syndication

21:12.300 --> 21:15.920
would stoop to accepting an ad from a website like this that doesn't actually appear to

21:15.920 --> 21:16.920
be selling anything.

21:16.920 --> 21:17.920
Nope.

21:17.920 --> 21:21.560
On the other hand, it's deeply disturbing as a thing for them to be intentionally or

21:21.560 --> 21:24.080
accidentally promoting to their audience.

21:24.080 --> 21:28.560
This website is explicitly accusing people, everyone who has AB blood type of being part

21:28.560 --> 21:32.120
of a conspiracy to kill off the public and that they need to be rounded up.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.480
That seems a little irresponsible.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.480
Yeah.

21:34.480 --> 21:38.120
So I was curious about this and I dug around a little bit more.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.120
Sure.

21:39.120 --> 21:44.820
Apparently this page has been up since 2003 and there are some snapshots of what it used

21:44.820 --> 21:46.960
to promote on the way back machine.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.960
Okay.

21:47.960 --> 21:51.840
It turns out my feelings about this seeming a bit antisemitic were accurate.

21:51.840 --> 21:57.040
From the page, as it existed in 2004, quote, they are murderers and thieves and destroy

21:57.040 --> 21:59.960
the truth and destroy the earth and mankind.

21:59.960 --> 22:02.640
Now is the time to destroy these destroyers.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.240
They are the ones who claim to be Jews who are not.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.240
All right.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.240
There we go.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.240
Oh boy.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
All right.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.240
Toss that one on the board.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.240
Yeah.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.800
The site at this point does not appear to have any connection to the iron poisoning

22:12.800 --> 22:16.800
conspiracy, but instead it's just classic antisemitic screeds.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.560
It's basically just protocols of the elders of Zion shit.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.560
Great.

22:20.560 --> 22:25.080
By 2008, the site had added the iron poisoning shit and it seems pretty clear that the argument

22:25.080 --> 22:30.920
being laid out by this website is that Jewish people who aren't really Jewish are running

22:30.920 --> 22:35.240
around and they're going to poison the world with iron in order to kill everyone off down

22:35.240 --> 22:36.240
the road.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.240
All right.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.640
So this AB blood type, I think is a way of talking.

22:39.640 --> 22:40.640
Yeah.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.640
Yeah.

22:41.640 --> 22:42.640
Jews, but I'm saying AB blood type.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.640
Right.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.640
Gotcha.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.320
It's not about how everyone thinks he's a Nazi, it's important to remember that his

22:47.320 --> 22:52.760
radio buddy, uh, you know, who runs all of his, uh, like radio syndication and affiliates,

22:52.760 --> 22:57.640
uh, is, you know, he's, he's, he's responsible for Alex's radio career.

22:57.640 --> 23:01.000
That guy is willing to accept advertising money to promote a website that essentially

23:01.000 --> 23:03.040
advocates rounding up Jewish people.

23:03.040 --> 23:07.200
I would really prefer, and I'm going to go out on a limb here.

23:07.200 --> 23:11.500
And I think this, look, this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I don't care what

23:11.500 --> 23:13.840
side of the political aisle you're on.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.720
I think rounding people up is usually a bad sign.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
Yeah.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
I'm just going to go out there.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.720
I'm going to say that.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.440
I know it's an unpopular thought, Dan.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.440
Yeah.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.880
It's, uh, it's, it's not a sign of a healthy, uh, body politic.

23:25.880 --> 23:30.680
Let's think of all the historical examples of people being rounded up.

23:30.680 --> 23:31.960
All of them worked out well.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
Nevermind.

23:32.960 --> 23:38.760
Uh, I found this bizarre, um, confusing.

23:38.760 --> 23:44.200
I would never have imagined that something like this would be like able to secure an

23:44.200 --> 23:46.760
advertising slot on Alex Jones's show.

23:46.760 --> 23:50.160
I was going to say, it must be really fucking cheap.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.760
It's gotta be dirt cheap for, uh, for just a random ass website to be like, yeah, I'll

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
buy 30 seconds.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.500
Well, there's two things to consider.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.840
One is maybe this person is independently wealthy.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.840
Sure.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.640
So maybe it's not that cheap and there's like, fuck it.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.360
I got to get the word out about iron possible.

24:05.360 --> 24:10.080
Second possibility is that it is that cheap because think about it, like there's no big

24:10.080 --> 24:14.580
businesses knocking down Ted Anderson's door to get ads on, on this shit.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.720
No one wants this bottom of the barrel stuff.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.560
I could absolutely also see this as just a favor.

24:20.560 --> 24:26.520
I could see almost all advertising on GCN just being Ted being like, man, I know a guy,

24:26.520 --> 24:28.520
come on, do a 30 second spot, man.

24:28.520 --> 24:33.400
If that's a favor, then that opens up another can of worms and that is like, this is, they

24:33.400 --> 24:38.720
know what's being pushed and they are willingly disseminating and supporting this and that's

24:38.720 --> 24:39.720
fucked up.

24:39.720 --> 24:44.600
I would have to, I mean, there's no way that somebody doesn't know what's being pushed.

24:44.600 --> 24:49.120
You know what, I would, I would believe a world exists where no one knows what's going

24:49.120 --> 24:50.120
on.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.120
That's fair.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.120
They're just like, wait, the check cleared?

24:52.120 --> 24:53.120
Put the eye on it.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.120
I don't give a shit.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.700
He's saying that people are going to be exterminated.

24:55.700 --> 24:56.700
That works for us.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.700
Yeah.

24:57.700 --> 24:58.700
Oh, what's this?

24:58.700 --> 24:59.700
Iron poisoning?

24:59.700 --> 25:00.700
Uh, okay.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.700
Yeah, sure.

25:01.700 --> 25:02.700
Why not?

25:02.700 --> 25:06.800
I'm going to wait for just a little while to find out that you are a deeply anti-Semitic

25:06.800 --> 25:07.800
website.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.800
Yeah.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.800
Hmm.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.800
Uh, iron poisoning.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.800
We sell zinc.

25:11.800 --> 25:12.800
They're close enough.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.800
Get it on, get on the network.

25:14.800 --> 25:15.800
Come on, buddy.

25:15.800 --> 25:19.800
Oh, I'm also not going to check in on what you're, what you're espousing, uh, to the

25:19.800 --> 25:26.640
point where I run, uh, alternative media thing, which you think needs to be commandeered immediately.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
There is that.

25:27.640 --> 25:32.640
I do like the idea that there is a 30 second spot.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.640
Yeah.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.360
With the website in it and no one bothered to look at the website.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.360
Yeah.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.960
I honestly, I'm not positive what I think is more upsetting.

25:41.960 --> 25:42.960
Yeah.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.840
The idea that they didn't check or that someone checked and they're like, yeah, it's fine.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.840
It's either, either is pretty, pretty scary.

25:48.840 --> 25:53.680
And the, the idea that like some of Alex's audience might go to that website and be like,

25:53.680 --> 25:58.800
oh my God, if Alex would promote this, if he would allow this on his show, then there's

25:58.800 --> 26:00.120
gotta be something to it.

26:00.120 --> 26:04.920
I think the only thing we can do is get our own ad spot on GCN, Dan.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.920
Wow.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.760
I think we, I think we should try it.

26:07.760 --> 26:12.160
Maybe, you know, we could, I, yeah, we got to get another website though.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.160
Oh yeah.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.920
No, we can't be, we can't be too obvious.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.920
Yeah.

26:16.920 --> 26:17.920
Yeah.

26:17.920 --> 26:22.640
It's good that we're planning this on air in terms of, well, look, if you're not going

26:22.640 --> 26:26.000
to look at that motherfucker's website, we're going to be fine.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Yeah.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
All right.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I'm going to, I'm going to work on this.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.680
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to see if we can, the point is, they'll never know

26:33.680 --> 26:38.520
when it's coming, Dan, we can announce it's going to happen and maybe that's the real

26:38.520 --> 26:39.520
torture there.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.200
They'll always be wondering, right?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.200
Is this the one?

26:42.200 --> 26:44.880
When is it going to, when is it going to, which ad is the prank?

26:44.880 --> 26:47.200
When's the hammer going to drop?

26:47.200 --> 26:53.160
Um, all right, so, uh, we get back to Alex now, uh, that it was a deeply upsetting little

26:53.160 --> 26:54.400
road that I went down.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.400
It's real dangerous.

26:55.400 --> 27:00.800
Um, and, uh, also deeply upsetting, Alex is really thrilled that no one is wearing masks

27:00.800 --> 27:01.800
at CPAC.

27:01.800 --> 27:02.800
Great.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.200
Don't you love how almost no one's wearing a mask in the CPAC event?

27:05.200 --> 27:10.160
These were some, even though they've been haranguing them too, isn't that great?

27:10.160 --> 27:11.160
These are good people.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.280
These are the smart people.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.280
These are the smart people.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.280
Jesus.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.280
It's not going to look great in hindsight.

27:16.280 --> 27:17.280
Wow.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.280
I would assume.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.280
Wow.

27:19.280 --> 27:23.400
So Alex started the show talking about how Trump is the rightful president.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.920
Um, and that's upsetting.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.280
Sure.

27:27.280 --> 27:32.300
It's more upsetting when Trump himself, uh, says that on stage at CPAC.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.300
That's pretty upsetting.

27:33.300 --> 27:37.840
Again, ladies and gentlemen, you're watching coverage of president Trump's ongoing live

27:37.840 --> 27:38.840
speech.

27:38.840 --> 27:43.720
We're about 20 minutes behind because we are going through the live show.

27:43.720 --> 27:48.680
Actually, as you know, they just lost the white house, but it's one of those things.

27:48.680 --> 27:56.800
But who knows, who knows, I may even decide to beat them for a third time.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.800
Okay.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.800
Yeah.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
Yeah.

27:59.800 --> 28:05.800
He just came out and said it was a fraud again.

28:05.800 --> 28:06.800
Football spike bitches.

28:06.800 --> 28:07.800
Boom.

28:07.800 --> 28:08.800
Yeah.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.800
That's what you need.

28:09.800 --> 28:10.800
That's alarming.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.640
I mean, we just can't, we can't keep doing this.

28:12.640 --> 28:16.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28:16.920 --> 28:17.920
Yeah.

28:17.920 --> 28:18.920
We refuse.

28:18.920 --> 28:19.920
Yeah.

28:19.920 --> 28:25.120
You know, like when, uh, 2000 happened, the election in 2000, that, uh, the Supreme Court

28:25.120 --> 28:27.480
awarded the presidency to Bush.

28:27.480 --> 28:31.240
Using all of the precedent that was available to them at the time, which is none.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.720
And then they were just like, yeah, sure.

28:32.720 --> 28:37.360
Well, and I think that a lot of people, uh, rightfully or inaccurately felt like that

28:37.360 --> 28:39.880
was a stolen election.

28:39.880 --> 28:46.200
I don't recall people insisting that Al Gore was the rightful president and I don't recall

28:46.200 --> 28:50.280
Al Gore giving speeches where he said, I'm actually the president.

28:50.280 --> 28:51.280
No, no.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.480
Instead he went and focused on climate change.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.280
Man, Trump, go focus on climate change.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.280
No, don't.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.920
Oh, no, no, no, not him.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.080
No, no, no, no, no.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.320
He would, he would bungle that.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.320
No, no, no, no.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.280
Go back inside of a very small hole and stay there.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.040
I just find this to be untenable.

29:09.040 --> 29:15.320
Like I, I can't, I can't imagine these kinds of rhetorics, uh, these, these kinds of things

29:15.320 --> 29:16.760
leading anywhere positive.

29:16.760 --> 29:20.480
It's going to get another storming of the Capitol at this rate.

29:20.480 --> 29:25.460
It happened on the sixth and in response to that, they changed none of their rhetoric.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.840
So it will happen again.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.760
That's how it, it, it works.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.160
It does seem that way.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.160
Yeah.

29:32.160 --> 29:36.360
So Alex is one of the most influential voices in the world.

29:36.360 --> 29:40.760
Ah, until he's commandeered by those guys.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.480
Those guys.

29:42.480 --> 29:46.120
The true most influential voices in the world.

29:46.120 --> 29:50.260
And uh, you know, you might be surprised who, uh, who listens to Alex.

29:50.260 --> 29:53.040
It's a famous Alex Jones saying, my son always says it as a joke.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.160
He wants to start a podcast called I'm not bragging.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.160
I'm not bragging.

29:57.160 --> 30:00.520
In fact, I'm a target and to even say this is dangerous.

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
Okay.

30:01.520 --> 30:06.000
But the globalists know how authoritative and how influential we are, not just with

30:06.000 --> 30:09.880
the general public, but with thought leaders here and across the planet.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.680
You can probably imagine who listens to the show.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.360
I'm not going to name drop.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.960
One of them died just a week and a half ago.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.600
He listened every day.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
Okay.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Really?

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
So this is not about bragging, it's about understanding.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.440
This broadcast is a brain trust.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.640
This broadcast does not have corporate sponsorship.

30:26.640 --> 30:32.080
This broadcast is hunted and lied about and demonized because we go to the source documents

30:32.080 --> 30:33.640
and we're over the targets.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.520
So we're getting the most flat.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.720
We've got great products you already need.

30:37.720 --> 30:38.720
Great.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.360
Um, yeah, there's no way Rush Limbaugh listened to Alex every day.

30:41.360 --> 30:45.840
I can't think of anything Rush Limbaugh did less than listen to Alex Jones.

30:45.840 --> 30:51.520
You know what's, I mean, like he's on air for hours himself and then you imagine like,

30:51.520 --> 30:56.320
oh yeah, he's going to spend his off time listening to someone do a shittier him and

30:56.320 --> 30:57.960
a cartoony version.

30:57.960 --> 30:58.960
Yeah, exactly.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.960
Yeah.

30:59.960 --> 31:00.960
Yeah.

31:00.960 --> 31:01.960
Or he just yells about demons.

31:01.960 --> 31:02.960
Right.

31:02.960 --> 31:03.960
Like I find this to be so fascinating.

31:03.960 --> 31:07.040
The idea that Alex thinks that his audience, and I mean, maybe he's right, but he thinks

31:07.040 --> 31:12.280
that his audience will believe that like really serious people take him seriously.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.360
I mean, they must.

31:13.360 --> 31:20.280
I can't imagine anybody who is like, you know, critical thinking, engaged, uh, listening

31:20.280 --> 31:22.200
to his show and not being like, this is stupid.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.520
This is insanely stupid.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.520
Yeah.

31:24.520 --> 31:29.920
It is, it is, uh, stupid on a level that like I can't really comprehend.

31:29.920 --> 31:34.920
I understand being tricked by like little clips or snippets or something into thinking

31:34.920 --> 31:38.360
that Alex's show is something that it's not, but it is dumb.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.040
It is incredibly dumb.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.660
Um, it's meandering.

31:41.660 --> 31:43.240
It's often pointless.

31:43.240 --> 31:45.160
It's full of emotional outbursts.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.160
Yeah.

31:46.160 --> 31:51.520
Um, it's a psycho drama that he's having that he's engaging the audience in and it's just

31:51.520 --> 31:52.520
bizarre.

31:52.520 --> 31:59.220
Well, I mean, we saw, I mean, literally he's playing a clip of somebody doing just that

31:59.220 --> 32:01.840
to Republicans at a conference.

32:01.840 --> 32:06.720
You know, like he's playing a clip of Trump saying nonsense that no reasonable person

32:06.720 --> 32:08.560
would take seriously at all.

32:08.560 --> 32:14.800
And it turns out 50% of the goddamn world is like, yay, imagination.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.160
It's it's wild.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
Yeah.

32:17.160 --> 32:20.640
So, um, Alex is a creature of comedy.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.640
We know that.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.640
Yeah.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.640
He's the meme machine.

32:23.640 --> 32:24.640
He is indeed.

32:24.640 --> 32:30.380
Um, but sometimes he has to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing horribly racist and

32:30.380 --> 32:31.600
disgusting comedy.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.600
Yeah.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.600
Drag.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.600
Oh.

32:34.600 --> 32:35.600
So yeah.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.600
Yeah.

32:36.600 --> 32:37.600
Yeah.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
Just pulling teeth with this guy.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.200
He doesn't want to do it, but demands it.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.200
He got it.

32:41.200 --> 32:47.560
There have been a lot of requests for fentanyl, the communist Chinese dragon to make a return.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.280
And so we hadn't done one probably in six months because I get bummed out with the news,

32:51.280 --> 32:54.920
but I've decided to be more pumped out with the dress side to have more fun because the

32:54.920 --> 32:56.240
globalist want to get our spirits down.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
So I'm going to do it.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.960
This is a little racy, a little, a little gross.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.900
My wife thought it was a little much.

33:01.900 --> 33:06.640
I told McBreen who made it with a Rob do to make the, when he pulls the anal probe out

33:06.640 --> 33:09.000
to have it be green slime or something and said it's bloody.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.720
But I think I'm gonna have him edit it again and just make it green, green dragon slime.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.720
But kids love it.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.960
Adults love it.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.280
But it's also horrifying.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.280
Yeah.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.880
It sounds like it.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.120
What did you just describe to me?

33:22.120 --> 33:26.440
What did you just describe to me in a way that makes me want to see it?

33:26.440 --> 33:31.360
Black demand is so high that Alex bring back his racist Chinese dragon character, which

33:31.360 --> 33:33.400
by the way has not been gone for six months.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.520
I have seen recently videos.

33:36.520 --> 33:41.160
There was one making fun of that, um, what was that, uh, that guy who had his cat on

33:41.160 --> 33:42.160
zoom.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.160
Oh yeah.

33:43.160 --> 33:47.080
Alex did a version of that, but with the dragon, like instead of the cat.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.080
Wow.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.080
Yeah.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.800
So I mean like he's made those videos as recently as that.

33:50.800 --> 33:51.800
It's not been six months.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.960
He's doing this pretty regularly.

33:52.960 --> 33:53.960
All right.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.600
So he's got one apparently that involves a bloody anal probe.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.840
I am really confused as to why you told me about the anal probe part.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.840
Yeah.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.120
I feel like that's something, look, that's a no spoiler situation for sure.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.120
Yeah.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.120
Okay.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.120
I also love the kids love it.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.120
Adults love it.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
Kids love it.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.120
Adults love it.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.120
It's like kicks.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.680
It's some shit coming out of a dragon's asshole.

34:14.680 --> 34:15.960
What are we, what are we going to be bad?

34:15.960 --> 34:17.800
It's kid tested mother approved.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.200
Yeah, absolutely.

34:19.200 --> 34:22.920
Oh, choosy moms choose anal probes covered in blood.

34:22.920 --> 34:23.920
Yeah.

34:23.920 --> 34:24.920
This is, this is wild.

34:24.920 --> 34:29.560
I mean, like I would have listened to his wife in this situation does sound like it's

34:29.560 --> 34:30.560
a little bit much.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.040
I would have listened to her tennis partner.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.040
Yeah.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.040
Wonder what they think.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
Yeah.

34:35.040 --> 34:41.080
So, um, Alex plays this video of an Australian journalist, uh, or, you know, I don't know.

34:41.080 --> 34:45.080
I don't, I feel like journalists might be a little bit generous.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.480
Seems like a editorial commentator type.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.440
Oh, he plays this video of an Australian.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.440
Yeah.

34:50.440 --> 34:56.120
This guy is, uh, giving a speech about, uh, globalism and how, uh, it's evil.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.120
Sure.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.120
Sure.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.120
And fine, whatever.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.760
I also thought maybe this was a little bit racist.

35:02.760 --> 35:07.760
He's talking about like how you gotta be skeptical of any organization that has the word world

35:07.760 --> 35:08.760
in it.

35:08.760 --> 35:13.840
Like the world, uh, world health organization, the world food program, uh, and then he throws

35:13.840 --> 35:14.840
this in.

35:14.840 --> 35:18.080
Then of course there's the world food program.

35:18.080 --> 35:22.880
It too is part of the United nations and it actually won the Nobel peace prize in 2020.

35:22.880 --> 35:28.920
Now all that sounds pretty impressive until you remember that Barack Obama won it in 2008

35:28.920 --> 35:31.200
just for having the right skin color.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.200
Eeee.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.200
Wow.

35:33.200 --> 35:39.120
I, I, I think it's a problem that Alex can't seem to find any, anybody who breaks down

35:39.120 --> 35:43.040
complaints about globalism that doesn't veer into that direction.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.320
Ultimately boils down to somebody's going to say skin color.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.320
Yeah.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.320
Yep.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.320
Ooh.

35:49.320 --> 35:55.120
He understands how he got to Australia, right?

35:55.120 --> 35:59.840
Um, like he understands the route that it took.

35:59.840 --> 36:03.520
It was, it was perhaps a worldwide journey, if you will.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.640
Uh, like he understands that, right?

36:06.640 --> 36:08.720
Is that a concept that he gets?

36:08.720 --> 36:09.720
I would assume so.

36:09.720 --> 36:10.720
Yeah.

36:10.720 --> 36:17.040
I mean, cause it seems like he is absolutely, if he's making this argument, uh, white people

36:17.040 --> 36:19.520
should leave Australia.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.160
You should go away.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.640
Well that's, that's, that's interesting.

36:23.640 --> 36:30.600
I just, I, I find it really interesting the way that like you can, and I obviously I think

36:30.600 --> 36:34.440
it's partially because these kinds of things are attractive to Alex and he enjoys it.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.440
Sure, sure, sure.

36:35.440 --> 36:42.120
But you can't like find somebody to talk about these issues of like the challenges of globalized

36:42.120 --> 36:47.740
connections and, uh, you know, living in a modern world where there's so much interconnectedness.

36:47.740 --> 36:53.240
You can't find somebody to play that doesn't say Obama won a peace prize cause he has black

36:53.240 --> 36:54.240
skin.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.800
Like that's fucked up.

36:55.800 --> 37:02.640
You can't find somebody that isn't like subtly racist or not subtly.

37:02.640 --> 37:08.000
And it's the same thing with like, you know, the, uh, the Genesis Communications Network

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
can't take ads.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.680
They can't attract anyone to give ads except for completely nonsensical, uh, websites.

37:14.680 --> 37:20.080
I mean, what's wild about that is not since, uh, you know, like there are plenty of great

37:20.080 --> 37:23.480
reasons to say that Obama shouldn't have that Nobel fucking peace prize.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.480
Sure.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.480
There are tons of great reasons.

37:25.480 --> 37:26.480
There's a lot of critiques.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.480
None of them have to do with his skin color.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.480
No.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.560
Ansance Yuki shouldn't have her Nobel peace prize either.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.560
But here we are.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.560
Well, yeah.

37:33.560 --> 37:38.380
And, and the fact that like you have to distill it down to throw that kind of like that, uh,

37:38.380 --> 37:43.480
you know, what the audience wants, that sort of poking, Oh, he only got it because he has

37:43.480 --> 37:44.480
black skin.

37:44.480 --> 37:49.280
Uh, he could have said he, he got it and they didn't know that he was going to drone bomb

37:49.280 --> 37:52.480
the fucking world and it would be very reasonable.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.480
Yeah.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.500
But the audience wouldn't find that funny or satisfied because they kind of want him

37:56.500 --> 38:00.520
to drone bomb the world and they just don't like the, he has the wrong skin color according

38:00.520 --> 38:01.520
to them.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.520
Yeah.

38:02.520 --> 38:06.720
So, uh, one of the more delightful things that came out of the CPAC I think was the

38:06.720 --> 38:12.880
video of, uh, the, the people getting booed for trying to tell people to wear masks.

38:12.880 --> 38:13.880
Oh boy.

38:13.880 --> 38:14.880
Did you see that?

38:14.880 --> 38:15.880
No, I didn't see.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.760
I, I want, I wanted nothing to do with this year's CPAC.

38:18.760 --> 38:22.400
So a guy comes on stage and he, we're going to listen to this too, but I'm just going

38:22.400 --> 38:23.960
to give you like a little bit of a breakdown.

38:23.960 --> 38:24.960
Sure, sure, sure.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.840
Um, he comes on stage and he's like, Hey, look, masks.

38:27.840 --> 38:32.400
I know you all don't want to wear them, but we believe in property rights and we are in

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
someone else's hotel.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.400
Wow.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.160
So they get to make the rules.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.160
Good angle.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.160
Good angle.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.160
Way to do it.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.400
Way to fucking pull that one through.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.680
Hey, that's a good landing.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.680
Hey, yeah.

38:44.680 --> 38:48.280
It's like, okay, I understand you don't want to wear a mask, but our conservative principles

38:48.280 --> 38:52.160
demand that we respect the property rights of the owners of this hotel that are allowing

38:52.160 --> 38:54.020
us to hold this convention here.

38:54.020 --> 38:58.820
And I assume all the people there were like, uh, we don't have principles.

38:58.820 --> 38:59.820
Go fuck yourself.

38:59.820 --> 39:00.820
People weren't thrilled.

39:00.820 --> 39:07.160
And so he hands the mic off to a young woman and she, uh, she says, uh, you know, I know

39:07.160 --> 39:12.480
you don't want to wear masks, but can you work on that?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.040
That's also fair.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.500
It's like, that's also fair.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.500
It's like talking to children.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.500
It's amazing.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.120
And then someone yells freedom.

39:20.120 --> 39:24.600
Oh my God, somebody.

39:24.600 --> 39:31.340
That's outrageously funny because it is, it is so, um, just so, uh, so much of a clear

39:31.340 --> 39:37.540
illustration of this defiance, this oppositional defiance that characterizes, um, these crowds.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.040
It's just like, no, fuck you.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.040
Yeah.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.040
That's insane.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.040
It's childish.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.040
Here's, here's my pitch.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.040
All right.

39:44.040 --> 39:47.560
CPAC, but we get all the conservatives in there and we just play schoolhouse rock for

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
them.

39:48.560 --> 39:54.460
And maybe we would be at least a better off place, you know, it wouldn't fix everything,

39:54.460 --> 39:59.020
but maybe when they understand how bills become law, they might be, you know, that's a, that's

39:59.020 --> 40:02.520
a globalist Soros brainwashing for the kids, man.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
You're probably right.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.520
Yep.

40:04.520 --> 40:10.280
So anyway, Alex plays this clip of the people booing because he's, uh, he loves it.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.280
It's very weird.

40:11.280 --> 40:15.720
Um, this is a, uh, I saw this on CNN too, so I tuned in and found the actual clip.

40:15.720 --> 40:19.640
They were like, oh my gosh, they told them all wear their mask and they didn't and they

40:19.640 --> 40:22.620
booed and almost no one was wearing the stupid mask.

40:22.620 --> 40:23.620
They tried to enforce it.

40:23.620 --> 40:24.960
Oh, this is private property.

40:24.960 --> 40:25.960
Do it.

40:25.960 --> 40:26.960
No, it's all a giant fraud.

40:26.960 --> 40:31.680
It's saying, I'm not wearing your little burka, your little face diaper scumbags.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.680
So here it is.

40:32.680 --> 40:38.200
CPAC host booed for asking attendees to wear their muzzles.

40:38.200 --> 40:43.340
We conservatives believe in the rule of law because we know that when the law is enforced,

40:43.340 --> 40:44.920
our rights are protected.

40:44.920 --> 40:45.920
Our rights are protected.

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
The laws of fraud.

40:46.920 --> 40:52.560
Such a big effort to talk about the bill of rights, but I also want to mention one thing

40:52.560 --> 40:56.120
and I know this might sound like a little bit of a downer, but we also believe in property

40:56.120 --> 40:59.520
rights and this is a private hotel and we believe in the rule of law.

40:59.520 --> 41:03.320
So we need to comply with the laws of this county that we're in.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
There is no law.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.720
Private hotel, just like your house gets to set its own rules.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.720
Statement.

41:07.720 --> 41:08.720
I am the law.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.360
Our CPAC director.

41:10.360 --> 41:17.360
Well, as Dan mentioned, we are in a private facility and we do want to be respectful of

41:17.360 --> 41:21.920
the ordinances that they have as their private property.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.480
So this woman looks like she's had a lot of vaccines in the ballroom when you're seated

41:25.480 --> 41:28.640
or she has her soul sucked wearing a mask.

41:28.640 --> 41:32.600
So if everybody can go ahead, work on that.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.600
Work on that.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.600
I know.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.600
I know.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.600
It's, it's not.

41:36.600 --> 41:40.120
You'll work on that.

41:40.120 --> 41:44.440
William Wallace, ladies and gentlemen, you have the right to set the own rules in your

41:44.440 --> 41:48.640
own house and we're borrowing them down.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.640
Thank you.

41:49.640 --> 41:58.000
It's, it's just, I can't imagine having a response to that other than like, wow, that's

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
bummer.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.080
Like if, even if I were somebody who was like opposed to wearing masks or being required

42:04.080 --> 42:06.680
to, I was just like, Hey, we're, we're here.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.120
It's the rules of the place.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.120
Yeah.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
Okay.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.120
I understand.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.560
All of these people should be embarrassed.

42:12.560 --> 42:13.560
Yeah.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.000
They should really be embarrassed because they're fucking children and it's kind of

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
sad.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
It's not kind of sad.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.520
It's incredibly sad.

42:20.520 --> 42:21.600
It bums me out.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.320
And the fact that I'm going to go home and think about how stupid they are is an even

42:25.320 --> 42:26.720
bigger bummer to me.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
Yeah.

42:27.720 --> 42:32.080
And I think that that clip just so fully like demonstrates that behavior.

42:32.080 --> 42:39.480
Someone gently trying to come up with an excuse for why you need to do this.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.640
Yeah.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.840
Trying to, it's like trying to trick kids into eating vegetables.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
No, totally.

42:43.840 --> 42:49.400
It's the idea that you would have to, somebody, a group of people got together and were like,

42:49.400 --> 42:51.840
we've got to try and get these people to wear masks.

42:51.840 --> 42:54.360
They're not going to listen to medical ideas.

42:54.360 --> 42:58.000
They're not going to listen to, they don't give a shit about other people.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
That person could die right now.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.320
And if they didn't like them, they would all cheer.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.320
Yeah.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.320
So what do we do?

43:04.320 --> 43:06.400
Oh, you know, these people really love property rights.

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
Yeah.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.400
That's something that they're really into.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.000
Hey guys, it's borderline.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.040
Like you have to be, Hey, if we want to carry guns in this place, we got to wear a mask

43:16.040 --> 43:17.040
in this place.

43:17.040 --> 43:18.840
Those are the rules.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.160
That would, that would might work.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.160
Yeah.

43:21.160 --> 43:25.360
I mean, that's about all you can do to deal with these fucking children.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.360
Yeah.

43:26.360 --> 43:30.400
But like I said, there's a little bit of a shorter episode because it's so much of just

43:30.400 --> 43:33.960
Trump's speech and you know, whatever.

43:33.960 --> 43:34.960
Yeah.

43:34.960 --> 43:40.720
I'm, I feel like it is the greatest privilege in the world not to listen to him speak ever

43:40.720 --> 43:41.720
a gun.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.720
Yeah.

43:42.720 --> 43:45.280
And it's, uh, there was one, there's one part where Alex was saying like, Oh, isn't this

43:45.280 --> 43:52.520
refreshing after weeks of Biden, Oh, just so much, I was like, I don't have to disagree.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.520
Wow.

43:53.520 --> 43:59.120
Um, but you know, uh, I, I, I, what was the policy platform that came out of CPAC this

43:59.120 --> 44:00.120
year?

44:00.120 --> 44:01.120
Dan?

44:01.120 --> 44:02.120
And avoid canceling things.

44:02.120 --> 44:09.320
Did they do, did they, no bother with like, we want lower taxes, none of that.

44:09.320 --> 44:13.040
Just straight up, nonstop bile and cheering.

44:13.040 --> 44:14.040
Yeah.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.040
Great.

44:15.040 --> 44:18.560
I was looking at the speaker's list and it was pretty surprising.

44:18.560 --> 44:23.120
Like, you know, you got Trump, you got Trump Jr.

44:23.120 --> 44:26.280
Then that's like, well, don't know why Trump Jr. needs to be there anymore.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.000
I kind of understand Trump.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.840
You gotta appease the lunatics and what have you, but then he had like, James O'Keefe was

44:33.840 --> 44:34.840
giving a speech.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.840
Really?

44:35.840 --> 44:39.480
Charlie Kirk and then Lauren Boebert.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.480
Oh my God.

44:40.480 --> 44:41.480
Yeah.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.760
I was like, wow, this is, this is not subtle.

44:43.760 --> 44:44.760
Whoa boy.

44:44.760 --> 44:45.760
Yeah.

44:45.760 --> 44:46.760
We are white nationalists.

44:46.760 --> 44:55.000
Um, so we have one last clip here and it's Alex, uh, someone has found a clip of him

44:55.000 --> 45:01.320
talking about his Rockefeller document that he calls the lockstep document, which is not,

45:01.320 --> 45:02.320
that's not what it is.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.320
It doesn't have anything to do with it.

45:03.320 --> 45:08.640
Um, that lockstep is one of the four scenarios that have painted, uh, about possible ways

45:08.640 --> 45:14.280
that technology and, uh, governance can, uh, uh, progress into the future.

45:14.280 --> 45:15.280
Right.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.160
Um, and it's interesting.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.800
Someone found a clip of him talking about it back in 2010.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.800
Did they?

45:20.800 --> 45:21.800
Oh really?

45:21.800 --> 45:26.280
And Alex plays this clip as if like this proves I've always been right.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.280
Everything.

45:27.280 --> 45:31.260
But I will make an argument on the other side of this clip that this makes things worse

45:31.260 --> 45:32.260
for Alex.

45:32.260 --> 45:33.260
It makes sense.

45:33.260 --> 45:34.260
All right.

45:34.260 --> 45:35.260
Let's end this with my prediction.

45:35.260 --> 45:40.640
11 years ago, the lockdowns and then Owen Schroyer is coming up with Sunday live.

45:40.640 --> 45:41.640
Please spread the word.

45:41.640 --> 45:42.640
God bless you all.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.200
The Alex Jones show, there is a war on for your mind.

45:46.200 --> 45:49.840
I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.

45:49.840 --> 45:55.520
And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've

45:55.520 --> 45:59.520
had chills, uh, since last night.

45:59.520 --> 46:06.640
This just confirms everything else we've already researched Rockefeller study and visions future

46:06.640 --> 46:12.200
dictatorship controlled by elite millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints,

46:12.200 --> 46:15.560
the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.

46:15.560 --> 46:19.600
But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller foundation documents about the GMO food to

46:19.600 --> 46:23.360
sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.880
This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back.

46:26.880 --> 46:30.400
So I mean, it's just another headline for him at this point.

46:30.400 --> 46:35.140
He doesn't call it operation lockstep because that wasn't the branding on it at this point.

46:35.140 --> 46:37.880
Now here is why I think this makes things worse.

46:37.880 --> 46:41.320
And if I were Alex, I wouldn't have played this.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.520
He didn't keep talking about this.

46:43.520 --> 46:48.000
It's not like it's shocking that someone was able to find a clip from 2010 of him covering

46:48.000 --> 46:52.980
this back then when I guess it probably someone picked it up and ran with it.

46:52.980 --> 46:53.980
Didn't have much legs.

46:53.980 --> 46:56.240
And so people just forgot about it.

46:56.240 --> 47:00.920
It's not like 2011, 2012, he's still talking about this document.

47:00.920 --> 47:08.120
He completely forgets about it until Jim Fetzer starts yelling about it on his blog in 2020.

47:08.120 --> 47:13.160
Like he doesn't, like this is, this is worse because if you actually believe, like Alex

47:13.160 --> 47:17.640
is pretending to, that this document lays out the globalist plan, you had it and you

47:17.640 --> 47:18.640
whiffed.

47:18.640 --> 47:19.640
Yeah.

47:19.640 --> 47:20.640
You dropped the ball.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.640
Again.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
Yeah.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.640
For the millionth time.

47:23.640 --> 47:28.760
And it's, it's astounding to me the way, the way in which he, he just like, he, he thinks

47:28.760 --> 47:33.920
that this is a win and it's actually like, it's, it kind of raises more questions about

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
his process.

47:34.920 --> 47:35.920
Yeah.

47:35.920 --> 47:36.920
I mean, it makes him look more full of shit.

47:36.920 --> 47:43.560
I would probably argue that the, it is really bad for him because it's basically saying

47:43.560 --> 47:45.560
that this is, cause it's not the same document.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.560
Yeah.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.560
I think it is.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.560
That he's talking about?

47:48.560 --> 47:49.560
I think it is.

47:49.560 --> 47:50.560
Oh, okay.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.560
Yeah.

47:51.560 --> 47:54.920
It's the same thing about goddamn near every document since 2010.

47:54.920 --> 47:55.920
Yeah.

47:55.920 --> 47:56.920
Yeah.

47:56.920 --> 48:02.480
It's been 10 years and not only has he not kept talking about it, none of it has happened.

48:02.480 --> 48:03.480
True.

48:03.480 --> 48:04.480
So.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.480
Ugh.

48:05.480 --> 48:06.480
But he's a prophet.

48:06.480 --> 48:07.480
Sure.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.840
And he's a psychic, but he's not like a psychic psychic, everyone's a little bit psychic.

48:09.840 --> 48:14.320
Well, everybody's a little bit psychic, it's called, uh, memory.

48:14.320 --> 48:17.760
So I found that a little weird and one of the things that I decided that I think I want

48:17.760 --> 48:21.320
to do is I think I want to go try and find that episode.

48:21.320 --> 48:22.320
The 2010?

48:22.320 --> 48:23.320
Yeah.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.320
Yeah.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.320
I think I want to go try and do that.

48:25.320 --> 48:26.320
I think that's a good one.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.600
Maybe we'll do that for Wednesday or something since this is a shorter episode.

48:28.600 --> 48:29.600
Yeah.

48:29.600 --> 48:30.600
I think that would be a good idea.

48:30.600 --> 48:31.600
Yeah.

48:31.600 --> 48:36.600
Cause I'm very curious to hear his coverage of it and compare it to the present day coverage

48:36.600 --> 48:37.720
of this document.

48:37.720 --> 48:40.040
I wonder if he knows what the document is back in 2010.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.560
That would be a really good, oh yeah.

48:42.560 --> 48:43.960
You gotta do that now.

48:43.960 --> 48:44.960
Yeah.

48:44.960 --> 48:45.960
You literally have no choice.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.560
I'm getting to work on it now.

48:47.560 --> 48:48.560
Click!

48:48.560 --> 48:49.560
Yeah.

48:49.560 --> 48:50.560
Um, so.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.560
Yeah.

48:51.560 --> 48:52.560
At underscore.

48:52.560 --> 48:57.800
I, I, you know, I think this is, this is a shorter episode, but I think it's worth it

48:57.800 --> 49:04.080
if only for the weird commercial, that commercial is fantastic.

49:04.080 --> 49:11.400
That is the kind of thing that not only should you not accept a commercial advertising money

49:11.400 --> 49:13.800
from that, you should denounce it.

49:13.800 --> 49:18.160
This is the kind of thing that Ted Anderson should be forced to apologize for accepting

49:18.160 --> 49:24.560
advertising money to air that is something that like, there would be a scandal in any

49:24.560 --> 49:28.880
other media outlet, like getting in bed with something like this.

49:28.880 --> 49:29.880
No, I know.

49:29.880 --> 49:36.720
That's like, uh, that's like fucking somebody running a advertisement from Hitler in 1937

49:36.720 --> 49:38.200
in the New York Times.

49:38.200 --> 49:41.680
Just like straight up, Hey, well, let's kill juice.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.960
It's it's a, it's a bit much.

49:43.960 --> 49:44.960
Yeah.

49:44.960 --> 49:49.560
And I would, uh, I would humbly request that Ted Anderson, uh, pull that commercial and

49:49.560 --> 49:52.640
also apologize.

49:52.640 --> 49:53.640
That's really the point.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.200
And sell the network and go away forever.

49:55.200 --> 49:57.960
That is the point of this episode, really.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.960
Go away.

49:58.960 --> 49:59.960
Fuck you, Ted Anderson.

49:59.960 --> 50:00.960
Fuck you, Ted Anderson.

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
Uh, but we'll be back.

50:01.960 --> 50:05.560
I'm going to try and dig up that episode and, uh, hopefully we'll be able to put that together

50:05.560 --> 50:06.560
for Wednesday.

50:06.560 --> 50:07.560
Sounds like a plan.

50:07.560 --> 50:08.560
Uh, but until then, Jordan, we have a website.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.560
We do have a website.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.560
It's knowledgefight.com.

50:10.560 --> 50:11.560
Yeah.

50:11.560 --> 50:12.560
We're also on Twitter.

50:12.560 --> 50:13.560
We are on Twitter.

50:13.560 --> 50:14.560
It's at knowledgefight.com.

50:14.560 --> 50:15.560
Yep.

50:15.560 --> 50:16.560
We're also on Facebook.

50:16.560 --> 50:21.680
And if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

50:21.680 --> 50:22.680
doing God's work right now.

50:22.680 --> 50:23.680
Yeah.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.680
We'll be back.

50:24.680 --> 50:25.680
But until then, I'm Neo.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.680
I'm Leo.

50:26.680 --> 50:27.680
I'm DZX Clark.

50:27.680 --> 50:28.680

50:30.560 --> 50:31.560
Andy in Kansas.

50:31.560 --> 50:32.560
You're on the air.

50:32.560 --> 50:33.560
Thanks for holding.

50:33.560 --> 50:34.560
Hello, Alex.

50:34.560 --> 50:35.560
I'm a first time caller.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.560
I'm a huge fan.

50:36.560 --> 50:37.560

I love you.
