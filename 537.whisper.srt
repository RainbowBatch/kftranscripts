00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,040
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:47,120
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:55,880
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

8
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
I love your work.

I love you.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,200
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, it's Dan.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm Jordan.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
We're a couple dudes.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
If we're gonna mess up the pace.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,440
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
bit about Alex Jones.

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,760
Oh indeed we are Dan.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Jordan.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
Dan.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Jordan.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Quick question.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,840
Today Jordan is we are into the month of March and that means that it is time for Munch Madness

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
on the Doughboys.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
I'm very excited.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,680
There are a lot of, there's a podcast that I very much enjoy during my time off from

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,940
listening to Alex.

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,520
It's tough to find other audio entertainment that I can just sort of like, ah fun.

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,000
Sure, sure, sure, unmitigated fun.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,480
No one hates Jews here.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,360
No, just two guys arguing with each other.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,040
I enjoy it and it's always fun every year whenever they have their March Madness food

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
tournament.

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
It's a Munch Madness.

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
That's lovely.

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Is upon us.

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
That's lovely.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Yep, what about you?

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,840
My Bright Spot, Dan, I was going through my iTunes listening to some music the other day

41
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,600
and Natalie Alford popped up and I haven't thought about her in, or not, I haven't thought

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,120
about her, but we haven't spoken since the old cupcake days.

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Yeah, she's great.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,220
She's back whenever you were allowed to go outside and I was just thinking, man, she's

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,320
so good and I want, I felt very good about that.

46
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,240
Everybody should check Natalie Grace Alford out.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
She's fantastic.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,260
Natalie's one of those performers who I kind of like, when I first started doing standup

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,680
all it made, I was like, what's the big deal?

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,560
But talking about how great she is, I saw her perform one night and I was like, I get

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
it.

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
Oh yeah.

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
She's fantastic.

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
She is fantastic.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
And she's just such a great person to be around.

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,480
Yeah, I don't know her super well, but she was always very nice.

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Oh yeah.

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Loved her.

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,360
So Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,480
We be time traveling, my man.

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,040
Oh no, we're in the past?

62
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
We are.

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Or have we finally gone to the future?

64
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
We're going to the future.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Oh shit!

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
It's about time!

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
No, we're back in the past because on our last episode on Monday, I teased at the end

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,000
that I was going to try and find where Alex made that prediction.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,760
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,320
His video from 2010 where he talked about the Rockefeller document lockstep.

71
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,880
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

72
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,800
And so I had to compulsively go back and find it and see what his coverage was like.

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Naturally.

74
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Man, this is going to be a whirlwind ride.

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,440
I fucking love Rockefeller.

77
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,400
I think this is the greatest guy in the history of the world.

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Lockstep is the way to go.

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,080
I will admit that I had no idea what to expect, and I think that sometimes you fish and the

80
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
well is dry.

81
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Sure.

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Like Monday.

83
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
It happens.

85
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,460
One of the reasons we're doing a Wednesday episode is because I felt very unsatisfied

86
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,940
putting out a 50 minute episode.

87
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,320
That well, very dry.

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,720
I felt like, hey, we were looking for the CPAC wrap up and we got snake eyes.

89
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,880
There was one sad three-eyed fish with human eyes.

90
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
No good.

91
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Uh-uh.

92
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
This time, so many fish.

93
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,360
All right.

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,880
Nothing but fish.

95
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,800
Okay, all right.

96
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
So I'm very excited to get down to business on that, but before we do, Jordan, we're going

97
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,720
to take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting

98
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
the show.

99
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Oh, that's a great idea.

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,280
So first, Harrison, but not that Harrison.

101
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,000
He's really trashing the brand.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't disagree.

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
You are now a policy wonk.

104
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm a policy wonk.

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Thanks, Harrison.

106
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
But not that Harrison.

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Yes.

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,720
Next, Horatio Kornholer.

109
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Thank you so much.

110
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
You are now a policy wonk.

111
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm a policy wonk.

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you very much, Horatio Kornholer.

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I choose to think that it's a game of bags, you know, the college game.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,320
Did Horatio Hornblower play a lot of bags?

115
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I don't know.

116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
We'll see.

117
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,820
Next, the greatest supervillain of all time, The Hintmaster.

118
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Thank you so much.

119
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,820
You are now a policy wonk.

120
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,820
I'm a policy wonk.

121
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,400
Thank you very much, The Hintmaster.

122
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Next, Alex from Tap.

123
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Thank you so much.

124
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
You are now a policy wonk.

125
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I'm a policy wonk.

126
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Thanks, Alex.

127
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Thank you.

128
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Next, to all the knowledge fighters out there, thank you so much.

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,720
You are now a policy wonk.

130
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm a policy wonk.

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,200
Hey, thank you very much to all the knowledge fighters out there.

132
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,660
Next, for the ultimate bastard, Robert Evans.

133
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
Thank you so much.

134
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,660
You are now a policy wonk.

135
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
I'm a policy wonk.

136
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,660
Thank you very much.

137
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,980
Someone doesn't like Kid Stays in the Picture.

138
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,980
That doesn't sound true.

139
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,240
I think everybody loves Kid Stays in the Picture, dad.

140
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,400
Once you know more about fisting, you know you're in a good time.

141
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,360
I remember hearing, I think, Patton Oswalt's bit about the Kid Stays in the Picture audiobook.

142
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,960
I remember I was like, I don't know, probably 16, I got the audiobook of it on cassette.

143
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,860
I just remember it being like this giant thing of like six tapes.

144
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,080
It was as good as advertised.

145
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,040
It was very nonsensical.

146
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,880
What did Patton call it?

147
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,920
It's like the devil reading his memoirs.

148
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I think there's a similarity.

149
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,000
I haven't listened to it in a long time, but anyway, also I have a technocrat here to give

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
a little shout out to.

151
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So thank you so much.

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, God.

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, boy.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It could be Joakim.

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Or Joakim.

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Could be.

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sure.

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
J-O-A-K-I-M.

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,440
Oh, then is that literally Joakim Noah?

162
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
No, it's not.

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,440
It's a fantastic center for the Bulls team in the early aughts whenever Derrick Rose

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
rode in the earth like a God among men.

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
It is not because this is Joakim from Denmark.

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Thank you so much.

167
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
You are now a technocrat.

168
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm a policy wonk.

169
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Crikey, mate.

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
That's fantastic.

171
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Have yourself a brew.

172
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
How's your 401k doing, bro?

173
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,320
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson, all right?

174
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,840
Let's just get down to business.

175
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,900
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

176
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,840
Why you pimps so good?

177
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,480
My neck is freakishly large.

178
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,200
I declare info war on you.

179
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Head out to Denmark.

180
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes.

181
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Thank you very much.

182
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,080
Denmark and Joakim specifically, and if you can, I assume all Joakims know each other.

183
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,200
Hook me up with Joakim Noah.

184
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,680
Great fantastic center for the Bulls in the early aughts when Derrick wrote me.

185
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Okay.

186
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,520
I feel like a friend of mine had a story about running into him at the long room.

187
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Oh, yeah.

188
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
That's right.

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
That bar on Irving Park.

190
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Yeah.

192
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
I seem to recall the story about that.

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,320
Number one, don't know if it's true.

194
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,960
Number two, don't remember the story.

195
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
How did he fit in there?

196
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
It's very long.

197
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
It's my question.

198
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,680
I know it's long, but he's very wide.

199
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Yeah.

200
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
I don't know.

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,320
Again, story might not be true, and I don't remember the story.

202
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Anyway, Jordan, on February 24th of this year, 2021, Info Wars released a video titled, quote,

203
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,880
video shocks the world, exclamation point.

204
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
Sure.

205
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,040
Alex Jones predicted COVID lockdown in 2010.

206
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,360
This was a three-minute clip taken from Alex's July 16th, 2010 show, and this is a little

207
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,080
bit rare, a little bit unconventional, but I want to play the entire thing for you because

208
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,480
this is going to be the launching off point for this entire episode, so it's important

209
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,160
that we give a fair hearing to the original source material.

210
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Okay.

211
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
How long is this?

212
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
Three minutes and 20 seconds.

213
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Brutal.

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Sorry.

215
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
All right.

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Let's do it.

217
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
The Alex Jones Show.

218
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
There is a war on for your mind.

219
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,600
I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful, and I hope

220
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,000
that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've had chills since

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,220
last night.

222
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,920
This just confirms everything else we've already researched.

223
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:17,000
A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,

224
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,560
mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other

225
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,440
documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about

226
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,080
the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in.

227
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,360
This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics

228
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
madmen.

229
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,720
But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.

230
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,240
The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?

231
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,060
Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.

232
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,880
These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them that they're

233
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,840
producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never

234
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
read them all.

235
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,160
It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.

236
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I pray to God.

237
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,000
I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me strength and the will

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,760
to be able to face this harm and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why

239
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,680
a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos

240
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,080
or on message boards that I'm a liar.

241
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,760
I know why because it's scary.

242
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,160
You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,480
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.

244
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,160
You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.

245
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,080
The only chance we've got of beating the scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes

246
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:52,120
its time to incrementally enslave you mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually,

247
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,880
the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you

248
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,040
have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.

249
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,600
Once you face this information, once you consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over

250
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
your life.

251
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
It should take over your life.

252
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
I mean, what else?

253
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,280
What else could it do?

254
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,520
We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been

255
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:27,280
putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.

256
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,760
They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.

257
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,380
Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness

258
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,760
of our commitment at both home and abroad.

259
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,600
One loser draw, you need to choose a sign.

260
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,520
InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.

261
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,760
Winter Sun Plus is the highest grade vitamin B3 you're going to find with vitamin K for

262
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,840
your immune system for overall well being.

263
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
There is an ad at the end.

264
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
Dan, you son of a bitch.

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There is an ad at the end.

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,280
You knew there was an ad at the end.

267
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,920
Of course.

268
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,260
So when I heard that video, the first thing that stuck out to me was the quick cuts.

269
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,440
That seems strange to me, and it made me suspect that Alex in 2010 might not have been talking

270
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,840
about exactly what he wants people in 2021 to think he was talking about.

271
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,760
Yeah, I mean, you leave some things out, some details here and there.

272
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Nobody needs to know.

273
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,680
The second thing that caught my ear was how vague and almost formulaic this coverage of

274
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,720
the Rockefeller document was back in 2010.

275
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,960
Was this really as deep as Alex got into the document that supposedly demonstrates and

276
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,560
outlines the globalists' evil plans?

277
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,680
Is this in any way believable, that if he considered this document to be anything even

278
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,120
close to that, that he wasn't able to find a clip of him that has more oomph than what

279
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
we just heard?

280
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
That was soft.

281
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah, that was a big load of nothing.

282
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Yeah.

283
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,860
This all didn't sit right with me.

284
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,800
This was apparently a video that shocked the world.

285
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,760
This is supposed to be Alex dropping the mic and proving that he was always on the operation

286
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,340
lockstep tip, and thus you should totally listen to him about everything he's saying

287
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,060
now because it's all going to come true in the future.

288
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,400
That's the underlying argument that's being made by this video, and it felt dishonest

289
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
to me.

290
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Surprise.

291
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Yeah.

292
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,040
I wanted to understand the larger context, so I went back to this, and let me spoil this

293
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,280
a little bit.

294
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,080
My suspicions were not unfounded.

295
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,600
To give some background about what was going on around this time, if you're listening to

296
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,640
Alex's show, the only real-world actual headline is that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was

297
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,160
ongoing.

298
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,760
And BP had announced the day prior to this episode that they had successfully capped

299
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,680
the spill, which represented significant progress towards resolving the whole situation.

300
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Sure, sure, sure.

301
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,560
Alex also mentions a car bombing in Mexico that was carried out by cartels, but he doesn't

302
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,360
really dwell on the story much.

303
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,300
Outside of that, I'm not sure we get much else in the way of news.

304
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,320
You know who else predicted a pandemic in 2010?

305
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,520
That would be the CDC when they made a plan for how to deal with a pandemic that wasn't

306
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,480
really important until, say, a certain time period whenever it was ignored, and hopefully...

307
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Yeah.

308
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Yeah.

309
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,400
If I'm not much mistaken, the CDC constantly predicts...

310
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,320
It's basically their job.

311
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,920
To plan for things that are going to happen.

312
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,240
So here we get to...

313
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,080
We're starting here on July 16th, 2010, which is the day that all that is taken from for

314
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:23,040
Alex's very moodily scored...

315
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,960
So here's the beginning of the show, Alex dropping his lead story.

316
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,960
And I have all the vital stacks of news and information here in front of me that we're

317
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,400
going to be covering.

318
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,040
BP claims for the first time in 80 plus days that they have stopped the leak.

319
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,920
And I pray that they're not lying, because they've said this at least three times that

320
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,080
I can remember in the last 87 plus days.

321
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,140
So we'll be breaking that down.

322
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,820
That alone is weird to me.

323
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,920
First of all, his lead story is the BP oil spill on the day that he's supposedly breaking

324
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
these documents.

325
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,280
Yeah, well, I mean, the eventual destruction of the family and quarantines and killing

326
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,200
of all the people, that's second rate.

327
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,080
But the other thing that I think is super weird about that clip is the way that Alex

328
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,520
seems to be willing to give BP the benefit of the doubt about whether or not they'd sealed

329
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
the leak.

330
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,360
Well, I mean, BP's leak happening makes oil prices go down, right?

331
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,080
And he prefers oil.

332
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,920
Alex has sources, he has documents, he knows everything, he's kind of psychic.

333
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,400
He doesn't will see it.

334
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,800
That is fair.

335
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,280
He doesn't do that.

336
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Very weird.

337
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,320
I certainly hope that this oil company isn't lying.

338
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,160
He accuses everyone of lying.

339
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,240
Well, come on.

340
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,640
You gotta give BP the benefit of the doubt.

341
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,480
That was weird as hell.

342
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,000
British petroleum is one word away from British Israelism, Dan, and that's basically what

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
he's going for.

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,500
So Alex does get to the Rockefeller document pretty quick.

345
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,520
It is the second headline that he's got, although I'm not sure he's read it.

346
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm not sure he knows much about it.

347
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,120
I was here in the office last night when Aaron Dykes and I were doing research for the full

348
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,840
spectrum dominance eugenics film that we are working on that deals with chemtrails and

349
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,640
other issues.

350
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:26,060
And we have come across so much more information than our awareness of the globalist master

351
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,280
plan is growing exponentially.

352
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,640
Don't think that you ever know everything.

353
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,480
The more we learn, the more horrified we get to discover that things are far worse than

354
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,040
we originally thought.

355
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,520
So I sent the Rockefeller Foundation document over to Paul Watson.

356
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,880
He wrote a story about it this morning and just everything we talk about here, the magnitude

357
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
is off the chart.

358
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.

359
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,460
And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've

360
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,640
had chills since last night.

361
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,100
This just confirms everything else we've already researched.

362
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:16,120
But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,

363
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,160
mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other

364
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
documents.

365
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,960
But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to

366
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,280
sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in.

367
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,440
That's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these

368
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,360
eugenics madmen.

369
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,400
But that story is up on prison planet dot com.

370
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,840
This is about as deep as he gets.

371
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
That's not much.

372
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, it's up on prison planet dot com, Dan.

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Paul wrote a story.

374
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Fixed it.

375
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,480
Alex is just reading off a headline from an article that Paul Joseph Watson wrote.

376
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
And everything that in the present day Alex is trying to pass off as his prediction is

377
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,040
actually just him reading from Paul's outrageously bad opinion piece.

378
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
Oh, no, Dan.

379
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
He was the one who told Paul that he needed to write an article about something.

380
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
But then it was Aaron Dyke who found it.

381
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,480
Well, you know.

382
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,160
That line, quote, global pandemics that kill millions, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints,

383
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,960
biometric ID cards, and a world of top down government control that's in Alex's sizzle

384
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,780
reel in the present.

385
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,580
That's just the first line of Paul's article.

386
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,780
So if anything, Alex should be saying that Paul predicted all the stuff that's happening

387
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,120
now and Alex read it and then took credit for it.

388
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,040
Yeah, I don't think Alex will be doing that.

389
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Nope.

390
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,260
And that being said, Paul's article is not a prediction of anything.

391
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,280
It's just the same kind of trash coverage of this Rockefeller document that we've seen

392
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,040
11 years later just happening in 2010 and being quickly forgotten, even by the people

393
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,120
who pushed it as a conspiracy.

394
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,240
The article lays out that this is a scenario, you know, it admits that, that this is a scenario

395
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,880
that's being depicted in the document titled Scenarios for the Future of Technology and

396
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
International Development.

397
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,000
And Paul even notes that it's one of four scenarios that are included in the document.

398
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay.

399
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,320
He then describes the scenario titled Lockstep in exhaustive detail, ignoring the other scenarios

400
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,120
or the point of the document at all.

401
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,400
Don't worry about it.

402
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,160
The conclusion of this article is absolutely unearned and completely unsupported by the

403
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
underlying evidence.

404
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Sure.

405
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,200
Quote, the Rockefeller study is not a warning against preventing the kind of tyranny contained

406
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,820
in the scenario from unfolding.

407
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,360
It's a blueprint for how globalists want to exploit global crises like bioterror attacks

408
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,560
and pandemics in order to completely destroy society and rebuild it under a new world order

409
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,980
in their image.

410
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,200
It's crystal clear from reading the Lockstep scenario that the oppressive society portrayed

411
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,800
in the study is not presented as an admonishment of how governments would cynically seize upon

412
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,600
a pandemic to set up a police state and empower themselves as dictators.

413
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,440
It's a ringing endorsement that this approach would be the correct thing to do.

414
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,000
Dan, I've been holding my hand up.

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You have.

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You have me?

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yes, Jordan.

418
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I have a quick question.

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Why?

420
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Because Paul thinks so.

421
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Oh, okay.

422
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Well, now that I've got that.

423
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,840
He said it is not a document predicting or like meant to prevent or warning.

424
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,320
But then he just said, because it's not, he didn't say why.

425
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,760
No, of course not.

426
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,700
These conclusions are not sensible to arrive at from reading the document unless you went

427
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,080
into it with those conclusions already in mind and you were just looking for anything

428
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,520
you could find to justify your narratives.

429
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,840
That entire blurb that I read you there from Paul's article, it's completely dismissible

430
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,800
by just reminding yourself that everything he's saying is his opinion.

431
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,880
It's not fact and it's not even coherent analysis.

432
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,000
The real tell here is how it's a completely ignoring the other three scenarios in the

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
document.

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,600
How come the conspiracy isn't that the globalists are secretly trying to reveal that they're

435
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,400
trying to usher in a world depicted by the clever together scenario where quote, pharmaceutical

436
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,440
giants release thousands of drug compounds shown to be effective against diseases like

437
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,220
malaria to the public domain as part of an open innovation agenda.

438
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,960
They also opened their archives of research and development on neglected diseases deemed

439
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,800
not commercially viable, offering seed funding to scientists who wanted to carry the research

440
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
forward.

441
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,400
Why isn't that the conspiracy that's in the document?

442
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,960
I will argue because in that world, zinc sales are down.

443
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Yeah.

444
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,480
This scenario isn't used or even mentioned because it doesn't depict the kind of vibe

445
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,800
that Alex has spent his career making his audience scared about.

446
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,760
The four scenarios in this document are equally likely, as is a completely different future

447
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,600
that wasn't captured by the two variable exercise of this study, but the only one that matters

448
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,280
to Infowars is the one that paints the dystopian hellscape they make money by convincing listeners

449
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,220
is right around the corner.

450
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,800
If Alex and Paul wanted to fear monger about this document responsibly, they have an obligation

451
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,480
to answer one very basic question, which they refuse to in the past or in the present, which

452
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,560
is what is different about the lockstep scenario that makes it the globalist secret plan, whereas

453
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,440
the other three aren't.

454
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,680
Well, it's in the other d- because GMOs?

455
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
Sure.

456
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,600
Vac- vaccines, Dan.

457
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,700
They're gonna- cows?

458
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,760
It seems kind of like an arbitrary choice that you make, because that's the one that

459
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,520
appeals to you and you think is profitable.

460
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,680
Yeah, probably.

461
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,740
That would make sense.

462
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,360
Profit motive does seem to encompass most of all the things we talk about.

463
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,760
So they're gonna kill us.

464
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Sure.

465
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
That's basically-

466
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Yeah, that sounds about right.

467
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
It's always been.

468
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Yeah.

469
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
DNA has been altered to also cause sterilization.

470
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,520
I mean, they're hitting us on so many fronts, and I've got all the government reports admitting

471
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,280
that the births, year by year, they're studying that human DNA is being damaged at a level

472
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
never before seen.

473
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:50,040
We are being mutated, and many of us that are able to even think and operate today,

474
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,320
our children, their children, and the children after them are gonna be deformed monsters

475
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,800
who are literally drooling basket cases.

476
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Sure.

477
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,680
But of course, that will never even get to that point.

478
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,720
They plan to exterminate all of us long before then.

479
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Oh, that's nice of them.

480
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,440
It's just an absolute fact.

481
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,200
And why do we have to sit here and fight with each other?

482
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,320
Government bureaucrats, police, military, everybody?

483
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,840
I mean, we're all in this together.

484
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:22,520
It's a tiny elite, less than 6,000 globalists in their own analysis that rule the planet.

485
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,640
And look, I'm gonna get into all the news coming up in your phone calls today.

486
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
It's just, this is so horrible.

487
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They're collapsing the economy so they can take control of us through the government

488
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
healthcare system and soft kill us.

489
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Ooh, oh boy.

490
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Took a turn.

491
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,160
Well, this is like, this reminds me of the Heaven's Gate cult now, just on account of

492
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:50,080
like, I'm worried that we, like that argument, sure, we don't want them to kill all of us,

493
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,360
but on the other hand, if we all killed ourselves, that would take away their satisfaction, right?

494
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,760
Yeah, that would stick it to the devil.

495
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,520
Yeah, they'd be really bummed about that.

496
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,040
Yeah, also this 6,000, why doesn't the devil just give more peeps?

497
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,240
Oh no, you can only really devil it up with 6,000 at a time.

498
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,520
Is the devil behind this or not at this point in 2010?

499
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,440
Because it doesn't feel like it, it feels like it's an administrative plan.

500
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,080
Fair, fair, fair.

501
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,720
But I will say that we do know that the globalist plans are ten years behind, and here we are,

502
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,900
ten years later.

503
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:29,160
It just has the vibe of like, definitely being a mortal plan.

504
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,440
A little bit, yeah, yeah a little bit.

505
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Different vibe.

506
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
What's the devil get out of this?

507
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I don't know.

508
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,160
Anyway, Aaron Dykes was the one who found the document and brought it to Alex's attention

509
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,240
so he sent it across the pond.

510
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,680
Which is why Alex is a psychic who predicted everything now.

511
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Yes.

512
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,600
Now, here's a little bit about Aaron Dykes and how he found his way to Infowars.

513
00:23:52,600 --> 00:24:01,800
There are so many of these reports that Aaron Dykes only ate it by coffee.

514
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,680
What?

515
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,080
Many days will not sleep and I have to make him go home after two days of being up here.

516
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,760
This is somebody I hired right out of the University of Texas five years ago who didn't

517
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,760
really believe in what I was doing, who didn't really buy what I was saying and kind of laughed

518
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,960
when I hired him.

519
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,840
That's exactly who I wanted to hire.

520
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,480
I wanted him to see it.

521
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,280
And he'd gone to, you know, the UT public relations school, you know, he had very good

522
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
grades.

523
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
When he graduated, he was very intelligent.

524
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,240
And I said, you are going to see the dark side.

525
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,040
Hire me, you coward.

526
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Wow.

527
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,400
If you really want someone who doesn't believe you, I have got a candidate for the position.

528
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
And that's me.

529
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,320
I don't think, I don't think Alex could afford me at this point, but no, no, no, no, no.

530
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,040
I do like that idea of like, I wanted to find somebody.

531
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,460
I want the most skeptical person.

532
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,160
I want somebody who thinks they can see through all of my bullshit.

533
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,640
And then I'm going to show them the truth.

534
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,720
Which is that we make a lot of money here and you can make some too.

535
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,800
Integrity is for losers.

536
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,920
I hired him out of public relations school because journalism school was not where I

537
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,840
find people to work at Infowars.

538
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Nope.

539
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,680
Usually contests is how I find people.

540
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,880
So Alex, Alex is like, there's so much proof, man, or just so much proof of things.

541
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,280
These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers.

542
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,160
So many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers

543
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:51,440
so fast, so fast, so furious that you could never read them all.

544
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,480
A group of just two or three people here in my office that research this, we could never

545
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
read them all.

546
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,080
It is warehouses full of it.

547
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,480
It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.

548
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,640
If there are in fact warehouses full of the proof of Alex's conspiracy theories, then

549
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,400
I would suggest he start by producing one piece of that proof because everything he's

550
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
pointed to so far in my experience has been bullshit.

551
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,320
John P. Holdren's eco science book doesn't advocate sterilizing people through adding

552
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,540
stuff to the water.

553
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,120
This Rockefeller document doesn't lay out a master plan to bring in a dictatorship through

554
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
a pandemic.

555
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,960
The Club of Rome's publications don't prove that they made up climate change.

556
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,880
Every single specific I've ever heard Alex mention doesn't say what he claims it does.

557
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,040
There is a warehouse.

558
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,120
It's just a warehouse that's full of books and publications that Alex has never read

559
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,000
or can't understand, and he's just using them as props to justify and support his flimsy

560
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,360
facade of dumb theories.

561
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,160
I'm going to argue that rather than a warehouse, maybe five gigs of a Google Drive.

562
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Maybe.

563
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,880
No, because he used to print everything out.

564
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
It's physical.

565
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Well, that's fair.

566
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
That's fair.

567
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,580
It's got to be a filing cabinet or two.

568
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,400
I hope they have a shredder.

569
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,440
That's how important the stuff they print out is.

570
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,040
We got to get rid of this the moment Alex prints out a tweet.

571
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,480
I can't be caught with this.

572
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
No, no, no.

573
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Too dangerous.

574
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,780
Too many stacks.

575
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:18,600
So as I was listening to this episode, I heard one of the parts of Alex's 2021 prediction

576
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,120
montage clip that shocked the world, and I noticed something really suspicious about

577
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,300
how his words were presented.

578
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,800
Here's how this appears in the overly dramatic current day clip.

579
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
I pray to God.

580
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,640
I pray to my Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, every night to give me the strength and the

581
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,040
will to be able to face this harm and to give me the strength to carry on, because I know

582
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,440
why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the

583
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,800
YouTube videos or on message boards, and I'm a liar.

584
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:55,520
I know why, because it's scary.

585
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,880
You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.

586
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,200
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.

587
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,440
You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.

588
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,280
That sounds kind of prophetic.

589
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,320
Alex is saying that we won't be able to go to ball games or get drunk with our friends

590
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,760
at the bar, and that's exactly like what happened because of coronavirus safety measures.

591
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,600
The intention of this clip is to give the audience that impression, that Alex is predicting

592
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,760
social lockdown, which, if you haven't forgotten, is kind of the title of this video.

593
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
Sure.

594
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,960
So, there's a huge problem, though, and there's a slight edit that whoever made this clip

595
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,400
did that changes the entire meaning of Alex's words.

596
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,100
Do you mean when he said that they were going to nuke us and that's why we couldn't go to

597
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
ball games anymore?

598
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,280
No, that's from another show.

599
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Gotcha.

600
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I pray to God.

601
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,680
I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the

602
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,800
will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on, because

603
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,500
I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment

604
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,960
on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.

605
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,120
I know why, because it's scary.

606
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,000
And if you admit this to yourself, you're not going to be able to go to the ball games

607
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,520
anymore.

608
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,680
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.

609
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,680
You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time and

610
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:25,440
not spend some of your energy on resisting this shady, you lying piece of shit.

611
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Shady as hell.

612
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
You motherfucking liar.

613
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Yeah.

614
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,000
You are saying that if you are available to learn this information, that information will

615
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,040
so dominate you, you won't be able to go to ball games.

616
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Motherfucking liar!

617
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Liar!

618
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:46,600
I have a paragraph written, but I think you expressed it just about as well as I could.

619
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Yeah, that was really shocking to me.

620
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,160
I was like, wow, what a difference a couple of words make.

621
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Yeah, sure does.

622
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,000
Sure does make a big difference, doesn't it?

623
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,880
Really puts everything into it.

624
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,240
Put that back in your fucking sizzle reel, you son of a...

625
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Yeah, it's not fair.

626
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Fuck off.

627
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,520
The cutting out of those words completely alters the point of what Alex is saying, and

628
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,920
it makes those images of not being able to go to the ball game or bars anymore, you know,

629
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,840
it makes, when you cut it out, it seems like they're independent thoughts from everything

630
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,880
else that he's saying, as opposed to the then part of an if-then statement.

631
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
You got it.

632
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,480
This is intensely dishonest, and whoever edited this clip together took those words out because

633
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,600
they knew that in their original form, they don't really work to make Alex sound like

634
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,680
he made an amazing prediction.

635
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,000
But if you chop them off, it looks like he might have been onto something.

636
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,880
Using this cheesy score and making selective edits like this, the person who put this together

637
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,520
is able to transform something pretty meaningless and standard from Alex's show into something

638
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,600
that looks like a fairly specific prediction about stuff that would happen a decade later.

639
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,680
They do this because they know they can get away with it.

640
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,160
Anyone who's susceptible for falling for Alex's shit is probably not going to be the sort

641
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,320
of person who goes back to look at his 2010 episode to see if he was actually making a

642
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,560
prediction back then, so this is a safe game of exploitation and manipulation that Alex

643
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,280
is free to play, and man, it's just transparent.

644
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,560
Dan, frankly, at this point, I would argue, you're literally the only person who would

645
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,640
go back and find the episode that Alex said that and kick ass.

646
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,040
Well, I was curious.

647
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Of course you are.

648
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,680
You know, because you hear that, it's like you can't go to the ball games anymore.

649
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,560
It's like, well, I mean, like, if you really did say that, I still don't think it means

650
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
anything.

651
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,160
No, it's not because he knows anything about it.

652
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
But it would be, yeah, you're right.

653
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
It would be interesting.

654
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
You're right, it would be interesting.

655
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,120
Going back and hearing that, I mean, I do it for your reaction.

656
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
That reaction is why I do it.

657
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
That's why you play the game.

658
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,680
I want to throw a baseball at him.

659
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,040
I want to throw a baseball right at his head.

660
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,200
Happy spring training of baseball to the brain.

661
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Jesus Christ.

662
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,800
That is unacceptable behavior.

663
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,360
I was sitting alone in my room when I heard that, and I said, you asshole.

664
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,960
Do you know what the problem is?

665
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,320
He takes himself out of context in the clips.

666
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
That's the problem.

667
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,040
The problem is the Infowars media takes Alex Jones out of context.

668
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,160
Yeah, it's not fair.

669
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,280
So Alex gets to complaining about Obamacare and what have you, and he's like, hey, man,

670
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,800
they're going to try and tell you you can't eat foods and stuff, and oh, no, it's no good.

671
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Tracking how much you weigh.

672
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,960
They're already doing that through the schools to then tax you if you're overweight.

673
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,360
They admit they're now going to do that and say what you can put in a child's Happy Meal.

674
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,960
Oh, it's okay for McDonald's to put silicone in the food.

675
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:38,480
That's CNN, a petrochemical, extremely poisonous, illegal in England and other countries, but

676
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,960
you can't put a toy in there.

677
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,560
See, it's all about control.

678
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,300
It's not so much that McDonald's puts silicone in their food, which is the impression that

679
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Alex is trying to give the audience.

680
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,100
It's that McDonald's uses silicone in the preparation of their food.

681
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,600
You can find this information on McDonald's own website, that they use dimethyl polysiloxane

682
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,560
in the oil that they use to fry French fries.

683
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,760
What a great place to hide that information.

684
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Right on their website.

685
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,040
No one would ever look there.

686
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,280
So the reason for this is because it's a food-grade anti-foaming agent, which prevents the oil

687
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,840
from bubbling up and burning employees.

688
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,960
Anyone who's worked in fast food knows that getting that oil on you is no joke, and with

689
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,880
the high incidence of younger employees at places like McDonald's, it's really important

690
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,880
as a safety measure to do what you can to limit the possibility of people getting oil

691
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
all over themselves.

692
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Totally.

693
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
It sucks.

694
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm putting a little oil on myself back in my fry-making days.

695
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Yeah.

696
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Aw, it hurts so fucking bad.

697
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,240
Alex can't prove that this chemical is dangerous to people.

698
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,540
And actually, interestingly, in 2018, MLive reported that, quote, scientists at Yokohama

699
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,280
National University in Japan say that a chemical added to the oil to cook McDonald's French

700
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,480
fries could help cure baldness in humans.

701
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
That's right.

702
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,380
Some early-stage testing has shown that dimethyl polysiloxane was used to, quote, aid the growth

703
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,200
of black hair on the back and scalp of mice.

704
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Okay.

705
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Yeah.

706
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
All right.

707
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,960
So, Alex, it's his own fault he's losing his hair.

708
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,160
Of course, because people are kind of dumb, after this news broke, these Japanese scientists

709
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,440
had to come out and clarify that eating McDonald's fries would not help you grow back hair.

710
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
It doesn't do that.

711
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Of course not.

712
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
It's not the same.

713
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Yeah.

714
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,960
Their lead researcher, Junji Fukada, told writers, quote, no matter how many fried potatoes

715
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,160
you eat, you'll never grow more hair.

716
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,360
That's a total misunderstanding that's gone viral.

717
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,200
It's so sad that scientists have to take time out of their day to say stuff like that.

718
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Oh, boy.

719
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,000
So, Alex does stuff like this all the time.

720
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,840
He'll say something like, McDonald's puts silicone in their food, and then do nothing

721
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,160
more to examine the claim or help his audience understand what it even means.

722
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,740
If you just listened to Alex, you'd be, you know, it would be equally easy to conclude

723
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,160
that McDonald's is using this chemical in the oil as an anti-foaming agent as it would

724
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,600
be to believe that their Big Macs are half breast implant.

725
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Right.

726
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Right, right, right.

727
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,640
It just leaves you just treading water.

728
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Yeah.

729
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,160
I mean, the worst part of that is we are a little bit conditioned so much to that type

730
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,600
of processed food that there's, it's almost borderline reasonable to be like, yeah, I

731
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,080
can see McDonald's putting silicone in their food.

732
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,480
I mean, it is.

733
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,440
We get so much, I'm not saying that it's a good idea or that I, you know, all that stuff,

734
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
but it is.

735
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,840
And I'm not, I'm not blanket defending use of all kinds of chemicals and stuff.

736
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
No, of course not.

737
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,200
It's a very different conversation from like what you're just sort of out of nowhere brain

738
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,800
would pull up if you're thinking about silicone, you're thinking of like plastic, basically,

739
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,800
as opposed to something that is a food grade anti-foaming agent for the oil.

740
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,120
No, he's, he's taking advantage of the fact that evil shady corporations are tend to tend

741
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,600
to be evil and shady.

742
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,880
And he's taking advantage of the fact that his audience does not demand any kind of specificity

743
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
out of them.

744
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Why would they?

745
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Yeah.

746
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Why not BP?

747
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Sure.

748
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Why not?

749
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,160
This is so weird.

750
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,280
Coming up also BP says they've stopped the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, but we've

751
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:10,020
got screenshots of their cameras down there and it looks like there may be some hanky

752
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,600
panky going on, but we are looking into it right now and working on that.

753
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,440
But if this is true, praise God, this is certainly wonderful news.

754
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,800
Why are you still taking a wait and see approach?

755
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,720
You claim to have evidence that indicates there's hanky panky going on and you're still

756
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,080
trusting an oil company.

757
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,160
He's got money.

758
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,320
He's got money in oil.

759
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
I don't know.

760
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,720
He's got to have something behind it.

761
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't know if it's that.

762
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,520
I just think it, I don't, I don't know, but it's weird.

763
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
That's very weird.

764
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Yeah.

765
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Yeah.

766
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,880
Well, I mean, we've seen some screenshots that show something weird is happening, but

767
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,240
you know, I think in this one situation I'm going to last the corporation.

768
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm pretty sure that escape pod is filled with nobody.

769
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
There's nobody in there.

770
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,360
We don't need to fire a laser to blow up that escape pod.

771
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:05,880
Isn't this company that, uh, you know, spilled millions of tons of oil into the water.

772
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,560
They tell us that it's all good, but I saw some evidence.

773
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,360
There might be some goofing around, you know, might be some chicanery down there to say

774
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,400
that this, this massive oil spill, this ecological disaster, I'm going to just go ahead and trust

775
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,240
that they're, they're all, they're above board up to human hair.

776
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,420
We all make mistakes.

777
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,680
So one of the things I think is pretty interesting about going back to this time frame is like

778
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,360
when Alex says he's going to go to calls a lot of the time he does, like it's, it, it

779
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:38,320
seems more consistent that he'll get to calls and he'll take some calls and then jump back

780
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,800
to just doing the show and then take some more calls.

781
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,000
It has more of the feel of like an actual radio show back then.

782
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,900
And so he goes to some calls as opposed to maybe somebody who's abused, uh, amphetamines

783
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,480
for a few years.

784
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Yeah.

785
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Yeah.

786
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,800
So this first caller brings up that like, Hey, you know, finding out about all this

787
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,240
stuff about the evil folks who run the world and all that kind of makes it tough for me

788
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,480
to be happy.

789
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,740
Alex does not seem concerned.

790
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,880
You hit on a talking point that, that, uh, not a lot of times people will bring up and

791
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,880
what you had mentioned this morning earlier before, uh, I got through to talk to you was

792
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:33,120
about how once you obtain this information and the truth, basically how much it does

793
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,600
change your outlook on how you value your life.

794
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,000
And then I can honestly say it, my life hasn't been the same.

795
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And sometimes I, you know, and I, I might even be asking for some advice here, buddy,

796
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,680
but sometimes it's really hard to find some balance and to try to even maintain a reasonable

797
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,300
amount of what I got given right by the constitution that, uh, you know, that just, you know, my

798
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,300
right to be happy.

799
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,600
Well, listen, listen, listen, Tim, we got out of balance.

800
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:12,440
Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Thomas Payne, Patrick Henry, they all said, you must

801
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,080
guard the jewel of Liberty.

802
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,000
You must do everything you can in its defense.

803
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,400
It is, you know, the, of the prime importance, even if you struggle to keep freedom, you're

804
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,280
probably going to lose it and, and, and you will go into bondage and the worst elements

805
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,320
of society will take over.

806
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,400
And so we've gotten out of balance as a society becoming decadent, fat and happy.

807
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
So the evil crept in.

808
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,680
Now we're going back into bondage.

809
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,080
The blessings of Liberty we're now losing.

810
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,400
And so, uh, what did Barry Goldwater say?

811
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,960
Extremism and defensive Liberty is no vice.

812
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,040
Uh, there, there is no such thing as being out of balance.

813
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
That's all folks.

814
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,840
And by my underwear, my antsy pants, um, yeah, I think that this caller is expressing that

815
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,520
like, Hey, this stuff is really like, you scare me a lot and it's not pleasant.

816
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,920
Hey, you've whipped me into a constant state of fear and my adrenaline is always pumping,

817
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,040
which makes me feel bad.

818
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Yeah.

819
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
And Alex is like, you're fine.

820
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Yeah.

821
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Come on.

822
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
What are you doing?

823
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
Chill out.

824
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,240
They're going to kill all of us, but it's like a while.

825
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,160
So he wants to give this dude a little bit more kind of advice and a little bit of, uh,

826
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,320
like when I'm with my family, when I'm out there fishing with the kids, you know, like

827
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,720
I'm thinking about fighting the globalist, but I'm also enjoying this because that's

828
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,520
why I'm fighting the globalist.

829
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
That kind of thing.

830
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,960
He won't be able to go to ball games.

831
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,040
I mean, you can take your kids to ball games cause that's why you're fighting.

832
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,880
You got to integrate the enjoyment of family time with your passion to fight.

833
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,360
Not yet the devil soon to be the devil.

834
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Right.

835
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,800
And then this caller flips the script and changes the game.

836
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Okay.

837
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,280
What's interesting is 10 years ago, you know, I've been married for almost nine, but, but

838
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,480
you know, 10 years ago, even six, seven years ago, I would still see a beautiful woman in

839
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,760
a grocery store and lust.

840
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,680
I would still, uh, you know, uh, be, I have a lot of flesh and now almost all of that

841
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,680
is burned away.

842
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:13,160
I mean, I'm attracted to my wife, but still my drive states are fully survival, warn people

843
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:21,360
deal with this, you know, protect my children and anything else, Tim?

844
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Yeah.

845
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,760
And just a couple of real quick things here is, uh, you know, uh, you were talking about,

846
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,280
you know, uh, what people look at as important to these days.

847
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,000
And when I crack open my Yahoo page, which is my homepage, uh, they have this thing called

848
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
trending now and you'll see stuff like Lindsay Lohan, American idol, uh, raw wrestling, dancing

849
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,400
the stars.

850
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:53,360
And then the sixth thing at the end of the very last article, guess what it was, BP oil

851
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,560
spill.

852
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,560
That's what kind of priorities our country has these days.

853
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,320
That's a great point is, uh, what is that trend you're looking at Google trends or what

854
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
is it?

855
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:10,200
No, you know, it's, uh, on my, on my Yahoo, uh, I don't have a Yahoo, I've meant to write

856
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,440
a story about that.

857
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,960
Uh, I'm gonna talk when we come back.

858
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Great points, Tim.

859
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,960
God bless you.

860
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
No time.

861
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
I just had a thought.

862
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
All right.

863
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,520
Also, uh, Alex is a couple of years away from divorce at this point.

864
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah.

865
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,640
Um, so it's too bad that he had all the lust burned out of him by this point.

866
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Yeah.

867
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,600
You know, the internet, like the way that he described that, that reminds me so much

868
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,080
of the way that Douglas Adams described the babble fish, whereas like finally everyone

869
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,840
in the universe was able to communicate with each other and that caused more and bloodier

870
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:50,020
wars than ever in the past, you know, where it's like, Oh no, maybe it was a bad idea.

871
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,880
Just like universal communication.

872
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah.

873
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Yeah.

874
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
Yeah.

875
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
The internet is fucking, it's probably bad.

876
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
Well, I don't know.

877
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,720
I don't know if the internet is bad, but it does definitely at very least expose some

878
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:08,200
parts of our behaviors and our patterns that maybe we wouldn't have been aware of otherwise.

879
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Yeah.

880
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,880
Um, certainly trolling, uh, becomes a bit more noticeable, shitty as hell.

881
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Um, and then also like the phenomenon that this dude's talking about with like things

882
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,560
like American Idol, WWE wrestling, they're trending, whereas something like the BP oil

883
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
spill isn't.

884
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,040
And it's like, well, yeah, that's people's attention.

885
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,880
The internet is the opiate of the masses.

886
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,320
I don't know what to tell you.

887
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,000
I don't know.

888
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,780
We're trying to feel comforted.

889
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,880
We have Obama in the white house.

890
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,640
Everybody's still like, maybe we won't have an evil president.

891
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,880
It was good times.

892
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,480
So Alex had something trigger in his brain because of what that guy said about his Yahoo

893
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,480
feed.

894
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,880
And he has come up with a plan.

895
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,360
And you'll see how it's a news item.

896
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,840
Normally they kind of feedback loop it and feed into it when it's Lindsay Lohan, uh,

897
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,880
or when it's, uh, something like, uh, the scandal of Mel Gibson, the media hypes that,

898
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:19,520
Hey, look, you know, the number one trend is Facebook or Chubacombra or Mel Gibson or

899
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,260
Kelly Osborn.

900
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:32,360
And the BP oil spill is way down the line.

901
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,580
Unemployment extension 2010 is number 15 on Yahoo trends.

902
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,860
Are you for or against it?

903
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:48,020
That should be number one, lead and mercury in our children's juice drinks and chips and

904
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,560
food and soft drinks.

905
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,560
That's all admitted.

906
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,680
Your children are drinking this in mass.

907
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:59,320
That should be the top trend.

908
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,560
Now what if we actually gamed their corrupt system?

909
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:11,560
What if every listener of this show today and tomorrow and on Sunday and Monday typed

910
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,420
the Obama deception into Yahoo and into Google search engines?

911
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,400
What have you did it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?

912
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:30,440
That would put the Obama deception links to the video for people to watch it for free.

913
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,680
That would put links to that at the top of Google and at the top of Yahoo and tens of

914
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,840
millions more would see it.

915
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,500
This guy's a goddamn genius.

916
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:48,020
If every one of my listeners would buy one share of stock in, yeah, yeah, yeah.

917
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,800
That's Bill Cooper all over the place.

918
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,200
But in like a minute, Alex has laid out a case for his audience to do something completely

919
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,160
nonsensical to solve a non-existent problem.

920
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,960
He is a genius of marketing.

921
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,160
The supposed problem here is that the news about the BP oil spill is not higher than

922
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,880
on the internet trending list.

923
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,720
This is an outrage when the top trends are about trivial matters like celebrities or

924
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,720
cryptids.

925
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,280
You can easily see how this is an easy argument to get people to agree with.

926
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,560
The oil spill is probably more important than pop stories, but this isn't a problem.

927
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,620
It's just kind of a statement about what attracts people's attention.

928
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,800
The oil spill began three months prior, so headlines about it might not have been all

929
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,560
that exciting to people.

930
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,760
And just a few days before this, Lindsay Lohan had been sentenced to 90 days in jail for

931
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,360
violating her probation.

932
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:42,400
And I believe Mel Gibson was in the news for, yeah, that racist ass rant.

933
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,640
I remember, I remember that.

934
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,880
This was not the time he got pulled over.

935
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,880
Yeah.

936
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,880
This was the other time.

937
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,160
Yeah, it's good that he still has a career.

938
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,360
It's fine to say that the BP oil spill is maybe a larger story for more people, but

939
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,560
it's ridiculous to complain about the public paying attention to those stories.

940
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,680
They were pretty serious stories.

941
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,040
You think the BP oil spill should be higher.

942
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,360
Well, here's what we do tomorrow.

943
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,440
Make something else news.

944
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,440
Right.

945
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,720
So Alex lays out his supposed problem, which is caused by some vague idea about how the

946
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,240
algorithm searches work.

947
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,240
And then the solution is that everybody needs to search for the Obama deception to push

948
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,080
that movie to the top of all search engine results.

949
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,160
This makes no sense, but it feels like it does to Alex's audience because they've

950
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,640
been trained to equate promoting info wars with engaging in activism.

951
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,120
They've been conditioned to believe that it's possible that if the Obama deception gets

952
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,080
seen by millions more people, maybe it'll have an impact on getting people to pay more

953
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,400
attention to oil spills and less to celebrity gossip.

954
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,920
The sleight of hand you see in this clip is phenomenal, and it really represents the bleak

955
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,080
underbelly of what Alex's world is always about.

956
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,880
The only solutions that are ever really offered are those that directly profit Alex.

957
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,200
The solution to the collapsing economy is to buy gold from Alex's sponsor, Ted Anderson.

958
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,320
The solution to the coming societal collapse is to buy survival food from Alex's sponsor,

959
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
My Patriot Supply.

960
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,480
The solution to COVID-19 and every other health condition is just to use Alex's supplements.

961
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,160
The solution to people not paying enough attention to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill apparently

962
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,640
is to try and trick search engines into thinking Alex's movie is more popular than it actually

963
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,360
is, so it's fooled into recommending it to more people.

964
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,680
Yeah, that sounds correct.

965
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,680
It's evil.

966
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,640
And looking back on this, it's painfully transparent to see what Alex is doing.

967
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,640
It's very bad.

968
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,440
But I do have a hard time not recognizing that it is a great marketing strategy.

969
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
Ugh.

970
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Yeah.

971
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,840
I also enjoyed that as Alex was talking, like as soon as he said the Obama deception the

972
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,720
first time, you rolled your eyes and just shook your head.

973
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
No.

974
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

975
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Yeah.

976
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,840
So that's his big plan.

977
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,000
And see, this is a serious plan.

978
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,280
He spends a half hour talking about it.

979
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,280
Really?

980
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,280
Yes.

981
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,280
Really?

982
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Yeah.

983
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
Okay.

984
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,280
And like, hey, look.

985
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Look.

986
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Sure.

987
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
We'll do the Obama deception first.

988
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,280
Sure.

989
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
And then later we can do it with other things.

990
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,280
Okay.

991
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,760
What if you all right now went to a search engine box.

992
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,240
Let's show people live on TV.

993
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,080
Radio listeners could just go to Google, go to Yahoo, go to the biggest search engines

994
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,420
and type in the Obama deception.

995
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,660
The Obama deception.

996
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,120
Type in the Obama deception.

997
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
This'll probably work.

998
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,840
It'll probably push it into the top trends, maybe even number one.

999
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:35,480
And the next week I can put out a viral video, say on genetic engineering, causing DNA damage.

1000
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:43,040
We can create a simple term for people to search.

1001
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,440
And then millions of new people because of that information warfare tool will see it.

1002
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:53,120
I like this technique that is sort of like that Steve Martin, one for the studios, one

1003
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,920
for me kind of movie thing.

1004
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,160
It's like, all right, this first one is just going to be promoting my shit.

1005
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,520
And then the second time I'll do it about some topic that we want to draw attention

1006
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,520
to.

1007
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,200
What I want to do is kind of a ladder attack, okay?

1008
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,880
Just get my name trending first and then I'll put out content to go viral.

1009
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,880
See?

1010
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,880
It's great.

1011
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,040
And to be clear, Alex has done this kind of thing earlier in his career as well with

1012
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,160
Google search terms and stuff.

1013
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:24,880
It's not a new strategy for him, but it is tremendously desperate and weird the way he's

1014
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
acting.

1015
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
This one's terrible.

1016
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
Yeah, this one's bad.

1017
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Yeah.

1018
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
So Alex won, right?

1019
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Sure.

1020
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,060
When there was an even playing field, Alex won.

1021
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,440
His stuff was the most popular.

1022
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Everybody knows it.

1023
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Shut up.

1024
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
Everyone knows it.

1025
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
Okay.

1026
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,920
So the globalists cheated.

1027
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,360
Oh, okay.

1028
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,000
So now Alex has to cheat so they can't cheat.

1029
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Okay.

1030
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,080
It's complicated, but I just had this clip because Alex is really accepting and admitting

1031
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,800
that what he's doing is cheating.

1032
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,880
We've won on the level playing field, so they cheat.

1033
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,600
So before they start cheating this system, we need to game their system right now.

1034
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Yeah, we got to game it.

1035
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,200
We got to cheat that system in order to make sure they can't cheat again.

1036
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,640
We cheat first in order to stop their cheating.

1037
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,600
No, because they cheated before the level playing field.

1038
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,240
They cheated before the level playing field when he was the most popular radio show on

1039
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
the planet.

1040
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
Yes.

1041
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:21,040
So I want to stress to you, and I hope that stammering really drove home the point.

1042
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,360
He talks about this for a long time.

1043
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Oh, boy.

1044
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,360
It's a long time.

1045
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,800
So we're not going to listen to a ton more clips of it because he does jump off to another

1046
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,440
topic and that is that Pearl Harbor was a false flag.

1047
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
Okay.

1048
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,440
And it's now declassified.

1049
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,960
The US had broken the Japanese purple and blue code and knew exactly what they were

1050
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,600
going to do weeks before.

1051
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,640
It took weeks for that task force to steam from Japan into that area of the Pacific.

1052
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
That's way across the Pacific.

1053
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,320
If you look at the map, here's Japan, here's Hawaii, here's the West Coast of the United

1054
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
States.

1055
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,360
They had to come all the way and the aircraft and the US submarines and all the islands

1056
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,840
we control, they all knew they were coming and they were ordered to stand down and die.

1057
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,840
Whoa.

1058
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,120
Can't prove any of that.

1059
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,760
Ooh, that's a big one.

1060
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,120
We've talked a bit about his Pearl Harbor conspiracies in the past, but I just wanted

1061
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:11,040
to play that as just to represent that he spends a while on that topic.

1062
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,960
Now he goes back to calls because he has made his point that everyone needs to get to typing

1063
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,960
in their search engines.

1064
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,960
Of course.

1065
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,000
And he gets a call from a guy named Angel Eyes.

1066
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Okay.

1067
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Who scares me.

1068
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm listening.

1069
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,800
Let's talk to Angel Eyes in Texas here on the air.

1070
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
You got me.

1071
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,000
How you doing, Bulldog?

1072
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Pretty good.

1073
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Okay.

1074
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You know, Angel Eyes is because I think my eyes see what other people don't.

1075
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You're freaking me out, Angel Eyes.

1076
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That's not good.

1077
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's not good.

1078
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Sir?

1079
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Sir?

1080
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Sir?

1081
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
How you doing, Bulldog?

1082
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
All right.

1083
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
All right.

1084
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Maybe if it's 3 a.m. at a bar and I don't want to go home, if somebody starts with,

1085
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,560
I'm Angel Eyes because I think I can see, I'm like, hey, maybe I'm listening.

1086
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,160
I'll ask one follow-up.

1087
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,560
Any time before that.

1088
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,820
I can always leave, man.

1089
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:01,760
I think I'm going to start our episodes now with, hey, what's going on, Bulldog?

1090
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
Yeah.

1091
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,840
That's a little bit of a charming way to greet me.

1092
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,840
Sure.

1093
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,920
Angel Eyes has some interesting memories that he wants to try and run by, Alex.

1094
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Okay.

1095
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,680
I called you about a month ago in regards to the interview with Chandra Levy's aunt

1096
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,400
with Barbara Walters about Chandra called her a week before she disappeared and said

1097
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,480
something big is fixing to happen in America and I can't tell you about it.

1098
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:35,320
You put out the flag that if anybody had a recording of that, could they send it to you?

1099
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,920
I doubt anybody would have it.

1100
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,240
That was like 10 years ago that happened.

1101
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,680
I wonder, could you find out who Chandra Levy's aunt is and interview her if she hasn't disappeared

1102
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,680
or, you know, died mysteriously yet?

1103
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:55,280
So you're saying you saw Chandra Levy, the intern that was killed right before 9-11.

1104
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,760
You're saying that she said something big is about to happen, but I can't tell you.

1105
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,560
And you're saying you saw her say that on what show?

1106
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,800
On Barbara Walters, I believe it was Barbara Walters.

1107
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,680
It may have been like Leslie Stahl or one of those global reporters, but...

1108
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,200
Does not spare the details here.

1109
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,400
So Chandra Levy's aunt is named Linda Zamsky and the interview that she gave back in 2001

1110
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,000
and her statement about her niece's disappearance were widely reported at the time in every

1111
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
outlet you can imagine.

1112
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,160
It would be the easiest thing in the world for this caller to have just googled Chandra

1113
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:37,840
Levy's aunt and found articles explaining this, which kind of illustrates where his

1114
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,920
memory has failed him.

1115
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,980
The aunt didn't say that Chandra had said that there was something big that was going

1116
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,880
to happen in America, as Angel Eyes is reporting to Alex.

1117
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,680
According to the Washington Post, quote, on April 29th, the day before Levy was last seen,

1118
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,800
Levy left a message on Zamsky's voicemail.

1119
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,600
Zamsky would never hear from her niece again.

1120
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:01,560
Quote, hi, Linda, it's Chandra, my internship is over, Levy said in the message.

1121
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,160
I'm planning on packing my bags in the next week or ten days, heading home for a while,

1122
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,800
don't know what I'm going to do this summer, and I really have some big news or something

1123
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,000
important to tell, call me.

1124
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,240
The article goes on to say, quote, Zamsky said yesterday she did not know what Levy

1125
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,440
was referring to, but added that the 24-year-old did not seem upset.

1126
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,680
According to Zamsky, she was Chandra's confidant about her relationship with then-Representative

1127
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:31,620
Gary Condit, so taken in its proper context, as delivered by Zamsky, you could use this

1128
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:36,160
comment to speculate that maybe Chandra had some news about a change in her relationship

1129
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,160
with Condit?

1130
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Sure.

1131
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,760
But that's not the context that Angel Eyes is bringing this information to Alex in.

1132
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,480
He's saying that the news that Chandra had for her aunt was something big was going to

1133
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,080
happen in America, which seems to be him implying that she had foreknowledge about 9-11.

1134
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:55,320
Hey auntie, just wanted to let you know, coming home soon, I'm not sure, I don't know what

1135
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,560
I'm going to do for this summer, 9-11's about to happen, it's going to be a wild couple

1136
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,560
of months.

1137
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,520
I've seen this conspiracy floated online before, so it's not like a completely new idea to

1138
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,720
me, but it's one idea that kind of relies on connecting random dots and misinterpreting

1139
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,840
and misrepresenting Zamsky's comments.

1140
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,280
It's kind of shocking to me, honestly, that Alex would hear this and kind of not know

1141
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,280
what the guy's talking about.

1142
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,680
It seems like this would be something that he would have covered, and I bet he has and

1143
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,680
he's just forgotten.

1144
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,400
Yeah, he just doesn't care because it didn't really have legs, yeah.

1145
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Probably.

1146
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,160
So, this internet spamming, it works quick.

1147
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,400
It starts working while Alex is still on air.

1148
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,580
It totally works, okay.

1149
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:40,920
I'm noticing that on Twitter and Facebook it is alive with the Obama deception.

1150
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:47,700
Thousands and thousands of people are flooding Twitter and Facebook by posting the Obama

1151
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,060
deception from YouTube or just the term the Obama deception.

1152
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:56,680
People are also going to Google and Yahoo and typing in the Obama deception.

1153
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,960
We're going to try to trend that to the top to show people the power of the alternative

1154
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,240
media and to reach millions of new people with the film.

1155
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,280
But we can't make future films if you don't purchase them from us.

1156
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,720
Booyah!

1157
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,740
This has been a lot.

1158
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,740
This has been a lot.

1159
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,740
Yeah.

1160
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,880
This is a few more than I was hoping for.

1161
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,440
Hey, look, this is all working out great but also you need to buy the films.

1162
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,740
I got you in the door, now you got to buy the films also or else I can't make another

1163
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,920
one for us to artificially promote.

1164
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,840
This war isn't over until we defeat the globalists and we can't defeat the globalists so this

1165
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,720
war isn't over until you have made me obscenely wealthy.

1166
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,720
Yes.

1167
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,000
Beyond obscenely wealthy.

1168
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,440
So Alex goes back to calls and this one dude, he's wrong, I think about everything, sure.

1169
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,160
Matt in DC, you're on the air.

1170
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,160
Hi Alex.

1171
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,520
First, I just wanted to say thank you for doing more than anybody else in the world

1172
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,920
to fight against this new world order.

1173
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,920
Okay, well that's more.

1174
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,220
And secondly, I actually have to disagree with you when you say that you're not smarter

1175
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,220
than average.

1176
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:08,440
You're probably way above average when it comes to intelligence just based on your discernment.

1177
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,440
Yeah, that was wrong too.

1178
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,000
It's the duty of great men to lead.

1179
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,520
Alex, most people go cross-eyed when they try to process the amount of input that you

1180
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,880
do on a daily basis.

1181
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,960
That's three for three.

1182
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,240
And we need to know when you're going to step up and run for political office.

1183
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,720
I mean, run for mayor of Austin or governor of Texas and you'll have millions of people

1184
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,640
migrating just to go vote in that election.

1185
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh man, just the population of Texas would explode in order for people to come vote for

1186
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Alex to be their leader.

1187
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,600
If you stand correctly, if Alex announces that he is going to run for mayor of Austin

1188
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,960
within whatever length of time you must be a resident in order to vote.

1189
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,120
I'm sure there's some requirements.

1190
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,760
Yeah, there would have to be.

1191
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,220
So millions of people are going to go to Austin.

1192
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,220
Just to put Alex in office.

1193
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,220
Just to put Alex in office.

1194
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,220
And then they'll all move away.

1195
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:01,880
Oh, I guess they'll just stay in Austin and the place will get even weirder.

1196
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,020
There'll be a new shirt that'll say, keep Austin weird, but not that weird.

1197
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,680
Run away from how weird Austin is now.

1198
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,680
Yeah.

1199
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,360
Um, also as a cross-eyed American, I resent him saying people go cross-eyed taking in

1200
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,080
all the information that you do because he doesn't take in any information.

1201
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,400
Um, yeah, that's very frustrating.

1202
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,520
So one time Alex was gonna run.

1203
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,080
I don't know if you know this, he was going to run for office.

1204
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,080
Oh yeah.

1205
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
But there was a problem.

1206
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,120
He was too busy filming guardians of the galaxy.

1207
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,720
No, he was too popular.

1208
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,280
Politics is such a dirty business.

1209
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,760
One time I got talked into filing for state rep and I dropped out in a week because I

1210
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,120
was getting so much support and it freaked me out and I was reading the rules.

1211
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,120
They've written the rules where you can't follow the law and get elected legally in

1212
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,720
the campaign rules.

1213
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,720
That way they can selectively enforce against you.

1214
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:56,200
Um, so at this point, and I don't really ever intend to run for political office.

1215
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,860
Um, good, true.

1216
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,760
At this point, I don't intend to do that.

1217
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,320
Uh, I'm just here covering the news and the information.

1218
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,520
I mean, we're reaching millions of people a day, millions of new people every week.

1219
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,260
It's growing exponentially.

1220
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,880
Why should we stop what's working?

1221
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,800
I mean, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1222
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,440
Well, I don't think you'd have to stop.

1223
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,120
You could just do what you're doing and then have people come in and vote for you.

1224
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,320
I mean, it's not that you're wrong.

1225
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,280
I completely agree with everything you say.

1226
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,000
Well, Austin is incredibly corrupt because we do have a hundred percent election fraud.

1227
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,600
I've proven it in the paper when I've caught them back in 98 and again in 2000 I mean,

1228
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
it's just total fraud.

1229
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,000
That's why you can't vote them out and they're stealing everything.

1230
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,840
This is probably one of the most corrupt cities in the country.

1231
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,240
It's also the most wealthy per capita and that's why the bloodsuckers are here.

1232
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,520
They are, they are looting the public.

1233
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,160
Uh, so I mean, I can't even run for office here.

1234
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,160
There's no elections in Austin.

1235
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,080
What, what are you talking about?

1236
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,360
That's what are you talking about?

1237
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,440
Some world-class arguing right there.

1238
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,700
Yeah, I got me.

1239
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:07,440
So apparently Alex has been living in a land of lawlessness and complete 100% election

1240
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,280
stolen-ness for 10 years at least.

1241
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,480
Didn't bother him that much.

1242
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,480
Apparently not.

1243
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,480
No.

1244
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,200
I'm confused as to why.

1245
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,360
Oh, cause he's full of shit.

1246
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,360
Oh, that would make sense.

1247
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,360
Yeah, he's just talking shit.

1248
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,080
I was going to say, I feel like I would probably be like, hmm, I don't want to live here any

1249
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,080
longer.

1250
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,520
Yeah, I would be scared.

1251
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,880
Or it took me way little time with Laurie Lightfoot to be like, I don't want to live

1252
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,880
here anymore.

1253
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:39,720
I, or if like, if you really believe this revolutionary shit that Alex is talking about,

1254
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:45,440
it really seems like he would be not a radio host, he'd be a terrorist.

1255
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,080
He would be running a cell or something.

1256
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,200
He would be advocating that people do something crazy like a storm the Capitol building.

1257
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,920
If you've been living in a city where there's fraudulent elections for 10 years and there's

1258
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:04,280
nothing real and all the leadership, you can't vote him out because it's all like, what recourse

1259
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,160
do you have?

1260
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,540
Just accept it?

1261
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:11,720
I will say, having been to Austin, the barbecue is great.

1262
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,720
Sure.

1263
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,800
Is that worth an endlessly corrupt election?

1264
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
No, certainly not.

1265
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,240
Not with the Lions at Franklin's.

1266
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,300
Yeah, that's fair.

1267
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:24,440
So Alex is, I mean, what's really most important though is you guys gotta, you guys gotta hit

1268
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,560
that Google button.

1269
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:34,160
And we are having listeners today try to, I mean, BP is not even in the top 10 on Google

1270
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,040
and Yahoo trends.

1271
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,040
So we're trying to get the Obama deception done.

1272
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,880
Millions of people every day go to the front pages of these sites.

1273
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,840
They look at what the top stories are.

1274
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,660
You're able to drive it to the top.

1275
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:53,180
If you put the term, the Obama deception, the Obama deception, just go into Google and

1276
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,120
type the Obama deception in, hit enter.

1277
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,760
It'll bring up the results back out again, put your cursor on it, click it.

1278
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,320
So it's a new search and just keep reentering it.

1279
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
At least 15 times.

1280
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
It'll take you a couple of minutes.

1281
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,240
You don't have to type it in each time.

1282
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,400
After you type it in, you hit search, then you put your cursor in there, click it.

1283
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,800
So it thinks it's a new search or change one letter, you know, erase the end, put an end

1284
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,200
back on it, but it's easier just to that guy.

1285
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,540
Show them guys, guys, just show them how to Google, show them how to Google things repeatedly.

1286
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,320
Show them how to press the search button again.

1287
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1288
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:34,120
Because again, Alex is making this very clear that BP, the oil spill, should be number one.

1289
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,560
This is what we do about it.

1290
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,800
You can do that hundreds of times, it'll guaranteed go to the top.

1291
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:48,680
Now listen, many times I have had my videos already number one on the web and be the top

1292
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,380
search, and it gets millions of new people to see them.

1293
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:56,280
We're just artificially doing this here today, so there's not Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson.

1294
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,800
I mean, the BP oil spill isn't even in the top 10.

1295
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,360
That should be number one.

1296
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:05,120
You mean you really just summed it up when you were yelling over his last clip, which

1297
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,880
is if BP should be the number one trend, why are you doing this?

1298
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1299
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,400
Alex is doing this because he wants more traffic and more money to come into his business,

1300
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,440
but he also knows that admitting that would look really bad.

1301
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,280
He wants the outcome, but he doesn't want to have to ask for it, so he pretends that

1302
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,240
his motives are noble, and that he's actually incensed that Lindsay Lohan is getting more

1303
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,120
attention than the oil spill.

1304
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,840
In reality, Alex is pissed off that Lindsay Lohan is getting more attention than him,

1305
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,880
but being too obvious about it is bad for his branding, so he's pretending to be concerned

1306
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,080
about how many people are paying attention to the oil spill.

1307
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,320
I will say that- It's so transparent.

1308
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:47,240
Yeah, if you go back and listen to our coverage of the Obama deception, I will say that I

1309
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:53,660
completely lost my mind around the eight or nine hour mark, so were the last few minutes

1310
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:57,760
of the Obama deception about a BP oil spill that wasn't to happen for a couple years?

1311
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,760
I don't know.

1312
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,760
I don't think so.

1313
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,760
Okay.

1314
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:01,760
Certainly, no.

1315
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,760
Okay.

1316
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,960
So Alex is saying, get on there, type it in, hit enter.

1317
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,960
Sure.

1318
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,480
A caller has a better idea.

1319
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,480
Okay.

1320
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,120
For those people who sit down at the computer five or six times a day just to check their

1321
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,840
stuff and then they get up and leave, they're probably not going to think about doing the

1322
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,440
search for you.

1323
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,560
There are, however, really, really simple to use add-ons for just about any browser

1324
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,680
out there that can automatically do searches for them or refresh current searches that

1325
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,680
they have.

1326
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,720
Yeah, like Google will ask you, hey, do you want us to give you updates on this term?

1327
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,680
Yeah, that and extensions.

1328
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:49,760
Just for example, Google has one and I use it for this exact purpose called the reload

1329
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,760
every.

1330
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,760
No, that's Firefox.

1331
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:59,800
Firefox has one called reload every, and it can set up a refresh for you randomly or every

1332
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:05,200
one second or 10 seconds or 10 minutes or however often you want it to search for you.

1333
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,320
And I've read about this, that the mainstream media has these to push Lindsay Lohan and

1334
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,320
stuff.

1335
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,800
They're already doing this themselves.

1336
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,800
Correct.

1337
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:19,360
So this is a tool that info warriors and patriots who just leave their computers on, that they

1338
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,080
can install on their browsers that will help.

1339
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,560
Do me a favor, send me a list of those and I'm going to send it to Watson and ask him

1340
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,580
to do a blurb or I'll have Matt Ryan do it.

1341
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:32,440
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a list together of bots we can use to artificially

1342
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,840
inflate our traffic.

1343
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,840
Yeah.

1344
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:41,040
First, are you telling me that you want non-computer savvy people to start downloading add-ons

1345
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
to their browser?

1346
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,040
And bots?

1347
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,520
Generally speaking, that does not work well.

1348
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,520
No, no.

1349
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,080
Seems irresponsible.

1350
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:53,720
And yeah, this seems like we've- Second, they know what bot traffic looks

1351
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
like.

1352
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
Yeah.

1353
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,880
It is not hard to figure out.

1354
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,480
Also like you're on air.

1355
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,480
You're planning this scam on air.

1356
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,480
It's ridiculous.

1357
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,480
All right.

1358
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,640
We are going to go rob this bank and I know we are, we've already confirmed that we will

1359
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,640
be robbing this bank.

1360
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,640
How should we do it?

1361
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,480
Well, I will tell you this, we're going to have to walk away fast.

1362
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,480
Yes.

1363
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,480
Ring, ring.

1364
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,480
Oh, hello caller.

1365
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,480
Yeah, have you heard of cars?

1366
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,800
You can use them to get away.

1367
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,240
Do you want to drive for us?

1368
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:30,000
Do you specifically want to announce right now that you have committed to driving for

1369
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
us?

1370
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Very strange, very strange.

1371
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Not good.

1372
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Not good.

1373
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So Bob Chapman shows up.

1374
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Oh, great.

1375
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,720
He's a broadcaster, Bob Chapman.

1376
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,960
Yeah, the guy sucks.

1377
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,600
But it's not really all that interesting.

1378
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
He's boring even, Alex.

1379
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,840
I'm going to shock you this time.

1380
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,840
Don't buy gold.

1381
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
No.

1382
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,840
Nope.

1383
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,840
It's all about buying gold.

1384
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
Oh, I'm surprised.

1385
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:56,240
You can get a copy, a hard copy or an email copy or you can get a free one year subscription

1386
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,200
by getting a small gold coin.

1387
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,120
Yeah, the fifth of an ounce, Frank.

1388
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,120
Great deal.

1389
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,680
That's from Midas Resources offering that.

1390
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,420
So here's the point I want to make very clearly.

1391
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:15,040
If you're like sort of expert on the economy and the radio show host and the guy who syndicates

1392
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:20,480
the radio show who also runs a gold company are all intertwined in a bizarre business

1393
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,040
relationship, don't get involved.

1394
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,080
They might be untrustworthy.

1395
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:33,520
It might be that if the forecaster recommends buying the exact amount of gold that I sell

1396
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,480
– perhaps this is not a good –

1397
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,480
Yeah.

1398
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,560
And if the forecaster, like his business is doing a newsletter and you can get a free

1399
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:48,200
year of it if you buy gold from the guy whose business might be affected by the forecasts

1400
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,200
–

1401
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,840
Well, if the forecasts are rosy, maybe people might buy more gold.

1402
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,840
No, if they're not rosy, people buy more gold.

1403
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,560
No, I mean the forecast about gold.

1404
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,560
Yes.

1405
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,560
Yeah.

1406
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,560
He does forecast good things for gold.

1407
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,560
Usually.

1408
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,560
It's nonsense.

1409
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,080
It's very irresponsible.

1410
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,600
So you might have forgotten by now, but this was supposed to be about the Rockefeller document.

1411
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,120
I do remember that.

1412
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,320
So this is the last clip from the 16th.

1413
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,320
Okay.

1414
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,920
When I'm on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., I'm going to cover this in more detail, and I'm going

1415
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,520
to produce a special video this weekend for viral release that will be out by tomorrow

1416
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,200
that's going to deal with eugenics where I'm going to show you a bunch of food and

1417
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,080
their labels and the different poisons that are in them.

1418
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:35,080
But a key study that Aaron Dykes found, Rockefeller study, envisions food, future dictatorship

1419
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,520
controlled by the elite.

1420
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,680
And it gets into controlling food for the environment, total control, martial law, millions

1421
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:47,640
dead, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, biometric IDs to travel, to live.

1422
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,940
Read what these monsters are planning for you.

1423
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:55,120
And it's the same thing in hundreds of globalist documents like eco science.

1424
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,440
It's about food now?

1425
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,440
Mm-hmm.

1426
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,160
I don't know what's going on.

1427
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,920
So I heard that, and I was like, well, he's going to get into it on Sunday.

1428
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,800
So we better check in on Sunday while we're here.

1429
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,800
Okay.

1430
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,800
All right.

1431
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,920
So we're going to be covering also the July 18th, 2010 episode.

1432
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,200
Oh, God.

1433
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,640
I have to tell you this, Jordan.

1434
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,920
I got to warn you in advance.

1435
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,200
Alex comes in a little hot to the show on Sunday.

1436
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,200
Okay.

1437
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
He's got a head of steam.

1438
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,200
All right.

1439
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,200
All right.

1440
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,200
Let me at him.

1441
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,200
Let me at him.

1442
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,200
Let me at him.

1443
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,200
I am fired up today.

1444
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:33,440
I'm going to try to control myself throughout the next two hours.

1445
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:40,680
It is Sunday, the 18th day of July, 2010.

1446
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,040
We're here six days a week, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, back Sundays

1447
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,480
4 to 6 p.m.

1448
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,740
We have a lot of news.

1449
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:52,780
There's been a big truck bombing in Mexico, part of the drug war down there.

1450
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,760
They claim now that they're four days into a successful cap.

1451
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,320
I pray this is the truth.

1452
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,280
BP has lied in the past, but let's cross our fingers and say a prayer.

1453
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,720
These are the same headlines.

1454
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:10,240
And why are you still just waiting, seeing with BP?

1455
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,240
What is going on?

1456
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,240
What is happening?

1457
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,240
I don't know.

1458
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,240
Okay.

1459
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,240
It's very strange.

1460
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,240
All right.

1461
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,240
But these aren't the reasons Alex is mad.

1462
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,240
Sure.

1463
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,680
The reason he's mad is because the First Amendment is under attack.

1464
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,680
Oh, of course.

1465
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,200
I'm going to cover all the news today, but the attack on the First Amendment and free

1466
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,400
speech globally is numero uno, the cybersecurity takeover, the open announcements that they

1467
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,600
do want to censor the Web.

1468
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,080
Friday a listener pointed out the top searches were Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson and not

1469
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,120
even the BP oil spill.

1470
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,860
And I pointed out that in the past, my films like Endgame, Terrorstorm, The Obama Deception

1471
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:46,880
have been the number one search on the Web.

1472
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,260
Just that made a lot more sense than it being Lindsay Lohan or the top search should be

1473
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,480
depression because we're going into one.

1474
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,880
So I said, why don't our users go out and Google the term The Obama Deception to make

1475
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,360
it number one?

1476
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:03,280
And Friday and Saturday it was number one, more than 20 newspapers and blogs wrote big

1477
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,480
reviews of The Obama Deception, even though it's been out for a year and a half.

1478
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:11,700
There are hundreds of versions of it up on YouTube and Google and other video sites,

1479
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,140
but there was one version on a director's channel.

1480
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,140
We don't have a director's channel.

1481
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:19,600
That was only allowed at the beginning of YouTube and six years ago and people that

1482
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,600
have them still have them.

1483
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,400
And so there are several director channels that have posted it all in one part, not broken

1484
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,920
up in 10 parts.

1485
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:36,180
And the video had gotten 6.5 million views or it had 6,400,000 and change Friday.

1486
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:44,320
By Saturday it had gotten 100,000 additional, well above 6.5 million, about to be 6.6 million.

1487
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,320
Well that's well above 6.4 million.

1488
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,600
And at that trend I've learned to be able to gauge YouTube, it probably would have had

1489
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,680
another million views in a week or so because it was the number one search term.

1490
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:59,800
People did a great job getting that out there, but more importantly, in the last few months

1491
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:04,880
if you search the term Barack Obama or Obama or President Obama, not the number three link

1492
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,920
had been like that for a year, the number one link on the world wide web on Google and

1493
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:14,680
Yahoo was The Obama Deception and a link to that mega viral video with 6.5 million views

1494
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,680
and growing.

1495
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:23,240
No fucking way, no fucking way was the first link if you search for Obama, Alex's video.

1496
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,680
Absolutely not.

1497
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:31,920
If that is the case, it's only on Alex's browser based on his searches.

1498
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,840
I don't know, I don't believe any of this, but it worked apparently.

1499
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,920
Alex's plan worked, he got more traffic.

1500
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,880
I would like to know more about the people who posted reviews.

1501
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,520
I could only find one or two.

1502
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,640
That doesn't surprise me.

1503
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,640
And they weren't complimentary.

1504
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,680
That also doesn't surprise me.

1505
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:56,760
I would like to have an examination from a film student on that movie.

1506
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:04,440
So not all news is rosy, I mean we got definitely more traffic, the plan paid off, we got the

1507
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:11,880
money and ran, but unfortunately the feds might be on to them.

1508
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:17,080
School kids type it in for a school report, college professors, politicians, news people,

1509
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,080
whatever.

1510
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,120
You type Obama or President Obama or Barack Obama and it was the number one link.

1511
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:29,440
It was hacked and it was taken down off the director channel and it shows done by user.

1512
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440
That's what a hack is.

1513
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,000
They go in and once it's deleted, it's gone.

1514
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,160
The 6.5 million views is gone.

1515
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,800
All the tens of thousands of websites that are linked to that video, it's a dead link

1516
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,000
now.

1517
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,560
And so of course, now when you type in Obama, it's the Obama girl or the White House, it's

1518
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,820
not our video.

1519
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,600
So that's why the establishment did this.

1520
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,440
I have no doubt that it's an inside job from YouTube or Google, one of their employees.

1521
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:57,200
I mean this thing was number one, they were panicking and remember this was the YouTube

1522
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,200
presidency.

1523
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,480
I mean you go to the White House YouTube site, their videos get like a thousand viewers.

1524
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,760
My average video gets about a half mil.

1525
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,440
And so they're concerned about this and this is sabotage, this is criminal, but we're not

1526
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,920
going to just lay here and take it.

1527
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:15,840
We come back, I've got a battle plan, a mission for you, if you choose to accept it, we'll

1528
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,840
kick their ass.

1529
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,240
Google my name more!

1530
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,360
Yeah, as soon as I heard that, my first thought was, what do you want to bet that his plan

1531
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:26,320
to deal with this fiasco somehow involves the audience doing more free advertising?

1532
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,760
Yeah, yeah, I would probably argue that.

1533
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,860
We'll see if that's the case.

1534
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:38,200
So apparently, according to Alex, this website, this user's channel on YouTube got hacked

1535
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,840
and they took down this and it must be an inside job.

1536
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,240
It has to be an inside job.

1537
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:49,840
Partially inspired by how jealous Obama is of how many views Alex gets.

1538
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,760
Yeah, yep, yep, Obama, Obama.

1539
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,760
President.

1540
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,760
President Barack Obama.

1541
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,760
Right.

1542
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,800
The most well-known man on the planet.

1543
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,800
Uh-huh.

1544
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,800
Yep.

1545
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,800
Jealous!

1546
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,800
Widely, widely respected.

1547
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,400
Jealous of Alex's star power.

1548
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,400
Uh-huh.

1549
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,400
His reach.

1550
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,400
Yep.

1551
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,400
Oh, boy.

1552
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,600
Yeah, man, it's like people who get petty over download numbers, you know, or like YouTube

1553
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,600
views.

1554
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,560
Alex and Obama were beefing.

1555
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,480
They had the White House YouTube channel and they weren't getting the same kind of traffic

1556
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,440
that Alex was getting, so they're like, we gotta take him out, we gotta take him out.

1557
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,800
I mean, I would say they thoroughly fucked up healthcare at this point, so maybe Obama

1558
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,200
was like, look, I just gotta focus on anything else.

1559
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,480
I can't believe I bungled this one, too.

1560
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,760
Yeah, exactly.

1561
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,880
So we'll get into this as we go along, but I want to get out in front of this in advance.

1562
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,020
I don't believe that this even happened.

1563
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:50,060
The most I believe is that there was a temporary tech glitch or something that's being blown

1564
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:54,920
out of proportion, or conversely, I could believe that this is all made up.

1565
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,040
Here are my reasons for having that position.

1566
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:02,800
One, the video Alex is referring to on the Change the Channel YouTube channel is still

1567
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,780
up and active in the year of Our Lord 2021.

1568
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,220
That's an issue for me.

1569
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:11,640
It still has the original publishing date, it didn't lose its view count, nor did any

1570
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,840
of the comments disappear.

1571
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,920
There's over 200,000 comments on it, so I couldn't go through all of them, but I was

1572
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,960
able to find some from the time period of around 10 years ago, and none are saying,

1573
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,520
hey, so glad to see this got put back up or anything.

1574
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1575
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,920
The 200,000 comments thing, too, also is because there have been a couple people who have been

1576
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:35,920
having a running argument for the last couple months in the comments, and it's not even

1577
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,960
replies to comments, it's just individual comments that are responding to each other.

1578
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,480
It's impossible to navigate, and they both sound stupid.

1579
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,480
What a bunch of assholes.

1580
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:50,280
So two, I was able to find some blogs covering the alleged takedown of this video, and none

1581
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,480
of them can actually confirm that the video was taken down.

1582
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:58,440
All of them rely entirely on claims that trace back to Alex himself, which seems sketchy.

1583
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:03,080
Well, it just so happens that the evidence that Alex had, he lost, and the people who

1584
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,640
could have confirmed it, they were already dead.

1585
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,800
I'm sorry, Dan, it's true.

1586
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,520
Three, I was able to find a forum thread on GameSpot about the claims that the video was

1587
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,520
taken down as an attempt to silence Alex, and some of the posts are a little interesting.

1588
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,860
The angry pelican comments, quote, I'm watching that video right now on YouTube.

1589
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,360
It's not deleted.

1590
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,320
Another user chimed in, quote, I have it on in the background, that KRS-One guy has a

1591
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,320
good analogy.

1592
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:34,300
There seems to be a lot of people who are confused that the link that was posted to

1593
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:39,360
a supposedly deleted video page is in fact delivering them to a page that began playing

1594
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,960
a shitty documentary about Obama.

1595
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,240
So I believe that this is a continuation of the traffic bomb Alex began on his Friday

1596
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:50,160
show, which he's now heightening on Sunday.

1597
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,720
I can't say for certain that the video didn't have an error loading or something like that

1598
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:59,060
at some point, but there's literally no part of my being that believes that hackers got

1599
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,640
into a YouTube account and took down the Obama deception.

1600
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,520
It's almost the most unbelievable thing I can imagine.

1601
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,240
Well, look, now, Alex can prove it.

1602
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:14,480
See, when he went to YouTube, the page opened up and it said you have internet connectivity

1603
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,800
issues, which clearly means that the YouTube page was taken down.

1604
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,800
Obviously.

1605
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,800
Sure.

1606
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,320
If you get if you get that kind of message, there's only one explanation.

1607
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,360
So this is a federal crime.

1608
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:34,160
When you type the name Obama or President Obama or Barack Obama in, it was the number

1609
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:38,540
one link on Google and Yahoo.

1610
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,360
That was before we had listeners promote the term the Obama deception to make it the number

1611
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,520
one trend search Friday and Saturday.

1612
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:50,120
A whole bunch of newspapers reported on the film Saturday someone hacked into the director's

1613
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:54,920
channel, probably YouTube themselves, and deleted that film.

1614
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,960
The Obama deception and my newest film, Police State for the Rise of FEMA.

1615
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,860
Luckily, we were Twitter about it by my listeners and we're able to call the director who runs

1616
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:08,560
the director channel to get him inside there to change the passcode before they took all

1617
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,600
the videos down.

1618
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,140
The point is, this is a serious federal crime.

1619
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,400
The point is, this is a hack against this film.

1620
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,440
This is an attack against everyone's free speech.

1621
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,980
This is all bullshit.

1622
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:23,160
But the other thing that I want to say, you don't want to take a little time to say this,

1623
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,840
is that if YouTube had deleted the video, which I don't believe they did, I think they

1624
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,080
would have been within their rights to do so.

1625
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,080
Well.

1626
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,400
Alex is clearly engaging in manipulative practices to artificially game their system.

1627
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,360
He's openly discussing that as his plan.

1628
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:42,440
There's even been conversation on a radio show of groups of people using bots to boost

1629
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,000
Alex's view count.

1630
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,320
I could easily see an argument being made that this is an abuse of the platform and

1631
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,360
against the terms of service.

1632
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,160
That said, YouTube didn't delete this video and there was no hack.

1633
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,900
I just wanted to point out that even if this was real, I still wouldn't care.

1634
01:20:55,900 --> 01:21:02,080
It is a federal crime for YouTube to enforce its terms of service policies, Dan.

1635
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,080
That's true.

1636
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,080
Yep.

1637
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,640
So Alex shot a video the night before.

1638
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:10,800
On Saturday night, he, this is so serious that he had to shoot a video talking about

1639
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,640
how this video got taken down.

1640
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,440
Is he going to talk about how people should Google bomb in the video about how people

1641
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,440
should Google bomb?

1642
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,440
No, no, no.

1643
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,440
This is so much more important.

1644
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,760
This is about an assault on free speech.

1645
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:27,660
My friends, there has been an assault on the first amendment and free speech.

1646
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:32,600
The Obama deception has been erased, obliterated, censored, put into the memory hole.

1647
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,600
Oh no.

1648
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Why is this important?

1649
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:39,120
Obama deals with the first amendment and free speech, but this hack was illegal.

1650
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:46,800
These people legal hacks and somehow got our passcode and deleted this film and other documentaries

1651
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,840
I've made so that you don't have a right to watch it and make up your own mind.

1652
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,960
So you don't have the right to watch it.

1653
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,960
They're taking away your rights.

1654
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,960
All right.

1655
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,680
So it still hasn't been taken down though.

1656
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,160
No, it's still up.

1657
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,160
Yeah.

1658
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,160
That's an issue.

1659
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,160
You can still watch it now.

1660
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,160
The present day is a problem.

1661
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,160
Yeah.

1662
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,000
And this was so funny.

1663
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,400
Alex describes what it was like to experience this hack.

1664
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,040
This is still from the video from the night before.

1665
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,040
And I got-

1666
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,640
It's not his YouTube channel though, right?

1667
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,960
No, it's another guy.

1668
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,960
It's another guy.

1669
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,400
But they work together apparently.

1670
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,400
Oh, okay.

1671
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,080
But there's some sort of a working relationship.

1672
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,080
All right.

1673
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:28,560
And I got to say, this is where things reached a level of like bad movie slash farce.

1674
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,400
Luckily, one of my webmasters happened to be writing a story about the fact that the

1675
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:38,200
Obama deception was getting hundreds of thousands of views a day and was the number one trend

1676
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,540
being searched on major search engines.

1677
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:45,960
So within 15 minutes of him being removed, we were getting Twitter pings telling us it

1678
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,960
was down.

1679
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,120
So I called the director's channel who we work with and I said, hey, your site's being

1680
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,120
hacked.

1681
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:57,120
He drove in from a barbecue he was at, went in within an hour of this starting and was

1682
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:04,360
watching someone live in the interface, deleting my films, deleting police day for the rise

1683
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:09,080
of FEMA and the Obama deception, and thank God we could change the passcode before it

1684
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,080
continued.

1685
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,920
Saw a little guy creeping around inside the YouTube account.

1686
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,120
There's the little gremlin that steals videos.

1687
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,600
I see him.

1688
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:24,120
He was eating the video, but he hadn't quite finished eating it yet.

1689
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,120
Oh boy.

1690
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,120
Yep.

1691
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,120
Hmm.

1692
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,120
That's something.

1693
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,120
That's good days.

1694
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,120
Yeah.

1695
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,120
That's good days.

1696
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,120
That's another, that's actually reason four.

1697
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,840
I don't believe that happened, but I didn't want to spoil the fun.

1698
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,460
So Alex has said that he has a way to fight back.

1699
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:44,560
And so in this report that he's playing, he has the solution.

1700
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,560
Here's the good news.

1701
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,080
We can fight back.

1702
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,760
And the destiny of this documentary is now in your hands.

1703
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,440
You can do several things.

1704
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:56,360
Number one, go find the links on YouTube, Google, and other sites where the video is

1705
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:02,240
still posted and send that link out to everyone and tell them, this is a censored film.

1706
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,620
This is a film that the establishment doesn't want you to see.

1707
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:10,040
This is a number one film that was deleted sensors.

1708
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:16,480
These criminals, these 21st century book burners, every time they attack freedom of speech and

1709
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:21,260
creativity and expression that the American people and the people of the world are going

1710
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:28,060
to strike back, send the links to the Obama deception out to everyone, you know, and go

1711
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:33,420
to Google and Yahoo and other major search engines and the Obama deception every day

1712
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:38,300
when you first log into your computer and let's keep it at the top of the trends chart.

1713
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,820
Let's make it the number one search term in the world that it was.

1714
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:48,000
Let's have the Obama deception rise from the ashes like a Phoenix carrying the light of

1715
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,940
liberty and freedom.

1716
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:53,000
It is up to all of you to carry this torch forward.

1717
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Wow.

1718
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Wow.

1719
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,400
Can I throw a baseball back in time?

1720
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,960
I don't know.

1721
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,680
Do I have the arm strength for that?

1722
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,680
I don't think so.

1723
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,440
I can reach 88 miles an hour.

1724
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,840
I know that for a fact.

1725
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,360
So you can see how Alex is doing the exact same thing here as he did on Friday, just

1726
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,120
super heightened.

1727
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:15,080
He's created a fake problem and he's made it emotionally resonant to the audience and

1728
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,660
then he's made sure that they know the only way for them to really fight back is to do

1729
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:22,500
more free promotional work for Alex and his websites.

1730
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,400
Instead of appealing to the audience's understandable feeling that the oil spill was more important

1731
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,220
than celebrity news, then co-opting that for his own benefit, this time Alex has made the

1732
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:37,120
supposed deleting of his videos into an attack on the audience themselves and freedom.

1733
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,480
This is psychopath level shit.

1734
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1735
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,720
So what you're saying is that you've manufactured this lie about the video being taken down

1736
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:55,040
in order to convince your listeners to, one, share other versions of the same video, which

1737
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,040
if the video were censored, Dan.

1738
01:25:58,040 --> 01:25:59,040
Right.

1739
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,040
Well, it's censored on that one that had all the views.

1740
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,040
Uh-huh.

1741
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,040
Yeah.

1742
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:11,620
So we need to pump up the other views on the other ones, which if that is the point, those

1743
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:14,440
will be taken down in the same way.

1744
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,440
Right.

1745
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:16,440
Yep.

1746
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,440
And then we'll do it again.

1747
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,440
All right.

1748
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,440
Yep.

1749
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,440
Okay.

1750
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:26,960
So I remember hearing pretty regularly that the reason that Alex was embarking on this

1751
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,640
was because he was offended that BP was not higher up on the trends, because that's an

1752
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,680
important story, whereas Lindsay Lohan and Val Gibson, not important.

1753
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,200
I think we may have lost sight of that particular detail.

1754
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,200
No, we didn't.

1755
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,200
Oh, okay.

1756
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,280
No, but Alex is about to turn heel on BP.

1757
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,280
Okay.

1758
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:49,800
The establishment could not put up Friday and Saturday with the number one search trend

1759
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:57,680
in the world, not being Lindsay Lohan or Mel Gibson or BP oil spill.

1760
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:02,840
It was the Obama deception because of all of you out there getting the word out.

1761
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:08,280
And the video that was the top link, and this has been going on for at least a month, when

1762
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,620
you type in the name Obama and any variation thereof was this film.

1763
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:18,480
So now BP oil spill is an example of something that the globalists wanted to trend over Alex,

1764
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,960
as opposed to the reason he's doing this.

1765
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,960
Uh-huh.

1766
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:22,960
Uh-huh.

1767
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:23,960
This is silly.

1768
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:24,960
It's slippery.

1769
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,600
He literally was saying that BP should be the top trend.

1770
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,560
It should be the number one over Lindsay Lohan, and the problem with these globalists is they're

1771
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:35,720
trying to make it number one over things like Lindsay Lohan and me.

1772
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,720
Yeah.

1773
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,720
Terrible.

1774
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,720
Awful.

1775
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,720
This is outrageous.

1776
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:44,280
The leadership of the highest order that they're trying to make BP the number one story, Dan.

1777
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:49,240
Which I was advocating for yesterday in order to justify making me the number one.

1778
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,560
But now it's not about that.

1779
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,560
It's bigger than that.

1780
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,760
It's about me now.

1781
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,520
So we're back to the regular show, not the video you'd shot the night before.

1782
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:03,840
And this is where I think I would say this reaches its natural conclusion.

1783
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,340
These censors aren't going to have their way, but let's not stop there.

1784
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:12,840
Let's make the second search in case they've blacklisted and blacked out the entire term,

1785
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,840
Obama deception.

1786
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:21,280
In case these McCarthy-ites have done that, I want you to search the term infowars.com.

1787
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:27,160
No www in front of it, just infowars.com, and just type it into your search engine over

1788
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,560
and over again, and we'll see how they like it.

1789
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,960
Yeah, we'll see how they like it.

1790
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:33,960
This is naked.

1791
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,720
Lying, manipulative piece of shit.

1792
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,720
What?

1793
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:42,640
How can you listen to that and not go, fuck you?

1794
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,680
It's the kind of thing that I see.

1795
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:49,960
I'm offended by how manipulative it is, and how if you were someone who took him seriously,

1796
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:54,320
this would be a really tough thing to experience, because it's all fake.

1797
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:59,680
But looking at it now from a ten years later perspective, it's hard not to laugh at how

1798
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:07,400
embarrassingly clear this is of a charade he's putting on in order to try and gain more

1799
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,400
traffic.

1800
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:13,560
Yeah, it would probably not work if you just said, hey guys, I would like you to artificially

1801
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,280
inflate my traffic so I can become more well-known.

1802
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,240
No, but if you put on a pageant.

1803
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:24,800
Oh, it's the government and the BPs and the lockstep and all of this stuff.

1804
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,160
Look, celebrities are trending when it should be serious stories like BP, and so what we

1805
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:36,160
need to do is we need to get my documentary about Obama to be the number one, so we do

1806
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:43,440
that and then we pretend that it gets censored and now we're angry, so we do it more.

1807
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,240
Then why didn't it work the first time?

1808
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,240
I buy a new house.

1809
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,840
Why didn't it work the first time?

1810
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,960
So Alex now gets to what I would describe as the yelling phase.

1811
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,320
I would like a gremlin to eat up all of his shows.

1812
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,400
Now listen, I've made the film.

1813
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,400
On the level playing field of ideas, I won the Super Bowl.

1814
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,440
I kicked their hand in.

1815
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,080
I sat up here and didn't visit with my children for months.

1816
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:14,960
I worked seven days a week to make this documentary and fly all over the country and spend hundreds

1817
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,240
of thousands of dollars to make it, and I gave it to you for free, and I kicked their

1818
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,240
butt.

1819
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,240
And now I need you to pay for it.

1820
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:27,560
I need you to pay for it, take an action with it, and these scumbags don't like it.

1821
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:33,080
Google tells me I can't sell a t-shirt with his stinkin' image on it.

1822
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:36,560
They tell me I can't sell this video, and I put up with it.

1823
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,120
We wrote an article about it six months ago, but left it at that, and now they won't even

1824
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:45,400
let me give it out for free when they put their stinkin' ads on it, and I know they're

1825
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,680
the ones that get it.

1826
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,040
I think the problem with the t-shirt was like a copyright thing.

1827
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1828
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,040
Um.

1829
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,040
Because he steals just about everything.

1830
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,560
And he doesn't seem to understand.

1831
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,920
For someone who's really into property rights, intellectual property seems to be a complicated

1832
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,920
pickle.

1833
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,080
Not interested, though.

1834
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,360
Intellectual is in the name, so not interested.

1835
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:12,560
Yeah, so he spends a little bit of time freaking out and yelling, and like, I was blown away

1836
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,920
listening to this, like how clear it is that it's just like, everything is driving towards

1837
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,920
just like self-promotion.

1838
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,800
I need all of you to be my street team.

1839
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,800
I need you to do this.

1840
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:24,800
Yep.

1841
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,920
They let Obama and the Globalist and BP and all of them spew their propaganda on the web,

1842
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,840
but I can't put my films out.

1843
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,880
And they didn't even make up some hanky-panky, because every time they file false complaints

1844
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,200
against me, I just file in federal court.

1845
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,880
You know behind the scenes I've had to file in federal court no fewer than eight times

1846
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:48,100
in the last year and a half to keep that stinkin' video up for you?

1847
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:52,520
You know I've had to go in there and file against false copyright claims and tell people

1848
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,280
put up or shut up, let's go to court.

1849
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,280
Maybe real ones.

1850
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,880
I've had to file in federal court so you can see what Barack Obama really is.

1851
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,380
I am busting my butt here to bring you this information, and I'm not complaining.

1852
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,960
My family and my children in this country are worth it.

1853
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:11,800
I'm not gonna be a slave to a bunch of authoritarians, and this is authoritarian tyranny that this

1854
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,280
country's going into.

1855
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,280
And I know you understand that, and you're upset out there as listeners, so I'm gonna

1856
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,560
beg you on my knees for all of our future.

1857
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,520
Don't say it.

1858
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:25,960
We caught them inside the interface deleting videos one after the other, and they weren't

1859
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:30,800
able to get downfall the Republican, that director's account, two million views.

1860
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,000
I want you, because that's basically part two of the Obama deception, and quite frankly

1861
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,360
is even more powerful film, though this is the mega-viral.

1862
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:43,000
I want you to get that video, I mean here's the homework if you choose to take this mission.

1863
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,560
Search into the term over and over again, Obama Deception Censored.

1864
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:52,520
Search the term Infowars.com, and search the term Fall of the Republic.

1865
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,800
Fall of the Republic.

1866
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,480
Yeah, so now he's promoting the sequel.

1867
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,640
Oh man.

1868
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,960
Oh boy.

1869
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,220
Is this how movies should advertise from here on out?

1870
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:11,280
Should we have more movies just being like, listen, this movie is coming out on January

1871
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,120
21st, and you are going to love it.

1872
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:19,480
But they don't want you to see it on January 21st, so what you all need to do to see this

1873
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:25,400
movie is Google the name of this movie, and January 21st, because they're censoring it.

1874
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,400
Or something.

1875
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,120
I think it's an unethical ad campaign.

1876
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:35,400
I don't know if it would be effective outside the context of a very trapped audience like

1877
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,520
Alex has, but, hmm.

1878
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,560
Isn't that what happened with the Snyder Cut or whatever?

1879
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,960
I choose not to know anything about that.

1880
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:44,960
That's smart.

1881
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,960
Me neither.

1882
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,960
I just know the words Snyder Cut.

1883
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,400
I've seen it mentioned a couple times, and each time I'm like, I'm gonna go the other

1884
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,400
way.

1885
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,400
I just don't need any of that.

1886
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,400
I know, I just like, uh, yeah.

1887
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,040
So they took this down, right?

1888
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,080
This documentary.

1889
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,200
They have not proven that.

1890
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,200
No.

1891
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,200
I don't believe it either.

1892
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:03,280
But they did it in order to keep it from you, because they're afraid.

1893
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,520
I understand these trends.

1894
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,920
It would have gotten a million in the next week, probably two million the next week.

1895
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,680
They know we hit the zeitgeist.

1896
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:14,760
They know we caused a chain reaction, and they went in, and they shut this video down

1897
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,240
so you don't have access to it, and so you don't have a right to see it.

1898
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,060
They're gonna decide what you get to see.

1899
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:25,620
This is 21st century book burning, and then I've got stacks of news right here in front

1900
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:26,620
of me.

1901
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,620
I mean, here's one.

1902
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,920
Feds Ignore Due Process, First Amendment, shut down thousands of blogs.

1903
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,440
That should be the number one story.

1904
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,440
3,000 blogs were shut down last week.

1905
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:39,760
No judge, no jury, no nothing.

1906
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:46,000
Vice President Biden and intellectual property enforcement coordinator Victoria Espinel gave

1907
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,800
an order, and they've got quotes here.

1908
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,360
The DMC takedown actions were a direct violation of the First Amendment under prior restraint,

1909
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,560
however, explains law professor Wendy Seltzer.

1910
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:02,480
Because the DMC takedowns are privately administered through ISPs, they have not received constitutional

1911
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,240
scrutiny despite the high risk of error, Seltzer adds.

1912
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:17,040
So this is the White House now issuing 73,000 takedown orders this week, mainly of blogs

1913
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:20,080
critical of Barack Hussein Obama.

1914
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:25,760
So Alex is talking about the blog platform Blogotry here, and there were some initial

1915
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:31,560
theories that people were kicking around that the platform was taken down due to DMCA complaints,

1916
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,860
but that was just purely speculation.

1917
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:37,820
It came out a couple days later that the reason that the server that housed Blogotry kicked

1918
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:43,500
it off and thus removed 73,000 or so blogs was that someone was using the server to host

1919
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:49,200
an Al-Qaeda recruitment website, complete with a hit list and instructions on bomb making.

1920
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:54,020
Blogotry was hosted on server's own by Burst.net, who got contacted by the FBI regarding this

1921
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:58,060
terrorism stuff, and they decided to stop working with Blogotry.

1922
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:02,560
Apparently there had been some past terms of service violations that are unspecified,

1923
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,480
so they must have just decided that if they were allowing an Al-Qaeda site to stay up,

1924
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,800
they may represent too much of a risk to stay on the servers.

1925
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,900
Yeah, that's probably smart.

1926
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:16,880
I'm not sure in the end what happened with all this, but as of July 21st, 2010, there

1927
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:22,000
was an article on CNET about Burst.net's efforts to try to get the data from people's blogs

1928
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,440
back to them, so they could have their blog, but they would not re-host Blogotry, so the

1929
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,920
users would just have to find another platform to use.

1930
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,560
You shouldn't lose all of your content or whatever, yeah.

1931
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,240
And I think that to the extent that that was possible, they were saying that they were

1932
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,920
going to find a way to make that happen.

1933
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:39,920
Sure.

1934
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,400
There's no indication that any of these affected blogs were critical of Obama, or if any were,

1935
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,880
that it had anything to do with these actions.

1936
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,120
Alex is just making that up, because it's a concurrent headline that can be used to

1937
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:53,000
strengthen his Obama deception censorship pageant.

1938
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:59,260
They are taking down 73,000 blogs, and no one's talking about it, which is why you need

1939
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:03,160
to Google the Obama deception right now.

1940
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:08,340
Also to be clear, that stuff about Biden and Victoria Espinal, that was an unrelated story

1941
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:13,960
from June, where there was discussion about the massive economic costs of copyright infringement.

1942
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:17,560
The Infowars story about the blogs being removed just kind of assumes that the reason that

1943
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:22,600
they got taken down was copyright violations, so the whole angle is that, but it's not true.

1944
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:27,400
And also, you can just tell, Alex is like, he doesn't even know how the story on Infowars

1945
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,400
fits together.

1946
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,400
Yeah.

1947
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,120
He's just finding bits and pieces of it, and reading it.

1948
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,120
Yeah, he's playing Mad Libs.

1949
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,120
Yeah.

1950
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:37,480
And using it in a way to justify whatever the story already is.

1951
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,480
Yeah.

1952
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,480
So look.

1953
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,480
What?

1954
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,480
The internet.

1955
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,480
They're doing some censoring.

1956
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,480
Sure.

1957
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,400
But you know what would be hard to censor?

1958
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,400
The internet?

1959
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,400
The real world.

1960
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,400
Oh.

1961
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,400
Don't let them stop you.

1962
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,400
Go low tech.

1963
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,520
Get free links to it online, but also buy the high quality DVD with the expanded extras,

1964
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,080
and make copies of this.

1965
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:00,880
I mean, making 100 copies of this might cost you 50 bucks.

1966
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,800
And give it out to everybody you know.

1967
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,560
Air it on Access Television.

1968
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,040
Show it to your local church.

1969
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:10,000
Tell everybody you know the system doesn't want you to see the Obama deception.

1970
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,320
Now this is the most viral film I've ever released, but this was part two, Fall of the

1971
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,320
Republic.

1972
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,440
Ooh, we got part two here.

1973
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:21,440
This is absolutely 100% televangelist shit.

1974
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,440
That is fucking...

1975
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,440
Yeah.

1976
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,520
Oh, yes, it may cost you a little bit of money, but you need to know that this is about the

1977
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:29,520
law.

1978
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,520
You can spread the word.

1979
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,520
You need to get this out.

1980
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,520
Spread the good word.

1981
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,520
You need to make sure that you are converting people to the word of Christ.

1982
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,520
Yeah.

1983
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,680
This next clip is a little jarring.

1984
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,680
I found his switch in tone a little bit weird.

1985
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,240
They can't arrest all of us.

1986
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,320
It's over.

1987
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,320
It's over.

1988
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,440
We're done.

1989
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,120
We're done rolling over.

1990
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,960
We're done giving in.

1991
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:54,560
I've got a deal right now on Infowars.com, and you click on both the shopping carts.

1992
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,840
We've got two different shopping carts, whatever your choice is, where you can get four films

1993
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,040
for $19.95.

1994
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,520
I don't even make money on that because I put a free pocket constitution in every order.

1995
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:08,480
Okay, with the cost of the film and everything else, that comes out to less than $5 per film.

1996
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,200
If you get 10 films, it's $39.95.

1997
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,200
That's very weird.

1998
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,200
Wow.

1999
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,200
That's...

2000
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,200
It's over.

2001
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,200
It's over.

2002
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,200
It's done.

2003
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,200
It's fucking done.

2004
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:23,440
We're all dead, and there's two for one sales right now.

2005
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,440
I got a deal.

2006
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,440
I got a deal, baby.

2007
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,440
Yeah.

2008
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,440
Oh, man.

2009
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:32,440
So, Alex throws to break really, really passionate.

2010
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:36,960
He's freaking me out a little bit, but the underlying message here is that the only thing

2011
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:44,240
you need to do to break the will of the NWO, to destroy them, is support Alex's stuff and

2012
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,240
give him free publicity.

2013
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,520
That sounds right.

2014
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:51,320
You print up an image of Obama as the Joker, and you say, Google Obama deception, and you

2015
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:57,320
never stop, and you let these Nazi bloodsucking anti-American parasites that want to make

2016
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:04,520
you and your family slaves know that we are standing up against them, and we are red-blooded,

2017
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:08,840
and we are not slaves, and we are not bowing down to them.

2018
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,840
I'm not bowing down.

2019
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,320
I'm at the tip of the spear.

2020
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:14,480
I get death threats every day, and you know what?

2021
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,240
I am honored to be who I am.

2022
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:20,520
I'm honored to just be an average person that stood up 15 years ago and said, I'm going

2023
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,520
to defend the Republic.

2024
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,240
I'm going to defend the family.

2025
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,760
I'm going to defend the Second Amendment.

2026
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,320
I'm going to fight against abortion.

2027
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,360
I'm going to see what happens when I really take action, and we have laid waste to the

2028
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,360
enemy.

2029
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,960
If you simply unloose yourselves and become the leaders you are, we will sweep this scum

2030
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:36,960
into the gutter.

2031
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,120
We will defeat the New World Order.

2032
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,120
We will crush the tyranny.

2033
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,640
Second hour, straight ahead, stay with us!

2034
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,640
Oof.

2035
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,640
Oh, boy.

2036
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,640
Yeah.

2037
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,640
Oh, man.

2038
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:49,640
Yeah.

2039
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,640
That was a little much.

2040
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,640
Oh, boy.

2041
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:55,960
It sounds like on Thursday, a producer was like, uh, Alex, we are, look, DVD sales have

2042
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,960
gone way down.

2043
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,960
Yeah.

2044
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:58,960
Way down.

2045
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,960
Yeah.

2046
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:03,400
And then you can hear, this is like, this is like after a comic has been on the road

2047
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:09,160
for a year, and they bought 200 t-shirts, and they got 190 in the box.

2048
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,160
Yep.

2049
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:11,160
And they're like, I'm going to get a bath on this printing.

2050
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,440
Yeah, this was a bad idea.

2051
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:15,000
You know, I can't give these away.

2052
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Yeah.

2053
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,920
Well, we better turn your family's continued existence into something that's conditional

2054
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:23,920
on buying this shirt.

2055
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,320
That'll get this shirt out.

2056
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,320
Yep.

2057
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,320
Yeah.

2058
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:29,700
So, oh, God, just more of this.

2059
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:31,440
The globalists tapped my phones, folks.

2060
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:32,900
They know I'm real.

2061
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,240
They know what we're doing is effective.

2062
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:38,880
They have all these statistics, and I never really get up here and toot my horn.

2063
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,880
And I just tell you, we're having a big effect, folks.

2064
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:41,880
We're having a big effect.

2065
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:42,880
We're having a big effect.

2066
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,280
And now they've gone in and hacked and taken down my film, The Obama Deception, the one

2067
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,360
that had the biggest views and was the top link under the name Obama when you searched

2068
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,360
his name.

2069
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,700
You think the White House liked when they searched the name Barack Obama or President

2070
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:59,300
Obama or Obama, that a video exposing him as a traitorous globalist was the number one

2071
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:03,560
link in the last month or the number one search term in the last two days?

2072
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,200
Let's not let them stop us.

2073
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:09,000
Let's search the term, Fall of the Republic, my newest film on the globalist.

2074
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,680
Let's search the term Police State for the Rise of FEMA that they also erased, Police

2075
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:13,940
State for the Rise of FEMA.

2076
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:16,020
Let's search the term Infowars.com.

2077
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:19,240
Let's jam them all into there so we can't be stopped.

2078
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,300
Stuart, Antonio, John, Mark, Doug, Jared, we're going to get to all of you.

2079
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:23,440
It doesn't end.

2080
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:24,640
It just keeps going.

2081
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:31,740
This entire show is more or less just doubling down on this spamming organization.

2082
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:39,620
We need to organize against Obama's policies and I don't know what any of them are and

2083
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:44,600
sure we're about to take control of the Senate because the Democratic Party is shit, but

2084
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:49,360
I'm going to have to say the only way to stop him is to make him feel bad when he Googles

2085
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,760
his own name.

2086
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,920
In my imagination.

2087
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:59,000
So Alex takes a call from a guy and he's trying to pump him up about doing free street teamwork

2088
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,360
for him.

2089
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:04,480
We're hitting everybody right now is a test because the bottom fell out of Obama.

2090
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:07,120
He is their front man, their messianic savior.

2091
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:11,120
He was supposed to bring us into the world government and it isn't working, is it?

2092
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:12,340
So we ought to be happy.

2093
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:15,680
We ought to be happy and it just lets me know the effect we're having.

2094
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,760
So what are we going to do about it, Antonio?

2095
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,560
Are you going to fight in?

2096
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:22,840
Are you going to send everybody the links to the Obama deceptions that are still online?

2097
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,800
Are you going to make copies of the DVDs?

2098
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,240
Are you going to go and search the term Infowars.com to drive it into the top of the trends?

2099
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:32,280
Yeah, they're only making us mad to do it more.

2100
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,440
Antonio, great job.

2101
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:35,440
Anything else?

2102
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,220
No, sir.

2103
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:41,260
This caller is so close to recognizing the dynamic that's happening here.

2104
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:45,440
When Alex asks if he's going to burn the DVDs and send out links and all sorts of free street

2105
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:51,000
teamwork for Infowars, the caller says, quote, they're only making us mad to do it more.

2106
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Yep.

2107
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
That's totally correct.

2108
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,920
Except the imaginary globalists aren't the ones making him mad in order to get him to

2109
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,320
post more links to Infowars.

2110
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,320
Alex is doing that.

2111
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,320
Yeah.

2112
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,320
Yeah.

2113
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:08,280
You didn't stop and think, will the globalists be mad about this or will Alex just be more

2114
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,280
famous?

2115
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,280
Yeah.

2116
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,280
Hmm.

2117
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,120
I might be wrong here.

2118
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,120
Yeah.

2119
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,760
This one could be on me.

2120
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,760
You know what?

2121
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:19,360
I'm going to stick around and I'm going to stay listening for the rest of my life.

2122
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,360
You bet.

2123
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:24,200
And I'm going to double down on sending out links to everybody who just erases them.

2124
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:28,520
I could either engage in self-reflection or I can send out links.

2125
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,520
Yeah.

2126
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,200
And you know, I'm definitely going to keep sending these links to people who have long

2127
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,920
ago put my shit filtered into the spam folder.

2128
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,920
Oh yeah.

2129
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,240
Forward, forward, forward, forward.

2130
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,240
Nope.

2131
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:45,480
So Alex gets another caller and this guy is weird.

2132
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:53,540
He seems to be a fan of some financial broadcast and apparently people on this broadcast have

2133
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,960
been wanting to have a debate with Alex about something.

2134
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:56,960
Sure.

2135
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,400
And Alex has been ducking them or something along those lines.

2136
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,400
It's pretty unclear.

2137
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:06,640
This past Saturday on the webcast from Financial Sense Online, Jim Poplava, who is the proprietor,

2138
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:09,200
said that your office hasn't gotten back to him yet.

2139
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,480
Well, here's another issue.

2140
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:15,720
You know, I've done an hour and 36 minutes and spent about 30 seconds plugging the films.

2141
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:19,080
We have sponsors and video and t-shirt and book sales at Fundus.

2142
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:22,240
I'm sorry, what the fuck did you just say to me?

2143
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,240
What the fuck did you just say to me?

2144
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:28,360
I've been doing the week here as well and I turn down probably 10, 15 interviews a day.

2145
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:32,880
I can't do them all physically and I know there's a lot of big sites that want to have

2146
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:33,880
me on.

2147
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,200
I've tried to recruit other people.

2148
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,360
I've tried to find other hosts I could promote.

2149
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,840
They usually turn into egomaniacs and have mental problems and they can't handle the

2150
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:44,560
power and so I can't do it all as my problem.

2151
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,520
Oh, they turn into egomaniacs.

2152
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,760
Look, I just can't afford to advertise.

2153
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,920
So you guys do it.

2154
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,680
I don't understand what this is.

2155
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,680
This isn't complicated.

2156
01:45:55,680 --> 01:46:00,680
No, I mean like you responded to exactly the point of that clip that made me angry.

2157
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,680
God damn it.

2158
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:05,120
He's like, I haven't plugged but like 30 seconds on this show or whatever.

2159
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,720
It's like you have plugged the entire show.

2160
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:12,680
You turned the show into you being mad and then plugging.

2161
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:19,560
Yeah, the last two episodes of the show, the Friday and Sunday show, have been protracted

2162
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:26,600
nonstop experimental long form advertising, immersive advertising.

2163
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:27,720
It's outrageous.

2164
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:33,800
I do think that there's a possibility that Alex doesn't like experience that as plugging

2165
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:39,480
or whatever, but taken from like an external viewpoint, like that's all he's doing.

2166
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,480
Yeah.

2167
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,480
Everything.

2168
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,480
That's it.

2169
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,480
Yeah.

2170
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,680
No, this is complaining about not getting enough views.

2171
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:48,360
That's all this is.

2172
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,360
Yep.

2173
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:54,160
He's being mad that Mel Gibson's racism is more interesting than his.

2174
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,160
Yeah.

2175
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:56,520
Lindsay Lohan's more famous than him.

2176
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,520
That's a struggle.

2177
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,520
Yep.

2178
01:46:58,520 --> 01:46:59,520
Yep.

2179
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,760
So we have one last clip here and it's how the show ends on Sunday.

2180
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,760
Okay.

2181
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:03,760
Boy, it's familiar.

2182
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,520
We're getting a lot of new stations, so we're on AM, shortwave, satellite, and the internet.

2183
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,000
They're not going to shut us down easily.

2184
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,860
We've got to stand up against these sensors.

2185
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:17,840
They're testing us right now, seeing if they can get away with what they're doing.

2186
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:23,160
Let's counter them by getting the Obama deception out to everyone and info wars.com out to everyone.

2187
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,240
God bless you all.

2188
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:25,240
It's the same.

2189
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,500
It's just, it ends as it started.

2190
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:30,680
It ends as it, it died as it lived that episode.

2191
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:37,080
Like I'm, I'm baffled and also kind of tickled and confused because I went back trying to

2192
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,800
find the coverage of the Rockefeller Duck.

2193
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,800
Yeah.

2194
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,800
Yeah.

2195
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,800
Yeah.

2196
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,800
Yeah.

2197
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:44,800
The most important document of all time.

2198
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,600
Yeah, with that, Alex was all over and the plan, the plan.

2199
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:54,200
He revealed the whole plan, got the information out to everybody.

2200
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:59,400
Now I might be cynical, I might be a little jaded by my time covering Alex, but I will

2201
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:03,760
say that my experience of listening to these episodes was that it was about something else

2202
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:04,760
altogether.

2203
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:06,960
He barely cared at all about it.

2204
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,880
Feels like he even told people not to worry about it so much.

2205
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,880
Yeah.

2206
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:16,960
He said, let's get that Obama deception out there.

2207
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,440
I mean, here's the thing.

2208
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,440
Okay.

2209
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:25,120
So what we've recontextualized that dumb fuck video as is first off, he's a lying piece

2210
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:26,760
of shit in the present.

2211
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:33,360
And second, if he isn't a lying piece of shit, if he is claiming that he predicted this entire

2212
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:42,360
thing, that he failed on a level so incomprehensible that I had to listen to four fucking hours

2213
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:47,920
of him tell people to Google the Obama deception instead of him warning the free world that

2214
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,080
we're all about to die.

2215
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:53,600
I mean, you would think that if he had come into the possession of this plan document

2216
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,880
that was like laid it all out there.

2217
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:56,880
Yeah.

2218
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:57,880
Yeah.

2219
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:58,880
I would want details.

2220
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:04,640
I think you'd spend more time on it than he did spend probably more time talking about

2221
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:10,720
the BP situation and how let's hope they're telling the truth, which is not hard hitting

2222
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,720
news.

2223
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,720
Nope.

2224
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,720
Yeah.

2225
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:21,300
There's very little by way of the, and that's why the present day 2021 video about the coverage

2226
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:26,680
of the Rockefeller document is so thin because he barely even touched the thing.

2227
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:31,200
It was just another headline that he was able to roll with.

2228
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,080
Paul wrote an article about it.

2229
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:39,800
Alex could skim it and say some scary words and it could be used to help scare the audience

2230
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:46,600
and brow beat them into a place where they'll Google things for him.

2231
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,980
Here's what I'll say.

2232
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:50,200
Fuck him.

2233
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:58,160
And two, if you are listening to that and you do not immediately demand the knowledge

2234
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:03,480
of what are the steps that the globalists are going to take in order to implement lock

2235
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:10,000
step, how can we stop each of these individual steps in order to prevent lock step from happening?

2236
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,960
And instead he just says, it's going to happen and the only way to stop it is to Google the

2237
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:15,960
Obama deception.

2238
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:19,460
Get the word out, which means promote my shit.

2239
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:24,360
In this situation, not only is he not at all a hero for predicting this or anything along

2240
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:32,060
those lines, he is, he is, he's aiding and abetting the globalists in this regard.

2241
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:34,960
He's aiding and abetting the imaginary villains in his head.

2242
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:35,960
Exactly.

2243
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:36,960
Yep.

2244
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:37,960
Jesus.

2245
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,960
Yeah.

2246
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:39,960
It was not what I expected.

2247
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:45,960
I mean, in terms of, in a, in a way, yes, it was what you expected.

2248
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:50,760
I expected something, yeah, I don't know what I expect.

2249
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:56,520
You, you know, you expect the unexpected with Alex, but yeah, you didn't expect that.

2250
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:02,200
No, I did not expect two episodes of Google talk.

2251
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,200
What a piece of shit.

2252
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:04,200
Yeah, he's the worst.

2253
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,200
Yep.

2254
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,520
Anyway, we'll be back on Friday, Jordan, but until then we have a website.

2255
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,520
We do have a website.

2256
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:09,920
It's knowledgefight.com.

2257
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,400
Really easy to sum up this episode because it doesn't really talk about the, not hard,

2258
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,000
doesn't really talk about the Rockefeller document.

2259
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,920
It just annoyed the shit out of you.

2260
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,920
We're also on Twitter.

2261
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,920
We are on Twitter.

2262
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:21,920
It's that knowledge.

2263
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,920
I'm just going to fight that.

2264
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,920
Go to bed, Jordan.

2265
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,920
Yeah, we're also on Facebook.

2266
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,920
We are on Facebook.

2267
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,840
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2268
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,120
doing God's work right now.

2269
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,680
We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo.

2270
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,680
I'm Leo.

2271
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:34,680
I'm DZX Clark.

2272
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,680
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2273
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:39,000
I'm a, how about you go Google strategic relocation.

2274
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Andy in Kansas.

2275
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
You're on the air.

2276
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Thanks for holding.

2277
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,440
Well, Alex, I'm a first time caller.

2278
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:45,440
I'm a huge fan.

2279
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,440
I love your work.

2280
01:51:46,440 --> 01:52:14,880
Thanks for having me.
