N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.040
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

00:30.040 --> 00:47.120
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:47.120 --> 00:55.880
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.880
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.880
I love your work.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
Knowledgefight.com.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.880
N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.880
I love you.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.200
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, it's Dan.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
I'm Jordan.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
We're a couple dudes.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
If we're gonna mess up the pace.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.440
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little

01:10.440 --> 01:11.440
bit about Alex Jones.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.760
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:12.760 --> 01:13.760
Jordan.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.760
Dan.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
Jordan.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
Quick question.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.840
Today Jordan is we are into the month of March and that means that it is time for Munch Madness

01:21.840 --> 01:22.840
on the Doughboys.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
I'm very excited.

01:23.840 --> 01:29.680
There are a lot of, there's a podcast that I very much enjoy during my time off from

01:29.680 --> 01:30.940
listening to Alex.

01:30.940 --> 01:36.520
It's tough to find other audio entertainment that I can just sort of like, ah fun.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.000
Sure, sure, sure, unmitigated fun.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.480
No one hates Jews here.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.360
No, just two guys arguing with each other.

01:44.360 --> 01:49.040
I enjoy it and it's always fun every year whenever they have their March Madness food

01:49.040 --> 01:50.040
tournament.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.040
It's a Munch Madness.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.040
That's lovely.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.040
Is upon us.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.040
That's lovely.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.040
Yep, what about you?

01:55.040 --> 01:59.840
My Bright Spot, Dan, I was going through my iTunes listening to some music the other day

01:59.840 --> 02:05.600
and Natalie Alford popped up and I haven't thought about her in, or not, I haven't thought

02:05.600 --> 02:09.120
about her, but we haven't spoken since the old cupcake days.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.120
Yeah, she's great.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.220
She's back whenever you were allowed to go outside and I was just thinking, man, she's

02:15.220 --> 02:18.320
so good and I want, I felt very good about that.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.240
Everybody should check Natalie Grace Alford out.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
She's fantastic.

02:21.240 --> 02:25.260
Natalie's one of those performers who I kind of like, when I first started doing standup

02:25.260 --> 02:28.680
all it made, I was like, what's the big deal?

02:28.680 --> 02:32.560
But talking about how great she is, I saw her perform one night and I was like, I get

02:32.560 --> 02:33.560
it.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.560
Oh yeah.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
She's fantastic.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.560
She is fantastic.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.560
And she's just such a great person to be around.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.480
Yeah, I don't know her super well, but she was always very nice.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.480
Oh yeah.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.480
Loved her.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.360
So Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.480
We be time traveling, my man.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.040
Oh no, we're in the past?

02:48.040 --> 02:49.040
We are.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
Or have we finally gone to the future?

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
We're going to the future.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
Oh shit!

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
It's about time!

02:53.040 --> 02:57.040
No, we're back in the past because on our last episode on Monday, I teased at the end

02:57.040 --> 03:01.000
that I was going to try and find where Alex made that prediction.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.760
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:02.760 --> 03:07.320
His video from 2010 where he talked about the Rockefeller document lockstep.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.880
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

03:08.880 --> 03:14.800
And so I had to compulsively go back and find it and see what his coverage was like.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
Naturally.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.400
Man, this is going to be a whirlwind ride.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.440
I fucking love Rockefeller.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.400
I think this is the greatest guy in the history of the world.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.400
Lockstep is the way to go.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.080
I will admit that I had no idea what to expect, and I think that sometimes you fish and the

03:30.080 --> 03:31.080
well is dry.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.080
Sure.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
Like Monday.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
Mm-hmm.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.080
It happens.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.460
One of the reasons we're doing a Wednesday episode is because I felt very unsatisfied

03:36.460 --> 03:37.940
putting out a 50 minute episode.

03:37.940 --> 03:39.320
That well, very dry.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.720
I felt like, hey, we were looking for the CPAC wrap up and we got snake eyes.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.880
There was one sad three-eyed fish with human eyes.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.880
No good.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.880
Uh-uh.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.880
This time, so many fish.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.360
All right.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.880
Nothing but fish.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.800
Okay, all right.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.800
So I'm very excited to get down to business on that, but before we do, Jordan, we're going

03:59.800 --> 04:02.720
to take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed up and are supporting

04:02.720 --> 04:03.720
the show.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.720
Oh, that's a great idea.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.280
So first, Harrison, but not that Harrison.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.000
He's really trashing the brand.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I don't disagree.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.040
You are now a policy wonk.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
I'm a policy wonk.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.040
Thanks, Harrison.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.040
But not that Harrison.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.040
Yes.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.720
Next, Horatio Kornholer.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.720
Thank you so much.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.720
You are now a policy wonk.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.720
I'm a policy wonk.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.000
Thank you very much, Horatio Kornholer.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
I choose to think that it's a game of bags, you know, the college game.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.320
Did Horatio Hornblower play a lot of bags?

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
I don't know.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.320
We'll see.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.820
Next, the greatest supervillain of all time, The Hintmaster.

04:32.820 --> 04:33.820
Thank you so much.

04:33.820 --> 04:34.820
You are now a policy wonk.

04:34.820 --> 04:35.820
I'm a policy wonk.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.400
Thank you very much, The Hintmaster.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.200
Next, Alex from Tap.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.200
Thank you so much.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.200
You are now a policy wonk.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
I'm a policy wonk.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.200
Thanks, Alex.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
Thank you.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.400
Next, to all the knowledge fighters out there, thank you so much.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.720
You are now a policy wonk.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.720
I'm a policy wonk.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.200
Hey, thank you very much to all the knowledge fighters out there.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.660
Next, for the ultimate bastard, Robert Evans.

04:54.660 --> 04:55.660
Thank you so much.

04:55.660 --> 04:56.660
You are now a policy wonk.

04:56.660 --> 04:57.660
I'm a policy wonk.

04:57.660 --> 04:58.660
Thank you very much.

04:58.660 --> 05:00.980
Someone doesn't like Kid Stays in the Picture.

05:00.980 --> 05:01.980
That doesn't sound true.

05:01.980 --> 05:05.240
I think everybody loves Kid Stays in the Picture, dad.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.400
Once you know more about fisting, you know you're in a good time.

05:09.400 --> 05:16.360
I remember hearing, I think, Patton Oswalt's bit about the Kid Stays in the Picture audiobook.

05:16.360 --> 05:21.960
I remember I was like, I don't know, probably 16, I got the audiobook of it on cassette.

05:21.960 --> 05:27.860
I just remember it being like this giant thing of like six tapes.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.080
It was as good as advertised.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.040
It was very nonsensical.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.880
What did Patton call it?

05:33.880 --> 05:36.920
It's like the devil reading his memoirs.

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
I think there's a similarity.

05:37.920 --> 05:44.000
I haven't listened to it in a long time, but anyway, also I have a technocrat here to give

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
a little shout out to.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
So thank you so much.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, God.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, boy.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
It could be Joakim.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Or Joakim.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Could be.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Sure.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
J-O-A-K-I-M.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.440
Oh, then is that literally Joakim Noah?

06:00.440 --> 06:01.440
No, it's not.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.440
It's a fantastic center for the Bulls team in the early aughts whenever Derrick Rose

06:05.440 --> 06:07.680
rode in the earth like a God among men.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.400
It is not because this is Joakim from Denmark.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
Thank you so much.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.960
You are now a technocrat.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
I'm a policy wonk.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
Crikey, mate.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
That's fantastic.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.960
Have yourself a brew.

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
How's your 401k doing, bro?

06:17.960 --> 06:21.320
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson, all right?

06:21.320 --> 06:22.840
Let's just get down to business.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.900
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.840
Why you pimps so good?

06:26.840 --> 06:28.480
My neck is freakishly large.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.200
I declare info war on you.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.200
Head out to Denmark.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.200
Yes.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.200
Thank you very much.

06:34.200 --> 06:39.080
Denmark and Joakim specifically, and if you can, I assume all Joakims know each other.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.200
Hook me up with Joakim Noah.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.680
Great fantastic center for the Bulls in the early aughts when Derrick wrote me.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
Okay.

06:45.680 --> 06:51.520
I feel like a friend of mine had a story about running into him at the long room.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
Oh, yeah.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
That's right.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.520
That bar on Irving Park.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.520
Yeah.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.520
I seem to recall the story about that.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.320
Number one, don't know if it's true.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.960
Number two, don't remember the story.

07:00.960 --> 07:01.960
How did he fit in there?

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
It's very long.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
It's my question.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.680
I know it's long, but he's very wide.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
Yeah.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
I don't know.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.320
Again, story might not be true, and I don't remember the story.

07:11.320 --> 07:19.320
Anyway, Jordan, on February 24th of this year, 2021, Info Wars released a video titled, quote,

07:19.320 --> 07:21.880
video shocks the world, exclamation point.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.880
Sure.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.040
Alex Jones predicted COVID lockdown in 2010.

07:26.040 --> 07:31.360
This was a three-minute clip taken from Alex's July 16th, 2010 show, and this is a little

07:31.360 --> 07:36.080
bit rare, a little bit unconventional, but I want to play the entire thing for you because

07:36.080 --> 07:40.480
this is going to be the launching off point for this entire episode, so it's important

07:40.480 --> 07:44.160
that we give a fair hearing to the original source material.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
Okay.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.160
How long is this?

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
Three minutes and 20 seconds.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.160
Brutal.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.160
Sorry.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.160
All right.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.160
Let's do it.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.160
The Alex Jones Show.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.160
There is a war on for your mind.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.600
I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful, and I hope

07:57.600 --> 08:04.000
that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've had chills since

08:04.000 --> 08:06.220
last night.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.920
This just confirms everything else we've already researched.

08:09.920 --> 08:17.000
A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,

08:17.000 --> 08:21.560
mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other

08:21.560 --> 08:25.440
documents, but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about

08:25.440 --> 08:30.080
the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines and the hell we're already living in.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.360
This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics

08:34.360 --> 08:35.360
madmen.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.720
But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.

08:37.720 --> 08:41.240
The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?

08:41.240 --> 08:45.060
Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.

08:45.060 --> 08:49.880
These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them that they're

08:49.880 --> 08:55.840
producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
read them all.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.160
It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.160
I pray to God.

09:01.160 --> 09:06.000
I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me strength and the will

09:06.000 --> 09:10.760
to be able to face this harm and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why

09:10.760 --> 09:15.680
a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos

09:15.680 --> 09:19.080
or on message boards that I'm a liar.

09:19.080 --> 09:25.760
I know why because it's scary.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.160
You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.480
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.

09:32.480 --> 09:38.160
You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.

09:38.160 --> 09:45.080
The only chance we've got of beating the scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes

09:45.080 --> 09:52.120
its time to incrementally enslave you mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually,

09:52.120 --> 09:58.880
the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you

09:58.880 --> 10:03.040
have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.

10:03.040 --> 10:07.600
Once you face this information, once you consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
your life.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.080
It should take over your life.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.080
I mean, what else?

10:12.080 --> 10:15.280
What else could it do?

10:15.280 --> 10:19.520
We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been

10:19.520 --> 10:27.280
putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.760
They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.380
Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep, display the seriousness

10:35.380 --> 10:38.760
of our commitment at both home and abroad.

10:38.760 --> 10:43.600
One loser draw, you need to choose a sign.

10:43.600 --> 10:49.520
InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.

10:49.520 --> 10:54.760
Winter Sun Plus is the highest grade vitamin B3 you're going to find with vitamin K for

10:54.760 --> 10:56.840
your immune system for overall well being.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
There is an ad at the end.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.000
Dan, you son of a bitch.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
There is an ad at the end.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.280
You knew there was an ad at the end.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.920
Of course.

11:02.920 --> 11:07.260
So when I heard that video, the first thing that stuck out to me was the quick cuts.

11:07.260 --> 11:11.440
That seems strange to me, and it made me suspect that Alex in 2010 might not have been talking

11:11.440 --> 11:14.840
about exactly what he wants people in 2021 to think he was talking about.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.760
Yeah, I mean, you leave some things out, some details here and there.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.760
Nobody needs to know.

11:18.760 --> 11:22.680
The second thing that caught my ear was how vague and almost formulaic this coverage of

11:22.680 --> 11:25.720
the Rockefeller document was back in 2010.

11:25.720 --> 11:29.960
Was this really as deep as Alex got into the document that supposedly demonstrates and

11:29.960 --> 11:33.560
outlines the globalists' evil plans?

11:33.560 --> 11:37.680
Is this in any way believable, that if he considered this document to be anything even

11:37.680 --> 11:42.120
close to that, that he wasn't able to find a clip of him that has more oomph than what

11:42.120 --> 11:43.120
we just heard?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.120
That was soft.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.600
Yeah, that was a big load of nothing.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.600
Yeah.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.860
This all didn't sit right with me.

11:47.860 --> 11:49.800
This was apparently a video that shocked the world.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.760
This is supposed to be Alex dropping the mic and proving that he was always on the operation

11:53.760 --> 11:57.340
lockstep tip, and thus you should totally listen to him about everything he's saying

11:57.340 --> 12:00.060
now because it's all going to come true in the future.

12:00.060 --> 12:04.400
That's the underlying argument that's being made by this video, and it felt dishonest

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
to me.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
Surprise.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
Yeah.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.040
I wanted to understand the larger context, so I went back to this, and let me spoil this

12:12.040 --> 12:13.280
a little bit.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.080
My suspicions were not unfounded.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.600
To give some background about what was going on around this time, if you're listening to

12:19.600 --> 12:25.640
Alex's show, the only real-world actual headline is that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was

12:25.640 --> 12:27.160
ongoing.

12:27.160 --> 12:31.760
And BP had announced the day prior to this episode that they had successfully capped

12:31.760 --> 12:35.680
the spill, which represented significant progress towards resolving the whole situation.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.680
Sure, sure, sure.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.560
Alex also mentions a car bombing in Mexico that was carried out by cartels, but he doesn't

12:40.560 --> 12:42.360
really dwell on the story much.

12:42.360 --> 12:46.300
Outside of that, I'm not sure we get much else in the way of news.

12:46.300 --> 12:49.320
You know who else predicted a pandemic in 2010?

12:49.320 --> 12:55.520
That would be the CDC when they made a plan for how to deal with a pandemic that wasn't

12:55.520 --> 13:00.480
really important until, say, a certain time period whenever it was ignored, and hopefully...

13:00.480 --> 13:01.480
Yeah.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.480
Yeah.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.400
If I'm not much mistaken, the CDC constantly predicts...

13:04.400 --> 13:06.320
It's basically their job.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.920
To plan for things that are going to happen.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.240
So here we get to...

13:10.240 --> 13:16.080
We're starting here on July 16th, 2010, which is the day that all that is taken from for

13:16.080 --> 13:23.040
Alex's very moodily scored...

13:23.040 --> 13:26.960
So here's the beginning of the show, Alex dropping his lead story.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.960
And I have all the vital stacks of news and information here in front of me that we're

13:30.960 --> 13:32.400
going to be covering.

13:32.400 --> 13:39.040
BP claims for the first time in 80 plus days that they have stopped the leak.

13:39.040 --> 13:43.920
And I pray that they're not lying, because they've said this at least three times that

13:43.920 --> 13:49.080
I can remember in the last 87 plus days.

13:49.080 --> 13:52.140
So we'll be breaking that down.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.820
That alone is weird to me.

13:54.820 --> 13:58.920
First of all, his lead story is the BP oil spill on the day that he's supposedly breaking

13:58.920 --> 13:59.920
these documents.

13:59.920 --> 14:05.280
Yeah, well, I mean, the eventual destruction of the family and quarantines and killing

14:05.280 --> 14:08.200
of all the people, that's second rate.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.080
But the other thing that I think is super weird about that clip is the way that Alex

14:11.080 --> 14:15.520
seems to be willing to give BP the benefit of the doubt about whether or not they'd sealed

14:15.520 --> 14:16.520
the leak.

14:16.520 --> 14:22.360
Well, I mean, BP's leak happening makes oil prices go down, right?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.080
And he prefers oil.

14:24.080 --> 14:28.920
Alex has sources, he has documents, he knows everything, he's kind of psychic.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.400
He doesn't will see it.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.800
That is fair.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.280
He doesn't do that.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.280
Very weird.

14:35.280 --> 14:41.320
I certainly hope that this oil company isn't lying.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.160
He accuses everyone of lying.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.240
Well, come on.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.640
You gotta give BP the benefit of the doubt.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.480
That was weird as hell.

14:48.480 --> 14:53.000
British petroleum is one word away from British Israelism, Dan, and that's basically what

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
he's going for.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.500
So Alex does get to the Rockefeller document pretty quick.

14:58.500 --> 15:03.520
It is the second headline that he's got, although I'm not sure he's read it.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.000
I'm not sure he knows much about it.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.120
I was here in the office last night when Aaron Dykes and I were doing research for the full

15:12.120 --> 15:16.840
spectrum dominance eugenics film that we are working on that deals with chemtrails and

15:16.840 --> 15:18.640
other issues.

15:18.640 --> 15:26.060
And we have come across so much more information than our awareness of the globalist master

15:26.060 --> 15:30.280
plan is growing exponentially.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.640
Don't think that you ever know everything.

15:32.640 --> 15:37.480
The more we learn, the more horrified we get to discover that things are far worse than

15:37.480 --> 15:39.040
we originally thought.

15:39.040 --> 15:43.520
So I sent the Rockefeller Foundation document over to Paul Watson.

15:43.520 --> 15:49.880
He wrote a story about it this morning and just everything we talk about here, the magnitude

15:49.880 --> 15:50.880
is off the chart.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.560
I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.

15:54.560 --> 16:00.460
And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've

16:00.460 --> 16:03.640
had chills since last night.

16:03.640 --> 16:09.100
This just confirms everything else we've already researched.

16:09.100 --> 16:16.120
But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,

16:16.120 --> 16:21.160
mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other

16:21.160 --> 16:22.160
documents.

16:22.160 --> 16:26.960
But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to

16:26.960 --> 16:31.280
sterilize you and the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in.

16:31.280 --> 16:35.440
That's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these

16:35.440 --> 16:37.360
eugenics madmen.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.400
But that story is up on prison planet dot com.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.840
This is about as deep as he gets.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.840
That's not much.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.000
Well, it's up on prison planet dot com, Dan.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Paul wrote a story.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Fixed it.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.480
Alex is just reading off a headline from an article that Paul Joseph Watson wrote.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.720
And everything that in the present day Alex is trying to pass off as his prediction is

16:56.720 --> 17:01.040
actually just him reading from Paul's outrageously bad opinion piece.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.480
Oh, no, Dan.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.880
He was the one who told Paul that he needed to write an article about something.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.160
But then it was Aaron Dyke who found it.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.480
Well, you know.

17:11.480 --> 17:16.160
That line, quote, global pandemics that kill millions, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints,

17:16.160 --> 17:20.960
biometric ID cards, and a world of top down government control that's in Alex's sizzle

17:20.960 --> 17:22.780
reel in the present.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.580
That's just the first line of Paul's article.

17:25.580 --> 17:28.780
So if anything, Alex should be saying that Paul predicted all the stuff that's happening

17:28.780 --> 17:31.120
now and Alex read it and then took credit for it.

17:31.120 --> 17:35.040
Yeah, I don't think Alex will be doing that.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.040
Nope.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.260
And that being said, Paul's article is not a prediction of anything.

17:39.260 --> 17:42.280
It's just the same kind of trash coverage of this Rockefeller document that we've seen

17:42.280 --> 17:47.040
11 years later just happening in 2010 and being quickly forgotten, even by the people

17:47.040 --> 17:49.120
who pushed it as a conspiracy.

17:49.120 --> 17:53.240
The article lays out that this is a scenario, you know, it admits that, that this is a scenario

17:53.240 --> 17:56.880
that's being depicted in the document titled Scenarios for the Future of Technology and

17:56.880 --> 17:58.400
International Development.

17:58.400 --> 18:03.000
And Paul even notes that it's one of four scenarios that are included in the document.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Okay.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.320
He then describes the scenario titled Lockstep in exhaustive detail, ignoring the other scenarios

18:09.320 --> 18:11.120
or the point of the document at all.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.400
Don't worry about it.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.160
The conclusion of this article is absolutely unearned and completely unsupported by the

18:16.160 --> 18:17.160
underlying evidence.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.160
Sure.

18:18.160 --> 18:22.200
Quote, the Rockefeller study is not a warning against preventing the kind of tyranny contained

18:22.200 --> 18:23.820
in the scenario from unfolding.

18:23.820 --> 18:28.360
It's a blueprint for how globalists want to exploit global crises like bioterror attacks

18:28.360 --> 18:32.560
and pandemics in order to completely destroy society and rebuild it under a new world order

18:32.560 --> 18:33.980
in their image.

18:33.980 --> 18:38.200
It's crystal clear from reading the Lockstep scenario that the oppressive society portrayed

18:38.200 --> 18:42.800
in the study is not presented as an admonishment of how governments would cynically seize upon

18:42.800 --> 18:46.600
a pandemic to set up a police state and empower themselves as dictators.

18:46.600 --> 18:50.440
It's a ringing endorsement that this approach would be the correct thing to do.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.000
Dan, I've been holding my hand up.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
You have.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
You have me?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yes, Jordan.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
I have a quick question.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Why?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.800
Because Paul thinks so.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.800
Oh, okay.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.400
Well, now that I've got that.

19:02.400 --> 19:09.840
He said it is not a document predicting or like meant to prevent or warning.

19:09.840 --> 19:14.320
But then he just said, because it's not, he didn't say why.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.760
No, of course not.

19:15.760 --> 19:19.700
These conclusions are not sensible to arrive at from reading the document unless you went

19:19.700 --> 19:23.080
into it with those conclusions already in mind and you were just looking for anything

19:23.080 --> 19:25.520
you could find to justify your narratives.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.840
That entire blurb that I read you there from Paul's article, it's completely dismissible

19:29.840 --> 19:34.800
by just reminding yourself that everything he's saying is his opinion.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.880
It's not fact and it's not even coherent analysis.

19:37.880 --> 19:44.000
The real tell here is how it's a completely ignoring the other three scenarios in the

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
document.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.600
How come the conspiracy isn't that the globalists are secretly trying to reveal that they're

19:48.600 --> 19:54.400
trying to usher in a world depicted by the clever together scenario where quote, pharmaceutical

19:54.400 --> 19:58.440
giants release thousands of drug compounds shown to be effective against diseases like

19:58.440 --> 20:03.220
malaria to the public domain as part of an open innovation agenda.

20:03.220 --> 20:06.960
They also opened their archives of research and development on neglected diseases deemed

20:06.960 --> 20:11.800
not commercially viable, offering seed funding to scientists who wanted to carry the research

20:11.800 --> 20:12.800
forward.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.400
Why isn't that the conspiracy that's in the document?

20:15.400 --> 20:20.960
I will argue because in that world, zinc sales are down.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
Yeah.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.480
This scenario isn't used or even mentioned because it doesn't depict the kind of vibe

20:25.480 --> 20:28.800
that Alex has spent his career making his audience scared about.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.760
The four scenarios in this document are equally likely, as is a completely different future

20:33.760 --> 20:38.600
that wasn't captured by the two variable exercise of this study, but the only one that matters

20:38.600 --> 20:43.280
to Infowars is the one that paints the dystopian hellscape they make money by convincing listeners

20:43.280 --> 20:45.220
is right around the corner.

20:45.220 --> 20:49.800
If Alex and Paul wanted to fear monger about this document responsibly, they have an obligation

20:49.800 --> 20:55.480
to answer one very basic question, which they refuse to in the past or in the present, which

20:55.480 --> 21:00.560
is what is different about the lockstep scenario that makes it the globalist secret plan, whereas

21:00.560 --> 21:02.440
the other three aren't.

21:02.440 --> 21:07.680
Well, it's in the other d- because GMOs?

21:07.680 --> 21:08.680
Sure.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.600
Vac- vaccines, Dan.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.700
They're gonna- cows?

21:12.700 --> 21:16.760
It seems kind of like an arbitrary choice that you make, because that's the one that

21:16.760 --> 21:18.520
appeals to you and you think is profitable.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.680
Yeah, probably.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.740
That would make sense.

21:20.740 --> 21:25.360
Profit motive does seem to encompass most of all the things we talk about.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.760
So they're gonna kill us.

21:26.760 --> 21:27.760
Sure.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.760
That's basically-

21:28.760 --> 21:29.760
Yeah, that sounds about right.

21:29.760 --> 21:30.760
It's always been.

21:30.760 --> 21:31.760
Yeah.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.160
DNA has been altered to also cause sterilization.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.520
I mean, they're hitting us on so many fronts, and I've got all the government reports admitting

21:37.520 --> 21:42.280
that the births, year by year, they're studying that human DNA is being damaged at a level

21:42.280 --> 21:43.280
never before seen.

21:43.280 --> 21:50.040
We are being mutated, and many of us that are able to even think and operate today,

21:50.040 --> 21:54.320
our children, their children, and the children after them are gonna be deformed monsters

21:54.320 --> 21:56.800
who are literally drooling basket cases.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
Sure.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.680
But of course, that will never even get to that point.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.720
They plan to exterminate all of us long before then.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.720
Oh, that's nice of them.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.440
It's just an absolute fact.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.200
And why do we have to sit here and fight with each other?

22:08.200 --> 22:11.320
Government bureaucrats, police, military, everybody?

22:11.320 --> 22:13.840
I mean, we're all in this together.

22:13.840 --> 22:22.520
It's a tiny elite, less than 6,000 globalists in their own analysis that rule the planet.

22:22.520 --> 22:26.640
And look, I'm gonna get into all the news coming up in your phone calls today.

22:26.640 --> 22:30.000
It's just, this is so horrible.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
They're collapsing the economy so they can take control of us through the government

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
healthcare system and soft kill us.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Ooh, oh boy.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Took a turn.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.160
Well, this is like, this reminds me of the Heaven's Gate cult now, just on account of

22:43.160 --> 22:50.080
like, I'm worried that we, like that argument, sure, we don't want them to kill all of us,

22:50.080 --> 22:55.360
but on the other hand, if we all killed ourselves, that would take away their satisfaction, right?

22:55.360 --> 22:56.760
Yeah, that would stick it to the devil.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.520
Yeah, they'd be really bummed about that.

22:58.520 --> 23:02.040
Yeah, also this 6,000, why doesn't the devil just give more peeps?

23:02.040 --> 23:06.240
Oh no, you can only really devil it up with 6,000 at a time.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.520
Is the devil behind this or not at this point in 2010?

23:09.520 --> 23:14.440
Because it doesn't feel like it, it feels like it's an administrative plan.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.080
Fair, fair, fair.

23:16.080 --> 23:21.720
But I will say that we do know that the globalist plans are ten years behind, and here we are,

23:21.720 --> 23:22.900
ten years later.

23:22.900 --> 23:29.160
It just has the vibe of like, definitely being a mortal plan.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.440
A little bit, yeah, yeah a little bit.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.440
Different vibe.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.440
What's the devil get out of this?

23:34.440 --> 23:35.440
I don't know.

23:35.440 --> 23:40.160
Anyway, Aaron Dykes was the one who found the document and brought it to Alex's attention

23:40.160 --> 23:42.240
so he sent it across the pond.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.680
Which is why Alex is a psychic who predicted everything now.

23:45.680 --> 23:46.680
Yes.

23:46.680 --> 23:52.600
Now, here's a little bit about Aaron Dykes and how he found his way to Infowars.

23:52.600 --> 24:01.800
There are so many of these reports that Aaron Dykes only ate it by coffee.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.680
What?

24:03.680 --> 24:09.080
Many days will not sleep and I have to make him go home after two days of being up here.

24:09.080 --> 24:13.760
This is somebody I hired right out of the University of Texas five years ago who didn't

24:13.760 --> 24:19.760
really believe in what I was doing, who didn't really buy what I was saying and kind of laughed

24:19.760 --> 24:23.960
when I hired him.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.840
That's exactly who I wanted to hire.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.480
I wanted him to see it.

24:27.480 --> 24:33.280
And he'd gone to, you know, the UT public relations school, you know, he had very good

24:33.280 --> 24:34.280
grades.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.280
When he graduated, he was very intelligent.

24:35.280 --> 24:39.240
And I said, you are going to see the dark side.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.040
Hire me, you coward.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.040
Wow.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.400
If you really want someone who doesn't believe you, I have got a candidate for the position.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
And that's me.

24:49.400 --> 24:54.320
I don't think, I don't think Alex could afford me at this point, but no, no, no, no, no.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.040
I do like that idea of like, I wanted to find somebody.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.460
I want the most skeptical person.

24:59.460 --> 25:04.160
I want somebody who thinks they can see through all of my bullshit.

25:04.160 --> 25:08.640
And then I'm going to show them the truth.

25:08.640 --> 25:13.720
Which is that we make a lot of money here and you can make some too.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.800
Integrity is for losers.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.920
I hired him out of public relations school because journalism school was not where I

25:20.920 --> 25:22.840
find people to work at Infowars.

25:22.840 --> 25:23.840
Nope.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.680
Usually contests is how I find people.

25:26.680 --> 25:31.880
So Alex, Alex is like, there's so much proof, man, or just so much proof of things.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.280
These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers.

25:35.280 --> 25:40.160
So many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers

25:40.160 --> 25:51.440
so fast, so fast, so furious that you could never read them all.

25:51.440 --> 25:56.480
A group of just two or three people here in my office that research this, we could never

25:56.480 --> 25:57.480
read them all.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.080
It is warehouses full of it.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.480
It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.

26:03.480 --> 26:07.640
If there are in fact warehouses full of the proof of Alex's conspiracy theories, then

26:07.640 --> 26:12.400
I would suggest he start by producing one piece of that proof because everything he's

26:12.400 --> 26:15.600
pointed to so far in my experience has been bullshit.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.320
John P. Holdren's eco science book doesn't advocate sterilizing people through adding

26:19.320 --> 26:20.540
stuff to the water.

26:20.540 --> 26:24.120
This Rockefeller document doesn't lay out a master plan to bring in a dictatorship through

26:24.120 --> 26:25.120
a pandemic.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.960
The Club of Rome's publications don't prove that they made up climate change.

26:28.960 --> 26:33.880
Every single specific I've ever heard Alex mention doesn't say what he claims it does.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.040
There is a warehouse.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.120
It's just a warehouse that's full of books and publications that Alex has never read

26:38.120 --> 26:43.000
or can't understand, and he's just using them as props to justify and support his flimsy

26:43.000 --> 26:45.360
facade of dumb theories.

26:45.360 --> 26:53.160
I'm going to argue that rather than a warehouse, maybe five gigs of a Google Drive.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.160
Maybe.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.880
No, because he used to print everything out.

26:55.880 --> 26:56.880
It's physical.

26:56.880 --> 26:57.880
Well, that's fair.

26:57.880 --> 26:58.880
That's fair.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.580
It's got to be a filing cabinet or two.

27:00.580 --> 27:02.400
I hope they have a shredder.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.440
That's how important the stuff they print out is.

27:04.440 --> 27:08.040
We got to get rid of this the moment Alex prints out a tweet.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.480
I can't be caught with this.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.480
No, no, no.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.480
Too dangerous.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.780
Too many stacks.

27:12.780 --> 27:18.600
So as I was listening to this episode, I heard one of the parts of Alex's 2021 prediction

27:18.600 --> 27:23.120
montage clip that shocked the world, and I noticed something really suspicious about

27:23.120 --> 27:25.300
how his words were presented.

27:25.300 --> 27:29.800
Here's how this appears in the overly dramatic current day clip.

27:29.800 --> 27:30.800
I pray to God.

27:30.800 --> 27:35.640
I pray to my Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, every night to give me the strength and the

27:35.640 --> 27:40.040
will to be able to face this harm and to give me the strength to carry on, because I know

27:40.040 --> 27:44.440
why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the

27:44.440 --> 27:48.800
YouTube videos or on message boards, and I'm a liar.

27:48.800 --> 27:55.520
I know why, because it's scary.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.880
You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.200
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.

28:02.200 --> 28:07.440
You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.

28:07.440 --> 28:10.280
That sounds kind of prophetic.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.320
Alex is saying that we won't be able to go to ball games or get drunk with our friends

28:13.320 --> 28:18.760
at the bar, and that's exactly like what happened because of coronavirus safety measures.

28:18.760 --> 28:22.600
The intention of this clip is to give the audience that impression, that Alex is predicting

28:22.600 --> 28:27.760
social lockdown, which, if you haven't forgotten, is kind of the title of this video.

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
Sure.

28:28.760 --> 28:33.960
So, there's a huge problem, though, and there's a slight edit that whoever made this clip

28:33.960 --> 28:37.400
did that changes the entire meaning of Alex's words.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.100
Do you mean when he said that they were going to nuke us and that's why we couldn't go to

28:41.100 --> 28:42.100
ball games anymore?

28:42.100 --> 28:44.280
No, that's from another show.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.280
Gotcha.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.280
I pray to God.

28:46.280 --> 28:50.680
I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the

28:50.680 --> 28:54.800
will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on, because

28:54.800 --> 28:59.500
I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment

28:59.500 --> 29:03.960
on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.120
I know why, because it's scary.

29:07.120 --> 29:11.000
And if you admit this to yourself, you're not going to be able to go to the ball games

29:11.000 --> 29:12.520
anymore.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.680
You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.

29:14.680 --> 29:18.680
You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time and

29:18.680 --> 29:25.440
not spend some of your energy on resisting this shady, you lying piece of shit.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.440
Shady as hell.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.440
You motherfucking liar.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.440
Yeah.

29:28.440 --> 29:34.000
You are saying that if you are available to learn this information, that information will

29:34.000 --> 29:37.040
so dominate you, you won't be able to go to ball games.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.040
Motherfucking liar!

29:38.040 --> 29:39.040
Liar!

29:39.040 --> 29:46.600
I have a paragraph written, but I think you expressed it just about as well as I could.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.400
Yeah, that was really shocking to me.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.160
I was like, wow, what a difference a couple of words make.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.160
Yeah, sure does.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.000
Sure does make a big difference, doesn't it?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.880
Really puts everything into it.

29:57.880 --> 30:01.240
Put that back in your fucking sizzle reel, you son of a...

30:01.240 --> 30:02.240
Yeah, it's not fair.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.240
Fuck off.

30:03.240 --> 30:07.520
The cutting out of those words completely alters the point of what Alex is saying, and

30:07.520 --> 30:11.920
it makes those images of not being able to go to the ball game or bars anymore, you know,

30:11.920 --> 30:15.840
it makes, when you cut it out, it seems like they're independent thoughts from everything

30:15.840 --> 30:19.880
else that he's saying, as opposed to the then part of an if-then statement.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
You got it.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.480
This is intensely dishonest, and whoever edited this clip together took those words out because

30:24.480 --> 30:28.600
they knew that in their original form, they don't really work to make Alex sound like

30:28.600 --> 30:30.680
he made an amazing prediction.

30:30.680 --> 30:35.000
But if you chop them off, it looks like he might have been onto something.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.880
Using this cheesy score and making selective edits like this, the person who put this together

30:38.880 --> 30:43.520
is able to transform something pretty meaningless and standard from Alex's show into something

30:43.520 --> 30:48.600
that looks like a fairly specific prediction about stuff that would happen a decade later.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.680
They do this because they know they can get away with it.

30:51.680 --> 30:55.160
Anyone who's susceptible for falling for Alex's shit is probably not going to be the sort

30:55.160 --> 30:59.320
of person who goes back to look at his 2010 episode to see if he was actually making a

30:59.320 --> 31:03.560
prediction back then, so this is a safe game of exploitation and manipulation that Alex

31:03.560 --> 31:06.280
is free to play, and man, it's just transparent.

31:06.280 --> 31:11.560
Dan, frankly, at this point, I would argue, you're literally the only person who would

31:11.560 --> 31:15.640
go back and find the episode that Alex said that and kick ass.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.040
Well, I was curious.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.040
Of course you are.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.680
You know, because you hear that, it's like you can't go to the ball games anymore.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.560
It's like, well, I mean, like, if you really did say that, I still don't think it means

31:24.560 --> 31:25.560
anything.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.160
No, it's not because he knows anything about it.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.160
But it would be, yeah, you're right.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.160
It would be interesting.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.160
You're right, it would be interesting.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.120
Going back and hearing that, I mean, I do it for your reaction.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.880
That reaction is why I do it.

31:36.880 --> 31:37.880
That's why you play the game.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.680
I want to throw a baseball at him.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.040
I want to throw a baseball right at his head.

31:42.040 --> 31:45.200
Happy spring training of baseball to the brain.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.000
Jesus Christ.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.800
That is unacceptable behavior.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.360
I was sitting alone in my room when I heard that, and I said, you asshole.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.960
Do you know what the problem is?

31:55.960 --> 31:59.320
He takes himself out of context in the clips.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.320
That's the problem.

32:00.320 --> 32:04.040
The problem is the Infowars media takes Alex Jones out of context.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.160
Yeah, it's not fair.

32:06.160 --> 32:10.280
So Alex gets to complaining about Obamacare and what have you, and he's like, hey, man,

32:10.280 --> 32:15.800
they're going to try and tell you you can't eat foods and stuff, and oh, no, it's no good.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.800
Tracking how much you weigh.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.960
They're already doing that through the schools to then tax you if you're overweight.

32:19.960 --> 32:24.360
They admit they're now going to do that and say what you can put in a child's Happy Meal.

32:24.360 --> 32:29.960
Oh, it's okay for McDonald's to put silicone in the food.

32:29.960 --> 32:38.480
That's CNN, a petrochemical, extremely poisonous, illegal in England and other countries, but

32:38.480 --> 32:39.960
you can't put a toy in there.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.560
See, it's all about control.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.300
It's not so much that McDonald's puts silicone in their food, which is the impression that

32:45.300 --> 32:47.300
Alex is trying to give the audience.

32:47.300 --> 32:51.100
It's that McDonald's uses silicone in the preparation of their food.

32:51.100 --> 32:57.600
You can find this information on McDonald's own website, that they use dimethyl polysiloxane

32:57.600 --> 33:00.560
in the oil that they use to fry French fries.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.760
What a great place to hide that information.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.760
Right on their website.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.040
No one would ever look there.

33:06.040 --> 33:10.280
So the reason for this is because it's a food-grade anti-foaming agent, which prevents the oil

33:10.280 --> 33:12.840
from bubbling up and burning employees.

33:12.840 --> 33:16.960
Anyone who's worked in fast food knows that getting that oil on you is no joke, and with

33:16.960 --> 33:20.880
the high incidence of younger employees at places like McDonald's, it's really important

33:20.880 --> 33:23.880
as a safety measure to do what you can to limit the possibility of people getting oil

33:23.880 --> 33:24.880
all over themselves.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.880
Totally.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.880
It sucks.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.880
I'm putting a little oil on myself back in my fry-making days.

33:29.880 --> 33:30.880
Yeah.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.880
Aw, it hurts so fucking bad.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.240
Alex can't prove that this chemical is dangerous to people.

33:36.240 --> 33:41.540
And actually, interestingly, in 2018, MLive reported that, quote, scientists at Yokohama

33:41.540 --> 33:46.280
National University in Japan say that a chemical added to the oil to cook McDonald's French

33:46.280 --> 33:49.480
fries could help cure baldness in humans.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.480
That's right.

33:50.480 --> 33:55.380
Some early-stage testing has shown that dimethyl polysiloxane was used to, quote, aid the growth

33:55.380 --> 33:58.200
of black hair on the back and scalp of mice.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.200
Okay.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.200
Yeah.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.200
All right.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.960
So, Alex, it's his own fault he's losing his hair.

34:03.960 --> 34:08.160
Of course, because people are kind of dumb, after this news broke, these Japanese scientists

34:08.160 --> 34:11.440
had to come out and clarify that eating McDonald's fries would not help you grow back hair.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.440
It doesn't do that.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.440
Of course not.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.440
It's not the same.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.440
Yeah.

34:15.440 --> 34:19.960
Their lead researcher, Junji Fukada, told writers, quote, no matter how many fried potatoes

34:19.960 --> 34:22.160
you eat, you'll never grow more hair.

34:22.160 --> 34:25.360
That's a total misunderstanding that's gone viral.

34:25.360 --> 34:31.200
It's so sad that scientists have to take time out of their day to say stuff like that.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.200
Oh, boy.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.000
So, Alex does stuff like this all the time.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.840
He'll say something like, McDonald's puts silicone in their food, and then do nothing

34:37.840 --> 34:42.160
more to examine the claim or help his audience understand what it even means.

34:42.160 --> 34:45.740
If you just listened to Alex, you'd be, you know, it would be equally easy to conclude

34:45.740 --> 34:50.160
that McDonald's is using this chemical in the oil as an anti-foaming agent as it would

34:50.160 --> 34:52.600
be to believe that their Big Macs are half breast implant.

34:52.600 --> 34:53.600
Right.

34:53.600 --> 34:54.600
Right, right, right.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.640
It just leaves you just treading water.

34:56.640 --> 34:57.640
Yeah.

34:57.640 --> 35:03.160
I mean, the worst part of that is we are a little bit conditioned so much to that type

35:03.160 --> 35:09.600
of processed food that there's, it's almost borderline reasonable to be like, yeah, I

35:09.600 --> 35:12.080
can see McDonald's putting silicone in their food.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.480
I mean, it is.

35:13.480 --> 35:18.440
We get so much, I'm not saying that it's a good idea or that I, you know, all that stuff,

35:18.440 --> 35:19.440
but it is.

35:19.440 --> 35:22.840
And I'm not, I'm not blanket defending use of all kinds of chemicals and stuff.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.840
No, of course not.

35:23.840 --> 35:29.200
It's a very different conversation from like what you're just sort of out of nowhere brain

35:29.200 --> 35:33.800
would pull up if you're thinking about silicone, you're thinking of like plastic, basically,

35:33.800 --> 35:38.800
as opposed to something that is a food grade anti-foaming agent for the oil.

35:38.800 --> 35:44.120
No, he's, he's taking advantage of the fact that evil shady corporations are tend to tend

35:44.120 --> 35:45.600
to be evil and shady.

35:45.600 --> 35:49.880
And he's taking advantage of the fact that his audience does not demand any kind of specificity

35:49.880 --> 35:50.880
out of them.

35:50.880 --> 35:51.880
Why would they?

35:51.880 --> 35:52.880
Yeah.

35:52.880 --> 35:53.880
Why not BP?

35:53.880 --> 35:54.880
Sure.

35:54.880 --> 35:55.880
Why not?

35:55.880 --> 35:57.160
This is so weird.

35:57.160 --> 36:02.280
Coming up also BP says they've stopped the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, but we've

36:02.280 --> 36:10.020
got screenshots of their cameras down there and it looks like there may be some hanky

36:10.020 --> 36:14.600
panky going on, but we are looking into it right now and working on that.

36:14.600 --> 36:19.440
But if this is true, praise God, this is certainly wonderful news.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.800
Why are you still taking a wait and see approach?

36:21.800 --> 36:26.720
You claim to have evidence that indicates there's hanky panky going on and you're still

36:26.720 --> 36:28.080
trusting an oil company.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.160
He's got money.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.320
He's got money in oil.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.320
I don't know.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.720
He's got to have something behind it.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.000
I don't know if it's that.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.520
I just think it, I don't, I don't know, but it's weird.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.520
That's very weird.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
Yeah.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.520
Yeah.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.880
Well, I mean, we've seen some screenshots that show something weird is happening, but

36:44.880 --> 36:51.240
you know, I think in this one situation I'm going to last the corporation.

36:51.240 --> 36:55.640
I'm pretty sure that escape pod is filled with nobody.

36:55.640 --> 36:56.640
There's nobody in there.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.360
We don't need to fire a laser to blow up that escape pod.

36:59.360 --> 37:05.880
Isn't this company that, uh, you know, spilled millions of tons of oil into the water.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.560
They tell us that it's all good, but I saw some evidence.

37:08.560 --> 37:14.360
There might be some goofing around, you know, might be some chicanery down there to say

37:14.360 --> 37:19.400
that this, this massive oil spill, this ecological disaster, I'm going to just go ahead and trust

37:19.400 --> 37:22.240
that they're, they're all, they're above board up to human hair.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.420
We all make mistakes.

37:23.420 --> 37:27.680
So one of the things I think is pretty interesting about going back to this time frame is like

37:27.680 --> 37:32.360
when Alex says he's going to go to calls a lot of the time he does, like it's, it, it

37:32.360 --> 37:38.320
seems more consistent that he'll get to calls and he'll take some calls and then jump back

37:38.320 --> 37:41.800
to just doing the show and then take some more calls.

37:41.800 --> 37:47.000
It has more of the feel of like an actual radio show back then.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.900
And so he goes to some calls as opposed to maybe somebody who's abused, uh, amphetamines

37:52.900 --> 37:54.480
for a few years.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.480
Yeah.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.480
Yeah.

37:56.480 --> 38:01.800
So this first caller brings up that like, Hey, you know, finding out about all this

38:01.800 --> 38:07.240
stuff about the evil folks who run the world and all that kind of makes it tough for me

38:07.240 --> 38:09.480
to be happy.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.740
Alex does not seem concerned.

38:11.740 --> 38:17.880
You hit on a talking point that, that, uh, not a lot of times people will bring up and

38:17.880 --> 38:23.880
what you had mentioned this morning earlier before, uh, I got through to talk to you was

38:23.880 --> 38:33.120
about how once you obtain this information and the truth, basically how much it does

38:33.120 --> 38:37.600
change your outlook on how you value your life.

38:37.600 --> 38:42.000
And then I can honestly say it, my life hasn't been the same.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
And sometimes I, you know, and I, I might even be asking for some advice here, buddy,

38:47.000 --> 38:54.680
but sometimes it's really hard to find some balance and to try to even maintain a reasonable

38:54.680 --> 39:01.300
amount of what I got given right by the constitution that, uh, you know, that just, you know, my

39:01.300 --> 39:02.300
right to be happy.

39:02.300 --> 39:06.600
Well, listen, listen, listen, Tim, we got out of balance.

39:06.600 --> 39:12.440
Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Thomas Payne, Patrick Henry, they all said, you must

39:12.440 --> 39:14.080
guard the jewel of Liberty.

39:14.080 --> 39:17.000
You must do everything you can in its defense.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.400
It is, you know, the, of the prime importance, even if you struggle to keep freedom, you're

39:21.400 --> 39:26.280
probably going to lose it and, and, and you will go into bondage and the worst elements

39:26.280 --> 39:28.320
of society will take over.

39:28.320 --> 39:32.400
And so we've gotten out of balance as a society becoming decadent, fat and happy.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.800
So the evil crept in.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.680
Now we're going back into bondage.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.080
The blessings of Liberty we're now losing.

39:39.080 --> 39:42.400
And so, uh, what did Barry Goldwater say?

39:42.400 --> 39:44.960
Extremism and defensive Liberty is no vice.

39:44.960 --> 39:49.040
Uh, there, there is no such thing as being out of balance.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.040
That's all folks.

39:50.040 --> 39:56.840
And by my underwear, my antsy pants, um, yeah, I think that this caller is expressing that

39:56.840 --> 40:01.520
like, Hey, this stuff is really like, you scare me a lot and it's not pleasant.

40:01.520 --> 40:06.920
Hey, you've whipped me into a constant state of fear and my adrenaline is always pumping,

40:06.920 --> 40:08.040
which makes me feel bad.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.040
Yeah.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.040
And Alex is like, you're fine.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.040
Yeah.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.040
Come on.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.040
What are you doing?

40:13.040 --> 40:14.040
Chill out.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.240
They're going to kill all of us, but it's like a while.

40:15.240 --> 40:19.160
So he wants to give this dude a little bit more kind of advice and a little bit of, uh,

40:19.160 --> 40:25.320
like when I'm with my family, when I'm out there fishing with the kids, you know, like

40:25.320 --> 40:28.720
I'm thinking about fighting the globalist, but I'm also enjoying this because that's

40:28.720 --> 40:30.520
why I'm fighting the globalist.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.520
That kind of thing.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.960
He won't be able to go to ball games.

40:32.960 --> 40:36.040
I mean, you can take your kids to ball games cause that's why you're fighting.

40:36.040 --> 40:41.880
You got to integrate the enjoyment of family time with your passion to fight.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.360
Not yet the devil soon to be the devil.

40:44.360 --> 40:45.360
Right.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.800
And then this caller flips the script and changes the game.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
Okay.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.280
What's interesting is 10 years ago, you know, I've been married for almost nine, but, but

40:53.280 --> 40:56.480
you know, 10 years ago, even six, seven years ago, I would still see a beautiful woman in

40:56.480 --> 40:58.760
a grocery store and lust.

40:58.760 --> 41:04.680
I would still, uh, you know, uh, be, I have a lot of flesh and now almost all of that

41:04.680 --> 41:05.680
is burned away.

41:05.680 --> 41:13.160
I mean, I'm attracted to my wife, but still my drive states are fully survival, warn people

41:13.160 --> 41:21.360
deal with this, you know, protect my children and anything else, Tim?

41:21.360 --> 41:22.360
Yeah.

41:22.360 --> 41:27.760
And just a couple of real quick things here is, uh, you know, uh, you were talking about,

41:27.760 --> 41:31.280
you know, uh, what people look at as important to these days.

41:31.280 --> 41:37.000
And when I crack open my Yahoo page, which is my homepage, uh, they have this thing called

41:37.000 --> 41:44.000
trending now and you'll see stuff like Lindsay Lohan, American idol, uh, raw wrestling, dancing

41:44.000 --> 41:45.400
the stars.

41:45.400 --> 41:53.360
And then the sixth thing at the end of the very last article, guess what it was, BP oil

41:53.360 --> 41:54.560
spill.

41:54.560 --> 41:58.560
That's what kind of priorities our country has these days.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.320
That's a great point is, uh, what is that trend you're looking at Google trends or what

42:02.320 --> 42:03.320
is it?

42:03.320 --> 42:10.200
No, you know, it's, uh, on my, on my Yahoo, uh, I don't have a Yahoo, I've meant to write

42:10.200 --> 42:11.440
a story about that.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.960
Uh, I'm gonna talk when we come back.

42:13.960 --> 42:14.960
Great points, Tim.

42:14.960 --> 42:15.960
God bless you.

42:15.960 --> 42:16.960
No time.

42:16.960 --> 42:17.960
I just had a thought.

42:17.960 --> 42:18.960
All right.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.520
Also, uh, Alex is a couple of years away from divorce at this point.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.520
Yeah.

42:22.520 --> 42:28.640
Um, so it's too bad that he had all the lust burned out of him by this point.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.640
Yeah.

42:29.640 --> 42:33.600
You know, the internet, like the way that he described that, that reminds me so much

42:33.600 --> 42:38.080
of the way that Douglas Adams described the babble fish, whereas like finally everyone

42:38.080 --> 42:42.840
in the universe was able to communicate with each other and that caused more and bloodier

42:42.840 --> 42:50.020
wars than ever in the past, you know, where it's like, Oh no, maybe it was a bad idea.

42:50.020 --> 42:51.880
Just like universal communication.

42:51.880 --> 42:52.880
Yeah.

42:52.880 --> 42:53.880
Yeah.

42:53.880 --> 42:54.880
Yeah.

42:54.880 --> 42:55.880
The internet is fucking, it's probably bad.

42:55.880 --> 42:56.880
Well, I don't know.

42:56.880 --> 43:01.720
I don't know if the internet is bad, but it does definitely at very least expose some

43:01.720 --> 43:08.200
parts of our behaviors and our patterns that maybe we wouldn't have been aware of otherwise.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.200
Yeah.

43:09.200 --> 43:16.880
Um, certainly trolling, uh, becomes a bit more noticeable, shitty as hell.

43:16.880 --> 43:21.880
Um, and then also like the phenomenon that this dude's talking about with like things

43:21.880 --> 43:28.560
like American Idol, WWE wrestling, they're trending, whereas something like the BP oil

43:28.560 --> 43:29.560
spill isn't.

43:29.560 --> 43:34.040
And it's like, well, yeah, that's people's attention.

43:34.040 --> 43:36.880
The internet is the opiate of the masses.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.320
I don't know what to tell you.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.000
I don't know.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.780
We're trying to feel comforted.

43:41.780 --> 43:43.880
We have Obama in the white house.

43:43.880 --> 43:46.640
Everybody's still like, maybe we won't have an evil president.

43:46.640 --> 43:47.880
It was good times.

43:47.880 --> 43:53.480
So Alex had something trigger in his brain because of what that guy said about his Yahoo

43:53.480 --> 43:54.480
feed.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.880
And he has come up with a plan.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.360
And you'll see how it's a news item.

43:58.360 --> 44:02.840
Normally they kind of feedback loop it and feed into it when it's Lindsay Lohan, uh,

44:02.840 --> 44:08.880
or when it's, uh, something like, uh, the scandal of Mel Gibson, the media hypes that,

44:08.880 --> 44:19.520
Hey, look, you know, the number one trend is Facebook or Chubacombra or Mel Gibson or

44:19.520 --> 44:22.260
Kelly Osborn.

44:22.260 --> 44:32.360
And the BP oil spill is way down the line.

44:32.360 --> 44:38.580
Unemployment extension 2010 is number 15 on Yahoo trends.

44:38.580 --> 44:39.860
Are you for or against it?

44:39.860 --> 44:48.020
That should be number one, lead and mercury in our children's juice drinks and chips and

44:48.020 --> 44:49.560
food and soft drinks.

44:49.560 --> 44:50.560
That's all admitted.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.680
Your children are drinking this in mass.

44:52.680 --> 44:59.320
That should be the top trend.

44:59.320 --> 45:03.560
Now what if we actually gamed their corrupt system?

45:03.560 --> 45:11.560
What if every listener of this show today and tomorrow and on Sunday and Monday typed

45:11.560 --> 45:16.420
the Obama deception into Yahoo and into Google search engines?

45:16.420 --> 45:21.400
What have you did it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?

45:21.400 --> 45:30.440
That would put the Obama deception links to the video for people to watch it for free.

45:30.440 --> 45:36.680
That would put links to that at the top of Google and at the top of Yahoo and tens of

45:36.680 --> 45:38.840
millions more would see it.

45:38.840 --> 45:41.500
This guy's a goddamn genius.

45:41.500 --> 45:48.020
If every one of my listeners would buy one share of stock in, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:48.020 --> 45:49.800
That's Bill Cooper all over the place.

45:49.800 --> 45:54.200
But in like a minute, Alex has laid out a case for his audience to do something completely

45:54.200 --> 45:57.160
nonsensical to solve a non-existent problem.

45:57.160 --> 45:59.960
He is a genius of marketing.

45:59.960 --> 46:05.160
The supposed problem here is that the news about the BP oil spill is not higher than

46:05.160 --> 46:07.880
on the internet trending list.

46:07.880 --> 46:11.720
This is an outrage when the top trends are about trivial matters like celebrities or

46:11.720 --> 46:12.720
cryptids.

46:12.720 --> 46:16.280
You can easily see how this is an easy argument to get people to agree with.

46:16.280 --> 46:21.560
The oil spill is probably more important than pop stories, but this isn't a problem.

46:21.560 --> 46:24.620
It's just kind of a statement about what attracts people's attention.

46:24.620 --> 46:28.800
The oil spill began three months prior, so headlines about it might not have been all

46:28.800 --> 46:30.560
that exciting to people.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.760
And just a few days before this, Lindsay Lohan had been sentenced to 90 days in jail for

46:34.760 --> 46:36.360
violating her probation.

46:36.360 --> 46:42.400
And I believe Mel Gibson was in the news for, yeah, that racist ass rant.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.640
I remember, I remember that.

46:44.640 --> 46:46.880
This was not the time he got pulled over.

46:46.880 --> 46:47.880
Yeah.

46:47.880 --> 46:48.880
This was the other time.

46:48.880 --> 46:51.160
Yeah, it's good that he still has a career.

46:51.160 --> 46:55.360
It's fine to say that the BP oil spill is maybe a larger story for more people, but

46:55.360 --> 46:58.560
it's ridiculous to complain about the public paying attention to those stories.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.680
They were pretty serious stories.

47:00.680 --> 47:03.040
You think the BP oil spill should be higher.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.360
Well, here's what we do tomorrow.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.440
Make something else news.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.440
Right.

47:08.440 --> 47:12.720
So Alex lays out his supposed problem, which is caused by some vague idea about how the

47:12.720 --> 47:14.240
algorithm searches work.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.240
And then the solution is that everybody needs to search for the Obama deception to push

47:18.240 --> 47:22.080
that movie to the top of all search engine results.

47:22.080 --> 47:26.160
This makes no sense, but it feels like it does to Alex's audience because they've

47:26.160 --> 47:30.640
been trained to equate promoting info wars with engaging in activism.

47:30.640 --> 47:34.120
They've been conditioned to believe that it's possible that if the Obama deception gets

47:34.120 --> 47:38.080
seen by millions more people, maybe it'll have an impact on getting people to pay more

47:38.080 --> 47:41.400
attention to oil spills and less to celebrity gossip.

47:41.400 --> 47:45.920
The sleight of hand you see in this clip is phenomenal, and it really represents the bleak

47:45.920 --> 47:49.080
underbelly of what Alex's world is always about.

47:49.080 --> 47:53.880
The only solutions that are ever really offered are those that directly profit Alex.

47:53.880 --> 47:58.200
The solution to the collapsing economy is to buy gold from Alex's sponsor, Ted Anderson.

47:58.200 --> 48:02.320
The solution to the coming societal collapse is to buy survival food from Alex's sponsor,

48:02.320 --> 48:03.320
My Patriot Supply.

48:03.320 --> 48:08.480
The solution to COVID-19 and every other health condition is just to use Alex's supplements.

48:08.480 --> 48:14.160
The solution to people not paying enough attention to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill apparently

48:14.160 --> 48:18.640
is to try and trick search engines into thinking Alex's movie is more popular than it actually

48:18.640 --> 48:21.360
is, so it's fooled into recommending it to more people.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.680
Yeah, that sounds correct.

48:22.680 --> 48:23.680
It's evil.

48:23.680 --> 48:26.640
And looking back on this, it's painfully transparent to see what Alex is doing.

48:26.640 --> 48:27.640
It's very bad.

48:27.640 --> 48:31.440
But I do have a hard time not recognizing that it is a great marketing strategy.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.440
Ugh.

48:32.440 --> 48:33.440
Yeah.

48:33.440 --> 48:37.840
I also enjoyed that as Alex was talking, like as soon as he said the Obama deception the

48:37.840 --> 48:40.720
first time, you rolled your eyes and just shook your head.

48:40.720 --> 48:41.720
No.

48:41.720 --> 48:46.640
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

48:46.640 --> 48:47.640
Yeah.

48:47.640 --> 48:48.840
So that's his big plan.

48:48.840 --> 48:52.000
And see, this is a serious plan.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.280
He spends a half hour talking about it.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.280
Really?

48:55.280 --> 48:56.280
Yes.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.280
Really?

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
Yeah.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.280
Okay.

48:59.280 --> 49:00.280
And like, hey, look.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.280
Look.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
Sure.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.280
We'll do the Obama deception first.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.280
Sure.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
And then later we can do it with other things.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.280
Okay.

49:06.280 --> 49:09.760
What if you all right now went to a search engine box.

49:09.760 --> 49:12.240
Let's show people live on TV.

49:12.240 --> 49:16.080
Radio listeners could just go to Google, go to Yahoo, go to the biggest search engines

49:16.080 --> 49:19.420
and type in the Obama deception.

49:19.420 --> 49:21.660
The Obama deception.

49:21.660 --> 49:24.120
Type in the Obama deception.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.120
This'll probably work.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.840
It'll probably push it into the top trends, maybe even number one.

49:27.840 --> 49:35.480
And the next week I can put out a viral video, say on genetic engineering, causing DNA damage.

49:35.480 --> 49:43.040
We can create a simple term for people to search.

49:43.040 --> 49:48.440
And then millions of new people because of that information warfare tool will see it.

49:48.440 --> 49:53.120
I like this technique that is sort of like that Steve Martin, one for the studios, one

49:53.120 --> 49:54.920
for me kind of movie thing.

49:54.920 --> 49:58.160
It's like, all right, this first one is just going to be promoting my shit.

49:58.160 --> 50:01.520
And then the second time I'll do it about some topic that we want to draw attention

50:01.520 --> 50:02.520
to.

50:02.520 --> 50:06.200
What I want to do is kind of a ladder attack, okay?

50:06.200 --> 50:10.880
Just get my name trending first and then I'll put out content to go viral.

50:10.880 --> 50:11.880
See?

50:11.880 --> 50:12.880
It's great.

50:12.880 --> 50:17.040
And to be clear, Alex has done this kind of thing earlier in his career as well with

50:17.040 --> 50:19.160
Google search terms and stuff.

50:19.160 --> 50:24.880
It's not a new strategy for him, but it is tremendously desperate and weird the way he's

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
acting.

50:25.880 --> 50:26.880
This one's terrible.

50:26.880 --> 50:27.880
Yeah, this one's bad.

50:27.880 --> 50:28.880
Yeah.

50:28.880 --> 50:29.880
So Alex won, right?

50:29.880 --> 50:30.880
Sure.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.060
When there was an even playing field, Alex won.

50:32.060 --> 50:33.440
His stuff was the most popular.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.440
Everybody knows it.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.440
Shut up.

50:35.440 --> 50:36.440
Everyone knows it.

50:36.440 --> 50:37.440
Okay.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.920
So the globalists cheated.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.360
Oh, okay.

50:40.360 --> 50:43.000
So now Alex has to cheat so they can't cheat.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Okay.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.080
It's complicated, but I just had this clip because Alex is really accepting and admitting

50:47.080 --> 50:49.800
that what he's doing is cheating.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.880
We've won on the level playing field, so they cheat.

50:52.880 --> 50:58.600
So before they start cheating this system, we need to game their system right now.

50:58.600 --> 50:59.600
Yeah, we got to game it.

50:59.600 --> 51:02.200
We got to cheat that system in order to make sure they can't cheat again.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.640
We cheat first in order to stop their cheating.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.600
No, because they cheated before the level playing field.

51:06.600 --> 51:11.240
They cheated before the level playing field when he was the most popular radio show on

51:11.240 --> 51:12.240
the planet.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.240
Yes.

51:13.240 --> 51:21.040
So I want to stress to you, and I hope that stammering really drove home the point.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.360
He talks about this for a long time.

51:22.360 --> 51:23.360
Oh, boy.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.360
It's a long time.

51:24.360 --> 51:27.800
So we're not going to listen to a ton more clips of it because he does jump off to another

51:27.800 --> 51:31.440
topic and that is that Pearl Harbor was a false flag.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.440
Okay.

51:32.440 --> 51:33.440
And it's now declassified.

51:33.440 --> 51:35.960
The US had broken the Japanese purple and blue code and knew exactly what they were

51:35.960 --> 51:37.600
going to do weeks before.

51:37.600 --> 51:42.640
It took weeks for that task force to steam from Japan into that area of the Pacific.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
That's way across the Pacific.

51:43.640 --> 51:48.320
If you look at the map, here's Japan, here's Hawaii, here's the West Coast of the United

51:48.320 --> 51:49.320
States.

51:49.320 --> 51:53.360
They had to come all the way and the aircraft and the US submarines and all the islands

51:53.360 --> 51:57.840
we control, they all knew they were coming and they were ordered to stand down and die.

51:57.840 --> 51:58.840
Whoa.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.120
Can't prove any of that.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.760
Ooh, that's a big one.

52:02.760 --> 52:06.120
We've talked a bit about his Pearl Harbor conspiracies in the past, but I just wanted

52:06.120 --> 52:11.040
to play that as just to represent that he spends a while on that topic.

52:11.040 --> 52:14.960
Now he goes back to calls because he has made his point that everyone needs to get to typing

52:14.960 --> 52:15.960
in their search engines.

52:15.960 --> 52:16.960
Of course.

52:16.960 --> 52:19.000
And he gets a call from a guy named Angel Eyes.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Okay.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Who scares me.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
I'm listening.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.800
Let's talk to Angel Eyes in Texas here on the air.

52:25.800 --> 52:26.800
You got me.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.000
How you doing, Bulldog?

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Pretty good.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Okay.

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
You know, Angel Eyes is because I think my eyes see what other people don't.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
You're freaking me out, Angel Eyes.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
That's not good.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
That's not good.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Sir?

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Sir?

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Sir?

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
How you doing, Bulldog?

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
All right.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
All right.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
Maybe if it's 3 a.m. at a bar and I don't want to go home, if somebody starts with,

52:49.000 --> 52:52.560
I'm Angel Eyes because I think I can see, I'm like, hey, maybe I'm listening.

52:52.560 --> 52:54.160
I'll ask one follow-up.

52:54.160 --> 52:55.560
Any time before that.

52:55.560 --> 52:56.820
I can always leave, man.

52:56.820 --> 53:01.760
I think I'm going to start our episodes now with, hey, what's going on, Bulldog?

53:01.760 --> 53:02.760
Yeah.

53:02.760 --> 53:06.840
That's a little bit of a charming way to greet me.

53:06.840 --> 53:07.840
Sure.

53:07.840 --> 53:11.920
Angel Eyes has some interesting memories that he wants to try and run by, Alex.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
Okay.

53:12.920 --> 53:17.680
I called you about a month ago in regards to the interview with Chandra Levy's aunt

53:17.680 --> 53:23.400
with Barbara Walters about Chandra called her a week before she disappeared and said

53:23.400 --> 53:28.480
something big is fixing to happen in America and I can't tell you about it.

53:28.480 --> 53:35.320
You put out the flag that if anybody had a recording of that, could they send it to you?

53:35.320 --> 53:36.920
I doubt anybody would have it.

53:36.920 --> 53:40.240
That was like 10 years ago that happened.

53:40.240 --> 53:46.680
I wonder, could you find out who Chandra Levy's aunt is and interview her if she hasn't disappeared

53:46.680 --> 53:48.680
or, you know, died mysteriously yet?

53:48.680 --> 53:55.280
So you're saying you saw Chandra Levy, the intern that was killed right before 9-11.

53:55.280 --> 54:00.760
You're saying that she said something big is about to happen, but I can't tell you.

54:00.760 --> 54:04.560
And you're saying you saw her say that on what show?

54:04.560 --> 54:08.800
On Barbara Walters, I believe it was Barbara Walters.

54:08.800 --> 54:13.680
It may have been like Leslie Stahl or one of those global reporters, but...

54:13.680 --> 54:17.200
Does not spare the details here.

54:17.200 --> 54:22.400
So Chandra Levy's aunt is named Linda Zamsky and the interview that she gave back in 2001

54:22.400 --> 54:26.000
and her statement about her niece's disappearance were widely reported at the time in every

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
outlet you can imagine.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.160
It would be the easiest thing in the world for this caller to have just googled Chandra

54:31.160 --> 54:37.840
Levy's aunt and found articles explaining this, which kind of illustrates where his

54:37.840 --> 54:39.920
memory has failed him.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.980
The aunt didn't say that Chandra had said that there was something big that was going

54:42.980 --> 54:46.880
to happen in America, as Angel Eyes is reporting to Alex.

54:46.880 --> 54:51.680
According to the Washington Post, quote, on April 29th, the day before Levy was last seen,

54:51.680 --> 54:54.800
Levy left a message on Zamsky's voicemail.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.600
Zamsky would never hear from her niece again.

54:56.600 --> 55:01.560
Quote, hi, Linda, it's Chandra, my internship is over, Levy said in the message.

55:01.560 --> 55:06.160
I'm planning on packing my bags in the next week or ten days, heading home for a while,

55:06.160 --> 55:09.800
don't know what I'm going to do this summer, and I really have some big news or something

55:09.800 --> 55:12.000
important to tell, call me.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.240
The article goes on to say, quote, Zamsky said yesterday she did not know what Levy

55:16.240 --> 55:21.440
was referring to, but added that the 24-year-old did not seem upset.

55:21.440 --> 55:26.680
According to Zamsky, she was Chandra's confidant about her relationship with then-Representative

55:26.680 --> 55:31.620
Gary Condit, so taken in its proper context, as delivered by Zamsky, you could use this

55:31.620 --> 55:36.160
comment to speculate that maybe Chandra had some news about a change in her relationship

55:36.160 --> 55:37.160
with Condit?

55:37.160 --> 55:38.160
Sure.

55:38.160 --> 55:41.760
But that's not the context that Angel Eyes is bringing this information to Alex in.

55:41.760 --> 55:45.480
He's saying that the news that Chandra had for her aunt was something big was going to

55:45.480 --> 55:50.080
happen in America, which seems to be him implying that she had foreknowledge about 9-11.

55:50.080 --> 55:55.320
Hey auntie, just wanted to let you know, coming home soon, I'm not sure, I don't know what

55:55.320 --> 56:00.560
I'm going to do for this summer, 9-11's about to happen, it's going to be a wild couple

56:00.560 --> 56:01.560
of months.

56:01.560 --> 56:05.520
I've seen this conspiracy floated online before, so it's not like a completely new idea to

56:05.520 --> 56:10.720
me, but it's one idea that kind of relies on connecting random dots and misinterpreting

56:10.720 --> 56:12.840
and misrepresenting Zamsky's comments.

56:12.840 --> 56:17.280
It's kind of shocking to me, honestly, that Alex would hear this and kind of not know

56:17.280 --> 56:19.280
what the guy's talking about.

56:19.280 --> 56:22.680
It seems like this would be something that he would have covered, and I bet he has and

56:22.680 --> 56:23.680
he's just forgotten.

56:23.680 --> 56:26.400
Yeah, he just doesn't care because it didn't really have legs, yeah.

56:26.400 --> 56:27.400
Probably.

56:27.400 --> 56:32.160
So, this internet spamming, it works quick.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.400
It starts working while Alex is still on air.

56:34.400 --> 56:35.580
It totally works, okay.

56:35.580 --> 56:40.920
I'm noticing that on Twitter and Facebook it is alive with the Obama deception.

56:40.920 --> 56:47.700
Thousands and thousands of people are flooding Twitter and Facebook by posting the Obama

56:47.700 --> 56:52.060
deception from YouTube or just the term the Obama deception.

56:52.060 --> 56:56.680
People are also going to Google and Yahoo and typing in the Obama deception.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.960
We're going to try to trend that to the top to show people the power of the alternative

56:59.960 --> 57:03.240
media and to reach millions of new people with the film.

57:03.240 --> 57:07.280
But we can't make future films if you don't purchase them from us.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.720
Booyah!

57:08.720 --> 57:10.740
This has been a lot.

57:10.740 --> 57:11.740
This has been a lot.

57:11.740 --> 57:12.740
Yeah.

57:12.740 --> 57:14.880
This is a few more than I was hoping for.

57:14.880 --> 57:20.440
Hey, look, this is all working out great but also you need to buy the films.

57:20.440 --> 57:24.740
I got you in the door, now you got to buy the films also or else I can't make another

57:24.740 --> 57:26.920
one for us to artificially promote.

57:26.920 --> 57:33.840
This war isn't over until we defeat the globalists and we can't defeat the globalists so this

57:33.840 --> 57:37.720
war isn't over until you have made me obscenely wealthy.

57:37.720 --> 57:38.720
Yes.

57:38.720 --> 57:40.000
Beyond obscenely wealthy.

57:40.000 --> 57:47.440
So Alex goes back to calls and this one dude, he's wrong, I think about everything, sure.

57:47.440 --> 57:49.160
Matt in DC, you're on the air.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.160
Hi Alex.

57:50.160 --> 57:54.520
First, I just wanted to say thank you for doing more than anybody else in the world

57:54.520 --> 57:56.920
to fight against this new world order.

57:56.920 --> 57:57.920
Okay, well that's more.

57:57.920 --> 58:02.220
And secondly, I actually have to disagree with you when you say that you're not smarter

58:02.220 --> 58:03.220
than average.

58:03.220 --> 58:08.440
You're probably way above average when it comes to intelligence just based on your discernment.

58:08.440 --> 58:09.440
Yeah, that was wrong too.

58:09.440 --> 58:12.000
It's the duty of great men to lead.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.520
Alex, most people go cross-eyed when they try to process the amount of input that you

58:16.520 --> 58:17.880
do on a daily basis.

58:17.880 --> 58:18.960
That's three for three.

58:18.960 --> 58:23.240
And we need to know when you're going to step up and run for political office.

58:23.240 --> 58:27.720
I mean, run for mayor of Austin or governor of Texas and you'll have millions of people

58:27.720 --> 58:30.640
migrating just to go vote in that election.

58:30.640 --> 58:35.000
Oh man, just the population of Texas would explode in order for people to come vote for

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Alex to be their leader.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.600
If you stand correctly, if Alex announces that he is going to run for mayor of Austin

58:41.600 --> 58:45.960
within whatever length of time you must be a resident in order to vote.

58:45.960 --> 58:47.120
I'm sure there's some requirements.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.760
Yeah, there would have to be.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.220
So millions of people are going to go to Austin.

58:53.220 --> 58:54.220
Just to put Alex in office.

58:54.220 --> 58:55.220
Just to put Alex in office.

58:55.220 --> 58:56.220
And then they'll all move away.

58:56.220 --> 59:01.880
Oh, I guess they'll just stay in Austin and the place will get even weirder.

59:01.880 --> 59:05.020
There'll be a new shirt that'll say, keep Austin weird, but not that weird.

59:05.020 --> 59:07.680
Run away from how weird Austin is now.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.680
Yeah.

59:08.680 --> 59:13.360
Um, also as a cross-eyed American, I resent him saying people go cross-eyed taking in

59:13.360 --> 59:17.080
all the information that you do because he doesn't take in any information.

59:17.080 --> 59:19.400
Um, yeah, that's very frustrating.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.520
So one time Alex was gonna run.

59:21.520 --> 59:24.080
I don't know if you know this, he was going to run for office.

59:24.080 --> 59:25.080
Oh yeah.

59:25.080 --> 59:26.080
But there was a problem.

59:26.080 --> 59:28.120
He was too busy filming guardians of the galaxy.

59:28.120 --> 59:29.720
No, he was too popular.

59:29.720 --> 59:32.280
Politics is such a dirty business.

59:32.280 --> 59:36.760
One time I got talked into filing for state rep and I dropped out in a week because I

59:36.760 --> 59:40.120
was getting so much support and it freaked me out and I was reading the rules.

59:40.120 --> 59:44.120
They've written the rules where you can't follow the law and get elected legally in

59:44.120 --> 59:45.720
the campaign rules.

59:45.720 --> 59:48.720
That way they can selectively enforce against you.

59:48.720 --> 59:56.200
Um, so at this point, and I don't really ever intend to run for political office.

59:56.200 --> 59:58.860
Um, good, true.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.760
At this point, I don't intend to do that.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.320
Uh, I'm just here covering the news and the information.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.520
I mean, we're reaching millions of people a day, millions of new people every week.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.260
It's growing exponentially.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.880
Why should we stop what's working?

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.800
I mean, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.440
Well, I don't think you'd have to stop.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.120
You could just do what you're doing and then have people come in and vote for you.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.320
I mean, it's not that you're wrong.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.280
I completely agree with everything you say.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:29.000
Well, Austin is incredibly corrupt because we do have a hundred percent election fraud.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.600
I've proven it in the paper when I've caught them back in 98 and again in 2000 I mean,

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600
it's just total fraud.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.000
That's why you can't vote them out and they're stealing everything.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.840
This is probably one of the most corrupt cities in the country.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.240
It's also the most wealthy per capita and that's why the bloodsuckers are here.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.520
They are, they are looting the public.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.160
Uh, so I mean, I can't even run for office here.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.160
There's no elections in Austin.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.080
What, what are you talking about?

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.360
That's what are you talking about?

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.440
Some world-class arguing right there.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.700
Yeah, I got me.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:07.440
So apparently Alex has been living in a land of lawlessness and complete 100% election

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.280
stolen-ness for 10 years at least.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.480
Didn't bother him that much.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480
Apparently not.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480
No.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.200
I'm confused as to why.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.360
Oh, cause he's full of shit.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360
Oh, that would make sense.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.360
Yeah, he's just talking shit.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:25.080
I was going to say, I feel like I would probably be like, hmm, I don't want to live here any

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080
longer.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.520
Yeah, I would be scared.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.880
Or it took me way little time with Laurie Lightfoot to be like, I don't want to live

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.880
here anymore.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:39.720
I, or if like, if you really believe this revolutionary shit that Alex is talking about,

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:45.440
it really seems like he would be not a radio host, he'd be a terrorist.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.080
He would be running a cell or something.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:53.200
He would be advocating that people do something crazy like a storm the Capitol building.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.920
If you've been living in a city where there's fraudulent elections for 10 years and there's

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:04.280
nothing real and all the leadership, you can't vote him out because it's all like, what recourse

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.160
do you have?

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.540
Just accept it?

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.720
I will say, having been to Austin, the barbecue is great.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.720
Sure.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.800
Is that worth an endlessly corrupt election?

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800
No, certainly not.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.240
Not with the Lions at Franklin's.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.300
Yeah, that's fair.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:24.440
So Alex is, I mean, what's really most important though is you guys gotta, you guys gotta hit

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.560
that Google button.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:34.160
And we are having listeners today try to, I mean, BP is not even in the top 10 on Google

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.040
and Yahoo trends.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040
So we're trying to get the Obama deception done.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.880
Millions of people every day go to the front pages of these sites.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.840
They look at what the top stories are.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.660
You're able to drive it to the top.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:53.180
If you put the term, the Obama deception, the Obama deception, just go into Google and

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.120
type the Obama deception in, hit enter.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:59.760
It'll bring up the results back out again, put your cursor on it, click it.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.320
So it's a new search and just keep reentering it.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
At least 15 times.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320
It'll take you a couple of minutes.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.240
You don't have to type it in each time.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.400
After you type it in, you hit search, then you put your cursor in there, click it.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.800
So it thinks it's a new search or change one letter, you know, erase the end, put an end

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.200
back on it, but it's easier just to that guy.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:23.540
Show them guys, guys, just show them how to Google, show them how to Google things repeatedly.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:26.320
Show them how to press the search button again.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.120
Because again, Alex is making this very clear that BP, the oil spill, should be number one.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.560
This is what we do about it.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.800
You can do that hundreds of times, it'll guaranteed go to the top.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:48.680
Now listen, many times I have had my videos already number one on the web and be the top

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.380
search, and it gets millions of new people to see them.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:56.280
We're just artificially doing this here today, so there's not Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.800
I mean, the BP oil spill isn't even in the top 10.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.360
That should be number one.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.120
You mean you really just summed it up when you were yelling over his last clip, which

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.880
is if BP should be the number one trend, why are you doing this?

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.400
Alex is doing this because he wants more traffic and more money to come into his business,

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.440
but he also knows that admitting that would look really bad.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.280
He wants the outcome, but he doesn't want to have to ask for it, so he pretends that

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.240
his motives are noble, and that he's actually incensed that Lindsay Lohan is getting more

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.120
attention than the oil spill.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.840
In reality, Alex is pissed off that Lindsay Lohan is getting more attention than him,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.880
but being too obvious about it is bad for his branding, so he's pretending to be concerned

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.080
about how many people are paying attention to the oil spill.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.320
I will say that- It's so transparent.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:47.240
Yeah, if you go back and listen to our coverage of the Obama deception, I will say that I

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:53.660
completely lost my mind around the eight or nine hour mark, so were the last few minutes

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:57.760
of the Obama deception about a BP oil spill that wasn't to happen for a couple years?

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760
I don't know.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.760
I don't think so.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.760
Okay.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.760
Certainly, no.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.760
Okay.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.960
So Alex is saying, get on there, type it in, hit enter.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960
Sure.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.480
A caller has a better idea.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.480
Okay.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.120
For those people who sit down at the computer five or six times a day just to check their

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.840
stuff and then they get up and leave, they're probably not going to think about doing the

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.440
search for you.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.560
There are, however, really, really simple to use add-ons for just about any browser

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.680
out there that can automatically do searches for them or refresh current searches that

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.680
they have.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:38.720
Yeah, like Google will ask you, hey, do you want us to give you updates on this term?

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.680
Yeah, that and extensions.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:49.760
Just for example, Google has one and I use it for this exact purpose called the reload

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.760
every.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760
No, that's Firefox.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:59.800
Firefox has one called reload every, and it can set up a refresh for you randomly or every

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:05.200
one second or 10 seconds or 10 minutes or however often you want it to search for you.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.320
And I've read about this, that the mainstream media has these to push Lindsay Lohan and

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.320
stuff.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.800
They're already doing this themselves.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.800
Correct.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:19.360
So this is a tool that info warriors and patriots who just leave their computers on, that they

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.080
can install on their browsers that will help.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.560
Do me a favor, send me a list of those and I'm going to send it to Watson and ask him

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.580
to do a blurb or I'll have Matt Ryan do it.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.440
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a list together of bots we can use to artificially

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.840
inflate our traffic.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.840
Yeah.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:41.040
First, are you telling me that you want non-computer savvy people to start downloading add-ons

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
to their browser?

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.040
And bots?

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.520
Generally speaking, that does not work well.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520
No, no.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.080
Seems irresponsible.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.720
And yeah, this seems like we've- Second, they know what bot traffic looks

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720
like.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720
Yeah.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.880
It is not hard to figure out.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.480
Also like you're on air.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.480
You're planning this scam on air.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.480
It's ridiculous.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.480
All right.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.640
We are going to go rob this bank and I know we are, we've already confirmed that we will

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640
be robbing this bank.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640
How should we do it?

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.480
Well, I will tell you this, we're going to have to walk away fast.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.480
Yes.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480
Ring, ring.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480
Oh, hello caller.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.480
Yeah, have you heard of cars?

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.800
You can use them to get away.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.240
Do you want to drive for us?

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.000
Do you specifically want to announce right now that you have committed to driving for

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
us?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Very strange, very strange.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Not good.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Not good.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So Bob Chapman shows up.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Oh, great.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.720
He's a broadcaster, Bob Chapman.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.960
Yeah, the guy sucks.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.600
But it's not really all that interesting.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600
He's boring even, Alex.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.840
I'm going to shock you this time.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.840
Don't buy gold.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.840
No.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.840
Nope.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.840
It's all about buying gold.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840
Oh, I'm surprised.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:56.240
You can get a copy, a hard copy or an email copy or you can get a free one year subscription

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.200
by getting a small gold coin.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.120
Yeah, the fifth of an ounce, Frank.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.120
Great deal.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.680
That's from Midas Resources offering that.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.420
So here's the point I want to make very clearly.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:15.040
If you're like sort of expert on the economy and the radio show host and the guy who syndicates

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.480
the radio show who also runs a gold company are all intertwined in a bizarre business

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.040
relationship, don't get involved.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.080
They might be untrustworthy.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:33.520
It might be that if the forecaster recommends buying the exact amount of gold that I sell

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.480
– perhaps this is not a good –

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480
Yeah.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.560
And if the forecaster, like his business is doing a newsletter and you can get a free

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:48.200
year of it if you buy gold from the guy whose business might be affected by the forecasts

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.200
–

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.840
Well, if the forecasts are rosy, maybe people might buy more gold.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.840
No, if they're not rosy, people buy more gold.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.560
No, I mean the forecast about gold.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.560
Yes.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560
Yeah.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560
He does forecast good things for gold.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560
Usually.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.560
It's nonsense.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.080
It's very irresponsible.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.600
So you might have forgotten by now, but this was supposed to be about the Rockefeller document.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.120
I do remember that.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.320
So this is the last clip from the 16th.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320
Okay.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.920
When I'm on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., I'm going to cover this in more detail, and I'm going

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.520
to produce a special video this weekend for viral release that will be out by tomorrow

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.200
that's going to deal with eugenics where I'm going to show you a bunch of food and

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.080
their labels and the different poisons that are in them.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:35.080
But a key study that Aaron Dykes found, Rockefeller study, envisions food, future dictatorship

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.520
controlled by the elite.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:41.680
And it gets into controlling food for the environment, total control, martial law, millions

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:47.640
dead, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, biometric IDs to travel, to live.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.940
Read what these monsters are planning for you.

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:55.120
And it's the same thing in hundreds of globalist documents like eco science.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.440
It's about food now?

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440
Mm-hmm.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.160
I don't know what's going on.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.920
So I heard that, and I was like, well, he's going to get into it on Sunday.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.800
So we better check in on Sunday while we're here.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800
Okay.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.800
All right.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.920
So we're going to be covering also the July 18th, 2010 episode.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.200
Oh, God.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.640
I have to tell you this, Jordan.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.920
I got to warn you in advance.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.200
Alex comes in a little hot to the show on Sunday.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.200
Okay.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.200
He's got a head of steam.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.200
All right.

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.200
All right.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.200
Let me at him.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200
Let me at him.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.200
Let me at him.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.200
I am fired up today.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.440
I'm going to try to control myself throughout the next two hours.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.680
It is Sunday, the 18th day of July, 2010.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.040
We're here six days a week, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, back Sundays

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:46.480
4 to 6 p.m.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.740
We have a lot of news.

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:52.780
There's been a big truck bombing in Mexico, part of the drug war down there.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.760
They claim now that they're four days into a successful cap.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.320
I pray this is the truth.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.280
BP has lied in the past, but let's cross our fingers and say a prayer.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.720
These are the same headlines.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:10.240
And why are you still just waiting, seeing with BP?

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240
What is going on?

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.240
What is happening?

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240
I don't know.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240
Okay.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240
It's very strange.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240
All right.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240
But these aren't the reasons Alex is mad.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.240
Sure.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.680
The reason he's mad is because the First Amendment is under attack.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680
Oh, of course.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.200
I'm going to cover all the news today, but the attack on the First Amendment and free

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.400
speech globally is numero uno, the cybersecurity takeover, the open announcements that they

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.600
do want to censor the Web.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:39.080
Friday a listener pointed out the top searches were Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson and not

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.120
even the BP oil spill.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.860
And I pointed out that in the past, my films like Endgame, Terrorstorm, The Obama Deception

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.880
have been the number one search on the Web.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.260
Just that made a lot more sense than it being Lindsay Lohan or the top search should be

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:53.480
depression because we're going into one.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.880
So I said, why don't our users go out and Google the term The Obama Deception to make

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.360
it number one?

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.280
And Friday and Saturday it was number one, more than 20 newspapers and blogs wrote big

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.480
reviews of The Obama Deception, even though it's been out for a year and a half.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:11.700
There are hundreds of versions of it up on YouTube and Google and other video sites,

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.140
but there was one version on a director's channel.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.140
We don't have a director's channel.

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:19.600
That was only allowed at the beginning of YouTube and six years ago and people that

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600
have them still have them.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.400
And so there are several director channels that have posted it all in one part, not broken

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.920
up in 10 parts.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:36.180
And the video had gotten 6.5 million views or it had 6,400,000 and change Friday.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:44.320
By Saturday it had gotten 100,000 additional, well above 6.5 million, about to be 6.6 million.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.320
Well that's well above 6.4 million.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.600
And at that trend I've learned to be able to gauge YouTube, it probably would have had

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.680
another million views in a week or so because it was the number one search term.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:59.800
People did a great job getting that out there, but more importantly, in the last few months

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.880
if you search the term Barack Obama or Obama or President Obama, not the number three link

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.920
had been like that for a year, the number one link on the world wide web on Google and

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.680
Yahoo was The Obama Deception and a link to that mega viral video with 6.5 million views

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.680
and growing.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:23.240
No fucking way, no fucking way was the first link if you search for Obama, Alex's video.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.680
Absolutely not.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:31.920
If that is the case, it's only on Alex's browser based on his searches.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.840
I don't know, I don't believe any of this, but it worked apparently.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.920
Alex's plan worked, he got more traffic.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.880
I would like to know more about the people who posted reviews.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.520
I could only find one or two.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.640
That doesn't surprise me.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.640
And they weren't complimentary.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.680
That also doesn't surprise me.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.760
I would like to have an examination from a film student on that movie.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:04.440
So not all news is rosy, I mean we got definitely more traffic, the plan paid off, we got the

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:11.880
money and ran, but unfortunately the feds might be on to them.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.080
School kids type it in for a school report, college professors, politicians, news people,

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.080
whatever.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.120
You type Obama or President Obama or Barack Obama and it was the number one link.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:29.440
It was hacked and it was taken down off the director channel and it shows done by user.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.440
That's what a hack is.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.000
They go in and once it's deleted, it's gone.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.160
The 6.5 million views is gone.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.800
All the tens of thousands of websites that are linked to that video, it's a dead link

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.000
now.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.560
And so of course, now when you type in Obama, it's the Obama girl or the White House, it's

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.820
not our video.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.600
So that's why the establishment did this.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.440
I have no doubt that it's an inside job from YouTube or Google, one of their employees.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:57.200
I mean this thing was number one, they were panicking and remember this was the YouTube

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.200
presidency.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.480
I mean you go to the White House YouTube site, their videos get like a thousand viewers.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.760
My average video gets about a half mil.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.440
And so they're concerned about this and this is sabotage, this is criminal, but we're not

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.920
going to just lay here and take it.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.840
We come back, I've got a battle plan, a mission for you, if you choose to accept it, we'll

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840
kick their ass.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.240
Google my name more!

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:22.360
Yeah, as soon as I heard that, my first thought was, what do you want to bet that his plan

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:26.320
to deal with this fiasco somehow involves the audience doing more free advertising?

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.760
Yeah, yeah, I would probably argue that.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.860
We'll see if that's the case.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:38.200
So apparently, according to Alex, this website, this user's channel on YouTube got hacked

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.840
and they took down this and it must be an inside job.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.240
It has to be an inside job.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:49.840
Partially inspired by how jealous Obama is of how many views Alex gets.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.760
Yeah, yep, yep, Obama, Obama.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760
President.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.760
President Barack Obama.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.760
Right.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.800
The most well-known man on the planet.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.800
Uh-huh.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800
Yep.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.800
Jealous!

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.800
Widely, widely respected.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.400
Jealous of Alex's star power.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400
Uh-huh.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400
His reach.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400
Yep.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.400
Oh, boy.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.600
Yeah, man, it's like people who get petty over download numbers, you know, or like YouTube

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600
views.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.560
Alex and Obama were beefing.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.480
They had the White House YouTube channel and they weren't getting the same kind of traffic

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.440
that Alex was getting, so they're like, we gotta take him out, we gotta take him out.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.800
I mean, I would say they thoroughly fucked up healthcare at this point, so maybe Obama

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.200
was like, look, I just gotta focus on anything else.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.480
I can't believe I bungled this one, too.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.880
So we'll get into this as we go along, but I want to get out in front of this in advance.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.020
I don't believe that this even happened.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:50.060
The most I believe is that there was a temporary tech glitch or something that's being blown

01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:54.920
out of proportion, or conversely, I could believe that this is all made up.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.040
Here are my reasons for having that position.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.800
One, the video Alex is referring to on the Change the Channel YouTube channel is still

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.780
up and active in the year of Our Lord 2021.

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.220
That's an issue for me.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:11.640
It still has the original publishing date, it didn't lose its view count, nor did any

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.840
of the comments disappear.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.920
There's over 200,000 comments on it, so I couldn't go through all of them, but I was

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.960
able to find some from the time period of around 10 years ago, and none are saying,

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.520
hey, so glad to see this got put back up or anything.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.920
The 200,000 comments thing, too, also is because there have been a couple people who have been

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:35.920
having a running argument for the last couple months in the comments, and it's not even

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.960
replies to comments, it's just individual comments that are responding to each other.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.480
It's impossible to navigate, and they both sound stupid.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.480
What a bunch of assholes.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.280
So two, I was able to find some blogs covering the alleged takedown of this video, and none

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.480
of them can actually confirm that the video was taken down.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.440
All of them rely entirely on claims that trace back to Alex himself, which seems sketchy.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:03.080
Well, it just so happens that the evidence that Alex had, he lost, and the people who

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.640
could have confirmed it, they were already dead.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.800
I'm sorry, Dan, it's true.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.520
Three, I was able to find a forum thread on GameSpot about the claims that the video was

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.520
taken down as an attempt to silence Alex, and some of the posts are a little interesting.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.860
The angry pelican comments, quote, I'm watching that video right now on YouTube.

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:23.360
It's not deleted.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.320
Another user chimed in, quote, I have it on in the background, that KRS-One guy has a

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.320
good analogy.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:34.300
There seems to be a lot of people who are confused that the link that was posted to

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:39.360
a supposedly deleted video page is in fact delivering them to a page that began playing

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.960
a shitty documentary about Obama.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:47.240
So I believe that this is a continuation of the traffic bomb Alex began on his Friday

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.160
show, which he's now heightening on Sunday.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.720
I can't say for certain that the video didn't have an error loading or something like that

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:59.060
at some point, but there's literally no part of my being that believes that hackers got

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:02.640
into a YouTube account and took down the Obama deception.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.520
It's almost the most unbelievable thing I can imagine.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.240
Well, look, now, Alex can prove it.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:14.480
See, when he went to YouTube, the page opened up and it said you have internet connectivity

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.800
issues, which clearly means that the YouTube page was taken down.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800
Obviously.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800
Sure.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.320
If you get if you get that kind of message, there's only one explanation.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.360
So this is a federal crime.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:34.160
When you type the name Obama or President Obama or Barack Obama in, it was the number

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.540
one link on Google and Yahoo.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.360
That was before we had listeners promote the term the Obama deception to make it the number

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.520
one trend search Friday and Saturday.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:50.120
A whole bunch of newspapers reported on the film Saturday someone hacked into the director's

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.920
channel, probably YouTube themselves, and deleted that film.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.960
The Obama deception and my newest film, Police State for the Rise of FEMA.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.860
Luckily, we were Twitter about it by my listeners and we're able to call the director who runs

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:08.560
the director channel to get him inside there to change the passcode before they took all

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.600
the videos down.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.140
The point is, this is a serious federal crime.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:15.400
The point is, this is a hack against this film.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.440
This is an attack against everyone's free speech.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.980
This is all bullshit.

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.160
But the other thing that I want to say, you don't want to take a little time to say this,

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.840
is that if YouTube had deleted the video, which I don't believe they did, I think they

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.080
would have been within their rights to do so.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.080
Well.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.400
Alex is clearly engaging in manipulative practices to artificially game their system.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.360
He's openly discussing that as his plan.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.440
There's even been conversation on a radio show of groups of people using bots to boost

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.000
Alex's view count.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.320
I could easily see an argument being made that this is an abuse of the platform and

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.360
against the terms of service.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.160
That said, YouTube didn't delete this video and there was no hack.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.900
I just wanted to point out that even if this was real, I still wouldn't care.

01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:02.080
It is a federal crime for YouTube to enforce its terms of service policies, Dan.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.080
That's true.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080
Yep.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.640
So Alex shot a video the night before.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:10.800
On Saturday night, he, this is so serious that he had to shoot a video talking about

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.640
how this video got taken down.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.440
Is he going to talk about how people should Google bomb in the video about how people

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.440
should Google bomb?

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440
No, no, no.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.440
This is so much more important.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.760
This is about an assault on free speech.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.660
My friends, there has been an assault on the first amendment and free speech.

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:32.600
The Obama deception has been erased, obliterated, censored, put into the memory hole.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600
Oh no.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.600
Why is this important?

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.120
Obama deals with the first amendment and free speech, but this hack was illegal.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:46.800
These people legal hacks and somehow got our passcode and deleted this film and other documentaries

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.840
I've made so that you don't have a right to watch it and make up your own mind.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.960
So you don't have the right to watch it.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.960
They're taking away your rights.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960
All right.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.680
So it still hasn't been taken down though.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.160
No, it's still up.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160
Yeah.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160
That's an issue.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160
You can still watch it now.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.160
The present day is a problem.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.160
Yeah.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.000
And this was so funny.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.400
Alex describes what it was like to experience this hack.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.040
This is still from the video from the night before.

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.040
And I got-

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.640
It's not his YouTube channel though, right?

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.960
No, it's another guy.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:16.960
It's another guy.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.400
But they work together apparently.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.400
Oh, okay.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.080
But there's some sort of a working relationship.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.080
All right.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:28.560
And I got to say, this is where things reached a level of like bad movie slash farce.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:33.400
Luckily, one of my webmasters happened to be writing a story about the fact that the

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:38.200
Obama deception was getting hundreds of thousands of views a day and was the number one trend

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.540
being searched on major search engines.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.960
So within 15 minutes of him being removed, we were getting Twitter pings telling us it

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960
was down.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.120
So I called the director's channel who we work with and I said, hey, your site's being

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120
hacked.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.120
He drove in from a barbecue he was at, went in within an hour of this starting and was

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:04.360
watching someone live in the interface, deleting my films, deleting police day for the rise

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:09.080
of FEMA and the Obama deception, and thank God we could change the passcode before it

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.080
continued.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.920
Saw a little guy creeping around inside the YouTube account.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.120
There's the little gremlin that steals videos.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.600
I see him.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:24.120
He was eating the video, but he hadn't quite finished eating it yet.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120
Oh boy.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.120
Yep.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.120
Hmm.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.120
That's something.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120
That's good days.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120
Yeah.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120
That's good days.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120
That's another, that's actually reason four.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.840
I don't believe that happened, but I didn't want to spoil the fun.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.460
So Alex has said that he has a way to fight back.

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:44.560
And so in this report that he's playing, he has the solution.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.560
Here's the good news.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.080
We can fight back.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.760
And the destiny of this documentary is now in your hands.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.440
You can do several things.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.360
Number one, go find the links on YouTube, Google, and other sites where the video is

01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:02.240
still posted and send that link out to everyone and tell them, this is a censored film.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.620
This is a film that the establishment doesn't want you to see.

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:10.040
This is a number one film that was deleted sensors.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:16.480
These criminals, these 21st century book burners, every time they attack freedom of speech and

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.260
creativity and expression that the American people and the people of the world are going

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:28.060
to strike back, send the links to the Obama deception out to everyone, you know, and go

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:33.420
to Google and Yahoo and other major search engines and the Obama deception every day

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:38.300
when you first log into your computer and let's keep it at the top of the trends chart.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.820
Let's make it the number one search term in the world that it was.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:48.000
Let's have the Obama deception rise from the ashes like a Phoenix carrying the light of

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.940
liberty and freedom.

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:53.000
It is up to all of you to carry this torch forward.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Wow.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Wow.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.400
Can I throw a baseball back in time?

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.960
I don't know.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.680
Do I have the arm strength for that?

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680
I don't think so.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.440
I can reach 88 miles an hour.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.840
I know that for a fact.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.360
So you can see how Alex is doing the exact same thing here as he did on Friday, just

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.120
super heightened.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.080
He's created a fake problem and he's made it emotionally resonant to the audience and

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.660
then he's made sure that they know the only way for them to really fight back is to do

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.500
more free promotional work for Alex and his websites.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.400
Instead of appealing to the audience's understandable feeling that the oil spill was more important

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.220
than celebrity news, then co-opting that for his own benefit, this time Alex has made the

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:37.120
supposed deleting of his videos into an attack on the audience themselves and freedom.

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.480
This is psychopath level shit.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:47.720
So what you're saying is that you've manufactured this lie about the video being taken down

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:55.040
in order to convince your listeners to, one, share other versions of the same video, which

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.040
if the video were censored, Dan.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.040
Right.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.040
Well, it's censored on that one that had all the views.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.040
Uh-huh.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040
Yeah.

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:11.620
So we need to pump up the other views on the other ones, which if that is the point, those

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.440
will be taken down in the same way.

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.440
Right.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.440
Yep.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.440
And then we'll do it again.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.440
All right.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440
Yep.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.440
Okay.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:26.960
So I remember hearing pretty regularly that the reason that Alex was embarking on this

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.640
was because he was offended that BP was not higher up on the trends, because that's an

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.680
important story, whereas Lindsay Lohan and Val Gibson, not important.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.200
I think we may have lost sight of that particular detail.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.200
No, we didn't.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.200
Oh, okay.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.280
No, but Alex is about to turn heel on BP.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.280
Okay.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:49.800
The establishment could not put up Friday and Saturday with the number one search trend

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:57.680
in the world, not being Lindsay Lohan or Mel Gibson or BP oil spill.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.840
It was the Obama deception because of all of you out there getting the word out.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:08.280
And the video that was the top link, and this has been going on for at least a month, when

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.620
you type in the name Obama and any variation thereof was this film.

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:18.480
So now BP oil spill is an example of something that the globalists wanted to trend over Alex,

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.960
as opposed to the reason he's doing this.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.960
Uh-huh.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:22.960
Uh-huh.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.960
This is silly.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.960
It's slippery.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.600
He literally was saying that BP should be the top trend.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.560
It should be the number one over Lindsay Lohan, and the problem with these globalists is they're

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.720
trying to make it number one over things like Lindsay Lohan and me.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.720
Yeah.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.720
Terrible.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.720
Awful.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.720
This is outrageous.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.280
The leadership of the highest order that they're trying to make BP the number one story, Dan.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:49.240
Which I was advocating for yesterday in order to justify making me the number one.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.560
But now it's not about that.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.560
It's bigger than that.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.760
It's about me now.

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:58.520
So we're back to the regular show, not the video you'd shot the night before.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:03.840
And this is where I think I would say this reaches its natural conclusion.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.340
These censors aren't going to have their way, but let's not stop there.

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:12.840
Let's make the second search in case they've blacklisted and blacked out the entire term,

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.840
Obama deception.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:21.280
In case these McCarthy-ites have done that, I want you to search the term infowars.com.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.160
No www in front of it, just infowars.com, and just type it into your search engine over

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:29.560
and over again, and we'll see how they like it.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.960
Yeah, we'll see how they like it.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.960
This is naked.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.720
Lying, manipulative piece of shit.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:37.720
What?

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.640
How can you listen to that and not go, fuck you?

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.680
It's the kind of thing that I see.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:49.960
I'm offended by how manipulative it is, and how if you were someone who took him seriously,

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.320
this would be a really tough thing to experience, because it's all fake.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.680
But looking at it now from a ten years later perspective, it's hard not to laugh at how

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:07.400
embarrassingly clear this is of a charade he's putting on in order to try and gain more

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.400
traffic.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:13.560
Yeah, it would probably not work if you just said, hey guys, I would like you to artificially

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.280
inflate my traffic so I can become more well-known.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.240
No, but if you put on a pageant.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.800
Oh, it's the government and the BPs and the lockstep and all of this stuff.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.160
Look, celebrities are trending when it should be serious stories like BP, and so what we

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:36.160
need to do is we need to get my documentary about Obama to be the number one, so we do

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:43.440
that and then we pretend that it gets censored and now we're angry, so we do it more.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:47.240
Then why didn't it work the first time?

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.240
I buy a new house.

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.840
Why didn't it work the first time?

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.960
So Alex now gets to what I would describe as the yelling phase.

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.320
I would like a gremlin to eat up all of his shows.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.400
Now listen, I've made the film.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.400
On the level playing field of ideas, I won the Super Bowl.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.440
I kicked their hand in.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.080
I sat up here and didn't visit with my children for months.

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.960
I worked seven days a week to make this documentary and fly all over the country and spend hundreds

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.240
of thousands of dollars to make it, and I gave it to you for free, and I kicked their

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.240
butt.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240
And now I need you to pay for it.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:27.560
I need you to pay for it, take an action with it, and these scumbags don't like it.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:33.080
Google tells me I can't sell a t-shirt with his stinkin' image on it.

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:36.560
They tell me I can't sell this video, and I put up with it.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:41.120
We wrote an article about it six months ago, but left it at that, and now they won't even

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.400
let me give it out for free when they put their stinkin' ads on it, and I know they're

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.680
the ones that get it.

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.040
I think the problem with the t-shirt was like a copyright thing.

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.040
Um.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.040
Because he steals just about everything.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.560
And he doesn't seem to understand.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:58.920
For someone who's really into property rights, intellectual property seems to be a complicated

01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.920
pickle.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:01.080
Not interested, though.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.360
Intellectual is in the name, so not interested.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:12.560
Yeah, so he spends a little bit of time freaking out and yelling, and like, I was blown away

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.920
listening to this, like how clear it is that it's just like, everything is driving towards

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.920
just like self-promotion.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.800
I need all of you to be my street team.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.800
I need you to do this.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.800
Yep.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.920
They let Obama and the Globalist and BP and all of them spew their propaganda on the web,

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:33.840
but I can't put my films out.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.880
And they didn't even make up some hanky-panky, because every time they file false complaints

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.200
against me, I just file in federal court.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.880
You know behind the scenes I've had to file in federal court no fewer than eight times

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:48.100
in the last year and a half to keep that stinkin' video up for you?

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:52.520
You know I've had to go in there and file against false copyright claims and tell people

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.280
put up or shut up, let's go to court.

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.280
Maybe real ones.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.880
I've had to file in federal court so you can see what Barack Obama really is.

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:04.380
I am busting my butt here to bring you this information, and I'm not complaining.

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:06.960
My family and my children in this country are worth it.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:11.800
I'm not gonna be a slave to a bunch of authoritarians, and this is authoritarian tyranny that this

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.280
country's going into.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.280
And I know you understand that, and you're upset out there as listeners, so I'm gonna

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:19.560
beg you on my knees for all of our future.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:22.520
Don't say it.

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.960
We caught them inside the interface deleting videos one after the other, and they weren't

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:30.800
able to get downfall the Republican, that director's account, two million views.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.000
I want you, because that's basically part two of the Obama deception, and quite frankly

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.360
is even more powerful film, though this is the mega-viral.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:43.000
I want you to get that video, I mean here's the homework if you choose to take this mission.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.560
Search into the term over and over again, Obama Deception Censored.

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:52.520
Search the term Infowars.com, and search the term Fall of the Republic.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.800
Fall of the Republic.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.480
Yeah, so now he's promoting the sequel.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:58.640
Oh man.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.960
Oh boy.

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:05.220
Is this how movies should advertise from here on out?

01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:11.280
Should we have more movies just being like, listen, this movie is coming out on January

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.120
21st, and you are going to love it.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:19.480
But they don't want you to see it on January 21st, so what you all need to do to see this

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:25.400
movie is Google the name of this movie, and January 21st, because they're censoring it.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.400
Or something.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.120
I think it's an unethical ad campaign.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:35.400
I don't know if it would be effective outside the context of a very trapped audience like

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.520
Alex has, but, hmm.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.560
Isn't that what happened with the Snyder Cut or whatever?

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.960
I choose not to know anything about that.

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:44.960
That's smart.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.960
Me neither.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:46.960
I just know the words Snyder Cut.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.400
I've seen it mentioned a couple times, and each time I'm like, I'm gonna go the other

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.400
way.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.400
I just don't need any of that.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.400
I know, I just like, uh, yeah.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.040
So they took this down, right?

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.080
This documentary.

01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.200
They have not proven that.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.200
No.

01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:59.200
I don't believe it either.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.280
But they did it in order to keep it from you, because they're afraid.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.520
I understand these trends.

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:07.920
It would have gotten a million in the next week, probably two million the next week.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.680
They know we hit the zeitgeist.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:14.760
They know we caused a chain reaction, and they went in, and they shut this video down

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:19.240
so you don't have access to it, and so you don't have a right to see it.

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.060
They're gonna decide what you get to see.

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:25.620
This is 21st century book burning, and then I've got stacks of news right here in front

01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.620
of me.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.620
I mean, here's one.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:31.920
Feds Ignore Due Process, First Amendment, shut down thousands of blogs.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:33.440
That should be the number one story.

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:36.440
3,000 blogs were shut down last week.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.760
No judge, no jury, no nothing.

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:46.000
Vice President Biden and intellectual property enforcement coordinator Victoria Espinel gave

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.800
an order, and they've got quotes here.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.360
The DMC takedown actions were a direct violation of the First Amendment under prior restraint,

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.560
however, explains law professor Wendy Seltzer.

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.480
Because the DMC takedowns are privately administered through ISPs, they have not received constitutional

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.240
scrutiny despite the high risk of error, Seltzer adds.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:17.040
So this is the White House now issuing 73,000 takedown orders this week, mainly of blogs

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:20.080
critical of Barack Hussein Obama.

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:25.760
So Alex is talking about the blog platform Blogotry here, and there were some initial

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:31.560
theories that people were kicking around that the platform was taken down due to DMCA complaints,

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.860
but that was just purely speculation.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:37.820
It came out a couple days later that the reason that the server that housed Blogotry kicked

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:43.500
it off and thus removed 73,000 or so blogs was that someone was using the server to host

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:49.200
an Al-Qaeda recruitment website, complete with a hit list and instructions on bomb making.

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.020
Blogotry was hosted on server's own by Burst.net, who got contacted by the FBI regarding this

01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:58.060
terrorism stuff, and they decided to stop working with Blogotry.

01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:02.560
Apparently there had been some past terms of service violations that are unspecified,

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.480
so they must have just decided that if they were allowing an Al-Qaeda site to stay up,

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.800
they may represent too much of a risk to stay on the servers.

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.900
Yeah, that's probably smart.

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:16.880
I'm not sure in the end what happened with all this, but as of July 21st, 2010, there

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:22.000
was an article on CNET about Burst.net's efforts to try to get the data from people's blogs

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.440
back to them, so they could have their blog, but they would not re-host Blogotry, so the

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.920
users would just have to find another platform to use.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.560
You shouldn't lose all of your content or whatever, yeah.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:36.240
And I think that to the extent that that was possible, they were saying that they were

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.920
going to find a way to make that happen.

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:39.920
Sure.

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:44.400
There's no indication that any of these affected blogs were critical of Obama, or if any were,

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.880
that it had anything to do with these actions.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.120
Alex is just making that up, because it's a concurrent headline that can be used to

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.000
strengthen his Obama deception censorship pageant.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.260
They are taking down 73,000 blogs, and no one's talking about it, which is why you need

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:03.160
to Google the Obama deception right now.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:08.340
Also to be clear, that stuff about Biden and Victoria Espinal, that was an unrelated story

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:13.960
from June, where there was discussion about the massive economic costs of copyright infringement.

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.560
The Infowars story about the blogs being removed just kind of assumes that the reason that

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:22.600
they got taken down was copyright violations, so the whole angle is that, but it's not true.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:27.400
And also, you can just tell, Alex is like, he doesn't even know how the story on Infowars

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:28.400
fits together.

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.400
Yeah.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.120
He's just finding bits and pieces of it, and reading it.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.120
Yeah, he's playing Mad Libs.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.120
Yeah.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.480
And using it in a way to justify whatever the story already is.

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480
Yeah.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.480
So look.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480
What?

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.480
The internet.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480
They're doing some censoring.

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.480
Sure.

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.400
But you know what would be hard to censor?

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:46.400
The internet?

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.400
The real world.

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.400
Oh.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.400
Don't let them stop you.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.400
Go low tech.

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.520
Get free links to it online, but also buy the high quality DVD with the expanded extras,

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.080
and make copies of this.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.880
I mean, making 100 copies of this might cost you 50 bucks.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.800
And give it out to everybody you know.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.560
Air it on Access Television.

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.040
Show it to your local church.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.000
Tell everybody you know the system doesn't want you to see the Obama deception.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.320
Now this is the most viral film I've ever released, but this was part two, Fall of the

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.320
Republic.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.440
Ooh, we got part two here.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:21.440
This is absolutely 100% televangelist shit.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.440
That is fucking...

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.440
Yeah.

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.520
Oh, yes, it may cost you a little bit of money, but you need to know that this is about the

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:29.520
law.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.520
You can spread the word.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.520
You need to get this out.

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.520
Spread the good word.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.520
You need to make sure that you are converting people to the word of Christ.

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:37.520
Yeah.

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:38.680
This next clip is a little jarring.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.680
I found his switch in tone a little bit weird.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.240
They can't arrest all of us.

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.320
It's over.

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.320
It's over.

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.440
We're done.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.120
We're done rolling over.

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.960
We're done giving in.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.560
I've got a deal right now on Infowars.com, and you click on both the shopping carts.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.840
We've got two different shopping carts, whatever your choice is, where you can get four films

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.040
for $19.95.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:03.520
I don't even make money on that because I put a free pocket constitution in every order.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.480
Okay, with the cost of the film and everything else, that comes out to less than $5 per film.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.200
If you get 10 films, it's $39.95.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.200
That's very weird.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.200
Wow.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.200
That's...

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.200
It's over.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.200
It's over.

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:18.200
It's done.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.200
It's fucking done.

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.440
We're all dead, and there's two for one sales right now.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440
I got a deal.

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.440
I got a deal, baby.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440
Yeah.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440
Oh, man.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.440
So, Alex throws to break really, really passionate.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.960
He's freaking me out a little bit, but the underlying message here is that the only thing

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:44.240
you need to do to break the will of the NWO, to destroy them, is support Alex's stuff and

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.240
give him free publicity.

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.520
That sounds right.

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:51.320
You print up an image of Obama as the Joker, and you say, Google Obama deception, and you

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:57.320
never stop, and you let these Nazi bloodsucking anti-American parasites that want to make

01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:04.520
you and your family slaves know that we are standing up against them, and we are red-blooded,

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.840
and we are not slaves, and we are not bowing down to them.

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.840
I'm not bowing down.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.320
I'm at the tip of the spear.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.480
I get death threats every day, and you know what?

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.240
I am honored to be who I am.

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.520
I'm honored to just be an average person that stood up 15 years ago and said, I'm going

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.520
to defend the Republic.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.240
I'm going to defend the family.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.760
I'm going to defend the Second Amendment.

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.320
I'm going to fight against abortion.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.360
I'm going to see what happens when I really take action, and we have laid waste to the

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:31.360
enemy.

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.960
If you simply unloose yourselves and become the leaders you are, we will sweep this scum

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:36.960
into the gutter.

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:39.120
We will defeat the New World Order.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.120
We will crush the tyranny.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:44.640
Second hour, straight ahead, stay with us!

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.640
Oof.

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.640
Oh, boy.

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.640
Yeah.

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:48.640
Oh, man.

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:49.640
Yeah.

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.640
That was a little much.

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.640
Oh, boy.

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:55.960
It sounds like on Thursday, a producer was like, uh, Alex, we are, look, DVD sales have

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.960
gone way down.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.960
Yeah.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.960
Way down.

01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:59.960
Yeah.

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:03.400
And then you can hear, this is like, this is like after a comic has been on the road

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:09.160
for a year, and they bought 200 t-shirts, and they got 190 in the box.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:10.160
Yep.

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.160
And they're like, I'm going to get a bath on this printing.

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.440
Yeah, this was a bad idea.

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:15.000
You know, I can't give these away.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Yeah.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.920
Well, we better turn your family's continued existence into something that's conditional

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.920
on buying this shirt.

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.320
That'll get this shirt out.

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:26.320
Yep.

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:27.320
Yeah.

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.700
So, oh, God, just more of this.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.440
The globalists tapped my phones, folks.

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.900
They know I'm real.

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:35.240
They know what we're doing is effective.

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:38.880
They have all these statistics, and I never really get up here and toot my horn.

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.880
And I just tell you, we're having a big effect, folks.

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:41.880
We're having a big effect.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:42.880
We're having a big effect.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:47.280
And now they've gone in and hacked and taken down my film, The Obama Deception, the one

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.360
that had the biggest views and was the top link under the name Obama when you searched

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.360
his name.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.700
You think the White House liked when they searched the name Barack Obama or President

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:59.300
Obama or Obama, that a video exposing him as a traitorous globalist was the number one

01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:03.560
link in the last month or the number one search term in the last two days?

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.200
Let's not let them stop us.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.000
Let's search the term, Fall of the Republic, my newest film on the globalist.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.680
Let's search the term Police State for the Rise of FEMA that they also erased, Police

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.940
State for the Rise of FEMA.

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:16.020
Let's search the term Infowars.com.

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:19.240
Let's jam them all into there so we can't be stopped.

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:22.300
Stuart, Antonio, John, Mark, Doug, Jared, we're going to get to all of you.

01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:23.440
It doesn't end.

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.640
It just keeps going.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:31.740
This entire show is more or less just doubling down on this spamming organization.

01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:39.620
We need to organize against Obama's policies and I don't know what any of them are and

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:44.600
sure we're about to take control of the Senate because the Democratic Party is shit, but

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:49.360
I'm going to have to say the only way to stop him is to make him feel bad when he Googles

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.760
his own name.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.920
In my imagination.

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.000
So Alex takes a call from a guy and he's trying to pump him up about doing free street teamwork

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.360
for him.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:04.480
We're hitting everybody right now is a test because the bottom fell out of Obama.

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.120
He is their front man, their messianic savior.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:11.120
He was supposed to bring us into the world government and it isn't working, is it?

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.340
So we ought to be happy.

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:15.680
We ought to be happy and it just lets me know the effect we're having.

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.760
So what are we going to do about it, Antonio?

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.560
Are you going to fight in?

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.840
Are you going to send everybody the links to the Obama deceptions that are still online?

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.800
Are you going to make copies of the DVDs?

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:29.240
Are you going to go and search the term Infowars.com to drive it into the top of the trends?

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:32.280
Yeah, they're only making us mad to do it more.

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.440
Antonio, great job.

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:35.440
Anything else?

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.220
No, sir.

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:41.260
This caller is so close to recognizing the dynamic that's happening here.

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:45.440
When Alex asks if he's going to burn the DVDs and send out links and all sorts of free street

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:51.000
teamwork for Infowars, the caller says, quote, they're only making us mad to do it more.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Yep.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
That's totally correct.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.920
Except the imaginary globalists aren't the ones making him mad in order to get him to

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:58.320
post more links to Infowars.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.320
Alex is doing that.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.320
Yeah.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.320
Yeah.

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:08.280
You didn't stop and think, will the globalists be mad about this or will Alex just be more

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.280
famous?

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.280
Yeah.

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.280
Hmm.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.120
I might be wrong here.

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.120
Yeah.

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:15.760
This one could be on me.

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:16.760
You know what?

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.360
I'm going to stick around and I'm going to stay listening for the rest of my life.

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.360
You bet.

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.200
And I'm going to double down on sending out links to everybody who just erases them.

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.520
I could either engage in self-reflection or I can send out links.

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:29.520
Yeah.

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.200
And you know, I'm definitely going to keep sending these links to people who have long

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.920
ago put my shit filtered into the spam folder.

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.920
Oh yeah.

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:40.240
Forward, forward, forward, forward.

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.240
Nope.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.480
So Alex gets another caller and this guy is weird.

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:53.540
He seems to be a fan of some financial broadcast and apparently people on this broadcast have

01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.960
been wanting to have a debate with Alex about something.

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.960
Sure.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:59.400
And Alex has been ducking them or something along those lines.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.400
It's pretty unclear.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.640
This past Saturday on the webcast from Financial Sense Online, Jim Poplava, who is the proprietor,

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:09.200
said that your office hasn't gotten back to him yet.

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.480
Well, here's another issue.

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.720
You know, I've done an hour and 36 minutes and spent about 30 seconds plugging the films.

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:19.080
We have sponsors and video and t-shirt and book sales at Fundus.

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:22.240
I'm sorry, what the fuck did you just say to me?

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.240
What the fuck did you just say to me?

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:28.360
I've been doing the week here as well and I turn down probably 10, 15 interviews a day.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.880
I can't do them all physically and I know there's a lot of big sites that want to have

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.880
me on.

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:35.200
I've tried to recruit other people.

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.360
I've tried to find other hosts I could promote.

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:40.840
They usually turn into egomaniacs and have mental problems and they can't handle the

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.560
power and so I can't do it all as my problem.

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.520
Oh, they turn into egomaniacs.

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:50.760
Look, I just can't afford to advertise.

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.920
So you guys do it.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.680
I don't understand what this is.

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.680
This isn't complicated.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.680
No, I mean like you responded to exactly the point of that clip that made me angry.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.680
God damn it.

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.120
He's like, I haven't plugged but like 30 seconds on this show or whatever.

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.720
It's like you have plugged the entire show.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:12.680
You turned the show into you being mad and then plugging.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:19.560
Yeah, the last two episodes of the show, the Friday and Sunday show, have been protracted

01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:26.600
nonstop experimental long form advertising, immersive advertising.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.720
It's outrageous.

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:33.800
I do think that there's a possibility that Alex doesn't like experience that as plugging

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:39.480
or whatever, but taken from like an external viewpoint, like that's all he's doing.

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.480
Yeah.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480
Everything.

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480
That's it.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480
Yeah.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.680
No, this is complaining about not getting enough views.

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.360
That's all this is.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:49.360
Yep.

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:54.160
He's being mad that Mel Gibson's racism is more interesting than his.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.160
Yeah.

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.520
Lindsay Lohan's more famous than him.

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:57.520
That's a struggle.

01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:58.520
Yep.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:46:59.520
Yep.

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.760
So we have one last clip here and it's how the show ends on Sunday.

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:02.760
Okay.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.760
Boy, it's familiar.

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.520
We're getting a lot of new stations, so we're on AM, shortwave, satellite, and the internet.

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.000
They're not going to shut us down easily.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.860
We've got to stand up against these sensors.

01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:17.840
They're testing us right now, seeing if they can get away with what they're doing.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.160
Let's counter them by getting the Obama deception out to everyone and info wars.com out to everyone.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.240
God bless you all.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.240
It's the same.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.500
It's just, it ends as it started.

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:30.680
It ends as it, it died as it lived that episode.

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:37.080
Like I'm, I'm baffled and also kind of tickled and confused because I went back trying to

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.800
find the coverage of the Rockefeller Duck.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800
Yeah.

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:41.800
Yeah.

01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.800
Yeah.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.800
Yeah.

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.800
The most important document of all time.

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:49.600
Yeah, with that, Alex was all over and the plan, the plan.

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:54.200
He revealed the whole plan, got the information out to everybody.

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:59.400
Now I might be cynical, I might be a little jaded by my time covering Alex, but I will

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:03.760
say that my experience of listening to these episodes was that it was about something else

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.760
altogether.

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.960
He barely cared at all about it.

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.880
Feels like he even told people not to worry about it so much.

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.880
Yeah.

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:16.960
He said, let's get that Obama deception out there.

01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:18.440
I mean, here's the thing.

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:19.440
Okay.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:25.120
So what we've recontextualized that dumb fuck video as is first off, he's a lying piece

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.760
of shit in the present.

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:33.360
And second, if he isn't a lying piece of shit, if he is claiming that he predicted this entire

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:42.360
thing, that he failed on a level so incomprehensible that I had to listen to four fucking hours

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.920
of him tell people to Google the Obama deception instead of him warning the free world that

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.080
we're all about to die.

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.600
I mean, you would think that if he had come into the possession of this plan document

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.880
that was like laid it all out there.

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:56.880
Yeah.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:57.880
Yeah.

01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:58.880
I would want details.

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:04.640
I think you'd spend more time on it than he did spend probably more time talking about

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:10.720
the BP situation and how let's hope they're telling the truth, which is not hard hitting

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720
news.

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720
Nope.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720
Yeah.

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:21.300
There's very little by way of the, and that's why the present day 2021 video about the coverage

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:26.680
of the Rockefeller document is so thin because he barely even touched the thing.

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:31.200
It was just another headline that he was able to roll with.

01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:33.080
Paul wrote an article about it.

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:39.800
Alex could skim it and say some scary words and it could be used to help scare the audience

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:46.600
and brow beat them into a place where they'll Google things for him.

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.980
Here's what I'll say.

01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:50.200
Fuck him.

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:58.160
And two, if you are listening to that and you do not immediately demand the knowledge

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:03.480
of what are the steps that the globalists are going to take in order to implement lock

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.000
step, how can we stop each of these individual steps in order to prevent lock step from happening?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.960
And instead he just says, it's going to happen and the only way to stop it is to Google the

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:15.960
Obama deception.

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.460
Get the word out, which means promote my shit.

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:24.360
In this situation, not only is he not at all a hero for predicting this or anything along

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:32.060
those lines, he is, he is, he's aiding and abetting the globalists in this regard.

01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:34.960
He's aiding and abetting the imaginary villains in his head.

01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.960
Exactly.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:36.960
Yep.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.960
Jesus.

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.960
Yeah.

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.960
It was not what I expected.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:45.960
I mean, in terms of, in a, in a way, yes, it was what you expected.

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:50.760
I expected something, yeah, I don't know what I expect.

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:56.520
You, you know, you expect the unexpected with Alex, but yeah, you didn't expect that.

01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:02.200
No, I did not expect two episodes of Google talk.

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.200
What a piece of shit.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.200
Yeah, he's the worst.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.200
Yep.

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.520
Anyway, we'll be back on Friday, Jordan, but until then we have a website.

01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.520
We do have a website.

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:09.920
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.400
Really easy to sum up this episode because it doesn't really talk about the, not hard,

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.000
doesn't really talk about the Rockefeller document.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.920
It just annoyed the shit out of you.

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:19.920
We're also on Twitter.

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:20.920
We are on Twitter.

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:21.920
It's that knowledge.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:22.920
I'm just going to fight that.

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:23.920
Go to bed, Jordan.

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.920
Yeah, we're also on Facebook.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:25.920
We are on Facebook.

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.840
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.120
doing God's work right now.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:32.680
We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo.

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:33.680
I'm Leo.

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:34.680
I'm DZX Clark.

01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.680
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.000
I'm a, how about you go Google strategic relocation.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Andy in Kansas.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
You're on the air.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Thanks for holding.

Well, Alex, I'm a first time caller.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440
I'm a huge fan.

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440
I love your work.

01:51:46.440 --> 01:52:14.880
Thanks for having me.
