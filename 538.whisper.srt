00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,960
Saying we are the bad guys

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm Jordan

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,840
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk just a little bit

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
about Alex Jones

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh indeed we are Dan

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Jordan

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Dan

Jordan

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Blackjack

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Did I win?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh okay

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's not how this works

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Then I have a quick question for you

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's your bright spot?

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Blackjack, I've been playing a lot of online blackjack lately

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh well that works

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That makes things much easier

45
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I guess it's kind of related to that, but that was a joke

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,920
I guess one of my bright spots I think is kind of like, I'm starting to forgive myself

47
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,720
for enjoying video games

48
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
I like that

49
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,400
Like we talk about, you know, some games we're playing every now and again in these bright

50
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
spots

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Sure

52
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,760
You know, I've started to recognize some of these like unexamined biases I have towards

53
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,400
myself for liking video games

54
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Okay

55
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,480
You know, and like growing up they were so, like my parents were very against video games

56
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
like you play

57
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Sure

58
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
You play half an hour a day

59
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
You just keep on, yeah

60
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Then I'm gonna throw that thing out the window

61
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Totally, totally

62
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,300
And there was, you know, it's always been like something that you could be doing something

63
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,400
better than that

64
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,920
And I think I have a little bit of self-appointed stigma about it

65
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,040
And I'm starting to feel a little bit less that way

66
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Yeah

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,760
And I think part of that is just like I'm recognizing there are a lot of really good

68
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,680
video games that are a lot of fun and

69
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Yeah

70
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,880
I don't know, taking away a little bit of that shame is good

71
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,640
Yeah, no that's great because I've always had that same experience that even if you

72
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,360
classify it as like a complete leisure activity you should be doing better leisure activities

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,400
You know, like, oh you're playing a video game as a leisure activity, what you should

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,360
be doing is going out to a park

75
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Yeah

76
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,520
And throwing the ball around and it's like I get that and sometimes I do

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,200
I got a video game for you, it's called The Museum, get over that

78
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah, exactly

79
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
Yeah, there's a lot of that

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Yeah

81
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,920
I don't know, I think it's good to retain a little bit of it lest I descend into only

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
one

83
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,880
No, no, no, for sure, you can go far, you can go too far with anything

84
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,740
I'm finding a balance, anyway, what about you?

85
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
I like it

86
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,760
Dan, there's a new Mogwai album out, Dan, and that is important to me

87
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,960
Don't feed that album after midnight

88
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,720
Alright, okay, Dan

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,760
No, it's really interesting to me that there's a new album all the way in 2021 because I

90
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,520
think the first time I saw them live was in 2001 and they've been putting out music since

91
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,480
the late 80s, but it's Mogwai, so it's not like the Rolling Stones are those old bands

92
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,920
of like 70 year olds who are still touring, it's weird post-rock, so everybody who goes

93
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,760
is like, I wanna hear your new shit, post-rock all sounds basically the same

94
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,600
I have an interesting confession to make

95
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
What's that?

96
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
I know nothing about Mogwai

97
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,160
You don't know anything about Mogwai?

98
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
No

99
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,800
Oh shit, Mogwai is one of the most important, first off, Scottish bands there's ever been

100
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,440
and second, Mogwai helped create the entire genre of post-rock as we know it

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,920
Yeah, this is a big blind spot for me, clearly, because you could have told me they were metal

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,720
or folk, and I wouldn't have believed either

103
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,240
Well, now let me tell you something about post-rock, Dan

104
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Oh, no

105
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,160
There are elements of metal and folk that have been applied

106
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Goddammit

107
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,800
And they have wound up influencing other...

108
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,720
It's only fair that I sit through this music lecture because I got a lot to get through

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
in terms of Professor Dan today, so

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Fair enough, okay

111
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,000
Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over, I think there's a lot of in's

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,120
and out's, a lot of twists and hoo-boy

113
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,720
But before we get down to business on that, let's take a little moment to say thank you

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,600
to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I think that's a great idea

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,720
So first, Nick, and this is spelled N-I-K, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

Thank you very much, however, you are also my enemy, for I am Spunglodorf

126
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Oh no

127
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,400
Next, thank you to Eviscerated by a Reptoid Over Cadbury Eggs, thank you so much, you

128
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,500

I'm a policy wonk

Thank you very much, vision of all of our fates

131
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,720
Next, Dante H, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

132
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm a policy wonk

133
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Thanks, Dante

134
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,440
Thank you, and finally, I'd like to say thank you to a technocrat out there, actually it's

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,600
two people split into technocrats, so maybe they're both, ah, who knows

136
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
We'll see

137
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,960
Anyway, Matt and Bin, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat, or technocrats, you

138
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
decide

139
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm a policy wonk

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,120
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

141
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,440
How's your 401k doing, bro?

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,120
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

143
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's just get down to business, we ain't making that money off that heroin, why you

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,740
pimps so good?

145
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,920
My neck is freakishly large, I declare info war on you

146
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,720
Thank you so much, Matt and Bin

147
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you

148
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,760
And Jordan, we got a little bit of a special occasion to celebrate today

149
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Did we?

150
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,000
Yep, it's Mogwai's birthday

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,040
Oh no, oh shit, somebody fed him after midnight

152
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,960
No, no, we got a special birthday shout out going out to Easter, happy birthday out there

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
The holiday of Easter?

154
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,120
No, a person by the name of Easter

155
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,240
Oh, Astarte, the Sumerian god of, ooh, nope

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,640
Maybe, no, but I am excited that Easter candy is starting to show up

157
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Oh man

158
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,480
At the Walgreens and what have you

159
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
I do appreciate that

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Very pumped

161
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,040
Reese's peanut butter eggs are put out there, February 15th, baby

162
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,120
I like those, the eggs, the hard shelled eggs, the mini eggs, those are the best

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Those are fantastic

164
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Holy shit, they're so good

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
No, they're incredible

166
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,760
So anyway, happy birthday, Easter, I hope you enjoy some Easter candy

167
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Yes, please

168
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
And everybody's doing well

169
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,200
Yeah, the thing that I, it's terrible, but my partner is allergic to peanuts

170
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,920
And so I have to hoard Reese's peanut butter eggs and eat them like a squirrel before I

171
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
get home

172
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Yeah

173
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,120
And then like mouthwash and brush my teeth, but Dan, they're worth it

174
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm going to get you some Reese's almond butter eggs

175
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
How dare you, sir

176
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,320
Not quite the same

177
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
No

178
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,040
So Jordan, we didn't have an episode on Friday and in the interest of full transparency,

179
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,760
I want to discuss what happened

180
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,160
Essentially that video of Alex saying that he wished he'd never met Trump threw me into

181
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,360
a complete tailspin, but not for the reason that people who listen to our show or who

182
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,960
don't listen to our show might think

183
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Of course

184
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,040
I was flooded by messages and comments from people wanting our take on it, so naturally

185
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,520
I sat down to digest this footage.

186
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,680
In the name of being able to have a conversation that the audience can understand, let's listen

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,760
to that clip now all together

188
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:33,960
Part of me, the selfish part, wishes I'd never met Donald Trump, wishes that I'd never met

189
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:43,840
Roger Stone, because unlike previous things I'd done that were game changing, those were

190
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:54,200
just time space continuum reflections of the third big change I was going to be involved

191
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
in

192
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,360
And that was bringing Donald, John Trump into Austin

193
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,520
I'm just going to say it again, I said Austin into office

194
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,960
Because this is, you guys are actually really good questions, this is going to be a really

195
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,680
good thing, but I'm going to say it again in a minute

196
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,320
It's the truth, I'm just going to say it, that I wish I never would have fucking met

197
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Trump

198
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,600
I wish it never would have happened, and it's not that the attacks I've been through, I'm

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,840
so sick of fucking Donald Trump man, God I'm fucking sick of him

200
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,920
And I'm not doing this because it's like I'm kissing his fucking ass, you know, it's like

201
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm sick of it

202
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Do it in a minute

203
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,520
To people unfamiliar with Alex Jones or the right wing media sphere, this probably sounds

204
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,320
like a huge, huge deal

205
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,080
Here's Alex on film saying that he's sick of Trump and wishes he'd never met Trump or

206
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Roger Stone

207
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,920
To anyone who's listened to our show regularly, this probably was less shocking

208
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,400
Though Alex has created a personality cult around Trump that he's inexorably tied to,

209
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,760
he also frequently lashes out at Trump and the people in Trump's orbit when things don't

210
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,960
go his way

211
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,560
There was the classic case of his breakdown after Trump bombed Syria in April 2018

212
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,360
I mean, you know, like Trump said, Hillary and Obama created ISIS

213
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,080
Well, but, but, but, but, but Trump, it's Barack Trump

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
Trump uses it like a prophylactic, he just shoves ISIS up his big dirty asshole

215
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Apologizes to TV stations

216
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,960
Yeah, and then, you know, he said even more

217
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,640
Here's the news Trump, I'm not dog crap on shoes, brother

218
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,000
You are crap on my shoes, you son of a bitch

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
You will freaking get it, get ready

220
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
And of course the whole part where Alex yelled fuck Trump a bunch that day before he realized

221
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
he was streaming live

222
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Well there's that

223
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
When the fuck are we going live, I can't do this shit anymore

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,280
Fuck Trump and fuck these fucking people

225
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,280
At a certain point, man, I'm sick of all you fucking liberals and mainland, you're a bunch

226
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,160
of cowardly fucks, you're not Americans

227
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,280
What's going on?

228
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,560
Okay, should we shut these feets down and delete those?

229
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
Just shut those feets down and restart them, okay?

230
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
Better shut that down

231
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah, no one will ever know about this

232
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
No, no, no, no

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
So that stream included Alex accusing Trump of betraying his family and talking about

234
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
how ashamed he was of Trump and of supporting him

235
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,520
Things got so out of hand, Owen Schroyer had to try to stop the show, because Alex was

236
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,440
swearing so much and they were out of delay, so they couldn't bleep things

237
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,880
Maybe you should shut it down, we're out of delay

238
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,080
I see that, I see that, they were on TV

239
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,800
I see that

240
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's been made clear

241
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,040
It's so fucking clear right now, Owen

242
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, that was a tough drunk night for Alex

243
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
We did a whole episode about that night, so if you want to hear about that in greater

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,440
detail, it's episode 150

245
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,600
But the thing is, that night is not at all an isolated incident

246
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,840
Alex very regularly blows up at Trump, and the reason is pretty obvious

247
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,480
Trump doesn't actually care about what Alex thinks,

248
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,480
but Alex's business model has relied on him claiming that Trump does

249
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,400
When Trump's public actions contradict the version of reality that Alex has painted on

250
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,040
his show, the only response Alex can have is to portray it as betrayal

251
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
The alternative is to admit that you were either conned, or that you were aware that

252
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,360
Trump was full of shit and you were helping him con your audience,

253
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,160
neither of which are acceptable for Alex's brand

254
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,720
Yeah, they don't come off in a positive light no matter how you try and spin them

255
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,600
The same thing happened during Alex's March 2019 Ask Me Anything stream that he did,

256
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,760
which happened after Facebook had purged more accounts that Alex and Infowars ran,

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,360
and just after Rogan did an episode with Jack Dorsey, where Alex's Twitter ban was discussed

258
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,520
Alex was really raw about how Trump wasn't helping him get it back on social media,

259
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,360
and he expressed that inaction on Trump's part has made him turn against him

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Trump has all the power in his hands, and he's done a lot of good things,

261
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,040
but the fact that he doesn't to these other decentralizations shows that

262
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,760
at the end of the day he's an establishment type person, and so he should be abandoned

263
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
And I'm not happy about that because I've been persecuted for supporting Trump

264
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,840
But, you know, my gut is like ready to pull away, but then there's like a left,

265
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,760
and they are. I don't want to abandon Trump because of them.

266
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,920
They didn't run me off Trump. They didn't make me turn against Trump.

267
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,400
Trump made me turn against Trump. And so it doesn't matter if Trump is this great thing,

268
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,920
it's that if he's going against that we have to turn against him.

269
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,840
So some of these clips might be a little obscure

270
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,360
Sure. And, you know, they haven't been seen by multitudes of people,

271
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
so it could be argued that Alex said these things in

272
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
unseen areas of the internet were only weirdos like me look on.

273
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,200
True.

274
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,760
Unfortunately, Alex has literally also said that he hates Trump more than Hillary

275
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,080
when he was a guest on Joe Rogan's show.

276
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,360
I don't dislike Donald Trump, and I think he's done some good things on trying to do peace

277
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
and trying to get jobs back to America, but I hate Donald Trump

278
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,040
because I got behind him because I knew Hillary was bad.

279
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
And then he became my identity. He's not a bad guy.

280
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,840
But the truth is, I hate him more than Hillary Clinton

281
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,640
because he's who I am now and whatever he does is who I am.

282
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm not with Donald Trump. I'm with America and freedom and everything else.

283
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,800
And I'm not throwing him under the bus to get George Soros on my back,

284
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,600
though they're already after me for the reasons I'm with them.

285
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,680
So I'm not against even Trump, but I get in a fight like this that's so dumbed down

286
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,960
that then no matter what I do, they take my radicalness, my weirdness to hurt Trump.

287
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
But then all it does is like radioactively attack me.

288
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,600
I don't know how to describe it, but it's like it's like Trump is breaking my legs every day.

289
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,840
And it's not like I'm not willing to go through the pain,

290
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,240
except a lot of what he says I don't agree with.

291
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
And he's not my identity.

292
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,960
Sandy Hook's not my identity.

293
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,840
This is just you're talking from your own personal perspective.

294
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,000
And I appreciate that, that he's not your,

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,040
I don't know how many people actually think that he's your identity.

296
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,680
Me.

297
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,240
Me!

298
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
You might notice that in these clips I've played,

299
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,760
you know, there are instances that Alex is clearly intoxicated on air.

300
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,640
I was about to say, Dan, there are very similar speech patterns and yeah.

301
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,760
That's something of a theme.

302
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
And it's something that seems also to be related to the clip that was released by Hatewatch.

303
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,280
The clip of Alex saying that he's sick of Trump that we played at the beginning.

304
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,240
Yeah, and you can argue in vino veritas if you would like, but...

305
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,520
I'm not gonna even get into any of that.

306
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,240
Exactly.

307
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,600
Alex definitely seems drunk in that clip, and that makes sense.

308
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,720
But the thing is, this is not a behavior that's exclusive to when he's clearly fucked up.

309
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,760
In late January 2019, Alex was getting deeply frustrated with being associated with Trump,

310
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,440
at least partially because fundraising for Roger Stone's legal defense was cutting into his profits.

311
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,440
I've got all these employees and all this crew and I've got all my lawsuits I'm fighting

312
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,280
that are way more money than Roger's paying.

313
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,560
It's not some competition here, but I'm kind of fighting a two-front war with Roger

314
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,000
because Infowars has become a platform to sit there and promote fundraising for

315
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,760
his issues when I gave Roger a job here, which is great, and he's paid.

316
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,360
And then it also becomes this split where we may not get the funds to fund Infowars

317
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,600
because the 24-7 Roger Stone fundraising is people then split it and say, well,

318
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,680
we'll just give him a donation instead of Infowars.

319
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm going to have a talk with him about that because we can win the battle, lose the war here

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,160
because of that. So I hope people do support Roger, but Infowars has a bill,

321
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
let's not exaggerate, at least 10 times what Roger Stone's is, okay?

322
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
And he's bringing in as much money as we're bringing in right now.

323
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,320
And that's great. That's all fine and dandy. I have 100 employees.

324
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,280
I have all the bandwidth bills and all the equipment.

325
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,720
And I sent security up with Roger and reporters up there that cost money. And so I'm not bitching

326
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,200
or complaining. I'm going to have to make some decisions around here on a bunch of fronts about

327
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,840
layoffs, laying Paul Watson off, laying Roger Stone off, people that are paid more around here.

328
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,080
Alex is definitely more demonstrative and more gregarious, I guess, when he's fucked up,

329
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,440
but he'll still venture into many outbursts against Trump like he did here in this segment

330
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,560
he was doing on his, he did a big marathon in May, 2017. And he said this.

331
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:16,000
And so the truth is Trump is the Johnson holster for the warmongering neocons and Democrats.

332
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,600
Trump is the Johnson holster of the military industrial complex.

333
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,960
And these are just clips about Trump. They're not even about the people

334
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,440
associated with Trump, that Alex has gone back and forth on heroes to villains over and over again.

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,840
The point I'm seeking to make here is that if you follow Alex, you know that him saying that

336
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,240
he wishes he'd never met Trump while drunk in a controlled setting where editing is possible

337
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,720
is not a bombshell. It's a good headline and it seems to have driven some traffic if my

338
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,520
mentions are any gauge of that, but I'm not sure it's helpful. And the reason for this is

339
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,320
three-pronged. The first is the fact that this is not a comment that's necessarily groundbreaking.

340
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,800
Alex has said a lot of shit about Trump on his own show. The second piece is that literally

341
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,720
nobody who listens to Alex Jones would care about a 90-second clip being reported on by

342
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,080
the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate watch. No, no, no. They always check the SPLC to see

343
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,400
whether or not they should trust people, right? I can personally respect the work that the SPLC

344
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,160
does and acknowledge that they are an important entity, while at the same time saying with

345
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,880
absolute certainty that no one who believes right-wing propaganda will respect or accept

346
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,600
a report from the SPLC. A very basic piece of right-wing ideology is that the SPLC is a

347
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,240
communist globalist front organization meant to launder money and demonize patriots who

348
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,880
threaten the globalist establishment. Any report coming from that source is going to be seen

349
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,520
basically like how normal people see a headline that comes from Glenn Beck. It's going to be

350
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,320
ignored. I was going to say, it's like RT being like, Russia's not doing anything evil today.

351
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,400
Okay. Presumably the people that this clip and things like it would be helpful for are people

352
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,560
who suspect that Alex may be a valid source of information, and in terms of those people,

353
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,120
they will not be reached by this reporting at all. That's not to say that the SPLC shouldn't

354
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,480
do reporting like this, but the fact that only they have access to the underlying material,

355
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,240
which we'll get into in a minute, makes this a little bit difficult to believe will help

356
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,040
anybody that it could help. The people that this Hatewatch article appeals to are people who

357
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,200
already think or know that Alex is full of shit. The third prong is that this basically just plays

358
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,000
the same game that we've done so many times with Alex in the past. The response is predictable,

359
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,200
and honestly, it's one that Alex comes out winning. On the evening of March 2nd,

360
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,480
when this article on Hatewatch was released, Alex appeared on the War Room to discuss things,

361
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,200
and it was honestly so formulaic that I probably could have written his response before listening

362
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,800
to this episode. So here at the beginning of this is Owen introducing this headline and asking Alex

363
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,240
about it. Okay. Alex, this is just... I just might as well bring this up to you because it's kind of

364
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,840
funny. Is this the Daily Mail article where they say a Howard Stern puppet of me is real?

365
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,080
No, no, that's a different one. This one just came out from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

366
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,440
Oh, this is so ridiculous, especially when I work here and I know the true story and then to just

367
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,320
read their lies. Alex Jones on leaked video, I wish I never met Trump. You can see there,

368
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,480
calling it the Southern Poverty Hate Center, preemptively minimizing and deriding the headline

369
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,400
and the source, that this isn't a big deal to Alex or Owen. The thing about Stern there was that

370
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,160
apparently a Daily Mail article attributed words that an Alex impersonator said to being from Alex

371
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,040
himself. It's difficult to tell though because what's apparently parody is indistinguishable

372
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,160
from things Alex would say himself. From the article, quote, this is normalized mass

373
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,640
extermination, a bio attack on humanity before the day of our Lord's birth in the name of the

374
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,520
satanic pedophile globalist New World Order. They want forced inoculation of the Gates vaccine,

375
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,600
which has the HIV delivery system gene coding. It has HIV in it. That's what happens when you

376
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,480
defeat parody. When you finally won over, like SNL can't fucking touch you.

377
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,800
No, I mean, that might have been said by a person doing an impression, but Alex has said all of

378
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,360
those things. He literally said all those things. He could have been reading off of any episode

379
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,840
transcript. Yeah, it could have been. No, no, no, not hard.

380
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,640
Anyway, Alex is fixated on this detail for two reasons. First, it gives him a chance to try and

381
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,640
wage a publicity campaign where he's able to see if he can get some cheap attention by yelling

382
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,680
about a more popular broadcaster, in this case, Howard Stern. We're mere days away from Stern

383
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,120
getting the sneaky snake treatment. Second, it distracts from the main point of that Daily

384
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,000
Mail article, which was about how Alex had buzzed his ex-wife's house in a helicopter,

385
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,720
which had terrorized their daughter. From the article, quote, in the video exclusively obtained

386
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,960
by DailyMail.com, the couple's 12-year-old daughter is briefly seen waving before rushing

387
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,680
over to her mother and screaming, it's scary, mom, it's scary. We try to stay out of Alex's

388
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,560
personal life, but this incident seems like Alex being a real piece of shit. And he's focusing on

389
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,680
this detail about the Stern character. It seems like a way to make the audience not even care to

390
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,600
look at this article because it kind of makes them look like a real piece of shit. Yeah, yeah,

391
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,680
and that's also another thing that's beyond parody. No good or reasonable human being would

392
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,000
fucking fly by their own child with a helicopter. Wow.

393
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,760
You've won. You've defeated me. That's ridiculous and evil.

394
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Yeah, yeah. So we now get to the formulaic defense, exactly what you would expect.

395
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,400
Alex, so they're saying that it's a leaked footage from a documentary filmmaker that you paid

396
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
on his film, even though that's not even accurate. We didn't pay him to make that,

397
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
he did that on his own. Hold on, let me explain. Turns out those guys worked for Hope Not Hate,

398
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,720
so they probably lost their ADL, you know, that whole group.

399
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,880
Oh, there we go. They came to me and they said, we're making this documentary of Paul

400
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,240
Watson, all these people that were here one day. They did the interview and they said,

401
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,280
what's your feelings on Trump? And I said, well, it's devil's advocate. It's in the film.

402
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
I said, part of me hates him. It destroyed my life. You know, it's terrible. I wish I would

403
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,880
have met him, but I'm still glad I did it because overall, even though it's been painful, I always

404
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,520
do that. You know, they always get me on that. So that's in a DVD we sell.

405
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,760
So here you see the reason why this minute or so clip is not really threatening to Alex,

406
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,240
at least in the eyes of his listeners. It was taken out of context, which is the standard

407
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,160
excuse that everyone in the right wing media knows damn well they can use to get out of almost

408
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,800
any situation. Really? I've never heard that before.

409
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,720
It happens all the time because it's something that the audience has been trained to accept,

410
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,720
particularly when the clip that's said to be out of context comes from a source that's been

411
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,520
fully maligned, like the SPLC. The audience requires an answer for that clip because

412
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,000
people are posting it around, which is delivered by Alex saying that it's out of context. That's

413
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,800
enough. The audience does not then become curious about what the larger context is.

414
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,400
Matter is just dead. Yep.

415
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,800
And you know what? Alex is standing on slightly sturdier ground here than he

416
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,120
normally is when he makes that claim. I went and I rewatched the full documentary

417
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,720
called You Can't Watch This. And the part that that clip is in,

418
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,160
part of it is in the movie. Here is that. It's not just me who's at risk.

419
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Part of me. The selfish part. Wishes I'd never met Donald Trump.

420
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,200
Fantastic business. I don't know if you can see that thing right up here.

421
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,160
We can. But it's doing great business. I hope your

422
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,760
audience goes out and buys it as Christmas gifts and everything else. And I just want

423
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,360
to finish by saying your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very

424
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,880
impressed, I hope. And I think we'll be speaking a lot.

425
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,800
Being sucked into that whole vortex has, it was like selling your soul.

426
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,880
Everything I did, everything I was, and everything I was trying to do at that point,

427
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,800
didn't matter how diverse it was. It didn't matter how it was multifaceted. It all became

428
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,400
that at that point. So Trump came to get my populist audience and then he did that.

429
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,760
The Democrats saw it as a threat. They attacked it and said that I was Donald

430
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,960
Trump thinking that would hurt him. It made Trump stronger. It made him win the election.

431
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:21,280
And so they understand that Donald Trump is infamous and that I'm Donald Trump now.

432
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,160
And it's like a ring of doom. We've been merged together into this,

433
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,520
into this thing and they're obsessed with it. If I'd had a target on my back before,

434
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,280
when I signed on to promote America's resurgence, to promote Donald Trump,

435
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,680
all the attacks I'd been through before were like bootcamp. This was the real battle.

436
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,280
And that's when it got crazy. The future definitely worries me.

437
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,080
I left the beginning and end and just to show that that's where...

438
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,560
It's unedited. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand.

439
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,120
This introduces some really murky issues for me. If you listen to the clip that's included

440
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,280
in the final product of the documentary, it's not really saying anything too different from

441
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,280
what Alex is saying in the newly released clip. Yeah, I didn't know that that was in there and

442
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,520
now I'm real not happy about this. They're both expressing a frustration

443
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,160
with Trump, particularly around how the identity that Alex enjoyed prior to being associated with

444
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,880
Trump has been swallowed up by this new image of him. Make no mistake though, he did create that

445
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,320
image and he profits off it. No, I know.

446
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,400
Don't feel too bad for him. No, I don't feel bad at all.

447
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,040
I'm really frustrated because that does seem something like a very clear-eyed evaluation

448
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,640
of how things have gone, which makes me think he's been listening to our show too much.

449
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:40,960
Well, but that clip that's in the documentary is thematically the same as the only difference

450
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,440
is that Alex seems to be a little more mad and he's having a little bit of an outburst.

451
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,600
I just don't give a shit. Once you say someone shoved ISIS up their dirty asshole,

452
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,200
of course I don't care. You've already said enough.

453
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,120
It's tough to top that. Dan, if I told you,

454
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,360
you shoved fucking the base up your dirty asshole, I don't think we would be going beyond that.

455
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,680
We'd be like, we got it. If you're on stage and you say that,

456
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm giving you the light. Yeah, we got it guys.

457
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,200
It's what's been said needed to be said and it's over.

458
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,480
It's about time. Yeah.

459
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,120
So the thing that I find fascinating here is that the clip that's in the documentary is actually a

460
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,680
clearer articulation of Alex's feelings. Whereas the clip released by hate watch is interesting

461
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,160
only because it appears to show a secret revelation and an emotional outburst.

462
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,120
You can see emotional outbursts on Alex's show every day.

463
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,360
And what Alex says there is far from a secret revelation.

464
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,800
And ultimately here's one of the things that I'm really struggling with.

465
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,280
As far as I can tell, as someone who watched the documentary and has watched Alex's show

466
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,480
around the time that this documentary was being filmed,

467
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,080
I do think that the clip is taking Alex out of context.

468
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,640
Alex was struggling with his identity at the time.

470
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
According to hate watch, this documentary was filming in January 2019,

471
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,560
which is exactly when Alex was spending a lot of time on air discussing his desire

472
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,960
to get back to his roots and not be so singularly associated with Trump.

473
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
Here is a clip from the January 28th, 2019 episode of his show,

474
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,200
where Alex discusses how he doesn't just want to talk about Trump and Roger anymore

475
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,320
and how the audience wants him to go back to his roots.

476
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,680
I don't want to just cover Trump or Roger Stone, and I like Roger,

477
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,360
but it's taken all the oxygen out of the room of all the incredible stuff going on around the world.

478
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,920
I ran on the edge of war with Israel, what's happening in Venezuela,

479
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,240
what Soros is saying, get ready for China to collapse, which I agree with.

480
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
But that's only because Soros is jumping on the bandwagon.

481
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,080
A lot of listeners love the show, but they also say, Alex,

482
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,720
Alex, we want you to get back to secret society some and the globalist and the esoteric and

483
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,400
weather modification, because the last three years, it's been all Trump all the time.

484
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,400
And that's because we've been in an epic civil war with the globalist.

485
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,320
It'll still be a lot of Trump here.

486
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,000
It's just that I don't want to cover every facet of everything Trump does.

487
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,080
Alex was feeling like his identity had been subsumed by the Trump.

488
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
And you clearly was right.

489
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
He was feeling right, totally.

490
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,680
He was correctly feeling that.

491
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,200
And he was feeling some kind of backlash from the audience over this.

492
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,800
They were expressing that they weren't.

493
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,840
There was some, whatever it was, maybe it's somebody who works at Infowars,

494
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,280
maybe it was an outpouring of feedback from the audience.

495
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,960
We miss Beck when you were fun.

496
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
This is boring and one note.

497
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,400
No, I know.

498
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,520
And I feel like this is such a nothing, simply because it seems impossible to believe.

499
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,160
It's impossible for me to believe that any right thinking person

500
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,880
would look at the grifters and not think they all actually hate Donald Trump.

501
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,080
Like when you saw, like in the campaign, in the primary, they all hate him.

502
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,280
They all hate him, but it's just part of the game.

503
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,240
He won the game and now they have to lick his boots.

504
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,000
Any reasonable person would be like, yeah, of course Alex hates Donald Trump.

505
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,920
Yeah, I think anybody except the most ambitious grifter would have seen that,

506
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,680
like, okay, the money is following this.

507
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,320
Exactly.

508
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,200
And the most ambitious grifter would have probably, the bet might have paid off.

510
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,480
Yeah, probably not.

511
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,800
Maybe.

512
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
It'd be a long bet.

513
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I don't know if anybody who's boosting Rand Paul is making a lot of money.

514
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,280
I don't think so.

515
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,400
Anybody who's stuck with Rand.

516
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,520
I don't think so.

517
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,720
So this was part of a larger period in time where Alex was really fucking tired

518
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
of Roger's legal fund siphoning donations.

519
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,880
But it's definitely this phase that he was in, you know, like that legal fees

520
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,760
and this disillusionment with Trump and wanting to be who he used to be was going on in January 2019.

521
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,320
Yeah.

522
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,200
And if you pay attention to Alex and you were listening to it,

523
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,080
you would know that this stemmed from Alex being mad at Trump

524
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,760
for not declaring a national emergency to close our southern border.

525
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,440
This was deep in the caravan propaganda cycle of 2019.

526
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,240
So in Infowars world, Trump not declaring an emergency and seizing complete power

527
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,920
was essentially him allowing all Americans to be murdered by MS-13.

528
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,240
There you go.

529
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,680
Which is hard to rationalize.

530
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah.

531
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,080
So Alex turned on Trump for a little while.

532
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,720
That was a really rough situation for Alex because he had all but guaranteed

533
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,280
that Trump was about to declare an emergency, as we can be heard here.

534
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,040
Quite a time to be alive, my friends.

535
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,480
Trump's going to declare a national emergency tonight.

536
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,400
It's already been declared privately.

537
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,200
And oh, I remember that one.

538
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
I like private declarations.

539
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
But also the looks on their faces.

540
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,840
It's as if they're being led up before a firing squad.

541
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Or how about this clip?

542
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,880
Mike Adams, incredible job.

543
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,920
Naturalnews.com is on us tonight, seven o'clock central for coverage

544
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
of Trump's epic declaration of emergency.

545
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,360
As he says, we're in an emergency.

546
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,760
I made to declare an emergency.

547
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,920
Oh, he's going to declare it.

548
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,040
Mike, thank you.

549
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,600
We'll be right back.

550
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,480
Stay with us.

551
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,200
Or this one.

552
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,960
Mike Adams, God bless you.

553
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,200
Great job.

554
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,920
You're joining us tonight.

555
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,160
Seven o'clock central, 8 p.m.

556
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Eastern for the coverage of Trump declaring a national emergency.

557
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,000
I don't know how all this is going to end, but if the globalists want to fight,

558
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,520
they better believe they've got one.

559
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,920
Yes.

560
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,480
Here in January 2019, the migrant caravan fears were the biggest story in the right-wing media.

561
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,120
And Alex had essentially gone all in and Trump declaring a national emergency to the point

562
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,000
where you did a special evening stream to celebrate the declaration that didn't end up happening.

563
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,400
Yep.

564
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,080
That's fucking embarrassing.

565
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,720
It's not good.

566
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,800
And Alex was understandably a little bit raw about it after the fact.

567
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,080
Now, I was going to come back in this segment and I was going to get to this later, but

568
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,800
everybody knows my habit of mentioning something coming up and getting right into it.

569
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,640
But when we come back, constitutional lawyer, really smart cookie, founder of Oath Keepers.

570
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,160
Oath Cookie is going to be joining us.

571
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
But here's the bottom line.

572
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,840
And he's a constitutional lawyer.

573
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,080
Yale for his writings, of course, worked for Ron Paul.

574
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,880
Smart guy.

575
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,320
He concurs with me with what I've said.

576
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
Trump essentially is no longer the president.

577
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
He has advocated his responsibility.

578
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,680
He's he's signing it away.

579
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,120
He's let a group of people around him tell him that he can't fire the head of the Federal

580
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,960
Reserve, which he can do in the code.

581
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,320
So this is one of the things that makes a clip like this.

582
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,560
Really, it's incredibly difficult to understand without a nuanced understanding of Alex's

583
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,760
propaganda and the context that the things are set in.

584
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,840
Alex saying that he's sick of Trump is attention grabbing, but it's completely in line with

585
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,640
what he was saying on air around this time.

586
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
And we were talking about back then.

587
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,640
Yeah.

588
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,360
Alex was sick of his identity being associated solely with Trump, which he expresses more

589
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,200
coherently in the take that they actually use in the documentary.

590
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,240
Alex has said way worse things about Trump on his show.

591
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,600
Like before deciding to support him for president back in 2015, Alex would regularly talk about

592
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,440
how Trump was a front man for the mob.

593
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,480
You go and you show at the university four or five palace size houses, 40 million, 13

594
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,280
million, you name it.

595
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,080
You say, is this Donald Trump's?

596
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
Everybody thinks he's the richest guy.

597
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,800
The guy's literally nothing.

598
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,080
Kind of just a front man for some consortiums on the East coast.

599
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,800
I'll leave it at that.

600
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,280
Oh yeah.

601
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,400
Trump's piece of work, folks.

602
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,560
And they go in there.

603
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,960
It's just mind blowing.

604
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
I don't even know what to say anymore.

605
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,600
And like he did this a lot.

606
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,080
Yep.

607
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,320
Donald Trump owns a bunch of casinos.

608
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,840
Donald Trump's involved in a bunch of stuff.

609
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,200
He's basically a front man for some very hardcore people.

610
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,120
And he gives tons of money to the democratic party, more to Democrats than Republicans

611
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,080
in the last 30 years.

612
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,720
So you can bet this is all as phony as a $3 bill.

613
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,520
And Donald Trump, I have it from high level sources, uh, is, uh, well, let's just say

614
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,160
with a name like Trump, they don't come after you with a name like Carleone.

615
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
Don Trump will be back.

616
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,400
Stay with us.

617
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,200
I'm Alex Jones.

618
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,160
You want the truth?

619
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,960
Can you handle it?

620
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,840
You're going to get it.

621
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,560
Ha ha.

622
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:12,960
Yeah.

623
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,720
So this is the reality of a clip like the one released by hate watch.

624
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,400
It's Schrodinger's clip.

625
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,440
It's simultaneously in and out of context.

626
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,080
Yeah.

627
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,920
I do believe that it captures a sincere moment of frustration where Alex is pissed off about

628
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,560
how pigeonholed he's become as a Trump cheerleader.

629
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,960
But I don't think that the moment means anything outside of exciting people who already don't

630
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,320
like Trump or Alex.

631
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,880
Yeah.

632
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,280
For me, this falls into about the same heading as that Bon Iver parody song that was made

633
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,320
about Alex.

634
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,080
It feels like an attack, but in reality it just plays directly into his hands.

635
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,640
Yep.

636
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,920
Consider this.

637
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,760
I hate Alex Jones.

638
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,480
I've done a podcast about how full of shit he is for over four years.

639
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,320
And when I heard him respond to this clip by saying that it's out of context, I don't

640
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
think he's totally wrong.

641
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,600
The hate watch article doesn't discuss the other version of this clip that appears in

642
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,600
the documentary, nor does it address what was going on in the world around the time

643
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,360
that the documentary was filmed that could have contributed to what their readers were

644
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,160
seeing.

645
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,920
From my perspective, these are important aspects to understanding that clip.

646
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,000
Because without knowing what was going on, it's really easy to see that clip and make

647
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,160
up your own story in your mind about what Alex, you know, when he says, I'm so fucking

648
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,880
sick of Trump, like he wished he'd never met him.

649
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,840
You can come up with your own explanation of what that means.

650
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,360
And it's not, it's pretty clear if you know what was going on, what he means by that.

651
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,480
No, I, I tweeted out immediately cause I got all those.

652
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,520
I got all those too.

653
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,560
I tweeted out immediately.

654
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,080
I was like, this is just an ad for Alex and the filmmaker.

655
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,280
That's what it is.

656
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,600
And it's not, it's just because, God damn it, Dan, how many times are we going to do

657
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,400
this?

658
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,040
I understand.

659
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,920
And that's why, that's why this episode is going to be a little bit, you know, different

660
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:03,040
is because the frustration of like, everybody wants us to cover these things that go viral.

661
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,160
And we did three years ago.

662
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,320
Now what's interesting though, too, is that like, this is a little bit different than

663
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,800
those other instances, because this is a case where I do believe that it's in context in

664
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,040
as much as it is a video that it doesn't have like a bunch of quick cuts.

665
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,240
It is Alex saying I'm fucking sick and tired of Trump.

666
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,320
You know, it is that it is also devoid of the surrounding context that could be accessed.

667
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,360
I mean, just by listening to his show.

668
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,840
Yeah.

669
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,080
Well, I mean, there's a certain part of me that's not, it's defensible.

670
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,400
Yeah.

671
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,160
Just because, look, you shouldn't, I mean, it's not, you shouldn't be paying attention

672
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,200
to that world, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to say that it's, it's, it's hard to

673
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,720
pay, you don't, it's hard to pay as much attention to it as we do.

674
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,040
Yeah.

675
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,120
And that's something that, you know, we constantly have to check ourselves on in terms of being

676
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,960
like, how can you possibly not be aware of this completely sensible thing to not be aware

677
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,120
of?

678
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,000
And there's absolutely value in taking something that otherwise people wouldn't know.

679
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,480
Right.

680
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
And bringing it out to them.

681
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,480
I get it.

682
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:10,800
Sure.

683
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
There are tons of people who don't pay attention to Alex and just know of him.

684
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,480
I'm sure it's a very valuable thing for them to, to know.

685
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,200
Also, he's full of shit on this, you know?

686
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,120
And if they didn't know that and now they do, that's a net positive.

687
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,440
Yeah.

688
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,760
Yeah.

689
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,200
So this is where we get to why we didn't have an episode on Friday.

690
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,200
When I was exploring some of these ideas and listening to this clip and what have you,

691
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,120
I realized that covering Alex's response to it would be unsatisfying.

692
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,040
I didn't want to do an episode where we look at this and then just say that Alex said that

693
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,120
the clip that was released was out of context.

694
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,880
And the best I can say is kind of.

695
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,360
Yeah.

696
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,400
I felt like that feels way too close to defending Alex.

697
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,440
Yeah, no, we don't need, we don't need that at all.

698
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,520
I felt like the best thing I could do is try something I've never tried before.

699
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,200
And that was make some inquiries.

700
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,600
I sent emails, made a bunch of phone calls and tried everything I could think of other

701
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,200
than starting a social media pressure campaign, because I'm opposed to those.

702
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,840
But I was trying to get access to the raw footage of this clip that Hate Watch had released,

703
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,680
trying to see where it came from, see what the surrounding discussion was around that.

704
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,560
Of course.

705
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,720
What happened after Alex walked off camera, as he does at the end of that clip?

706
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,800
Did he immediately clarify himself or did he sit down and say stuff that made it clear

707
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,800
that what he meant is that he fucking personally hates Donald Trump as a human and that he's

708
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,760
connected to the mob?

709
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,480
I felt unable to wrestle with this clip fully without the surrounding context, because to

710
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,240
me, this was a headline being presented without a body of text.

711
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:44,800
Yeah, Dan, we don't, in our world, headlines being their own story is not good.

712
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,840
That's what Alex does.

713
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,480
Exactly.

714
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,200
No one at the SPLC or Hate Watch returned my calls or emails and my press request went

715
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,840
unanswered.

716
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,080
It's hard to believe that they wouldn't suddenly drop everything for a podcast.

717
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:01,440
Look, dude, I understand people are busy and not everyone's aware of us, so I don't take

718
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,720
it personally or anything.

719
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,760
I completely understand and I'm not shitting on anybody.

720
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,920
I just am saying this to say I tried to get access to this and I failed.

721
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,400
I don't know.

722
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,920
I take it a little personally.

723
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Well, you can, because that's your role.

724
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,560
I do.

725
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,160
I take it a little bit personally.

726
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,760
I find it, I just find it a little bit frustrating that if you're reporting on Alex Jones, you

727
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,280
can't find the only podcast about him.

728
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,760
It's great.

729
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,200
It seems easy to find.

730
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,960
What's great is that I put in all the effort and then you get to be mad that it didn't

731
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,360
work out.

732
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,680
What?

733
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,720
Okay, okay.

734
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,000
Are you gonna play the victim for being a better person than me?

735
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,880
No, I just think it's fine.

736
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,640
So I did see, however, that the producer of the documentary that the clip is from, who

737
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,240
gave the footage to Hate Watch, had replied to a tweet from one of our listeners that

738
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,400
indicated that he would be willing to come on our show.

739
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,760
So, typically, when things like this happen, I ignore them.

740
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,640
I don't have a lot of interest in doing an interview with someone who comes from the

741
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,040
worlds that we cover, since I have a default position of distrust and skepticism towards

742
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,920
them, and I'm not particularly drawn toward making a show where me and a propagandist

743
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,440
yell at each other incoherently.

744
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,040
And I don't think I can interview him because I'm famous for saying, cut his dick off

745
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,720
to Roger Stone, so that would make things a little bit adversarial.

746
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,440
So I wasn't convinced that I should interview him, and you were strongly opposed, so I

747
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,880
figured a middle ground would be to reach out to him and see if he was open to letting

748
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,000
us review the larger context of the clip that was released.

749
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,680
I made guarantees to everyone that I spoke to that I would respect the right of Hate

750
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,280
Watch's reporting, and I wouldn't scoop them by releasing clips that they may or may

751
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,040
not be working on for future stories.

752
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,040
The documentarian, Kalen Robertson, said that he gave the footage to Hate Watch, but would

753
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,160
come on the show to discuss what it was like to work with Alex.

754
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,400
I responded by asking if there was an exclusivity situation with Hate Watch, at which point

755
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,520
he stopped responding.

756
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,160
It's entirely possible that he saw me as someone just out to get the footage to create

757
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,240
clickbait and undermine whatever plans there may or may not be for releasing things.

758
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,760
He doesn't know me at all, and I can't begrudge someone being careful about who they

759
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,280
would trust online, so this didn't seem too strange to me.

760
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,680
I think I moderated my tone, but honestly, I might have come off as a little thirsty

761
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,480
for the footage.

762
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,960
Maybe.

763
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,640
It's really hard to tell how your tone works.

764
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,120
I mean, you are a little thirsty for the footage, so...

765
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,160
I was interested, sure.

766
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
I mean, if it's there, I want to see it.

767
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,040
Well, yeah, I understand.

768
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,540
Yeah.

769
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,720
As Wednesday became Thursday, I realized that we needed to record an episode, that a lot

770
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,160
of the audience expected that we would be covering that clip that Hate Watch released,

771
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,240
and that without the larger footage, I didn't have much to bring to the table past saying

772
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,840
there's a larger context, Alex is still an asshole who lies about everything, but there's

773
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,440
nuance here that might have been missed.

774
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,940
Yeah.

775
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,120
I didn't know what to do, but at that point, I still thought there was a chance that someone

776
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,240
would get back to me.

777
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,240
COVID is a total pain in the ass, so I could understand the bureaucracy at the SPLC and

778
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,880
Hate Watch being slowed down a little bit, so maybe I'd hear back on Thursday or Friday,

779
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,400
and thus, I decided to punt to Monday to make the best episode we could.

780
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,200
That was the plan.

781
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,520
But here we are on Sunday, and no one's responding.

782
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,640
And there's not much to say other than that the SPLC is bad now, Dan.

783
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,840
Since I didn't have the raw footage, I felt like I was at a dead end.

784
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,120
That said, I'd already thought a lot about this clip, and I had some things I wanted

785
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,040
to say about it, so we have to do this episode.

786
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,520
I decided to rewatch You Can't Watch This and jot down some questions that I would-

787
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

788
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:22,980
How?

789
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,080
I could watch it.

790
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,460
Turns out.

791
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,640
I wanted to jot down some questions that I would like to ask Kalyn Robertson to see where

792
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,040
I would take a theoretical future interview.

793
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,600
Sure.

794
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,320
As I watched through that lens, a ton of questions came to mind, particularly about the state

795
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,760
of mind one is in while creating clearly full of shit propaganda documentaries that feature

796
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,920
only the opinions of extreme lunatics like Alex Jones, Tommy Robinson, Laura Loomer,

797
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,880
and Gavin McGinnis.

798
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,840
Right, as well as, I believe, Wile E. Coyote.

799
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,440
I got into this idea, so early on Friday, I sent Kalyn another message explaining the

800
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
reasoning for my wanting the raw footage to better understand the context.

801
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,600
I also said that if that wasn't possible, I still might want to chat, and that if he

802
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,760
was interested, I could email over some questions, he could decide whether or not he wanted to

803
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,640
participate.

804
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,880
I had absolutely no interest in blindsiding anybody, and I felt like he could see the

805
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,360
questions, get the tone of what I was looking for, and decide whether or not he wanted to

806
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,080
participate.

807
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,240
I did not send him the questions, though, to be fair.

808
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,880
I get you.

809
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,040
I'm just saying that might sound a little bit thirsty.

810
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,360
You know, if you're on a dating app and you don't get a response for a day and then you

811
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,440
come back with, I might answer questions.

812
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,520
There is definitely a reason I didn't send another message after this one.

814
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,600
I'm also not interested in harassing somebody, and I felt like another unanswered message

815
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,680
in this chain would look a way that I have to...

816
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,720
It might be your trouble.

817
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,520
I have to look in the mirror, and I don't think I can handle being the guy who keeps

818
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,400
sending messages.

819
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,200
Yeah, that could be trouble.

820
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,680
Yeah.

821
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,160
It dawned on me that I knew very little about this guy, Kalyn Robertson.

822
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,240
I pay attention to the right-wing media, but he's a behind-the-scenes guy, and his only

823
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,880
direct association with Alex was in this film, You Can't Watch This, which didn't impress

824
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,680
me much, and didn't cause a big splash when it came out.

825
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,360
The Hatewatch piece says that Robertson has disavowed the far right, and told Hatewatch

826
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,000
he's working to undo the damage he did while producing propaganda for extremists such as

827
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,480
Jones.

828
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:29,200
That's good, but words like, quote, producing propaganda for extremists like Jones are

829
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,040
the kind of words that make me curious.

830
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,240
What other sorts of extremists are we talking about here?

831
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,680
Yeah, you know, I read that line, and my immediate thought was, tell me exactly how he is disavowing

832
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,520
and improving from there.

833
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:43,840
Right.

834
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:50,800
Give me line by line, do not tell me that he told you he was disavowing the far right,

835
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
and you took him at face value.

836
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,280
I started poking around, and this dude's fingerprints are on so many of the side characters we've

837
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,880
discussed on this show.

838
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,840
He used to work at Rebel Media, he did extensive work with Tommy Robinson, he directed two

839
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,480
flagrantly racist and intentionally manipulative documentaries with Lawrence Southern, and

840
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,320
perhaps most interestingly, he was the uncredited, but at very least cameraman and probably editor

841
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,280
or director of Stefan Molyneux's film, The Hundred Year March, a Philosopher in Poland.

842
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,400
Famous for his declaration of, I am a white nationalist.

843
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,200
Empirically.

844
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,160
Empirically, I am a white nationalist.

845
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,440
We covered that entire documentary, and you can find it, it's episode 285 of our podcast.

846
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,920
But not only does Robertson boast this impressive list of right-wing shithead credentials, he

847
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,320
also went along on that trip that Lawrence Southern and Stefan Molyneux took to New Zealand

848
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:51,600
in 2018, and even spoke prior to their talks after screaming his very racist film Farmlands,

849
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,680
which argues that black South Africans are trying to kill all the white farmers there.

850
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,480
Here's a little clip of him giving a speech.

851
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,000
Hello, my name is Caelan Robertson and I co-produced Farmlands with my colleague George

852
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,080
Ewell and John, and of course Lawrence Southern.

853
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,360
Obviously this was an incredibly challenging process to put together, it was highly emotional

854
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,280
as a subject, and obviously very very intensely serious as a subject, which meant that it

855
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,400
had to be told in the right way, and the stories of these people are so powerful that it had

856
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,440
to be told properly.

857
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,120
It had to be told properly.

858
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,440
Now, we'll get back to that in a second, but in case you're interested, here's what Stefan

859
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,800
was talking about that evening.

860
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:55,520
Let's hear it.

861
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:01,040
Pull up, I really agree with it, but you know, I'm open, data, you know, let's find out.

862
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:07,360
So we started researching into average culture.

863
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,600
Sir, this plane is going down, this plane is going down, sir.

864
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,480
It's, well, you'll see.

865
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,600
But it's important, it's important because I want to sort of make a philosophical argument,

866
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,080
of course, about two cultures.

867
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,480
Obviously there's the European Western culture, the white culture, and then there's the

868
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:41,360
Aborigine culture, and there was a collision, one-one, and then you get a powerful culture

869
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,400
and civilization and glowing cities of light and rising out of the very desert itself,

870
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,120
and another lost.

871
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:56,640
And then, like, in general, cultures that lose, they either vanish or they turn into

872
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,640
guilt-tripping manipulators to extract the giant red vending machine called white guilt.

873
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,400
Wow, cool stuff, cool stuff.

874
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,640
Boy, I want him to get collisioned.

875
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,680
Quick reminder that this is in New Zealand, and also that the Christchurch shooter donated

876
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,840
money to Stefan Molyneux and was a big fan of Lauren Southern, and named his manifesto

877
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,840
The Great Replacement, which is the conspiracy about white genocide that Lauren Southern's

878
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,880
movies are based on, which were directed by Kaelan Robertson.

879
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,040
So, real quick, back to that clip I played of Kaelan's speech.

880
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,440
Well, it's a good thing he told people that he disavowed that.

881
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,360
He said in that speech in New Zealand that he was covering this very sensitive topic

882
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,600
about the South African farmers, so it was crucial to tell their stories properly.

883
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:45,200
Well, about that, in a very interesting review of Lauren Southern's article, she said that

884
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,920
Lauren Southern's other film, Borderless, the YouTube commentator Jose brought up a

885
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,160
very interesting problem about how farmland told the stories of these farmers.

886
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Here's a little clip from Jose's video titled The Many Lies of Borderless.

887
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,360
Towards the end of the video, I highlighted one of Lauren's major works, and that's

888
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,800
the movie Farmlands, a movie that advanced the racist conspiracy theory that black South

889
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,880
Africans were out to kill white farmers, fueled by some sort of racial animosity that's

890
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,000
ginned up by South African politicians.

891
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,280
In that movie, a woman named Janine Eichenfeldt had the gruesome details of her father's

892
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,480
murder used to advance said racist conspiracy theory.

893
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,080
I mentioned that I didn't believe Janine was a willing participant in this, evidenced

894
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,240
by the selective editing of her interview.

895
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,920
In an interview of May 2019, Eichenfeldt told Ariel Levy, writing for The New Yorker, that

896
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,560
she had been interviewed under a false premise.

897
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,280
Here's a quote.

898
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,640
I felt exploited. Another farmer phoned me to say he's got this Canadian chickie doing

899
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,560
a documentary about the drought.

900
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,520
Can you bring her to me?

901
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,120
Hence, I was in my farm boots and my shorts to go and show them the effect of the drought

902
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,840
on the farm, and Lauren sat down and said,

903
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,440
Tell me about your dad.

904
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,680
Completely caught me off guard.

905
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,560
This is a shocking revelation because it's not something that can possibly happen by

906
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,440
accident.

907
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,760
It's the result of a conscious decision to mislead interview subjects and exploit what

908
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,920
they tell you by taking it out of context to further the conclusion you want your propaganda

909
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,120
to arrive at.

910
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,120
The behavior precludes good faith.

911
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,320
There's just no way around that.

912
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,600
No, it's not possible.

913
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,920
As it turns out, this is not the only way in which Farmlands, the documentary directed

914
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,760
by Caitlin Robertson, failed to tell the woman's story properly.

915
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,320
In reality, her father was killed, and that is a tragedy, but the film fails to explain

916
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,080
the details of the crime because they want to use it as a prop to make the argument that

917
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,760
white farmers are being targeted for genocide by black South Africans.

918
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,800
Her father was killed by a guy who had been working on his farm.

919
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,880
Five days prior, this man had stabbed his girlfriend, who was a person of color, to

920
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,000
death and was chased by police but not apprehended.

921
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,160
He went to this woman's father's farm, killed him and robbed his house and was subsequently

922
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,800
arrested and is now serving a 30-year sentence in jail.

923
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:04,000
This is a case of a double murder, and it's sad and an awful crime, but it's not an act

924
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,160
of racial hate towards white farmers, which is what Caitlin's film portrays it as.

925
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,880
This isn't telling the story properly, it's creating a fake version of a South African

926
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,400
woman's pain to exploit to further a racist narrative, and then it's further gaslighting

927
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,560
an audience in New Zealand while doing audience warm-up for a guy who decided to be a white

928
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,800
supremacist because less of them booed his dumb ass.

929
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,640
No, no, no, no, Dan, it's great.

930
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,920
Look, I get it, but he told the SPLC that he disavowed that, and he gave them some footage

931
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,080
of Alex that everybody's already seen before.

932
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,720
So he's repented.

933
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,760
I'm struggling, I'm really struggling.

934
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,760
Over the course of the weekend, I watched and read everything that was available to

935
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,840
be found and created about or created by Caitlin Robertson, because this picture was just giving

936
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,400
me trouble.

937
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,080
I was confused, it was accidental going down this road, but I was interested and I was

938
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,960
confused.

939
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,000
Wow, you know what, and look, this is by no means retaliation.

940
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,880
I know because we've talked about this every step of the way, but you should have given

941
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,080
us that fucking footage, dude.

942
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,120
No, no, I understand, I understand.

943
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,760
I think it's funny you saying that, but...

944
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,480
No, we've talked about this extensively.

945
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,080
Believe me, that is not your motivation whatsoever.

946
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,440
The more I watched of his work, the more I didn't like him at all.

947
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,360
But the more I watched his interviews, the more I kinda liked him.

948
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,280
He's an immensely charming person, and that charisma probably played no small part in

949
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,200
his ability to rise to such a position of prominence among these right-wing grifters,

950
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,280
for whom appearance is so critical.

951
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,440
As well as getting them to say stuff.

952
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,320
Perhaps.

953
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,520
I mean, Louis Theroux is an incredibly charming person, and that's part of why his documentaries

954
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,360
end up with people saying stuff that maybe they wouldn't in other contexts.

955
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,880
Exactly. I don't know, I feel like he seems fun, interesting, and...

956
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,480
He's the type of guy that the New Yorker would have written a glowing profile about.

957
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,960
Totally.

958
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,440
New Nazis, they dress different.

959
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,280
Yeah, I would say so.

960
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,920
Yeah.

961
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,840
And I mean, I'm not even immune to it, like watching these interviews.

962
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,200
Sure, no, you listen to it.

963
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,800
A charming guy is a charming guy.

964
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,080
There's not much you can do with that.

965
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,000
And that's part of what made it so intriguing.

966
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

967
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,760
It's like, what's going on here?

968
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,720
This is fucked up.

969
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,480
So, here we are in the present day, and Robertson has disavowed the errors of his ways from

970
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,880
a few years ago, and he's trying to undo the damage he's done, and I do commend that.

971
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,280
I do.

972
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,440
I want to be very clear about that.

973
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,280
I was curious about the stories of his path to redemption, so I decided to dig a little

974
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,280
bit deeper and watch some of the more recent interviews that were available out there to

975
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,480
try and get a sense of this.

976
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:40,880
Yeah.

977
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,520
You know, like, one of the things that I love the most about our podcast that unfortunately

978
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,240
may be tainted now is that episode about Jessica Schaub, the crystal child, who...

979
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

980
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,960
Someone informed me that she might not be as much of a wonderful success story as...

981
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,680
God damn it.

982
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,760
But I'm always looking for something like that.

983
00:53:59,760 --> 00:53:59,760
Of course.

984
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,640
I'm always looking for something uplifting, because it's so much better than Alex's dumbass.

985
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,280
Totally.

986
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,280
No, and I think that's a great example, because I've thought about that one a lot.

987
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:19,680
You know, my exuberance towards her escape was undeniable, but the more I've thought

988
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,760
about that, the more I've just been like, you cannot take people at their word when

989
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,280
they just say that they are disavowing stuff.

990
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:35,280
And the reason that we do, the reason that we always do is because we want to believe

991
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,480
that so hard.

992
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,040
Yeah.

993
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,520
I want to believe this guy, like the reason that I'm so against believing that this guy

994
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,080
is disavowed is because I know I want to.

995
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,400
Yeah.

996
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,240
Because I know that provides hope for me for my fucking family.

997
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,800
That provides hope for me for so many other people.

998
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,480
Look, you can come back.

999
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:54,800
Yeah.

1000
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,200
And so I am not going to trust anybody.

1001
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,680
Yeah.

1002
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:03,440
And that also is what makes, like, I'm struggling with the idea that it feels like we might

1003
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,000
be attacking him or something because I don't want to attack the idea that it's possible.

1004
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,240
Sure.

1005
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,160
For your family or for people around you.

1006
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,400
Sure.

1007
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,720
I'm just curious and I want to deal with reality on reality's terms.

1008
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,040
Right.

1009
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,720
And I, you know, the way that I talk, of course, everything I say is, uh, sounds like an attack,

1010
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:31,920
but what I'm trying to express in my dumb way is that he has earned where he is.

1011
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,760
He's earned where he got to.

1012
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,400
And if you want to go somewhere else, you have to earn it.

1013
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,200
And those, maybe they don't have to be equal, but I'll tell you that given a few clips to

1014
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,240
the SPLC is not earning your way out of being the shit bag that you were.

1015
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,480
Right.

1016
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,800
A couple of important points.

1017
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,400
One, that's not for us to determine.

1018
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,760
And you can have your feeling and you're entitled to your feeling, but we are not the judges

1019
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,560
of this person.

1020
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,360
Absolutely not.

1021
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,680
Second, we cannot possibly know what he has done privately.

1022
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,400
Of course not.

1023
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:11,200
Like he doesn't owe anybody, uh, like us an apology and maybe he has made amends with

1024
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,960
folks behind the scenes privately.

1025
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,600
And I think that may be even more appropriate than anybody knowing exactly what he should

1026
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,080
be doing.

1027
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1028
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,560
And we can't judge whether or not that's the case and I'm not sitting here saying he hasn't.

1029
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:30,640
I'm saying I'm struggling with this because I believe wholeheartedly in redemption.

1030
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,400
I believe wholeheartedly that people can make it out and oftentimes their stories on the

1031
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,920
other end can be very, um, uplifting and helpful for people.

1032
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,560
Yeah.

1033
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,160
I also don't think it's appropriate to pretend that this history isn't what it is.

1034
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,720
Exactly.

1035
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:56,240
Like the redemption needs to take stock of the professional career that beget the redemption.

1036
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,280
100 percent.

1037
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,680
And I was not convinced of that until I was watching this.

1038
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:08,240
And as I was looking at these, this story of, you know, the upliftingness, I was like,

1039
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,440
this doesn't make sense.

1040
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,920
There's something that doesn't match up.

1041
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,520
So the first thing that stuck out to me was an interview that Robertson did with a Muslim

1042
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,600
activist in the UK named Ali Dawah.

1043
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:24,400
Ali and Tommy's crew had a really high-profile run-in in the past, back in May of 2018, surrounding

1044
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,120
a rally that Tommy was throwing called Freedom Day.

1045
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,160
The event was supposed to be a free speech rally, so Ali requested to speak at the rally,

1046
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,360
since why wouldn't a free speech rally want to have everybody have speech?

1047
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,000
Oh, of course.

1048
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,960
Initially, Ali was told he could speak, but ultimately he wasn't allowed to, and he was

1049
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,640
harassed, threatened, and attacked by Tommy's fans at the event.

1050
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,080
This interaction between Ali and Kaylin in September 2019 is actually really fascinating

1051
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,280
for a number of reasons.

1052
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,680
The first is just the simple fact that these two people who were on opposite sides of things

1053
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,200
a little over a year prior were now able to have a polite conversation.

1054
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,000
The other reason is that halfway through, their interview gets interrupted by an old

1055
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,800
British Islamophobe who spouts a bunch of anti-Muslim talking points at Ali for no other

1056
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,200
reason than because he looks like a Muslim.

1057
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,320
The interview gets sidetracked and derailed by the consequences of Kaylin's prior actions.

1058
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,320
It's almost as if this interview is metaphorically expressing that the damage that Kaylin did

1059
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,200
in his past lives on no matter what he does, and beyond that, it even gets in the way of

1060
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,920
and will be a constant problem even when he's trying to do good, as he presumably is by

1061
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,360
having this chat with Ali.

1062
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:31,920
Sure.

1063
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,680
It's remarkable how this turn of events captures a reality and a meta-reality, and both involve

1064
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,400
the person embodied by Ali patiently trying to deal with the aftermath of what this white

1065
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,480
nationalist propaganda has done to people.

1066
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,720
The reason I find this interview the most interesting, however, is because of one detail

1067
00:58:48,720 --> 00:59:08,400
that Kaylin gives while discussing that Freedom Day march that was all about free speech.

1068
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,520
The head of the DFLA, or DFLA, or this far right group that pretended they were about

1069
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:30,800
football, texted Tommy and said, if you let him on stage, we'll storm the stage, you know,

1070
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:39,200
you'll be attacked or whatever, and Tommy was like, and I was saying, this is fucking

1071
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,480
about freedom of speech, this is the purpose of the event, it's about freedom of expression

1072
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,160
and freedom of speech, that's literally what it's about, nothing else, and he was like,

1073
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,960
I can't do it, I can't do it, it's going to fucking piss everyone off, I can't do it,

1074
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,040
and then Lucy came on, super, super, super heated, she said, everyone knows about this,

1075
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,000
everyone already knows he's invited, he said he doesn't care if you can spin it off, and

1076
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,840
she said, just admit it, it's because he's fucking Muslim, isn't it, and he said, yeah,

1077
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:07,200
it is, that's it, and that's when we realised, like at that moment, that he didn't give a

1078
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:13,120
fuck about freedom of speech, no, but we were quite convinced, like I, fuck you, like we

1079
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,040
were genuinely like, this is, we are like a cool counterculture thing, there's a lot

1080
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,040
of far right idiots that we don't want, but we genuinely believed in that.

1081
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:21,520
Fuck you.

1082
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,200
Fuck you.

1083
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,120
That was the moment, that was the moment.

1084
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:25,600
Sure.

1085
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1086
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,960
I have no idea what was said when Kalen's mic cut out there, but the gist of that story

1087
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,560
is that when Tommy was okay with the idea of Ali being disinvited to speak at this free

1088
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,800
speech event because he was Muslim, it made Kalen wake up and realise that Tommy didn't

1089
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,320
care about free speech at all.

1090
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,640
The conversation goes on to be about how Tommy uses free speech rhetoric as a mask to hide

1091
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:52,160
his real agenda, which is racism generally and anti-Islam agitation specifically.

1092
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,600
There's no way for him to have known before that point that the far right did that, Dan.

1093
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,560
It's not possible.

1094
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:04,160
But the claim that he's making, I actually kind of believe, and the reason I do, is that

1095
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,640
in July 2020, Kalen released a video through the Byline Times which captures Tommy Robinson

1096
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,240
essentially saying exactly this back in 2018.

1097
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,560
We should do a free speech march.

1098
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,040
Nope.

1099
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:17,440
No.

1100
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,320
A free speech march.

1101
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,240
That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.

1102
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,880
What are we going to do?

1103
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,760
Just shout.

1104
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,640
No, the difference is you...

1105
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,920
Just walking around London.

1106
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,720
Do you know why, do you know why, do you know why you think he could be so, why you think

1107
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,760
he's so easy to get numbers, would be so easy to get numbers?

1108
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
Because you're not asking people to come out and protest against Islam.

1109
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
You're not asking people to protest against anything.

1110
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,120
You're asking people to come and show their face in support of free speech.

1111
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,400
Everyone can do that.

1112
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,880
Doesn't matter about your job, doesn't matter about your career, you're not going to lose

1113
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,440
your job, no one's going to look down upon you, your friends aren't going to hate you.

1114
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,040
I'm hard at free speech, and they still will.

1115
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,320
It's interesting, because that clip is from 2018, and it seems to be Tommy discussing

1116
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,120
the idea of doing a free speech rally, which would be really just to trick large numbers

1117
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,080
of people to come out who wouldn't show up if you were honest about your anti-Muslim

1118
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:58,640
intentions.

1119
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,200
Yeah, there you go.

1120
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,080
That Freedom Day event in May was Tommy's biggest allegedly free speech event that year,

1121
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,560
and he did spend some of 2018 in jail.

1122
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,240
So it seems to me it's pretty likely that this clip of Tommy explaining that free speech

1123
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,240
is a mask that might have come from before the Freedom Day event.

1124
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,480
I would probably say...

1125
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,600
I have a hunch.

1126
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,280
Could be that.

1127
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,960
Either way, I find it super hard to believe that anyone working with these people wouldn't

1128
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,320
understand that dynamic, and I think it's super embarrassing that Tommy got caught on

1129
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,240
tape explaining the most obvious game he and his friends play.

1130
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,680
Very sad.

1131
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,320
Yeah.

1132
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,880
The point here, whether or not this tape was from before or after the Freedom Day event,

1133
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,080
that day in 2018 is supposed to be the day that Kalen realized that Tommy Robinson used

1134
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,560
the facade of free speech as a way to cover his racism and trick people into getting involved

1135
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:46,880
with it.

1136
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,200
That was his Saul of Tarsus moment.

1137
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,240
That rally took place on May 6th, 2018, so it's safe to assume that anything that took

1138
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,400
place after that point was done with the full awareness that the whole free speech argument

1139
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,480
from the right-wing media figures is nonsense.

1140
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,640
Well, then I assume he quit at that point, right?

1141
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,080
That date is a problem.

1142
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,040
Is that date a problem?

1143
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,240
Why is that date a problem, Dan?

1144
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,280
Well, for one, in his documentary You Can't Watch This, which you can watch, Kalen interviews

1145
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,200
Alex Jones about how he was kicked off all those social media entities, which happened

1146
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,440
in early August 2018, after the Freedom Day rally.

1147
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,520
This interview is being recorded in January 2019, even later than that.

1148
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,320
Plenty of time to reflect on how maybe Tommy Robinson isn't the only person who uses free

1149
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,840
speech complaints to mask their bigotry.

1150
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,560
No, no, he's an aberration.

1151
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:37,440
To make matters worse, Tommy Robinson himself is one of the subjects of this documentary,

1152
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,040
and the entire point of it, if you couldn't tell from the title, is that these people

1153
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,880
who have just alternative points of view are having their free speech violated and they're

1154
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,880
wrongly being called racists.

1155
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,520
The entire concept of this documentary is something that, based on Kalen's own timeline,

1156
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,680
he should have completely understood was just a way of masking racism through appealing

1157
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,360
to free speech bullshit.

1158
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:02,400
In January 2019, at the same time he was making this documentary, Kalen was interviewed by

1159
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,760
Sky News.

1160
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,920
In this interview, he tells a story about a short film he made about Muslim extremists

1161
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,800
while in college.

1162
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,960
This film that he made didn't end up making the clients his screening.

1163
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,560
And if you listen carefully to this interview, you might notice Kalen using free speech arguments

1164
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,160
to justify people's racism.

1165
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,200
Oh, you think so?

1166
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,080
Well, I made a, like, I think it was like a nine minute film, just about, it wasn't

1167
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,120
an interim charity, but there was like a bunch of Muslim extremists who were walking up and

1168
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,480
down Whitechapel and I was just interviewing a few of them, not that they would really

1169
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,720
want to talk very much, but like going up to the cameras.

1170
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,600
And then I showed it to one of my lecturers and they were like, oh, this is, this is interesting,

1171
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,440
but we're not going to put it in the screening of the official, like of the official screening

1172
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,880
of all the short films at the end of the year.

1173
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,920
And I was like, oh, that's really strange.

1174
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,200
I didn't really think much of it.

1175
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:51,040
But then when I started Googling about universities not like deplatforming things or maybe not

1176
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,560
showing all different ideas.

1177
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,480
I mean, what was, what was the rationale giving to you?

1178
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:54,960
Right.

1179
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,200
Okay, this is interesting work, but do you know what?

1180
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,400
We're not going to have it in the end of the year.

1181
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,760
They said, I remember them using the word inflammatory, that it could be perceived as

1182
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,800
inflammatory.

1183
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,760
I think they, it wasn't from like a super insidious way.

1184
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,160
I think they were just trying to be polite to a lot of the other students and they didn't

1185
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,680
want to upset a lot of different people and bring that kind of argument into the classroom.

1186
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,480
Oh, you mean hate speech?

1187
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,120
So I wasn't really that bothered about it at the time until I started researching that

1188
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,800
other universities were doing things like that.

1189
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,040
But yeah, that was, that was sort of the first time I recognized that that was going on.

1190
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:25,920
I mean, is it fair for me to then join the dots between that incident, that film, and

1191
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,920
then your later work with, with Tommy Robinson formerly of the EDL?

1192
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,120
Yeah, well, this is why I say that the left created Tommy, like the left created this

1193
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:33,920
situation as well.

1194
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,840
Like if you would only show something, maybe we have some difficult conversations and actually

1195
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,920
not silence freedom of speech or not silence content, then people might not start questioning

1196
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,320
this too much.

1197
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,920
People might not start dedicating their lives to it or getting involved in activism to try

1198
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,400
and fight it.

1199
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,200
Like that wouldn't, that wouldn't be the case because there wouldn't be, there wouldn't

1200
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:49,920
be a silence around it.

1201
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,600
There wouldn't be these issues.

1202
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,520
Sounds like he disavowed it to me.

1203
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,840
This is an appeal to the idea that the left being censorious and limiting free speech

1204
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,880
of people like Tommy Robinson, read racists, is what causes people to become racist.

1205
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,880
These people aren't actually even racist.

1206
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,080
They're just made to look that way because normal society won't let them have the difficult

1207
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,000
conversations that they want to have.

1208
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,080
You know, those difficult conversations like the ones his buddy Stefan Molyneux wants to

1209
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,520
have about phrenology.

1210
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,480
Nothing I love more than oppressing people for hundreds of years and then blaming them

1211
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,920
for making me feel bad.

1212
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,120
That was in 2019.

1213
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,120
It was in January 2019.

1214
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,800
And then in May 2019, Kalen appeared as a guest on RT to promote his documentary that

1215
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,920
you can't watch this.

1216
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,320
Sure.

1217
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,400
And he discussed what the film covers.

1218
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,120
Once again, after he should have realized this was no good.

1219
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:39,520
Sure.

1220
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,240
He relies on whitewashing his subjects behaviors by appealing to free speech.

1221
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,680
The project looks into how social media is being used as a tool to exclude certain voices.

1222
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:54,400
It focuses on the online war with prominent conservatives and the implications this removal

1223
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,800
of content has for the freedom of speech.

1224
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:02,160
The director says he hoped the film would uncover how serious and widespread it's become

1225
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,480
and the danger it poses to our culture.

1226
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,680
Now, the film follows five controversial figures who have been victims of social media purges.

1227
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,880
One is British activist, Tommy Robinson, who founded the far-right English Defense League.

1228
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,120
Facebook accused Robinson of promoting hate against the Muslim community.

1229
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,440
Also featured is Alex Jones, director of the InfoWars website.

1230
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,920
Permanently banned from Twitter, Jones is said to have promoted discriminatory behavior

1231
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,000
and spread disinformation.

1232
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,600
No, he did do that.

1233
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:36,480
Now, to discuss the documentary and the issue it touches upon, we're joined now by Kalen

1234
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:42,160
Robertson, an executive producer of the documentary, You Can't Watch This, and Masoud Sajoure,

1235
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,720
chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission.

1236
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,640
You're both very welcome to the program.

1237
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,400
Now, Kalen, if we could start with you.

1238
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,040
Social media platforms are public forums.

1239
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:56,080
Do you not think it's a fair argument to respect the diversity of users and not to actively

1240
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,280
provoke or offend them?

1241
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:58,960
Well, yeah.

1242
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,960
Well, what this documentary explores is the increasing powers that social media have in

1243
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,080
changing the Overton window, in influencing what people can and can't watch online as

1244
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,560
consumers, in changing elections.

1245
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,920
And this is why it's so important.

1246
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,400
And a lot of people argue, oh, well, you know, they're private companies.

1247
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,200
They can do what they want.

1248
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,720
Well, they're actually acting like publishers, and they actually have a duty to actually

1249
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:25,360
hold free speech as one of their core values, especially given how important social media

1250
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,720
is in our society.

1251
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,520
Looks like someone's using free speech arguments in order to elevate the complaints of Laura

1252
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,360
Loomer, Gavin McGinnis, Alex Jones, and Tommy Robinson.

1253
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,280
Those people all have something else in common besides censorship.

1254
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,960
But this is like a year after the Freedom Day rally when he ostensibly-

1255
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,080
Yeah, but you can hear-

1256
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:44,720
No, no, no.

1257
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,400
You can hear in his voice that he recognizes that what he's doing is wrong.

1258
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,040
Oh, man.

1259
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,640
It's killing him on the inside.

1260
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,000
This is a man crying out for help, Dan.

1261
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,640
Please, someone stop me from doing this.

1262
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,040
It seems like even though he'd known for at least a year that this was specifically a

1263
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,680
tactic that one of his subjects, Tommy Robinson, used to subtly promote racist ideas to an

1264
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,400
unsuspecting population, Kaelin was still willing to employ the same tactic to subtly

1265
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,560
promote his film full of bigots to an unsuspecting population, which is strange.

1266
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,360
So I was sitting with this, and I was really, like, just reflecting, and I was wondering

1267
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,800
why I was even doing this.

1268
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1269
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,000
Honestly.

1270
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,400
Of course.

1271
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,200
At a certain point.

1272
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,680
At a certain point, and I want to jump back here real quick, because I think there's

1273
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,840
something interesting that I noticed in that interview that he did in January 2019 with

1274
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,560
Sky News, and it's illuminating to me, because here he is discussing...

1275
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:43,120
I know you're going to think this is going to be worse than it is, but here's Kaelin

1276
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,320
saying some things that he thought about the civil rights era.

1277
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,040
Oh, good.

1278
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,200
I loved what the left did in the 60s, 70s, and 80s with the civil rights movement, with

1279
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,200
the rights for women, with the rights for gays.

1280
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,760
It's groundbreaking.

1281
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,240
It's what made us as Westerners great.

1282
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,440
I always thought the left was fabulous.

1283
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,440
When I started at university, I was like, of course I'd be on the left.

1284
01:09:59,440 --> 01:09:59,760
Of course.

1285
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,880
Everyone told me that, and I assumed they were the ones who were progressive, caring.

1286
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,240
That was the best thing.

1287
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,440
But it wasn't until I actually saw what was going on, until I actually started seeing

1288
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,600
the homophobia from the people that they were already friends with, the anti-Semitism that

1289
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,880
the left are willing to put up with, that I thought, oh, it's losing their touch a little

1290
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,040
bit.

1291
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,160
It never used to be like that as well.

1292
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,800
They're losing their touch completely, and they need to stamp that out.

1293
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,520
Yeah, fair enough.

1294
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,040
Everybody could be a little bit better.

1295
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,800
Losing their touch, Dan.

1296
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,800
The left, we just don't got it anymore.

1297
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,400
I mean, the left can do better, but I think that if you want to compare...

1298
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:29,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1299
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,880
No, let's not pretend that there aren't shitheads.

1300
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,520
Yeah.

1301
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,320
But that clip is actually a really critical point to distinguish Kalen from the rest of

1302
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,560
the extreme right wing that he was hanging around with.

1303
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,000
His right wing existence is not philosophical.

1304
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,240
It's not rooted in the same traditions as his extreme right wing peers, who are deeply

1305
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:52,720
anti-communist, and they would view the left of the 60s and 70s as one of the greatest

1306
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,280
existential threats that the West has ever seen.

1307
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,520
If Kalen was rooted in the more entrenched school of the right wing, he would view things

1308
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,000
like integration, voting rights, and LGBTQ protections as things that were pushed by

1309
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,960
communists in order to divide and conquer society.

1310
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,520
Sure.

1311
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,280
It doesn't seem to me from looking through the available information that I can find

1312
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,400
that there's a lot of depth to Kalen's right wing views.

1313
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,080
Mm-hmm. In many ways, it seems aesthetic, almost.

1314
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1315
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,520
It seems almost performed.

1316
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:24,160
Work that he did back when he was on The Rebel is often about dumb, pointless culture war

1317
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,200
type complaints.

1318
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,480
Like this clip from July 2017, where he was oh-so-mad that there was a new emoji that

1319
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:30,880
got released.

1320
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,680
Oh, for God's sakes.

1321
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,960
Where someone's wearing a hijab.

1322
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,400
The original idea, according to their website, was to have an emoji with a dark purple headscarf,

1323
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,960
but fearing that was a little bit too crazy, they decided on a more neutral, fond color

1324
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,520
one, which I think is a lot more appropriate, to be honest.

1325
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,240
In the change.org petition, the group asked how they were going to make progress if they

1326
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,360
don't include everyone in their path for peace and acceptance.

1327
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,280
And oh boy, are they right.

1328
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,600
I mean, how on earth are we supposed to achieve world peace without the right emojis?

1329
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,720
This is not going to happen.

1330
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:06,160
And I don't know about you, but I'm so proud to see the tech industry making such giant

1331
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,760
leaps for humanity.

1332
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,680
And I tell you, I can't wait for the FGM emojis.

1333
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,600
Oh, wow.

1334
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,240
Great.

1335
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,600
Wow, wow, wow.

1336
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,680
He's like a, he's like a shittier Paul Watson out there.

1337
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,320
Yep.

1338
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,720
And then, you know, he unconvincingly argues that the British are at war with Islam after

1339
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:29,600
the suicide bombing in Manchester in 2017, which just again, this doesn't feel convincing.

1340
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:37,120
And once again, it proves that we are currently right now at this very place in time on the

1341
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,560
23rd of May, 2017 at war.

1342
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,080
And the left seem to think that they still dominate the narrative of this entire perspective.

1343
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:51,440
We had Katy Perry only hours ago saying that we need to ignore what's going on and keep

1344
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,520
the borders open and stop hate.

1345
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,320
We've had hundreds of political figures on pretty much every side of the political spectrum

1346
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:05,200
up and down the country, explain to all of us and lecture us about how we must come together,

1347
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,200
how we must unite and how we must not hate anybody.

1348
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:17,520
Well, the fact is that we are coming together, but we're coming together as British people

1349
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,880
and Islamists are coming together as themselves.

1350
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,000
And we are becoming even more of a target and it's a total waste of time and we are

1351
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,640
lying to ourselves if we think that having some sort of vigil, posting notes all over

1352
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:39,200
city centres saying that we will not be cowed and lighting candles will make any difference.

1353
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,920
Now the only differences between World War II, the last time this country looked as at

1354
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,040
war as we are now, was that at least then we could name the enemy and at least then

1355
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,360
we actually fought back.

1356
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,600
And now we don't do even slightly something like that.

1357
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,680
It just seems like an act.

1358
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,440
There's a video of him complaining about people cutting loose at Pride.

1359
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,840
There's a video of him complaining about Starbucks changing their logo in Saudi Arabia.

1360
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,840
It doesn't feel like it has anything going on.

1361
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,320
Yeah.

1362
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,720
Like, it feels like a PR person doing a right-wing piece of propaganda.

1363
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,120
Yeah.

1364
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,560
Because that's what it is.

1365
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,080
Caelan discussed the beginnings of his career in that Sky News interview from 2019.

1366
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,640
No, like, my career was always in marketing and politics and, well, sort of PR and things

1367
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,400
like that at university and after I graduated, you know, my partner was at the BBC and I

1368
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,600
was working in marketing and PR firms and that's where everything was really, really

1369
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:37,520
focused and that's obviously how I transitioned from sort of traditional establishment sectors

1370
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,160
into what we're doing now, sort of taking all of the textbook stuff and applying it

1371
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:47,360
to kind of more sort of fringe alternative subjects, which is interesting.

1372
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,280
This isn't a person who's motivated by the same ideologies that many of the people we

1373
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,480
talk about are.

1374
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,280
The Infos universe, particularly in the pre-Trump era but still to this day, is based on the

1375
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,840
bedrock of ideas disseminated by the John Birch Society and their associated figures.

1376
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:07,920
It's almost entirely emerging of Cold War anti-communism run amok and extreme white

1377
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,760
identity-tinged religious beliefs.

1378
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,800
That's what you find behind many of Alex's guests and in his own intellectual tradition.

1379
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,560
This is the same intellectual tradition that popularized conspiracies about the globalist

1380
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,320
which have morphed into the deep state conspiracies in the past few years.

1381
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:24,960
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1382
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:30,720
The pool that Kaelin is swimming in was filled by anti-communist conspiracy theories, but

1383
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,440
I don't get the sense that he knows how the plumbing works.

1384
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,720
He knows marketing.

1385
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,200
That was his job, and he's good at it.

1386
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,560
I would say I'm like an alternative producer, so covering the stories that a lot of traditional

1387
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,400
media and establishment media don't want to talk about or are too worried to talk about,

1388
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,520
sort of covering the other side of a lot of the conversations that aren't being discussed,

1389
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,320
even in day-to-day life, and bringing production value to that as well and legitimizing those

1390
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:58,720
arguments so that they're not like fringe sort of things on the corners of the internet

1391
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,720
and bringing that to the mainstream.

1392
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:05,760
In 2019, while on Sky News, prior to being on RT to promote his free speech documentary

1393
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,880
full of racists, Kaelin fully expresses an awareness that his role is to take fringe

1394
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,880
things and make them look presentable so that people might get tricked into thinking that

1395
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,680
they're mainstream.

1396
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:24,800
What this raises is the question of like, what does it mean to disavow right-wing ideology

1397
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,200
if you never fucking believed in it in the first place?

1398
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:31,680
Yeah, or if your ideology was simplistic and not really based in the same things that are

1399
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:40,080
motivating this wide swath of right-wing ideology that is back to the militia movement.

1400
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:40,560
Totally.

1401
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:48,000
And in that case, then what is he disavowing? Is he disavowing fucking opportunistic bullshit?

1402
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,720
Is he disavowing fucking deceptive editing?

1403
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,840
Is he disavowing surprise interviews?

1404
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,600
Like, I want to know what this is.

1405
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,960
I think that that's one of the things that I'm kind of confused by and I'm interested

1406
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,440
in.

1407
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:06,160
And these are the sorts of questions that were coming up as I was taking in a lot of

1408
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:06,960
this content.

1409
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,440
Yeah.

1410
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,120
I mean, it's confusing to me.

1411
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,600
I don't- Because I guess it's racism.

1412
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,800
I guess it's hate.

1413
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,440
Yeah.

1414
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,720
Okay, fine.

1415
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,880
You're a merc for Nazis.

1416
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,960
You're not a Nazi yourself.

1417
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,160
Yeah, I don't think I care about the distinction between those two all too much.

1418
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,120
Well, yeah.

1419
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:25,840
You know what I'm saying?

1420
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,560
It's not necessarily a...

1421
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:36,480
It's not a disavowing of right-wing ideas, although there are certainly a lot of racist

1422
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,440
problems on the right.

1423
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,640
Sure, sure, sure.

1424
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:44,400
I don't get the sense that there was anything other than profiting off bigotry.

1425
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,280
Yeah, it was a gig.

1426
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:45,920
Yeah.

1427
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:53,520
I answered an ad and I got a job and they were like, make these PR puff pieces.

1428
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,960
And I was like, I'm good at that.

1429
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,120
And then six years later, it turns out being a Nazi is wrong.

1430
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,360
It turns out there is a wall.

1431
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,000
Yeah.

1432
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,240
I don't think I'm going to be able to work at CNN as a line producer if I've got this

1433
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,120
on my baggage.

1434
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,640
Well, the thing that I run into that I think is really difficult is that I do believe he

1435
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,400
probably ended up in a position that was different than where he wanted to be.

1436
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:16,720
Sure.

1437
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:22,560
I do believe that there is entirely a possibility that some of that radicalization did happen.

1438
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:22,960
Totally.

1439
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:29,920
But from everything I can tell, it's not the story of somebody who got sucked into YouTube

1440
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,160
algorithms and got into right-wing ideology or something like that.

1441
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:40,080
It's somebody who sought out working with Tommy Robinson and rebel media in order to

1442
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,120
produce racist content that looked better than what was being created at the time.

1443
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:45,680
Yeah.

1444
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:45,920
Yeah.

1445
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,400
He saw a market inefficiency.

1446
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:48,880
Yeah.

1447
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:49,360
Yeah.

1448
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:49,920
Yeah.

1449
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,480
And...

1450
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:54,080
Which is also incredibly fucked up.

1451
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,160
But again, that's not Beyond Redemption 2.

1452
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:58,800
No, no, no.

1453
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,440
Of course not.

1454
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,080
It's different.

1455
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,280
It feels different than the story that we're being told.

1456
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,040
It feels different than the story that you get from reading that Hatewatch article.

1457
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:15,840
But it's not the person who's beyond care.

1458
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,200
Sure, sure.

1459
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,960
It's not somebody who's beyond respect.

1460
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:19,280
No.

1461
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,320
It's just that I'm gonna look a little bit differently.

1462
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:22,800
No.

1463
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,080
I mean, a PR person for an oil company sure can redeem themselves.

1464
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,200
The oil company's destroying the world.

1465
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,840
You're working for an essentially evil organization.

1466
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,960
I get it.

1467
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,360
But I mean, that's different.

1468
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,400
It's different.

1469
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:44,400
It really is different from being part and parcel of people who are there to inspire

1470
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:44,900
violence.

1471
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,400
That's what...

1472
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,680
Because that's ultimately the reality of it.

1473
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,520
I get that maybe he wasn't a believer in the deepest deep end, but he is still producing

1474
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,600
content that is only designed to drum up violence.

1475
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,760
I mean, at least hate.

1476
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,280
And here's what else he knew.

1477
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,960
He knew that Ali would get murdered.

1478
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:09,920
Could, yeah.

1479
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,640
Right?

1480
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,920
So he knows that violence is absolutely on the table.

1481
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:21,440
And he probably knows, or he should, or he would have to be incredibly stupid not to

1482
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,240
know that that is the fucking...

1483
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:29,200
The result of what they do is that group of people texting Tommy Robinson saying,

1484
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,240
we'll kill that guy.

1485
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:30,720
Yeah.

1486
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,080
That's the result.

1487
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:32,480
Yeah.

1488
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,280
And it's part of it.

1489
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,240
It's the base.

1490
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:34,640
Yeah.

1491
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,680
It's the idea.

1492
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:35,920
Yeah.

1493
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:44,400
And, you know, the production of this documentary about free speech being infringed for these

1494
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,560
four people who are complete bigots.

1495
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,040
Sure.

1496
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:53,440
Like, that was going on after he had the Freedom Day experience.

1497
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,040
We all have our relapses, Dan.

1498
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,440
It's just tough.

1499
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,600
It's just tough for me to swallow.

1500
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,920
I'm not trying to be unempathic and I'm not trying to shit on the guy.

1501
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,480
And I hope...

1502
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,480
I just don't know, man.

1503
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,280
I just don't know.

1504
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,400
No, I mean, we talked about this and part of why I was so vehemently against interviewing

1505
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:20,400
is, and I don't know if I'll bore you with this one more time, but whenever my family

1506
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,680
left the cult, before they could be accepted back in...

1507
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,200
I think this is an important perspective.

1508
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,680
Yeah, before they could be accepted back into their family.

1509
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,280
And it took a while.

1510
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,560
It took a while.

1511
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:36,640
They had to send actual letters of apology, single spaced, that actually enumerated,

1512
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:43,440
we understand where we went wrong and here is what we are going to do about that to improve

1513
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,080
things.

1514
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:50,080
This is a genuine apology because it's about knowing how to correct the mistake instead

1515
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,280
of just saying, I'm sorry for the bad things that happened.

1516
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,520
Yeah, and that's what I don't hear.

1517
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,440
Yeah, and I think that there's a little bit of a delineation that needs to be made because

1518
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:05,600
that's about personal life and I'm staying entirely in terms of professional life because

1519
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,680
I'm not interested in Kalen's personal life.

1520
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,840
I'm not interested in anything about that.

1521
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,920
I am very willing to believe that he is a good person and that he's had a change of

1522
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,420
heart.

1523
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,960
I'm concerned about the product.

1524
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,920
I'm concerned about the effects and the work.

1525
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:32,640
Like, the path to making things right for somebody who had his hands in and produced

1526
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:38,320
slash directed documentaries for Lauren Southern, Alex Jones, and fucking Stefan Molyneux within

1527
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,840
the last few years.

1528
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,680
It's a path.

1529
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,520
It's tough.

1530
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,160
It's not, the public has been hurt by this.

1531
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:48,960
A lot.

1532
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,200
And I do think that, you know, things that you can see online, things that he said, they

1533
01:22:55,200 --> 01:23:02,400
do give the indication and suggestion, and I don't have any reason to necessarily distrust

1534
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,240
it, that he wants to make that path, and I hope he does.

1535
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:14,000
I would say that the questions that I've been raised with through this is, okay, so he's,

1536
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:20,800
part of his redemption campaign is gotcha clips that half of which were already in the

1537
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:26,720
fucking documentary, that show Alex Jones represents himself differently in public than

1538
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,840
he does in private.

1539
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:34,240
And what you have just played for me is a clip of this guy representing himself differently

1540
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:39,840
in public in the interview where he says, here's what I believe, and this is the moment

1541
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:44,960
it happened to me, and then a clip from a year later talking about his fucking documentary.

1542
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,680
More or less.

1543
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:50,400
So to me, while those are different, they are not the same.

1544
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,880
No.

1545
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:57,840
They also don't point me towards believing that a guy who's very good at marketing is

1546
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,240
not rebranding and is instead contrite and changing things.

1547
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:02,960
It's hard.

1548
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,640
It's hard.

1549
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,480
And it's tough.

1550
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:06,800
Yeah.

1551
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,480
It's tough because I don't want to live in that place of suspicion.

1552
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,240
That doesn't make me feel good.

1553
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,040
I'm not like, hey, you know what is great?

1554
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,560
Thinking the worst of people.

1555
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,320
That's not true.

1556
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,120
But at the same time, we can't live in this space.

1557
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:25,840
Otherwise it's going to happen again and again and again like it always does.

1558
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:31,520
This is where we get to why I told you this off air, and I will say it again.

1559
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,840
I think that this was one of the most difficult and complicated episodes I've had to prepare

1560
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,520
for two main reasons.

1561
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,400
The first is that I had to constantly check in on myself and make sure that I was not

1562
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,320
doing this motivated out of spite.

1563
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:44,640
Yes.

1564
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,280
Yeah.

1565
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:49,600
I don't feel bitter about people not replying to my messages, but you never know how much

1566
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,360
might be below the surface.

1567
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,400
There was this emotionally interesting ride that I was on as the whole thing of trying

1568
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:02,400
to branch out and do something like requesting raw video from somebody, and that blew up

1569
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,360
in my face.

1570
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,040
There was a lot of processing going on.

1571
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:10,800
It's kind of funny to be around you with that emotional roller coaster because we don't

1572
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,040
talk like the entire way through.

1573
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:13,440
Yeah.

1574
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,880
So I'm getting little chunks of like, oh, you're on the down wave.

1575
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,760
I can definitely get this text is definitely not a good one.

1576
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,560
And then the text where he's like, this is the most exciting thing I've ever done.

1577
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,640
It's like I'm available to snapshots.

1578
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:28,480
You're filtering this through your own interpretation of these snapshots.

1579
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,200
That's what I'm saying.

1580
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,640
I'm just getting snapshots.

1581
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:35,280
So the second reason why this was so difficult, I think is more important.

1582
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,080
I hope Kalen is sincere and that he's changed.

1583
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,160
He's co-founded a new organization that's, quote, designed to show people radicalized

1584
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,040
into far right movements that there is a path out.

1585
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,480
That is an important goal.

1586
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,480
And people knowing that there's life after whatever thing they've fallen into is critical.

1587
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,040
I'm personally evidence of that.

1588
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,360
Yes.

1589
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,240
Absolutely.

1590
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,480
If this is for real, then I don't want to be a part of impeding Kalen from being able

1591
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,960
to live a good, healthy life that can be an example to others that they can do that too.

1592
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,800
I'm not interested in being a dick about someone who's trying to make their way out

1593
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,320
of being in the right wing.

1594
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,320
That does not benefit me at all.

1595
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,920
And it's not interesting to me.

1596
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,560
I don't like the idea of people shitting on somebody by default.

1597
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,060
Sure.

1598
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,320
I don't like that.

1599
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:26,400
The point that I think about is regardless of whether or not he specifically is on the

1600
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:31,120
right path, and just like you, I hope he is.

1601
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,120
This story is still instructive.

1602
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:35,600
Yeah.

1603
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,080
Because sure, he's on the path.

1604
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:43,520
There are still plenty of people who have taken advantage of this exact type of situation.

1605
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:43,680
Sure.

1606
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,720
We'll get into that in a second.

1607
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,200
Exactly.

1608
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:45,760
Just saying.

1609
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,400
Yeah, yeah.

1610
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,280
Ultimately, also, I think it's important to remember that in the big picture, it doesn't

1611
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,760
matter whether or not we believe him.

1612
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,400
This dude doesn't owe me or you anything.

1613
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,160
Any apologies that he needs to make are probably to other people and they could have already

1614
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,600
happened and we don't know.

1615
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,720
And that's totally cool.

1616
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,760
And that's their business.

1617
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,800
I'm not interested in it.

1618
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,520
This show is largely created by me taking in Alex Jones's content and finding things

1619
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,200
that stick out as interesting and seeing where curiosity takes me.

1620
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:18,080
In this case, there was a high profile viral video of Alex and the exploration of the context

1621
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,240
of it and where it came from led me to learn a bunch of stuff about a guy who's apparently

1622
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,320
turned over a new leaf.

1623
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:31,280
The way I went through this was largely what I would do if this was a Leo Zagami clip.

1624
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:31,760
Yeah, totally.

1625
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,400
Or something.

1626
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,200
100%.

1627
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:38,080
Except, I will admit, I pulled a few punches because some of it is like, well, this is

1628
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:38,960
probably shitty.

1629
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,440
Yeah.

1630
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,600
And also, he didn't claim to be Jesus.

1631
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,000
No.

1632
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,680
And I'm not here to...

1633
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,880
I'm here to ask him to.

1634
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,480
Leo Zagami did claim to be Jesus.

1635
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:47,360
He did claim to be Jesus.

1636
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,240
And he did 9-11.

1637
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,160
I'm saying, Kalen, if you want to give back in my good graces, buddy, there's a very

1638
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,120
very simple way.

1639
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,840
I believe in redemption wholeheartedly.

1640
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,680
Someone very important to me got sucked down a right-wing media hole and managed to find

1641
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,760
their way out, and I know that I would have hated them back when they were in that place.

1642
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:04,560
For sure.

1643
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,880
I respect and I'll defend people's right to change, but I think there needs to be really

1644
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:13,520
serious examination of the professional careers of people who are claiming to have changed,

1645
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,960
because to not do so is dangerous, professionally.

1646
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,200
Recent history is full of people who tried to make dishonest re-brands.

1647
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,280
I'm sure Samantha Bee isn't happy she played along with Glenn Beck's bullshit about how

1648
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,720
he was sorry about all that stuff, and then he went back on it.

1649
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,840
Yeah, what a surprise.

1650
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:34,880
In May 2019, The Daily Dot published an article about how noted white nationalist creep Baked

1651
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,080
Alaska quote is a recovering alt-right troll.

1652
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,360
This article quotes him as saying, quote, I was brainwashed.

1653
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,280
I felt like I was part of a cult.

1654
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,720
Flash forward to the present, and the last we heard of him was when he was arrested for

1655
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,600
being part of the January 6th storming of the US Capitol.

1656
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,840
Yeah, but that was outside of a cult.

1657
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,480
Okay.

1658
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,680
People like Mike Cernovich have made more pivots than I can count, and there's many

1659
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:56,800
more people like this.

1660
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,320
My kind of gist on how I'm, because I've thought about it a lot since we've been talking

1661
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:08,320
about this whole thing, and part, I think part of the simple thing that I kind of want

1662
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:13,200
is like, okay, you don't get to be in public.

1663
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:18,800
One thing that I've noticed so often is that it's just, I'm just going to change jobs.

1664
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,160
It's not like I'm going to do anything different.

1665
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,320
I'm just going to get a different gig.

1666
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,200
Yeah.

1667
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,720
And I don't appreciate that.

1668
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:35,360
Yeah, it is just a shifting over of like, I'm going to now do stuff that isn't hateful.

1669
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:39,360
I'll make slick content to make sure people know that they can not like stuff that like

1670
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:39,840
I used to do.

1671
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,240
No, they don't need to go to a judge to say, give me 100 hours of community service.

1672
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:48,640
News organizations should say, we're not going to put you on TV until you do 100 hours

1673
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:53,440
of, you know, like something along those lines of like, get your fucking hands dirty.

1674
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,760
Well, and the thing that really, I struggle with again too, is that like when you have

1675
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:05,760
stories of people who have been sucked down rabbit holes of information like YouTube radicalization

1676
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,360
and what have you, I feel like their stories are valuable.

1677
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,200
And I don't think Kalen's story is invaluable, but I think that their stories are really

1678
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:19,280
useful because people in their position can hear them and relate to things that they're

1679
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,320
talking about for sure.

1680
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:20,880
Yeah.

1681
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,280
Kalen's experience is pretty fucking unique and I'm not sure his testimony is going to

1682
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,400
be persuasive to other right-wing propagandists.

1683
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,760
They like him saying, you can get out, you can follow my lead and get out.

1684
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,120
They're going to look at him the same way Alex's audience looks at the Southern Poverty

1685
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:37,920
Law Center.

1686
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,440
It's not going to be persuasive to other folks who are creating and disseminating this

1687
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,400
propaganda.

1688
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:44,800
Right.

1689
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,440
It is going to benefit rehabbing his image.

1690
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,080
It will.

1691
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:50,560
Yeah.

1692
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:57,280
And again, I hate coming off the way that I sound because I do sound like I'm beating

1693
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,360
the shit out of a dead horse right now.

1694
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:07,200
I'm just, you know, we're just not far away from the storming of the fucking Capitol.

1695
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:07,360
It's true.

1696
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:11,680
And I'm supposed to be like, oh, he's disavowed the right and I care?

1697
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,640
I'm supposed to care?

1698
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,080
Great.

1699
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:14,720
You know?

1700
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,920
Yeah, yeah.

1701
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:17,920
That's all I'm saying.

1702
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,400
No, I know.

1703
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:18,960
It's tough.

1704
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:19,440
Yeah.

1705
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,720
It's complicated.

1706
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:21,440
It is.

1707
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:28,400
And I mean, I don't think that rehabbing your image is wrong if you're rehabbing.

1708
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,280
Absolutely not.

1709
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,440
I think that people deserve chances.

1710
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:38,640
And I just like he's doing this organization that's supposed to help people get out of

1711
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,440
right wing stuff.

1712
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:49,680
If the idea is to appeal to people who are sucked into these webs and these right wing

1713
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:57,440
information spaces, I don't think that he is going to be a very easy or I'm sorry, I

1714
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:02,160
don't think he's going to be a very hard target for the right wing propagandists to attack.

1715
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,520
You can smear him in two seconds.

1716
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,080
Yeah.

1717
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,200
Like Alex did, saying he works or hope not hate.

1718
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:13,440
Fucking, you can, again, you can play clips of him doing the thing that he's, you know,

1719
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,600
blaming or he's exploiting Alex for doing.

1720
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,360
Because that's also what he's doing.

1721
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,880
He's exploiting Alex and the SPLC at the same time.

1722
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,360
And they're obviously exploiting his bullshit.

1723
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:30,560
And the only people who benefit from this are the three parties involved, because none

1724
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,760
of us get shit from it.

1725
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,880
Well, the issue that I have is like, I guess you could describe it as exploiting, but I

1726
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,280
don't know if it's intentional.

1727
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:39,680
Sure.

1728
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:46,320
I could see a scenario where he thinks that this is going to make a difference, the video

1729
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:46,800
of Alex.

1730
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,280
Of course.

1731
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:51,360
And the SPLC thinks, hey, this'll show Alex is full of shit.

1732
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:51,920
Of course.

1733
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,160
And both of them just have no idea.

1734
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:54,800
Right.

1735
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,000
I could see that being possible.

1736
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,080
I see it as being fairly unlikely.

1737
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:58,960
Super unlikely.

1738
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,760
And would demonstrate a uncharacteristic naivete on both of their parts.

1739
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,680
Perhaps, perhaps something so.

1740
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,680
But it is possible.

1741
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,880
It is possible.

1742
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:14,240
So the rest of the reporting in that hate watch article that this clip was released

1743
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:18,160
in this initial clip, it's not stuff from the video.

1744
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:22,160
It's just things like Kaylin telling them, you know, like that Alex brags about selling

1745
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,720
dick pills in his audience was gullible.

1746
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:28,080
And then he paid Paul Joseph Watson $16,000 a month.

1747
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,080
All these things are interesting.

1748
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,440
But I already know how much Jerome Corsi got paid per month.

1749
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,560
And it was about what?

1750
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,360
$15,000 a month.

1751
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,000
I don't remember exactly, but it was some absurd number.

1752
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,800
But the problem is that I can't accept the unsubstantiated word of someone like this

1753
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,040
just because they're telling me something I want to hear.

1754
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:45,600
Totally.

1755
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,120
That's not fair.

1756
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:47,600
Yeah.

1757
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,400
Also something that you should deduce.

1758
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:56,560
It is far more likely that he is making fun of people for buying dick pills behind their

1759
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,400
backs than otherwise.

1760
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,960
Yeah.

1761
01:33:58,960 --> 01:33:59,440
Yeah.

1762
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,120
Well, I mean, sure.

1763
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:06,160
I feel like the entire supplement industry is laughing at us behind their backs.

1764
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,280
I feel like a lot of them are.

1765
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,160
They have to.

1766
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:14,640
I think that the problem with stuff like that, and it's definitely something that I've

1767
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:20,720
realized over the course of doing this show, is that that is something that everybody who

1768
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,520
isn't on the inside assumes.

1769
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:23,840
Yeah.

1770
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,200
And everybody who's inside won't be convinced that that's the case.

1771
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:27,680
No chance.

1772
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:32,160
Particularly based on the hearsay of somebody being quoted by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

1773
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:32,640
Totally.

1774
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,040
It's just...

1775
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:38,800
Well, I mean, you'd have to change your entire worldview because some guy who you know is

1776
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:44,400
connected to the SPLC told you that Alex thought buying dick pills made you a joke.

1777
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:44,880
Yeah.

1778
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:45,200
You know?

1779
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,280
And it's like, one, these are dick pills.

1780
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,040
I'm not even going to admit that I buy these.

1781
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:49,540
Yeah.

1782
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,280
Two, I am not going to believe that I've been conned out of having good boners.

1783
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,080
Not happening!

1784
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:56,640
Never.

1785
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:56,960
Never!

1786
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:05,360
So at the end of this, what we come to is, you know, we have a situation where it's

1787
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:12,720
essentially another instance of the media bungling how you report on Alex.

1788
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,200
Yeah.

1789
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:17,440
And honestly, I think that maybe you could look at this and think it was a slam dunk,

1790
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,560
but, you know, if you just had a little bit of context to what was going on in Alex's

1791
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,280
life at that time, you'd look at that clip entirely differently than how it's supposed

1792
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,240
to be presented.

1793
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,200
And then after that, I just don't know, man.

1794
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,480
I don't know how I feel.

1795
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:37,440
We've finished recording, we're at the end of this, and I don't know how I feel.

1796
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,360
I don't know if I feel shitty about, like, looking at these things.

1797
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:41,680
Sure.

1798
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:48,800
Um, I don't know if it is worth anyone's time to be like, hey, here is somebody who's

1799
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:55,680
embarking on a redemption arc, and I think that's cool, I think it's possible, but I

1800
01:35:55,680 --> 01:36:02,240
also think we need to wrestle with the fact that this isn't somebody who just came off

1801
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,360
the YouTube.

1802
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:08,800
It's somebody who went to New Zealand with fucking Stefan Molyneux.

1803
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,800
He went to Poland with Stefan Molyneux.

1804
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,760
Yeah.

1805
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,240
It's a serious, like, this is somebody who-

1806
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:21,200
He captured the shot of Stefan Molyneux proudly declaring himself a white nationalist, and

1807
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:25,680
when he clicked cut, he was like, that was great stuff, man.

1808
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,880
Now let me edit it.

1809
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

1810
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,760
I'm gonna watch hours of him saying that he's a white nationalist.

1811
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,640
Let me edit this together in a way that makes him look smart and presentable.

1812
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,520
Exactly, yeah.

1813
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:41,200
Yeah, so kids or youths who click on this video will see it and think like, oh, you

1814
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:45,600
know what, he does make a great case for why Poland is a great country and maybe it's because

1815
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,480
everyone's white.

1816
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:47,360
Exactly.

1817
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:47,600
It's-

1818
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:47,840
Yeah.

1819
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:56,720
And to me, the reason that I play any of the clips that I played, or any of the stuff,

1820
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:00,000
is not to beat up on this guy, because I really don't want to.

1821
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,560
Of course not.

1822
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:09,120
I play it to illustrate that as far as I can tell, everything that I look at and I can

1823
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:16,400
see, it's the mark of a willing and excited participant in this stuff.

1824
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,040
Yeah.

1825
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:22,240
It's- I think that there's a victimhood that inherently comes along with right-wing spheres.

1826
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:26,720
I think that a lot of the time they abuse each other in ways that are sometimes subtle

1827
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,160
and sometimes pretty overt.

1828
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:28,480
Yeah.

1829
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:33,600
And I do think that there's probably a fair amount of that, and I feel bad that he had

1830
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,120
to be involved in any of that stuff.

1831
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:35,520
Yeah.

1832
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:41,680
And I don't think that anybody is not a victim, to some extent, that gets in these machines.

1833
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:46,640
In the same way that we talk about how Alex fires Millie Weaver for Shadow Game.

1834
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,280
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1835
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,240
It's like, you think you're important?

1836
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:48,720
No, you're not.

1837
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:49,200
No, you're not.

1838
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,480
You're disbandable and, you know, that is an inherent abuse.

1839
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,040
You've got to do a fight with Stevie Pease, so you're gone.

1840
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:55,840
Bye, David Knight.

1841
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,400
You're gone.

1842
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,720
You've worked here for a decade and you're fucking gone, I don't care.

1843
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,680
That was a huge mistake and I'm not looking back.

1844
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:08,240
Yeah, I think that is like an inherent piece of this information world, and it is an intrinsically

1845
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,520
abusive place to be in.

1846
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:13,200
And so I'm not minimizing that, and I'm not saying, like, he doesn't have a fair point

1847
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,240
that, like, there's probably some mistreatment along the way, and that sucks.

1848
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:16,640
For sure.

1849
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:25,920
That said, from the second he is involved in right-wing media at Rebel, then with Tommy

1850
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:34,000
Robinson, it's not somebody who's not, like, driving his own train.

1851
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,680
He's not on message boards.

1852
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,040
He's filming their fucking documentaries.

1853
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:39,360
Yeah.

1854
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:39,840
You know?

1855
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,240
Yeah.

1856
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:47,760
Like, that's, I don't know, I don't have any place to judge by no means, but one thing

1857
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:54,720
I did think when I read that article was like, oh man, I thought the SPLC would be better

1858
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,360
than this. I really did.

1859
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:02,160
If I saw that in, like, The Times or something like that, yeah, of course, you guys are all

1860
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:05,280
shitheads, but it's the SPLC hate watch!

1861
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,120
They're good at this!

1862
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,160
It's, I was, man, I was like, goddamn, you guys are, you know what?

1863
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,960
I thought that the left had lost its touch a little bit.

1864
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,200
I don't know.

1865
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,360
Yeah.

1866
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,960
Anyway, let's end this.

1867
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,360
Okay.

1868
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:26,000
Um, apologies if anybody thought this episode was pointless.

1869
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:27,280
It's half pointless.

1870
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,000
I doubt they did.

1871
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,200
But we'll be back, Jordan, but until then, we have a website.

1872
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,920
Indeed we do!

1873
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,960
It's knowledgefight.com.

1874
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,160
Yeah, we're also on Twitter.

1875
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:34,880
We are on Twitter!

1876
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,640
It's at knowledgefight.net, go to betjordan.

1877
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,480
We're also, what?

1878
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,760
Wait, we're on Facebook?

1879
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,720
Oh, did I say?

1880
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:41,920
No, you said we're on Twitter.

1881
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:42,560
Yeah, we're on Facebook.

1882
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,600
Yeah, now we're on Facebook.

1883
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:43,840
Yeah.

1884
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,720
We are on Facebook, Dan.

1885
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,440
I'm absent-minded.

1886
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,840
If you could, please find a local charity or by phone.

1887
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,280
We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo.

1888
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:51,680
I'm Leo.

1889
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,560
I'm DZXClark.

1890
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:53,280
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1891
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,400
I'm absent-minded.

1892
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,480
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

1893
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,040
Thanks for holding.

1894
01:39:59,040 --> 01:39:59,760
Hello, Alex.

1895
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,640
I'm a first-time caller.

1896
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,440
I'm a huge fan.

1897
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,320
I love your work.

1898
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:20,080
I love you.
