Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.040 --> 00:21.280
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.280 --> 00:23.880
I have great respect for Knowledgefight

00:23.880 --> 00:25.160
Knowledgefight

00:25.160 --> 00:27.400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.400 --> 00:28.960
Saying we are the bad guys

00:28.960 --> 00:30.040

Andy and Kansas

00:40.440 --> 00:42.840
Andy and, Andy, stop it

00:42.840 --> 00:44.680
Andy and, Andy and Kansas

00:44.680 --> 00:47.120
Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

00:47.120 --> 00:49.440
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:49.440 --> 00:51.800
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:51.800 --> 00:53.000
I love your work

00:57.000 --> 00:59.240
I love you

00:59.240 --> 01:01.240
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
I'm Jordan

01:02.240 --> 01:04.840
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk just a little bit

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
about Alex Jones

01:05.840 --> 01:07.000
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Jordan

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Dan

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Jordan

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Blackjack

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Did I win?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
No

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh okay

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
That's not how this works

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Then I have a quick question for you

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
What's your bright spot?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Blackjack, I've been playing a lot of online blackjack lately

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh well that works

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
No

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
That makes things much easier

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I guess it's kind of related to that, but that was a joke

01:24.000 --> 01:26.920
I guess one of my bright spots I think is kind of like, I'm starting to forgive myself

01:26.920 --> 01:28.720
for enjoying video games

01:28.720 --> 01:29.720
I like that

01:29.720 --> 01:33.400
Like we talk about, you know, some games we're playing every now and again in these bright

01:33.400 --> 01:34.400
spots

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
Sure

01:35.400 --> 01:39.760
You know, I've started to recognize some of these like unexamined biases I have towards

01:39.760 --> 01:41.400
myself for liking video games

01:41.400 --> 01:42.400
Okay

01:42.400 --> 01:46.480
You know, and like growing up they were so, like my parents were very against video games

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
like you play

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
Sure

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
You play half an hour a day

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
You just keep on, yeah

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
Then I'm gonna throw that thing out the window

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
Totally, totally

01:52.480 --> 01:56.300
And there was, you know, it's always been like something that you could be doing something

01:56.300 --> 01:58.400
better than that

01:58.400 --> 02:02.920
And I think I have a little bit of self-appointed stigma about it

02:02.920 --> 02:06.040
And I'm starting to feel a little bit less that way

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
Yeah

02:07.040 --> 02:09.760
And I think part of that is just like I'm recognizing there are a lot of really good

02:09.760 --> 02:11.680
video games that are a lot of fun and

02:11.680 --> 02:12.680
Yeah

02:12.680 --> 02:14.880
I don't know, taking away a little bit of that shame is good

02:14.880 --> 02:18.640
Yeah, no that's great because I've always had that same experience that even if you

02:18.640 --> 02:25.360
classify it as like a complete leisure activity you should be doing better leisure activities

02:25.360 --> 02:29.400
You know, like, oh you're playing a video game as a leisure activity, what you should

02:29.400 --> 02:31.360
be doing is going out to a park

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
Yeah

02:32.360 --> 02:35.520
And throwing the ball around and it's like I get that and sometimes I do

02:35.520 --> 02:38.200
I got a video game for you, it's called The Museum, get over that

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
Yeah, exactly

02:39.200 --> 02:41.440
Yeah, there's a lot of that

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
Yeah

02:42.440 --> 02:45.920
I don't know, I think it's good to retain a little bit of it lest I descend into only

02:45.920 --> 02:46.920
one

02:46.920 --> 02:49.880
No, no, no, for sure, you can go far, you can go too far with anything

02:49.880 --> 02:51.740
I'm finding a balance, anyway, what about you?

02:51.740 --> 02:52.740
I like it

02:52.740 --> 02:58.760
Dan, there's a new Mogwai album out, Dan, and that is important to me

02:58.760 --> 02:59.960
Don't feed that album after midnight

02:59.960 --> 03:02.720
Alright, okay, Dan

03:02.720 --> 03:07.760
No, it's really interesting to me that there's a new album all the way in 2021 because I

03:07.760 --> 03:14.520
think the first time I saw them live was in 2001 and they've been putting out music since

03:14.520 --> 03:21.480
the late 80s, but it's Mogwai, so it's not like the Rolling Stones are those old bands

03:21.480 --> 03:26.920
of like 70 year olds who are still touring, it's weird post-rock, so everybody who goes

03:26.920 --> 03:31.760
is like, I wanna hear your new shit, post-rock all sounds basically the same

03:31.760 --> 03:33.600
I have an interesting confession to make

03:33.600 --> 03:34.600
What's that?

03:34.600 --> 03:35.600
I know nothing about Mogwai

03:35.600 --> 03:37.160
You don't know anything about Mogwai?

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
No

03:38.160 --> 03:42.800
Oh shit, Mogwai is one of the most important, first off, Scottish bands there's ever been

03:42.800 --> 03:48.440
and second, Mogwai helped create the entire genre of post-rock as we know it

03:48.440 --> 03:51.920
Yeah, this is a big blind spot for me, clearly, because you could have told me they were metal

03:51.920 --> 03:53.720
or folk, and I wouldn't have believed either

03:53.720 --> 03:56.240
Well, now let me tell you something about post-rock, Dan

03:56.240 --> 03:57.240
Oh, no

03:57.240 --> 04:00.160
There are elements of metal and folk that have been applied

04:00.160 --> 04:01.160
Goddammit

04:01.160 --> 04:03.800
And they have wound up influencing other...

04:03.800 --> 04:08.720
It's only fair that I sit through this music lecture because I got a lot to get through

04:08.720 --> 04:11.120
in terms of Professor Dan today, so

04:11.120 --> 04:12.120
Fair enough, okay

04:12.120 --> 04:17.000
Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over, I think there's a lot of in's

04:17.000 --> 04:20.120
and out's, a lot of twists and hoo-boy

04:20.120 --> 04:22.720
But before we get down to business on that, let's take a little moment to say thank you

04:22.720 --> 04:24.600
to some folks who have signed up and are supporting the show

04:24.600 --> 04:25.600
I think that's a great idea

04:25.600 --> 04:29.720
So first, Nick, and this is spelled N-I-K, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
I'm a policy wonk

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
Thanks, Nick

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
Thank you

04:32.720 --> 04:34.600
Next, Keely, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:34.600 --> 04:35.600
I'm a policy wonk

04:35.600 --> 04:36.600
Thanks, Keely

04:36.600 --> 04:40.960
Next, SpunglodorfEnemy, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:40.960 --> 04:41.960
I'm a policy wonk

04:41.960 --> 04:46.160
Thank you very much, however, you are also my enemy, for I am Spunglodorf

04:46.160 --> 04:47.160
Oh no

04:47.160 --> 04:51.400
Next, thank you to Eviscerated by a Reptoid Over Cadbury Eggs, thank you so much, you

04:51.400 --> 04:52.500
are now a policy wonk

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
I'm a policy wonk

04:53.500 --> 04:56.340
Thank you very much, vision of all of our fates

04:56.340 --> 04:59.720
Next, Dante H, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:59.720 --> 05:00.720
I'm a policy wonk

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
Thanks, Dante

05:01.720 --> 05:05.440
Thank you, and finally, I'd like to say thank you to a technocrat out there, actually it's

05:05.440 --> 05:08.600
two people split into technocrats, so maybe they're both, ah, who knows

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
We'll see

05:09.600 --> 05:12.960
Anyway, Matt and Bin, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat, or technocrats, you

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
decide

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
I'm a policy wonk

05:14.960 --> 05:18.120
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

05:18.120 --> 05:19.440
How's your 401k doing, bro?

05:19.440 --> 05:22.120
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

05:22.120 --> 05:26.000
Let's just get down to business, we ain't making that money off that heroin, why you

05:26.000 --> 05:27.740
pimps so good?

05:27.740 --> 05:31.920
My neck is freakishly large, I declare info war on you

05:31.920 --> 05:33.720
Thank you so much, Matt and Bin

05:33.720 --> 05:35.360
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you

05:35.360 --> 05:39.760
And Jordan, we got a little bit of a special occasion to celebrate today

05:39.760 --> 05:40.760
Did we?

05:40.760 --> 05:42.000
Yep, it's Mogwai's birthday

05:42.000 --> 05:45.040
Oh no, oh shit, somebody fed him after midnight

05:45.040 --> 05:50.960
No, no, we got a special birthday shout out going out to Easter, happy birthday out there

05:50.960 --> 05:52.240
The holiday of Easter?

05:52.240 --> 05:54.120
No, a person by the name of Easter

05:54.120 --> 05:58.240
Oh, Astarte, the Sumerian god of, ooh, nope

05:58.240 --> 06:02.640
Maybe, no, but I am excited that Easter candy is starting to show up

06:02.640 --> 06:03.640
Oh man

06:03.640 --> 06:05.480
At the Walgreens and what have you

06:05.480 --> 06:06.800
I do appreciate that

06:06.800 --> 06:07.800
Very pumped

06:07.800 --> 06:13.040
Reese's peanut butter eggs are put out there, February 15th, baby

06:13.040 --> 06:19.120
I like those, the eggs, the hard shelled eggs, the mini eggs, those are the best

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
Those are fantastic

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
Holy shit, they're so good

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
No, they're incredible

06:22.120 --> 06:25.760
So anyway, happy birthday, Easter, I hope you enjoy some Easter candy

06:25.760 --> 06:26.760
Yes, please

06:26.760 --> 06:27.760
And everybody's doing well

06:27.760 --> 06:34.200
Yeah, the thing that I, it's terrible, but my partner is allergic to peanuts

06:34.200 --> 06:40.920
And so I have to hoard Reese's peanut butter eggs and eat them like a squirrel before I

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
get home

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
Yeah

06:42.920 --> 06:46.120
And then like mouthwash and brush my teeth, but Dan, they're worth it

06:46.120 --> 06:49.400
I'm going to get you some Reese's almond butter eggs

06:49.400 --> 06:51.400
How dare you, sir

06:51.400 --> 06:53.320
Not quite the same

06:53.320 --> 06:54.320
No

06:54.320 --> 06:58.040
So Jordan, we didn't have an episode on Friday and in the interest of full transparency,

06:58.040 --> 06:59.760
I want to discuss what happened

06:59.760 --> 07:04.160
Essentially that video of Alex saying that he wished he'd never met Trump threw me into

07:04.160 --> 07:08.360
a complete tailspin, but not for the reason that people who listen to our show or who

07:08.360 --> 07:09.960
don't listen to our show might think

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
Of course

07:10.960 --> 07:15.040
I was flooded by messages and comments from people wanting our take on it, so naturally

07:15.040 --> 07:17.520
I sat down to digest this footage.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.680
In the name of being able to have a conversation that the audience can understand, let's listen

07:21.680 --> 07:23.760
to that clip now all together

07:23.760 --> 07:33.960
Part of me, the selfish part, wishes I'd never met Donald Trump, wishes that I'd never met

07:33.960 --> 07:43.840
Roger Stone, because unlike previous things I'd done that were game changing, those were

07:43.840 --> 07:54.200
just time space continuum reflections of the third big change I was going to be involved

07:54.200 --> 07:55.200
in

07:55.200 --> 07:57.360
And that was bringing Donald, John Trump into Austin

07:57.360 --> 08:00.520
I'm just going to say it again, I said Austin into office

08:00.520 --> 08:03.960
Because this is, you guys are actually really good questions, this is going to be a really

08:03.960 --> 08:06.680
good thing, but I'm going to say it again in a minute

08:06.680 --> 08:13.320
It's the truth, I'm just going to say it, that I wish I never would have fucking met

08:13.320 --> 08:14.320
Trump

08:14.320 --> 08:18.600
I wish it never would have happened, and it's not that the attacks I've been through, I'm

08:18.600 --> 08:22.840
so sick of fucking Donald Trump man, God I'm fucking sick of him

08:22.840 --> 08:26.920
And I'm not doing this because it's like I'm kissing his fucking ass, you know, it's like

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
I'm sick of it

08:27.920 --> 08:31.400
Do it in a minute

08:31.400 --> 08:35.520
To people unfamiliar with Alex Jones or the right wing media sphere, this probably sounds

08:35.520 --> 08:37.320
like a huge, huge deal

08:37.320 --> 08:41.080
Here's Alex on film saying that he's sick of Trump and wishes he'd never met Trump or

08:41.080 --> 08:42.080
Roger Stone

08:42.080 --> 08:45.920
To anyone who's listened to our show regularly, this probably was less shocking

08:45.920 --> 08:50.400
Though Alex has created a personality cult around Trump that he's inexorably tied to,

08:50.400 --> 08:54.760
he also frequently lashes out at Trump and the people in Trump's orbit when things don't

08:54.760 --> 08:55.960
go his way

08:55.960 --> 09:00.560
There was the classic case of his breakdown after Trump bombed Syria in April 2018

09:00.560 --> 09:05.360
I mean, you know, like Trump said, Hillary and Obama created ISIS

09:05.360 --> 09:10.080
Well, but, but, but, but, but Trump, it's Barack Trump

09:10.080 --> 09:14.160
Trump uses it like a prophylactic, he just shoves ISIS up his big dirty asshole

09:14.160 --> 09:16.160
Apologizes to TV stations

09:16.160 --> 09:18.960
Yeah, and then, you know, he said even more

09:18.960 --> 09:22.640
Here's the news Trump, I'm not dog crap on shoes, brother

09:22.640 --> 09:26.000
You are crap on my shoes, you son of a bitch

09:26.000 --> 09:28.480
You will freaking get it, get ready

09:28.480 --> 09:32.800
And of course the whole part where Alex yelled fuck Trump a bunch that day before he realized

09:32.800 --> 09:33.800
he was streaming live

09:33.800 --> 09:34.800
Well there's that

09:34.800 --> 09:38.240
When the fuck are we going live, I can't do this shit anymore

09:38.240 --> 09:41.280
Fuck Trump and fuck these fucking people

09:41.280 --> 09:45.280
At a certain point, man, I'm sick of all you fucking liberals and mainland, you're a bunch

09:45.280 --> 09:48.160
of cowardly fucks, you're not Americans

09:48.160 --> 09:51.280
What's going on?

09:51.280 --> 09:56.560
Okay, should we shut these feets down and delete those?

09:56.560 --> 09:58.480
Just shut those feets down and restart them, okay?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.360
Better shut that down

09:59.360 --> 10:01.200
Yeah, no one will ever know about this

10:01.200 --> 10:02.000
No, no, no, no

10:02.000 --> 10:06.240
So that stream included Alex accusing Trump of betraying his family and talking about

10:06.240 --> 10:08.800
how ashamed he was of Trump and of supporting him

10:08.800 --> 10:13.520
Things got so out of hand, Owen Schroyer had to try to stop the show, because Alex was

10:13.520 --> 10:17.440
swearing so much and they were out of delay, so they couldn't bleep things

10:18.400 --> 10:20.880
Maybe you should shut it down, we're out of delay

10:21.840 --> 10:24.080
I see that, I see that, they were on TV

10:24.080 --> 10:24.800
I see that

10:24.800 --> 10:28.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's been made clear

10:28.240 --> 10:31.040
It's so fucking clear right now, Owen

10:31.040 --> 10:34.000
Yeah, that was a tough drunk night for Alex

10:34.000 --> 10:37.120
We did a whole episode about that night, so if you want to hear about that in greater

10:37.120 --> 10:39.440
detail, it's episode 150

10:39.440 --> 10:43.600
But the thing is, that night is not at all an isolated incident

10:43.600 --> 10:47.840
Alex very regularly blows up at Trump, and the reason is pretty obvious

10:47.840 --> 10:50.480
Trump doesn't actually care about what Alex thinks,

10:50.480 --> 10:54.480
but Alex's business model has relied on him claiming that Trump does

10:54.480 --> 10:58.400
When Trump's public actions contradict the version of reality that Alex has painted on

10:58.400 --> 11:03.040
his show, the only response Alex can have is to portray it as betrayal

11:03.040 --> 11:06.560
The alternative is to admit that you were either conned, or that you were aware that

11:06.560 --> 11:09.360
Trump was full of shit and you were helping him con your audience,

11:09.360 --> 11:12.160
neither of which are acceptable for Alex's brand

11:12.160 --> 11:16.720
Yeah, they don't come off in a positive light no matter how you try and spin them

11:16.720 --> 11:21.600
The same thing happened during Alex's March 2019 Ask Me Anything stream that he did,

11:21.600 --> 11:25.760
which happened after Facebook had purged more accounts that Alex and Infowars ran,

11:26.400 --> 11:31.360
and just after Rogan did an episode with Jack Dorsey, where Alex's Twitter ban was discussed

11:31.360 --> 11:35.520
Alex was really raw about how Trump wasn't helping him get it back on social media,

11:35.520 --> 11:39.360
and he expressed that inaction on Trump's part has made him turn against him

11:40.000 --> 11:44.400
Trump has all the power in his hands, and he's done a lot of good things,

11:44.400 --> 11:49.040
but the fact that he doesn't to these other decentralizations shows that

11:49.040 --> 11:53.760
at the end of the day he's an establishment type person, and so he should be abandoned

11:54.480 --> 11:57.760
And I'm not happy about that because I've been persecuted for supporting Trump

11:57.760 --> 12:03.840
But, you know, my gut is like ready to pull away, but then there's like a left,

12:04.400 --> 12:07.760
and they are. I don't want to abandon Trump because of them.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.920
They didn't run me off Trump. They didn't make me turn against Trump.

12:11.920 --> 12:18.400
Trump made me turn against Trump. And so it doesn't matter if Trump is this great thing,

12:18.400 --> 12:21.920
it's that if he's going against that we have to turn against him.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.840
So some of these clips might be a little obscure

12:25.840 --> 12:29.360
Sure. And, you know, they haven't been seen by multitudes of people,

12:29.360 --> 12:31.440
so it could be argued that Alex said these things in

12:31.440 --> 12:34.720
unseen areas of the internet were only weirdos like me look on.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.200
True.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.760
Unfortunately, Alex has literally also said that he hates Trump more than Hillary

12:39.760 --> 12:42.080
when he was a guest on Joe Rogan's show.

12:42.720 --> 12:47.360
I don't dislike Donald Trump, and I think he's done some good things on trying to do peace

12:47.360 --> 12:50.240
and trying to get jobs back to America, but I hate Donald Trump

12:50.240 --> 12:55.040
because I got behind him because I knew Hillary was bad.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.760
And then he became my identity. He's not a bad guy.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.840
But the truth is, I hate him more than Hillary Clinton

13:00.880 --> 13:04.640
because he's who I am now and whatever he does is who I am.

13:04.640 --> 13:08.160
I'm not with Donald Trump. I'm with America and freedom and everything else.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.800
And I'm not throwing him under the bus to get George Soros on my back,

13:10.800 --> 13:13.600
though they're already after me for the reasons I'm with them.

13:13.600 --> 13:19.680
So I'm not against even Trump, but I get in a fight like this that's so dumbed down

13:20.480 --> 13:24.960
that then no matter what I do, they take my radicalness, my weirdness to hurt Trump.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.920
But then all it does is like radioactively attack me.

13:27.920 --> 13:33.600
I don't know how to describe it, but it's like it's like Trump is breaking my legs every day.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.840
And it's not like I'm not willing to go through the pain,

13:35.840 --> 13:38.240
except a lot of what he says I don't agree with.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.680
And he's not my identity.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.960
Sandy Hook's not my identity.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.840
This is just you're talking from your own personal perspective.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.000
And I appreciate that, that he's not your,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.040
I don't know how many people actually think that he's your identity.

13:49.040 --> 13:49.680
Me.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.240
Me!

13:50.240 --> 13:52.560
You might notice that in these clips I've played,

13:52.560 --> 13:55.760
you know, there are instances that Alex is clearly intoxicated on air.

13:55.760 --> 14:00.640
I was about to say, Dan, there are very similar speech patterns and yeah.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.760
That's something of a theme.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.760
And it's something that seems also to be related to the clip that was released by Hatewatch.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.280
The clip of Alex saying that he's sick of Trump that we played at the beginning.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.240
Yeah, and you can argue in vino veritas if you would like, but...

14:12.240 --> 14:13.520
I'm not gonna even get into any of that.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.240
Exactly.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.600
Alex definitely seems drunk in that clip, and that makes sense.

14:17.600 --> 14:22.720
But the thing is, this is not a behavior that's exclusive to when he's clearly fucked up.

14:22.720 --> 14:27.760
In late January 2019, Alex was getting deeply frustrated with being associated with Trump,

14:27.760 --> 14:33.440
at least partially because fundraising for Roger Stone's legal defense was cutting into his profits.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.440
I've got all these employees and all this crew and I've got all my lawsuits I'm fighting

14:37.440 --> 14:39.280
that are way more money than Roger's paying.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.560
It's not some competition here, but I'm kind of fighting a two-front war with Roger

14:42.560 --> 14:46.000
because Infowars has become a platform to sit there and promote fundraising for

14:46.880 --> 14:51.760
his issues when I gave Roger a job here, which is great, and he's paid.

14:51.760 --> 14:57.360
And then it also becomes this split where we may not get the funds to fund Infowars

14:57.360 --> 15:01.600
because the 24-7 Roger Stone fundraising is people then split it and say, well,

15:01.600 --> 15:03.680
we'll just give him a donation instead of Infowars.

15:03.680 --> 15:08.000
I'm going to have a talk with him about that because we can win the battle, lose the war here

15:08.000 --> 15:12.160
because of that. So I hope people do support Roger, but Infowars has a bill,

15:13.360 --> 15:17.040
let's not exaggerate, at least 10 times what Roger Stone's is, okay?

15:19.760 --> 15:22.160
And he's bringing in as much money as we're bringing in right now.

15:22.160 --> 15:26.320
And that's great. That's all fine and dandy. I have 100 employees.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.280
I have all the bandwidth bills and all the equipment.

15:29.280 --> 15:34.720
And I sent security up with Roger and reporters up there that cost money. And so I'm not bitching

15:34.720 --> 15:39.200
or complaining. I'm going to have to make some decisions around here on a bunch of fronts about

15:39.200 --> 15:43.840
layoffs, laying Paul Watson off, laying Roger Stone off, people that are paid more around here.

15:43.840 --> 15:50.080
Alex is definitely more demonstrative and more gregarious, I guess, when he's fucked up,

15:50.080 --> 15:55.440
but he'll still venture into many outbursts against Trump like he did here in this segment

15:55.440 --> 16:00.560
he was doing on his, he did a big marathon in May, 2017. And he said this.

16:01.840 --> 16:16.000
And so the truth is Trump is the Johnson holster for the warmongering neocons and Democrats.

16:18.080 --> 16:23.600
Trump is the Johnson holster of the military industrial complex.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.960
And these are just clips about Trump. They're not even about the people

16:26.960 --> 16:33.440
associated with Trump, that Alex has gone back and forth on heroes to villains over and over again.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.840
The point I'm seeking to make here is that if you follow Alex, you know that him saying that

16:37.840 --> 16:42.240
he wishes he'd never met Trump while drunk in a controlled setting where editing is possible

16:42.240 --> 16:46.720
is not a bombshell. It's a good headline and it seems to have driven some traffic if my

16:46.720 --> 16:51.520
mentions are any gauge of that, but I'm not sure it's helpful. And the reason for this is

16:51.520 --> 16:56.320
three-pronged. The first is the fact that this is not a comment that's necessarily groundbreaking.

16:56.320 --> 17:00.800
Alex has said a lot of shit about Trump on his own show. The second piece is that literally

17:00.800 --> 17:04.720
nobody who listens to Alex Jones would care about a 90-second clip being reported on by

17:04.720 --> 17:10.080
the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate watch. No, no, no. They always check the SPLC to see

17:10.080 --> 17:14.400
whether or not they should trust people, right? I can personally respect the work that the SPLC

17:14.400 --> 17:18.160
does and acknowledge that they are an important entity, while at the same time saying with

17:18.160 --> 17:22.880
absolute certainty that no one who believes right-wing propaganda will respect or accept

17:22.880 --> 17:29.600
a report from the SPLC. A very basic piece of right-wing ideology is that the SPLC is a

17:29.600 --> 17:34.240
communist globalist front organization meant to launder money and demonize patriots who

17:34.240 --> 17:38.880
threaten the globalist establishment. Any report coming from that source is going to be seen

17:38.880 --> 17:43.520
basically like how normal people see a headline that comes from Glenn Beck. It's going to be

17:43.520 --> 17:48.320
ignored. I was going to say, it's like RT being like, Russia's not doing anything evil today.

17:48.320 --> 17:54.400
Okay. Presumably the people that this clip and things like it would be helpful for are people

17:54.400 --> 17:58.560
who suspect that Alex may be a valid source of information, and in terms of those people,

17:58.560 --> 18:03.120
they will not be reached by this reporting at all. That's not to say that the SPLC shouldn't

18:03.120 --> 18:08.480
do reporting like this, but the fact that only they have access to the underlying material,

18:08.480 --> 18:12.240
which we'll get into in a minute, makes this a little bit difficult to believe will help

18:12.240 --> 18:17.040
anybody that it could help. The people that this Hatewatch article appeals to are people who

18:17.040 --> 18:23.200
already think or know that Alex is full of shit. The third prong is that this basically just plays

18:23.200 --> 18:28.000
the same game that we've done so many times with Alex in the past. The response is predictable,

18:28.000 --> 18:33.200
and honestly, it's one that Alex comes out winning. On the evening of March 2nd,

18:33.840 --> 18:38.480
when this article on Hatewatch was released, Alex appeared on the War Room to discuss things,

18:38.480 --> 18:43.200
and it was honestly so formulaic that I probably could have written his response before listening

18:43.200 --> 18:50.800
to this episode. So here at the beginning of this is Owen introducing this headline and asking Alex

18:50.800 --> 18:56.240
about it. Okay. Alex, this is just... I just might as well bring this up to you because it's kind of

18:56.240 --> 18:59.840
funny. Is this the Daily Mail article where they say a Howard Stern puppet of me is real?

18:59.840 --> 19:06.080
No, no, that's a different one. This one just came out from the Southern Poverty Law Center.

19:06.080 --> 19:11.440
Oh, this is so ridiculous, especially when I work here and I know the true story and then to just

19:11.440 --> 19:18.320
read their lies. Alex Jones on leaked video, I wish I never met Trump. You can see there,

19:18.320 --> 19:22.480
calling it the Southern Poverty Hate Center, preemptively minimizing and deriding the headline

19:22.480 --> 19:28.400
and the source, that this isn't a big deal to Alex or Owen. The thing about Stern there was that

19:28.400 --> 19:34.160
apparently a Daily Mail article attributed words that an Alex impersonator said to being from Alex

19:34.160 --> 19:39.040
himself. It's difficult to tell though because what's apparently parody is indistinguishable

19:39.040 --> 19:44.160
from things Alex would say himself. From the article, quote, this is normalized mass

19:44.160 --> 19:48.640
extermination, a bio attack on humanity before the day of our Lord's birth in the name of the

19:48.640 --> 19:53.520
satanic pedophile globalist New World Order. They want forced inoculation of the Gates vaccine,

19:53.520 --> 19:59.600
which has the HIV delivery system gene coding. It has HIV in it. That's what happens when you

19:59.600 --> 20:06.480
defeat parody. When you finally won over, like SNL can't fucking touch you.

20:06.480 --> 20:10.800
No, I mean, that might have been said by a person doing an impression, but Alex has said all of

20:10.800 --> 20:15.360
those things. He literally said all those things. He could have been reading off of any episode

20:15.360 --> 20:17.840
transcript. Yeah, it could have been. No, no, no, not hard.

20:17.840 --> 20:22.640
Anyway, Alex is fixated on this detail for two reasons. First, it gives him a chance to try and

20:22.640 --> 20:26.640
wage a publicity campaign where he's able to see if he can get some cheap attention by yelling

20:26.640 --> 20:31.680
about a more popular broadcaster, in this case, Howard Stern. We're mere days away from Stern

20:31.680 --> 20:37.120
getting the sneaky snake treatment. Second, it distracts from the main point of that Daily

20:37.120 --> 20:42.000
Mail article, which was about how Alex had buzzed his ex-wife's house in a helicopter,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.720
which had terrorized their daughter. From the article, quote, in the video exclusively obtained

20:46.720 --> 20:50.960
by DailyMail.com, the couple's 12-year-old daughter is briefly seen waving before rushing

20:50.960 --> 20:55.680
over to her mother and screaming, it's scary, mom, it's scary. We try to stay out of Alex's

20:55.680 --> 21:00.560
personal life, but this incident seems like Alex being a real piece of shit. And he's focusing on

21:00.560 --> 21:05.680
this detail about the Stern character. It seems like a way to make the audience not even care to

21:05.680 --> 21:09.600
look at this article because it kind of makes them look like a real piece of shit. Yeah, yeah,

21:09.600 --> 21:15.680
and that's also another thing that's beyond parody. No good or reasonable human being would

21:15.680 --> 21:20.000
fucking fly by their own child with a helicopter. Wow.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.760
You've won. You've defeated me. That's ridiculous and evil.

21:23.760 --> 21:29.760
Yeah, yeah. So we now get to the formulaic defense, exactly what you would expect.

21:30.480 --> 21:38.400
Alex, so they're saying that it's a leaked footage from a documentary filmmaker that you paid

21:38.400 --> 21:42.080
on his film, even though that's not even accurate. We didn't pay him to make that,

21:42.080 --> 21:46.080
he did that on his own. Hold on, let me explain. Turns out those guys worked for Hope Not Hate,

21:46.080 --> 21:48.720
so they probably lost their ADL, you know, that whole group.

21:48.720 --> 21:52.880
Oh, there we go. They came to me and they said, we're making this documentary of Paul

21:52.880 --> 21:56.240
Watson, all these people that were here one day. They did the interview and they said,

21:56.240 --> 21:59.280
what's your feelings on Trump? And I said, well, it's devil's advocate. It's in the film.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.960
I said, part of me hates him. It destroyed my life. You know, it's terrible. I wish I would

22:02.960 --> 22:06.880
have met him, but I'm still glad I did it because overall, even though it's been painful, I always

22:06.880 --> 22:11.520
do that. You know, they always get me on that. So that's in a DVD we sell.

22:11.520 --> 22:15.760
So here you see the reason why this minute or so clip is not really threatening to Alex,

22:15.760 --> 22:20.240
at least in the eyes of his listeners. It was taken out of context, which is the standard

22:20.240 --> 22:24.160
excuse that everyone in the right wing media knows damn well they can use to get out of almost

22:24.160 --> 22:26.800
any situation. Really? I've never heard that before.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.720
It happens all the time because it's something that the audience has been trained to accept,

22:30.720 --> 22:34.720
particularly when the clip that's said to be out of context comes from a source that's been

22:34.720 --> 22:39.520
fully maligned, like the SPLC. The audience requires an answer for that clip because

22:39.520 --> 22:44.000
people are posting it around, which is delivered by Alex saying that it's out of context. That's

22:44.000 --> 22:48.800
enough. The audience does not then become curious about what the larger context is.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.400
Matter is just dead. Yep.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.800
And you know what? Alex is standing on slightly sturdier ground here than he

22:54.800 --> 22:59.120
normally is when he makes that claim. I went and I rewatched the full documentary

22:59.120 --> 23:02.720
called You Can't Watch This. And the part that that clip is in,

23:03.520 --> 23:08.160
part of it is in the movie. Here is that. It's not just me who's at risk.

23:08.160 --> 23:20.160
Part of me. The selfish part. Wishes I'd never met Donald Trump.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.200
Fantastic business. I don't know if you can see that thing right up here.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.160
We can. But it's doing great business. I hope your

23:26.160 --> 23:29.760
audience goes out and buys it as Christmas gifts and everything else. And I just want

23:29.760 --> 23:35.360
to finish by saying your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very

23:35.360 --> 23:38.880
impressed, I hope. And I think we'll be speaking a lot.

23:38.880 --> 23:46.800
Being sucked into that whole vortex has, it was like selling your soul.

23:48.400 --> 23:54.880
Everything I did, everything I was, and everything I was trying to do at that point,

23:54.880 --> 24:00.800
didn't matter how diverse it was. It didn't matter how it was multifaceted. It all became

24:00.800 --> 24:06.400
that at that point. So Trump came to get my populist audience and then he did that.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.760
The Democrats saw it as a threat. They attacked it and said that I was Donald

24:09.760 --> 24:12.960
Trump thinking that would hurt him. It made Trump stronger. It made him win the election.

24:13.920 --> 24:21.280
And so they understand that Donald Trump is infamous and that I'm Donald Trump now.

24:21.280 --> 24:26.160
And it's like a ring of doom. We've been merged together into this,

24:26.160 --> 24:31.520
into this thing and they're obsessed with it. If I'd had a target on my back before,

24:32.880 --> 24:39.280
when I signed on to promote America's resurgence, to promote Donald Trump,

24:40.320 --> 24:45.680
all the attacks I'd been through before were like bootcamp. This was the real battle.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.280
And that's when it got crazy. The future definitely worries me.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.080
I left the beginning and end and just to show that that's where...

24:52.080 --> 24:54.560
It's unedited. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand.

24:54.560 --> 24:59.120
This introduces some really murky issues for me. If you listen to the clip that's included

24:59.120 --> 25:03.280
in the final product of the documentary, it's not really saying anything too different from

25:03.280 --> 25:07.280
what Alex is saying in the newly released clip. Yeah, I didn't know that that was in there and

25:07.280 --> 25:11.520
now I'm real not happy about this. They're both expressing a frustration

25:11.520 --> 25:16.160
with Trump, particularly around how the identity that Alex enjoyed prior to being associated with

25:16.160 --> 25:20.880
Trump has been swallowed up by this new image of him. Make no mistake though, he did create that

25:20.880 --> 25:22.320
image and he profits off it. No, I know.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.400
Don't feel too bad for him. No, I don't feel bad at all.

25:24.400 --> 25:29.040
I'm really frustrated because that does seem something like a very clear-eyed evaluation

25:29.040 --> 25:32.640
of how things have gone, which makes me think he's been listening to our show too much.

25:32.640 --> 25:40.960
Well, but that clip that's in the documentary is thematically the same as the only difference

25:40.960 --> 25:45.440
is that Alex seems to be a little more mad and he's having a little bit of an outburst.

25:45.440 --> 25:51.600
I just don't give a shit. Once you say someone shoved ISIS up their dirty asshole,

25:51.600 --> 25:55.200
of course I don't care. You've already said enough.

25:55.200 --> 25:59.120
It's tough to top that. Dan, if I told you,

25:59.120 --> 26:05.360
you shoved fucking the base up your dirty asshole, I don't think we would be going beyond that.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.680
We'd be like, we got it. If you're on stage and you say that,

26:07.680 --> 26:09.680
I'm giving you the light. Yeah, we got it guys.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.200
It's what's been said needed to be said and it's over.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.480
It's about time. Yeah.

26:14.480 --> 26:19.120
So the thing that I find fascinating here is that the clip that's in the documentary is actually a

26:19.120 --> 26:23.680
clearer articulation of Alex's feelings. Whereas the clip released by hate watch is interesting

26:23.680 --> 26:28.160
only because it appears to show a secret revelation and an emotional outburst.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.120
You can see emotional outbursts on Alex's show every day.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.360
And what Alex says there is far from a secret revelation.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.800
And ultimately here's one of the things that I'm really struggling with.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.280
As far as I can tell, as someone who watched the documentary and has watched Alex's show

26:43.280 --> 26:46.480
around the time that this documentary was being filmed,

26:46.480 --> 26:50.080
I do think that the clip is taking Alex out of context.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.840
Yeah. Yeah.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.640
Alex was struggling with his identity at the time.

26:54.640 --> 26:58.640
According to hate watch, this documentary was filming in January 2019,

26:58.640 --> 27:02.560
which is exactly when Alex was spending a lot of time on air discussing his desire

27:02.560 --> 27:06.960
to get back to his roots and not be so singularly associated with Trump.

27:06.960 --> 27:11.360
Here is a clip from the January 28th, 2019 episode of his show,

27:11.360 --> 27:15.200
where Alex discusses how he doesn't just want to talk about Trump and Roger anymore

27:15.200 --> 27:18.320
and how the audience wants him to go back to his roots.

27:18.320 --> 27:23.680
I don't want to just cover Trump or Roger Stone, and I like Roger,

27:23.680 --> 27:29.360
but it's taken all the oxygen out of the room of all the incredible stuff going on around the world.

27:29.360 --> 27:33.920
I ran on the edge of war with Israel, what's happening in Venezuela,

27:33.920 --> 27:38.240
what Soros is saying, get ready for China to collapse, which I agree with.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.320
But that's only because Soros is jumping on the bandwagon.

27:41.120 --> 27:44.080
A lot of listeners love the show, but they also say, Alex,

27:44.080 --> 27:50.720
Alex, we want you to get back to secret society some and the globalist and the esoteric and

27:51.920 --> 27:56.400
weather modification, because the last three years, it's been all Trump all the time.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.400
And that's because we've been in an epic civil war with the globalist.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.320
It'll still be a lot of Trump here.

28:02.320 --> 28:06.000
It's just that I don't want to cover every facet of everything Trump does.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.080
Alex was feeling like his identity had been subsumed by the Trump.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.080
And you clearly was right.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.240
He was feeling right, totally.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.680
He was correctly feeling that.

28:15.680 --> 28:19.200
And he was feeling some kind of backlash from the audience over this.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.800
They were expressing that they weren't.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.840
There was some, whatever it was, maybe it's somebody who works at Infowars,

28:25.840 --> 28:29.280
maybe it was an outpouring of feedback from the audience.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.960
We miss Beck when you were fun.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.760
This is boring and one note.

28:33.760 --> 28:34.400
No, I know.

28:34.400 --> 28:41.520
And I feel like this is such a nothing, simply because it seems impossible to believe.

28:41.520 --> 28:46.160
It's impossible for me to believe that any right thinking person

28:46.160 --> 28:50.880
would look at the grifters and not think they all actually hate Donald Trump.

28:50.880 --> 28:56.080
Like when you saw, like in the campaign, in the primary, they all hate him.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.280
They all hate him, but it's just part of the game.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.240
He won the game and now they have to lick his boots.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.000
Any reasonable person would be like, yeah, of course Alex hates Donald Trump.

29:06.000 --> 29:11.920
Yeah, I think anybody except the most ambitious grifter would have seen that,

29:11.920 --> 29:13.680
like, okay, the money is following this.

29:13.680 --> 29:14.320
Exactly.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.200
And the most ambitious grifter would have probably, the bet might have paid off.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.480
Yeah, probably not.

29:20.480 --> 29:20.800
Maybe.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.800
It'd be a long bet.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.800
I don't know if anybody who's boosting Rand Paul is making a lot of money.

29:26.800 --> 29:27.280
I don't think so.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.400
Anybody who's stuck with Rand.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.520
I don't think so.

29:29.520 --> 29:34.720
So this was part of a larger period in time where Alex was really fucking tired

29:34.720 --> 29:37.360
of Roger's legal fund siphoning donations.

29:37.360 --> 29:42.880
But it's definitely this phase that he was in, you know, like that legal fees

29:42.880 --> 29:49.760
and this disillusionment with Trump and wanting to be who he used to be was going on in January 2019.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.320
Yeah.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.200
And if you pay attention to Alex and you were listening to it,

29:53.200 --> 29:56.080
you would know that this stemmed from Alex being mad at Trump

29:56.080 --> 29:59.760
for not declaring a national emergency to close our southern border.

29:59.760 --> 30:03.440
This was deep in the caravan propaganda cycle of 2019.

30:03.440 --> 30:08.240
So in Infowars world, Trump not declaring an emergency and seizing complete power

30:08.240 --> 30:11.920
was essentially him allowing all Americans to be murdered by MS-13.

30:11.920 --> 30:12.240
There you go.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.680
Which is hard to rationalize.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.000
Yeah.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.080
So Alex turned on Trump for a little while.

30:16.720 --> 30:20.720
That was a really rough situation for Alex because he had all but guaranteed

30:20.720 --> 30:25.280
that Trump was about to declare an emergency, as we can be heard here.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.040
Quite a time to be alive, my friends.

30:29.040 --> 30:32.480
Trump's going to declare a national emergency tonight.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.400
It's already been declared privately.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.200
And oh, I remember that one.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.960
I like private declarations.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.200
But also the looks on their faces.

30:43.920 --> 30:47.840
It's as if they're being led up before a firing squad.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.120
Or how about this clip?

30:51.760 --> 30:52.880
Mike Adams, incredible job.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.920
Naturalnews.com is on us tonight, seven o'clock central for coverage

30:55.920 --> 30:57.920
of Trump's epic declaration of emergency.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.360
As he says, we're in an emergency.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.760
I made to declare an emergency.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.920
Oh, he's going to declare it.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.040
Mike, thank you.

31:05.040 --> 31:05.600
We'll be right back.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.480
Stay with us.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.200
Or this one.

31:07.920 --> 31:08.960
Mike Adams, God bless you.

31:08.960 --> 31:09.200
Great job.

31:09.200 --> 31:09.920
You're joining us tonight.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.160
Seven o'clock central, 8 p.m.

31:12.160 --> 31:16.960
Eastern for the coverage of Trump declaring a national emergency.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.000
I don't know how all this is going to end, but if the globalists want to fight,

31:20.560 --> 31:23.520
they better believe they've got one.

31:25.440 --> 31:25.920
Yes.

31:25.920 --> 31:30.480
Here in January 2019, the migrant caravan fears were the biggest story in the right-wing media.

31:30.480 --> 31:35.120
And Alex had essentially gone all in and Trump declaring a national emergency to the point

31:35.120 --> 31:40.000
where you did a special evening stream to celebrate the declaration that didn't end up happening.

31:40.000 --> 31:40.400
Yep.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.080
That's fucking embarrassing.

31:42.080 --> 31:42.720
It's not good.

31:42.720 --> 31:46.800
And Alex was understandably a little bit raw about it after the fact.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.080
Now, I was going to come back in this segment and I was going to get to this later, but

31:50.080 --> 31:52.800
everybody knows my habit of mentioning something coming up and getting right into it.

31:52.800 --> 31:58.640
But when we come back, constitutional lawyer, really smart cookie, founder of Oath Keepers.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.160
Oath Cookie is going to be joining us.

32:03.680 --> 32:04.800
But here's the bottom line.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.840
And he's a constitutional lawyer.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.080
Yale for his writings, of course, worked for Ron Paul.

32:10.080 --> 32:10.880
Smart guy.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.320
He concurs with me with what I've said.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.600
Trump essentially is no longer the president.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.400
He has advocated his responsibility.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.680
He's he's signing it away.

32:19.680 --> 32:23.120
He's let a group of people around him tell him that he can't fire the head of the Federal

32:23.120 --> 32:24.960
Reserve, which he can do in the code.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.320
So this is one of the things that makes a clip like this.

32:28.320 --> 32:32.560
Really, it's incredibly difficult to understand without a nuanced understanding of Alex's

32:32.560 --> 32:35.760
propaganda and the context that the things are set in.

32:35.760 --> 32:39.840
Alex saying that he's sick of Trump is attention grabbing, but it's completely in line with

32:39.840 --> 32:42.640
what he was saying on air around this time.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.240
And we were talking about back then.

32:44.240 --> 32:44.640
Yeah.

32:44.640 --> 32:49.360
Alex was sick of his identity being associated solely with Trump, which he expresses more

32:49.360 --> 32:53.200
coherently in the take that they actually use in the documentary.

32:53.200 --> 32:56.240
Alex has said way worse things about Trump on his show.

32:56.240 --> 33:01.600
Like before deciding to support him for president back in 2015, Alex would regularly talk about

33:01.600 --> 33:03.440
how Trump was a front man for the mob.

33:04.160 --> 33:10.480
You go and you show at the university four or five palace size houses, 40 million, 13

33:10.480 --> 33:11.280
million, you name it.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.080
You say, is this Donald Trump's?

33:14.080 --> 33:15.360
Everybody thinks he's the richest guy.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.800
The guy's literally nothing.

33:16.800 --> 33:22.080
Kind of just a front man for some consortiums on the East coast.

33:22.080 --> 33:22.800
I'll leave it at that.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.280
Oh yeah.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.400
Trump's piece of work, folks.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.560
And they go in there.

33:34.080 --> 33:34.960
It's just mind blowing.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.080
I don't even know what to say anymore.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.600
And like he did this a lot.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.080
Yep.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.320
Donald Trump owns a bunch of casinos.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.840
Donald Trump's involved in a bunch of stuff.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.200
He's basically a front man for some very hardcore people.

33:45.200 --> 33:49.120
And he gives tons of money to the democratic party, more to Democrats than Republicans

33:49.120 --> 33:50.080
in the last 30 years.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.720
So you can bet this is all as phony as a $3 bill.

33:53.360 --> 34:01.520
And Donald Trump, I have it from high level sources, uh, is, uh, well, let's just say

34:01.520 --> 34:04.160
with a name like Trump, they don't come after you with a name like Carleone.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.840
Don Trump will be back.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.400
Stay with us.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.200
I'm Alex Jones.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.160
You want the truth?

34:10.160 --> 34:10.960
Can you handle it?

34:10.960 --> 34:11.840
You're going to get it.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.560
Ha ha.

34:12.560 --> 34:12.960
Yeah.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.720
So this is the reality of a clip like the one released by hate watch.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.400
It's Schrodinger's clip.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.440
It's simultaneously in and out of context.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.080
Yeah.

34:22.080 --> 34:25.920
I do believe that it captures a sincere moment of frustration where Alex is pissed off about

34:25.920 --> 34:28.560
how pigeonholed he's become as a Trump cheerleader.

34:28.560 --> 34:32.960
But I don't think that the moment means anything outside of exciting people who already don't

34:32.960 --> 34:34.320
like Trump or Alex.

34:34.320 --> 34:34.880
Yeah.

34:34.880 --> 34:39.280
For me, this falls into about the same heading as that Bon Iver parody song that was made

34:39.280 --> 34:40.320
about Alex.

34:40.320 --> 34:44.080
It feels like an attack, but in reality it just plays directly into his hands.

34:44.080 --> 34:44.640
Yep.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.920
Consider this.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.760
I hate Alex Jones.

34:47.760 --> 34:52.480
I've done a podcast about how full of shit he is for over four years.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.320
And when I heard him respond to this clip by saying that it's out of context, I don't

34:56.320 --> 34:57.760
think he's totally wrong.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.600
The hate watch article doesn't discuss the other version of this clip that appears in

35:01.600 --> 35:05.600
the documentary, nor does it address what was going on in the world around the time

35:05.600 --> 35:09.360
that the documentary was filmed that could have contributed to what their readers were

35:09.360 --> 35:10.160
seeing.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.920
From my perspective, these are important aspects to understanding that clip.

35:13.920 --> 35:18.000
Because without knowing what was going on, it's really easy to see that clip and make

35:18.000 --> 35:22.160
up your own story in your mind about what Alex, you know, when he says, I'm so fucking

35:22.160 --> 35:24.880
sick of Trump, like he wished he'd never met him.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.840
You can come up with your own explanation of what that means.

35:27.840 --> 35:33.360
And it's not, it's pretty clear if you know what was going on, what he means by that.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.480
No, I, I tweeted out immediately cause I got all those.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.520
I got all those too.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.560
I tweeted out immediately.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.080
I was like, this is just an ad for Alex and the filmmaker.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.280
That's what it is.

35:43.280 --> 35:49.600
And it's not, it's just because, God damn it, Dan, how many times are we going to do

35:49.600 --> 35:50.400
this?

35:50.400 --> 35:51.040
I understand.

35:51.040 --> 35:55.920
And that's why, that's why this episode is going to be a little bit, you know, different

35:55.920 --> 36:03.040
is because the frustration of like, everybody wants us to cover these things that go viral.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.160
And we did three years ago.

36:06.160 --> 36:10.320
Now what's interesting though, too, is that like, this is a little bit different than

36:10.320 --> 36:16.800
those other instances, because this is a case where I do believe that it's in context in

36:16.800 --> 36:21.040
as much as it is a video that it doesn't have like a bunch of quick cuts.

36:21.040 --> 36:24.240
It is Alex saying I'm fucking sick and tired of Trump.

36:24.240 --> 36:30.320
You know, it is that it is also devoid of the surrounding context that could be accessed.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.360
I mean, just by listening to his show.

36:33.360 --> 36:33.840
Yeah.

36:33.840 --> 36:38.080
Well, I mean, there's a certain part of me that's not, it's defensible.

36:38.080 --> 36:38.400
Yeah.

36:38.400 --> 36:44.160
Just because, look, you shouldn't, I mean, it's not, you shouldn't be paying attention

36:44.160 --> 36:49.200
to that world, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to say that it's, it's, it's hard to

36:49.200 --> 36:52.720
pay, you don't, it's hard to pay as much attention to it as we do.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.040
Yeah.

36:53.040 --> 36:57.120
And that's something that, you know, we constantly have to check ourselves on in terms of being

36:57.120 --> 37:02.960
like, how can you possibly not be aware of this completely sensible thing to not be aware

37:02.960 --> 37:03.120
of?

37:03.120 --> 37:08.000
And there's absolutely value in taking something that otherwise people wouldn't know.

37:08.000 --> 37:08.480
Right.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.920
And bringing it out to them.

37:09.920 --> 37:10.480
I get it.

37:10.480 --> 37:10.800
Sure.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.880
There are tons of people who don't pay attention to Alex and just know of him.

37:14.880 --> 37:18.480
I'm sure it's a very valuable thing for them to, to know.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.200
Also, he's full of shit on this, you know?

37:21.200 --> 37:25.120
And if they didn't know that and now they do, that's a net positive.

37:25.120 --> 37:25.440
Yeah.

37:25.440 --> 37:25.760
Yeah.

37:25.760 --> 37:29.200
So this is where we get to why we didn't have an episode on Friday.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.200
When I was exploring some of these ideas and listening to this clip and what have you,

37:33.200 --> 37:37.120
I realized that covering Alex's response to it would be unsatisfying.

37:37.120 --> 37:41.040
I didn't want to do an episode where we look at this and then just say that Alex said that

37:41.040 --> 37:43.120
the clip that was released was out of context.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.880
And the best I can say is kind of.

37:44.880 --> 37:45.360
Yeah.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.400
I felt like that feels way too close to defending Alex.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.440
Yeah, no, we don't need, we don't need that at all.

37:51.440 --> 37:55.520
I felt like the best thing I could do is try something I've never tried before.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.200
And that was make some inquiries.

37:57.200 --> 38:01.600
I sent emails, made a bunch of phone calls and tried everything I could think of other

38:01.600 --> 38:05.200
than starting a social media pressure campaign, because I'm opposed to those.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.840
But I was trying to get access to the raw footage of this clip that Hate Watch had released,

38:09.840 --> 38:13.680
trying to see where it came from, see what the surrounding discussion was around that.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.560
Of course.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.720
What happened after Alex walked off camera, as he does at the end of that clip?

38:18.720 --> 38:22.800
Did he immediately clarify himself or did he sit down and say stuff that made it clear

38:22.800 --> 38:26.800
that what he meant is that he fucking personally hates Donald Trump as a human and that he's

38:26.800 --> 38:27.760
connected to the mob?

38:28.400 --> 38:32.480
I felt unable to wrestle with this clip fully without the surrounding context, because to

38:32.480 --> 38:36.240
me, this was a headline being presented without a body of text.

38:36.240 --> 38:44.800
Yeah, Dan, we don't, in our world, headlines being their own story is not good.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.840
That's what Alex does.

38:45.840 --> 38:46.480
Exactly.

38:46.480 --> 38:51.200
No one at the SPLC or Hate Watch returned my calls or emails and my press request went

38:51.200 --> 38:51.840
unanswered.

38:51.840 --> 38:56.080
It's hard to believe that they wouldn't suddenly drop everything for a podcast.

38:56.080 --> 39:01.440
Look, dude, I understand people are busy and not everyone's aware of us, so I don't take

39:01.440 --> 39:02.720
it personally or anything.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.760
I completely understand and I'm not shitting on anybody.

39:06.320 --> 39:11.920
I just am saying this to say I tried to get access to this and I failed.

39:11.920 --> 39:12.400
I don't know.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.920
I take it a little personally.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.920
Well, you can, because that's your role.

39:15.920 --> 39:16.560
I do.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.160
I take it a little bit personally.

39:18.160 --> 39:23.760
I find it, I just find it a little bit frustrating that if you're reporting on Alex Jones, you

39:23.760 --> 39:27.280
can't find the only podcast about him.

39:27.280 --> 39:27.760
It's great.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.200
It seems easy to find.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.960
What's great is that I put in all the effort and then you get to be mad that it didn't

39:32.960 --> 39:33.360
work out.

39:35.280 --> 39:35.680
What?

39:35.680 --> 39:36.720
Okay, okay.

39:36.720 --> 39:40.000
Are you gonna play the victim for being a better person than me?

39:40.000 --> 39:40.880
No, I just think it's fine.

39:41.840 --> 39:46.640
So I did see, however, that the producer of the documentary that the clip is from, who

39:46.640 --> 39:50.240
gave the footage to Hate Watch, had replied to a tweet from one of our listeners that

39:50.240 --> 39:52.400
indicated that he would be willing to come on our show.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.760
So, typically, when things like this happen, I ignore them.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.640
I don't have a lot of interest in doing an interview with someone who comes from the

39:58.640 --> 40:03.040
worlds that we cover, since I have a default position of distrust and skepticism towards

40:03.040 --> 40:07.920
them, and I'm not particularly drawn toward making a show where me and a propagandist

40:07.920 --> 40:09.440
yell at each other incoherently.

40:09.440 --> 40:13.040
And I don't think I can interview him because I'm famous for saying, cut his dick off

40:13.040 --> 40:16.720
to Roger Stone, so that would make things a little bit adversarial.

40:16.720 --> 40:21.440
So I wasn't convinced that I should interview him, and you were strongly opposed, so I

40:21.440 --> 40:24.880
figured a middle ground would be to reach out to him and see if he was open to letting

40:24.880 --> 40:28.000
us review the larger context of the clip that was released.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.680
I made guarantees to everyone that I spoke to that I would respect the right of Hate

40:31.680 --> 40:35.280
Watch's reporting, and I wouldn't scoop them by releasing clips that they may or may

40:35.280 --> 40:37.040
not be working on for future stories.

40:37.600 --> 40:43.040
The documentarian, Kalen Robertson, said that he gave the footage to Hate Watch, but would

40:43.040 --> 40:46.160
come on the show to discuss what it was like to work with Alex.

40:46.160 --> 40:50.400
I responded by asking if there was an exclusivity situation with Hate Watch, at which point

40:50.400 --> 40:51.520
he stopped responding.

40:52.320 --> 40:56.160
It's entirely possible that he saw me as someone just out to get the footage to create

40:56.160 --> 41:00.240
clickbait and undermine whatever plans there may or may not be for releasing things.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.760
He doesn't know me at all, and I can't begrudge someone being careful about who they

41:03.760 --> 41:07.280
would trust online, so this didn't seem too strange to me.

41:07.280 --> 41:11.680
I think I moderated my tone, but honestly, I might have come off as a little thirsty

41:11.680 --> 41:12.480
for the footage.

41:12.480 --> 41:12.960
Maybe.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.640
It's really hard to tell how your tone works.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.120
I mean, you are a little thirsty for the footage, so...

41:17.120 --> 41:18.160
I was interested, sure.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.520
I mean, if it's there, I want to see it.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.040
Well, yeah, I understand.

41:21.040 --> 41:21.540
Yeah.

41:22.400 --> 41:26.720
As Wednesday became Thursday, I realized that we needed to record an episode, that a lot

41:26.720 --> 41:30.160
of the audience expected that we would be covering that clip that Hate Watch released,

41:30.160 --> 41:34.240
and that without the larger footage, I didn't have much to bring to the table past saying

41:34.240 --> 41:37.840
there's a larger context, Alex is still an asshole who lies about everything, but there's

41:37.840 --> 41:39.440
nuance here that might have been missed.

41:39.440 --> 41:39.940
Yeah.

41:40.400 --> 41:45.120
I didn't know what to do, but at that point, I still thought there was a chance that someone

41:45.120 --> 41:46.240
would get back to me.

41:46.240 --> 41:50.240
COVID is a total pain in the ass, so I could understand the bureaucracy at the SPLC and

41:50.240 --> 41:54.880
Hate Watch being slowed down a little bit, so maybe I'd hear back on Thursday or Friday,

41:54.880 --> 41:58.400
and thus, I decided to punt to Monday to make the best episode we could.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.200
That was the plan.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.520
But here we are on Sunday, and no one's responding.

42:01.520 --> 42:06.640
And there's not much to say other than that the SPLC is bad now, Dan.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.840
Since I didn't have the raw footage, I felt like I was at a dead end.

42:11.840 --> 42:15.120
That said, I'd already thought a lot about this clip, and I had some things I wanted

42:15.120 --> 42:17.040
to say about it, so we have to do this episode.

42:17.680 --> 42:21.520
I decided to rewatch You Can't Watch This and jot down some questions that I would-

42:21.520 --> 42:22.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:22.480 --> 42:22.980
How?

42:23.360 --> 42:24.080
I could watch it.

42:24.960 --> 42:25.460
Turns out.

42:27.120 --> 42:32.640
I wanted to jot down some questions that I would like to ask Kalyn Robertson to see where

42:32.640 --> 42:35.040
I would take a theoretical future interview.

42:35.040 --> 42:35.600
Sure.

42:35.600 --> 42:40.320
As I watched through that lens, a ton of questions came to mind, particularly about the state

42:40.320 --> 42:45.760
of mind one is in while creating clearly full of shit propaganda documentaries that feature

42:45.760 --> 42:49.920
only the opinions of extreme lunatics like Alex Jones, Tommy Robinson, Laura Loomer,

42:49.920 --> 42:50.880
and Gavin McGinnis.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.840
Right, as well as, I believe, Wile E. Coyote.

42:54.640 --> 42:59.440
I got into this idea, so early on Friday, I sent Kalyn another message explaining the

42:59.440 --> 43:03.440
reasoning for my wanting the raw footage to better understand the context.

43:03.440 --> 43:07.600
I also said that if that wasn't possible, I still might want to chat, and that if he

43:07.600 --> 43:11.760
was interested, I could email over some questions, he could decide whether or not he wanted to

43:11.760 --> 43:12.640
participate.

43:12.640 --> 43:16.880
I had absolutely no interest in blindsiding anybody, and I felt like he could see the

43:16.880 --> 43:21.360
questions, get the tone of what I was looking for, and decide whether or not he wanted to

43:21.360 --> 43:22.080
participate.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.240
I did not send him the questions, though, to be fair.

43:24.240 --> 43:24.880
I get you.

43:24.880 --> 43:27.040
I'm just saying that might sound a little bit thirsty.

43:27.040 --> 43:31.360
You know, if you're on a dating app and you don't get a response for a day and then you

43:31.360 --> 43:33.440
come back with, I might answer questions.

43:33.440 --> 43:34.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:34.080 --> 43:39.520
There is definitely a reason I didn't send another message after this one.

43:39.520 --> 43:43.600
I'm also not interested in harassing somebody, and I felt like another unanswered message

43:43.600 --> 43:47.680
in this chain would look a way that I have to...

43:47.680 --> 43:48.720
It might be your trouble.

43:48.720 --> 43:53.520
I have to look in the mirror, and I don't think I can handle being the guy who keeps

43:53.520 --> 43:54.400
sending messages.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.200
Yeah, that could be trouble.

43:55.200 --> 43:55.680
Yeah.

43:55.680 --> 44:00.160
It dawned on me that I knew very little about this guy, Kalyn Robertson.

44:00.160 --> 44:04.240
I pay attention to the right-wing media, but he's a behind-the-scenes guy, and his only

44:04.240 --> 44:08.880
direct association with Alex was in this film, You Can't Watch This, which didn't impress

44:08.880 --> 44:11.680
me much, and didn't cause a big splash when it came out.

44:12.720 --> 44:17.360
The Hatewatch piece says that Robertson has disavowed the far right, and told Hatewatch

44:17.360 --> 44:22.000
he's working to undo the damage he did while producing propaganda for extremists such as

44:22.000 --> 44:22.480
Jones.

44:23.360 --> 44:29.200
That's good, but words like, quote, producing propaganda for extremists like Jones are

44:29.200 --> 44:31.040
the kind of words that make me curious.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.240
What other sorts of extremists are we talking about here?

44:34.240 --> 44:41.680
Yeah, you know, I read that line, and my immediate thought was, tell me exactly how he is disavowing

44:41.680 --> 44:43.520
and improving from there.

44:43.520 --> 44:43.840
Right.

44:43.840 --> 44:50.800
Give me line by line, do not tell me that he told you he was disavowing the far right,

44:50.800 --> 44:52.640
and you took him at face value.

44:52.640 --> 44:57.280
I started poking around, and this dude's fingerprints are on so many of the side characters we've

44:57.280 --> 44:58.880
discussed on this show.

44:58.880 --> 45:03.840
He used to work at Rebel Media, he did extensive work with Tommy Robinson, he directed two

45:03.840 --> 45:08.480
flagrantly racist and intentionally manipulative documentaries with Lawrence Southern, and

45:08.480 --> 45:14.320
perhaps most interestingly, he was the uncredited, but at very least cameraman and probably editor

45:14.320 --> 45:19.280
or director of Stefan Molyneux's film, The Hundred Year March, a Philosopher in Poland.

45:19.280 --> 45:24.400
Famous for his declaration of, I am a white nationalist.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.200
Empirically.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.160
Empirically, I am a white nationalist.

45:28.160 --> 45:33.440
We covered that entire documentary, and you can find it, it's episode 285 of our podcast.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.920
But not only does Robertson boast this impressive list of right-wing shithead credentials, he

45:39.920 --> 45:44.320
also went along on that trip that Lawrence Southern and Stefan Molyneux took to New Zealand

45:44.320 --> 45:51.600
in 2018, and even spoke prior to their talks after screaming his very racist film Farmlands,

45:51.600 --> 45:55.680
which argues that black South Africans are trying to kill all the white farmers there.

45:55.680 --> 45:58.480
Here's a little clip of him giving a speech.

45:58.480 --> 46:04.000
Hello, my name is Caelan Robertson and I co-produced Farmlands with my colleague George

46:04.000 --> 46:06.080
Ewell and John, and of course Lawrence Southern.

46:07.040 --> 46:11.360
Obviously this was an incredibly challenging process to put together, it was highly emotional

46:11.360 --> 46:17.280
as a subject, and obviously very very intensely serious as a subject, which meant that it

46:17.280 --> 46:22.400
had to be told in the right way, and the stories of these people are so powerful that it had

46:22.400 --> 46:23.440
to be told properly.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.120
It had to be told properly.

46:25.120 --> 46:29.440
Now, we'll get back to that in a second, but in case you're interested, here's what Stefan

46:29.440 --> 46:30.800
was talking about that evening.

46:30.800 --> 46:55.520
Let's hear it.

46:55.520 --> 47:01.040
Pull up, I really agree with it, but you know, I'm open, data, you know, let's find out.

47:01.040 --> 47:07.360
So we started researching into average culture.

47:08.320 --> 47:11.600
Sir, this plane is going down, this plane is going down, sir.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.480
It's, well, you'll see.

47:16.080 --> 47:21.600
But it's important, it's important because I want to sort of make a philosophical argument,

47:21.600 --> 47:26.080
of course, about two cultures.

47:26.080 --> 47:30.480
Obviously there's the European Western culture, the white culture, and then there's the

47:30.480 --> 47:41.360
Aborigine culture, and there was a collision, one-one, and then you get a powerful culture

47:41.360 --> 47:46.400
and civilization and glowing cities of light and rising out of the very desert itself,

47:48.240 --> 47:49.120
and another lost.

47:49.120 --> 47:56.640
And then, like, in general, cultures that lose, they either vanish or they turn into

47:56.640 --> 48:02.640
guilt-tripping manipulators to extract the giant red vending machine called white guilt.

48:02.640 --> 48:04.400
Wow, cool stuff, cool stuff.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.640
Boy, I want him to get collisioned.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.680
Quick reminder that this is in New Zealand, and also that the Christchurch shooter donated

48:11.680 --> 48:15.840
money to Stefan Molyneux and was a big fan of Lauren Southern, and named his manifesto

48:15.840 --> 48:19.840
The Great Replacement, which is the conspiracy about white genocide that Lauren Southern's

48:19.840 --> 48:22.880
movies are based on, which were directed by Kaelan Robertson.

48:22.880 --> 48:27.040
So, real quick, back to that clip I played of Kaelan's speech.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.440
Well, it's a good thing he told people that he disavowed that.

48:29.440 --> 48:35.360
He said in that speech in New Zealand that he was covering this very sensitive topic

48:35.360 --> 48:39.600
about the South African farmers, so it was crucial to tell their stories properly.

48:39.600 --> 48:45.200
Well, about that, in a very interesting review of Lauren Southern's article, she said that

48:45.200 --> 48:49.920
Lauren Southern's other film, Borderless, the YouTube commentator Jose brought up a

48:49.920 --> 48:54.160
very interesting problem about how farmland told the stories of these farmers.

48:54.160 --> 48:58.160
Here's a little clip from Jose's video titled The Many Lies of Borderless.

48:59.200 --> 49:03.360
Towards the end of the video, I highlighted one of Lauren's major works, and that's

49:03.360 --> 49:08.800
the movie Farmlands, a movie that advanced the racist conspiracy theory that black South

49:08.800 --> 49:14.880
Africans were out to kill white farmers, fueled by some sort of racial animosity that's

49:14.880 --> 49:18.000
ginned up by South African politicians.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.280
In that movie, a woman named Janine Eichenfeldt had the gruesome details of her father's

49:23.280 --> 49:26.480
murder used to advance said racist conspiracy theory.

49:26.480 --> 49:30.080
I mentioned that I didn't believe Janine was a willing participant in this, evidenced

49:30.080 --> 49:32.240
by the selective editing of her interview.

49:32.240 --> 49:37.920
In an interview of May 2019, Eichenfeldt told Ariel Levy, writing for The New Yorker, that

49:37.920 --> 49:40.560
she had been interviewed under a false premise.

49:40.560 --> 49:41.280
Here's a quote.

49:41.280 --> 49:46.640
I felt exploited. Another farmer phoned me to say he's got this Canadian chickie doing

49:46.640 --> 49:48.560
a documentary about the drought.

49:48.560 --> 49:49.520
Can you bring her to me?

49:50.400 --> 49:55.120
Hence, I was in my farm boots and my shorts to go and show them the effect of the drought

49:55.120 --> 49:57.840
on the farm, and Lauren sat down and said,

49:58.480 --> 49:59.440
Tell me about your dad.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.680
Completely caught me off guard.

50:02.240 --> 50:06.560
This is a shocking revelation because it's not something that can possibly happen by

50:06.560 --> 50:07.440
accident.

50:07.440 --> 50:11.760
It's the result of a conscious decision to mislead interview subjects and exploit what

50:11.760 --> 50:15.920
they tell you by taking it out of context to further the conclusion you want your propaganda

50:15.920 --> 50:17.120
to arrive at.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.120
The behavior precludes good faith.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.320
There's just no way around that.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.600
No, it's not possible.

50:21.600 --> 50:25.920
As it turns out, this is not the only way in which Farmlands, the documentary directed

50:25.920 --> 50:29.760
by Caitlin Robertson, failed to tell the woman's story properly.

50:29.760 --> 50:34.320
In reality, her father was killed, and that is a tragedy, but the film fails to explain

50:34.320 --> 50:38.080
the details of the crime because they want to use it as a prop to make the argument that

50:38.080 --> 50:41.760
white farmers are being targeted for genocide by black South Africans.

50:41.760 --> 50:44.800
Her father was killed by a guy who had been working on his farm.

50:44.800 --> 50:48.880
Five days prior, this man had stabbed his girlfriend, who was a person of color, to

50:48.880 --> 50:52.000
death and was chased by police but not apprehended.

50:52.000 --> 50:56.160
He went to this woman's father's farm, killed him and robbed his house and was subsequently

50:56.160 --> 50:58.800
arrested and is now serving a 30-year sentence in jail.

50:59.360 --> 51:04.000
This is a case of a double murder, and it's sad and an awful crime, but it's not an act

51:04.000 --> 51:08.160
of racial hate towards white farmers, which is what Caitlin's film portrays it as.

51:08.800 --> 51:12.880
This isn't telling the story properly, it's creating a fake version of a South African

51:12.880 --> 51:18.400
woman's pain to exploit to further a racist narrative, and then it's further gaslighting

51:18.400 --> 51:22.560
an audience in New Zealand while doing audience warm-up for a guy who decided to be a white

51:22.560 --> 51:24.800
supremacist because less of them booed his dumb ass.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.640
No, no, no, no, Dan, it's great.

51:26.640 --> 51:31.920
Look, I get it, but he told the SPLC that he disavowed that, and he gave them some footage

51:31.920 --> 51:34.080
of Alex that everybody's already seen before.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.720
So he's repented.

51:36.720 --> 51:39.760
I'm struggling, I'm really struggling.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.760
Over the course of the weekend, I watched and read everything that was available to

51:43.760 --> 51:49.840
be found and created about or created by Caitlin Robertson, because this picture was just giving

51:49.840 --> 51:50.400
me trouble.

51:50.400 --> 51:56.080
I was confused, it was accidental going down this road, but I was interested and I was

51:56.080 --> 51:56.960
confused.

51:56.960 --> 52:02.000
Wow, you know what, and look, this is by no means retaliation.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.880
I know because we've talked about this every step of the way, but you should have given

52:06.880 --> 52:08.080
us that fucking footage, dude.

52:08.080 --> 52:11.120
No, no, I understand, I understand.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.760
I think it's funny you saying that, but...

52:15.760 --> 52:18.480
No, we've talked about this extensively.

52:18.480 --> 52:22.080
Believe me, that is not your motivation whatsoever.

52:22.080 --> 52:25.440
The more I watched of his work, the more I didn't like him at all.

52:25.440 --> 52:29.360
But the more I watched his interviews, the more I kinda liked him.

52:29.360 --> 52:33.280
He's an immensely charming person, and that charisma probably played no small part in

52:33.280 --> 52:37.200
his ability to rise to such a position of prominence among these right-wing grifters,

52:37.200 --> 52:39.280
for whom appearance is so critical.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.440
As well as getting them to say stuff.

52:41.440 --> 52:42.320
Perhaps.

52:42.320 --> 52:47.520
I mean, Louis Theroux is an incredibly charming person, and that's part of why his documentaries

52:47.520 --> 52:51.360
end up with people saying stuff that maybe they wouldn't in other contexts.

52:51.360 --> 52:56.880
Exactly. I don't know, I feel like he seems fun, interesting, and...

52:56.880 --> 53:00.480
He's the type of guy that the New Yorker would have written a glowing profile about.

53:00.480 --> 53:00.960
Totally.

53:00.960 --> 53:03.440
New Nazis, they dress different.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.280
Yeah, I would say so.

53:05.280 --> 53:05.920
Yeah.

53:05.920 --> 53:09.840
And I mean, I'm not even immune to it, like watching these interviews.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.200
Sure, no, you listen to it.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.800
A charming guy is a charming guy.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.080
There's not much you can do with that.

53:14.080 --> 53:16.000
And that's part of what made it so intriguing.

53:16.000 --> 53:16.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:16.720 --> 53:17.760
It's like, what's going on here?

53:17.760 --> 53:18.720
This is fucked up.

53:18.720 --> 53:24.480
So, here we are in the present day, and Robertson has disavowed the errors of his ways from

53:24.480 --> 53:28.880
a few years ago, and he's trying to undo the damage he's done, and I do commend that.

53:28.880 --> 53:29.280
I do.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.440
I want to be very clear about that.

53:31.440 --> 53:35.280
I was curious about the stories of his path to redemption, so I decided to dig a little

53:35.280 --> 53:39.280
bit deeper and watch some of the more recent interviews that were available out there to

53:39.280 --> 53:40.480
try and get a sense of this.

53:40.480 --> 53:40.880
Yeah.

53:40.880 --> 53:45.520
You know, like, one of the things that I love the most about our podcast that unfortunately

53:45.520 --> 53:50.240
may be tainted now is that episode about Jessica Schaub, the crystal child, who...

53:50.240 --> 53:51.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:51.760 --> 53:56.960
Someone informed me that she might not be as much of a wonderful success story as...

53:56.960 --> 53:57.680
God damn it.

53:57.680 --> 53:59.760
But I'm always looking for something like that.

53:59.760 --> 53:59.760
Of course.

53:59.760 --> 54:04.640
I'm always looking for something uplifting, because it's so much better than Alex's dumbass.

54:04.640 --> 54:05.280
Totally.

54:05.280 --> 54:11.280
No, and I think that's a great example, because I've thought about that one a lot.

54:11.280 --> 54:19.680
You know, my exuberance towards her escape was undeniable, but the more I've thought

54:19.680 --> 54:25.760
about that, the more I've just been like, you cannot take people at their word when

54:25.760 --> 54:29.280
they just say that they are disavowing stuff.

54:29.280 --> 54:35.280
And the reason that we do, the reason that we always do is because we want to believe

54:35.280 --> 54:36.480
that so hard.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.040
Yeah.

54:37.040 --> 54:43.520
I want to believe this guy, like the reason that I'm so against believing that this guy

54:43.520 --> 54:46.080
is disavowed is because I know I want to.

54:46.080 --> 54:46.400
Yeah.

54:46.400 --> 54:50.240
Because I know that provides hope for me for my fucking family.

54:50.240 --> 54:52.800
That provides hope for me for so many other people.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.480
Look, you can come back.

54:54.480 --> 54:54.800
Yeah.

54:54.800 --> 54:57.200
And so I am not going to trust anybody.

54:57.200 --> 54:57.680
Yeah.

54:57.680 --> 55:03.440
And that also is what makes, like, I'm struggling with the idea that it feels like we might

55:03.440 --> 55:08.000
be attacking him or something because I don't want to attack the idea that it's possible.

55:08.000 --> 55:08.240
Sure.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.160
For your family or for people around you.

55:10.160 --> 55:10.400
Sure.

55:12.080 --> 55:16.720
I'm just curious and I want to deal with reality on reality's terms.

55:16.720 --> 55:17.040
Right.

55:17.040 --> 55:22.720
And I, you know, the way that I talk, of course, everything I say is, uh, sounds like an attack,

55:22.720 --> 55:31.920
but what I'm trying to express in my dumb way is that he has earned where he is.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.760
He's earned where he got to.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.400
And if you want to go somewhere else, you have to earn it.

55:36.400 --> 55:41.200
And those, maybe they don't have to be equal, but I'll tell you that given a few clips to

55:41.200 --> 55:46.240
the SPLC is not earning your way out of being the shit bag that you were.

55:46.240 --> 55:46.480
Right.

55:47.520 --> 55:48.800
A couple of important points.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.400
One, that's not for us to determine.

55:51.200 --> 55:55.760
And you can have your feeling and you're entitled to your feeling, but we are not the judges

55:55.760 --> 55:56.560
of this person.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.360
Absolutely not.

55:57.360 --> 56:03.680
Second, we cannot possibly know what he has done privately.

56:03.680 --> 56:04.400
Of course not.

56:04.400 --> 56:11.200
Like he doesn't owe anybody, uh, like us an apology and maybe he has made amends with

56:11.200 --> 56:12.960
folks behind the scenes privately.

56:12.960 --> 56:17.600
And I think that may be even more appropriate than anybody knowing exactly what he should

56:17.600 --> 56:18.080
be doing.

56:18.080 --> 56:18.960
Yeah, absolutely.

56:18.960 --> 56:24.560
And we can't judge whether or not that's the case and I'm not sitting here saying he hasn't.

56:24.560 --> 56:30.640
I'm saying I'm struggling with this because I believe wholeheartedly in redemption.

56:30.640 --> 56:36.400
I believe wholeheartedly that people can make it out and oftentimes their stories on the

56:36.400 --> 56:41.920
other end can be very, um, uplifting and helpful for people.

56:41.920 --> 56:42.560
Yeah.

56:42.560 --> 56:48.160
I also don't think it's appropriate to pretend that this history isn't what it is.

56:48.160 --> 56:48.720
Exactly.

56:48.720 --> 56:56.240
Like the redemption needs to take stock of the professional career that beget the redemption.

56:56.240 --> 56:57.280
100 percent.

56:57.280 --> 57:01.680
And I was not convinced of that until I was watching this.

57:01.680 --> 57:08.240
And as I was looking at these, this story of, you know, the upliftingness, I was like,

57:08.240 --> 57:09.440
this doesn't make sense.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.920
There's something that doesn't match up.

57:11.920 --> 57:15.520
So the first thing that stuck out to me was an interview that Robertson did with a Muslim

57:15.520 --> 57:17.600
activist in the UK named Ali Dawah.

57:17.600 --> 57:24.400
Ali and Tommy's crew had a really high-profile run-in in the past, back in May of 2018, surrounding

57:24.400 --> 57:27.120
a rally that Tommy was throwing called Freedom Day.

57:27.120 --> 57:32.160
The event was supposed to be a free speech rally, so Ali requested to speak at the rally,

57:32.160 --> 57:35.360
since why wouldn't a free speech rally want to have everybody have speech?

57:35.360 --> 57:36.000
Oh, of course.

57:36.560 --> 57:40.960
Initially, Ali was told he could speak, but ultimately he wasn't allowed to, and he was

57:40.960 --> 57:44.640
harassed, threatened, and attacked by Tommy's fans at the event.

57:44.640 --> 57:50.080
This interaction between Ali and Kaylin in September 2019 is actually really fascinating

57:50.080 --> 57:51.280
for a number of reasons.

57:51.840 --> 57:55.680
The first is just the simple fact that these two people who were on opposite sides of things

57:55.680 --> 57:59.200
a little over a year prior were now able to have a polite conversation.

57:59.760 --> 58:04.000
The other reason is that halfway through, their interview gets interrupted by an old

58:04.000 --> 58:08.800
British Islamophobe who spouts a bunch of anti-Muslim talking points at Ali for no other

58:08.800 --> 58:11.200
reason than because he looks like a Muslim.

58:11.200 --> 58:16.320
The interview gets sidetracked and derailed by the consequences of Kaylin's prior actions.

58:16.320 --> 58:20.320
It's almost as if this interview is metaphorically expressing that the damage that Kaylin did

58:20.320 --> 58:25.200
in his past lives on no matter what he does, and beyond that, it even gets in the way of

58:25.200 --> 58:29.920
and will be a constant problem even when he's trying to do good, as he presumably is by

58:29.920 --> 58:31.360
having this chat with Ali.

58:31.360 --> 58:31.920
Sure.

58:31.920 --> 58:37.680
It's remarkable how this turn of events captures a reality and a meta-reality, and both involve

58:37.680 --> 58:42.400
the person embodied by Ali patiently trying to deal with the aftermath of what this white

58:42.400 --> 58:44.480
nationalist propaganda has done to people.

58:45.200 --> 58:48.720
The reason I find this interview the most interesting, however, is because of one detail

58:48.720 --> 59:08.400
that Kaylin gives while discussing that Freedom Day march that was all about free speech.

59:18.720 --> 59:23.520
The head of the DFLA, or DFLA, or this far right group that pretended they were about

59:23.520 --> 59:30.800
football, texted Tommy and said, if you let him on stage, we'll storm the stage, you know,

59:30.800 --> 59:39.200
you'll be attacked or whatever, and Tommy was like, and I was saying, this is fucking

59:39.200 --> 59:42.480
about freedom of speech, this is the purpose of the event, it's about freedom of expression

59:42.480 --> 59:48.160
and freedom of speech, that's literally what it's about, nothing else, and he was like,

59:48.160 --> 59:50.960
I can't do it, I can't do it, it's going to fucking piss everyone off, I can't do it,

59:50.960 --> 59:55.040
and then Lucy came on, super, super, super heated, she said, everyone knows about this,

59:55.040 --> 59:58.000
everyone already knows he's invited, he said he doesn't care if you can spin it off, and

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.840
she said, just admit it, it's because he's fucking Muslim, isn't it, and he said, yeah,

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:07.200
it is, that's it, and that's when we realised, like at that moment, that he didn't give a

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:13.120
fuck about freedom of speech, no, but we were quite convinced, like I, fuck you, like we

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.040
were genuinely like, this is, we are like a cool counterculture thing, there's a lot

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.040
of far right idiots that we don't want, but we genuinely believed in that.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:21.520
Fuck you.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.200
Fuck you.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.120
That was the moment, that was the moment.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:25.600
Sure.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.960
I have no idea what was said when Kalen's mic cut out there, but the gist of that story

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.560
is that when Tommy was okay with the idea of Ali being disinvited to speak at this free

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.800
speech event because he was Muslim, it made Kalen wake up and realise that Tommy didn't

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.320
care about free speech at all.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.640
The conversation goes on to be about how Tommy uses free speech rhetoric as a mask to hide

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.160
his real agenda, which is racism generally and anti-Islam agitation specifically.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:57.600
There's no way for him to have known before that point that the far right did that, Dan.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.560
It's not possible.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:04.160
But the claim that he's making, I actually kind of believe, and the reason I do, is that

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.640
in July 2020, Kalen released a video through the Byline Times which captures Tommy Robinson

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.240
essentially saying exactly this back in 2018.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.560
We should do a free speech march.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.040
Nope.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.440
No.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.320
A free speech march.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.240
That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:20.880
What are we going to do?

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.760
Just shout.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.640
No, the difference is you...

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.920
Just walking around London.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.720
Do you know why, do you know why, do you know why you think he could be so, why you think

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.760
he's so easy to get numbers, would be so easy to get numbers?

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.000
Because you're not asking people to come out and protest against Islam.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
You're not asking people to protest against anything.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.120
You're asking people to come and show their face in support of free speech.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.400
Everyone can do that.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.880
Doesn't matter about your job, doesn't matter about your career, you're not going to lose

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.440
your job, no one's going to look down upon you, your friends aren't going to hate you.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.040
I'm hard at free speech, and they still will.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.320
It's interesting, because that clip is from 2018, and it seems to be Tommy discussing

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.120
the idea of doing a free speech rally, which would be really just to trick large numbers

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.080
of people to come out who wouldn't show up if you were honest about your anti-Muslim

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:58.640
intentions.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.200
Yeah, there you go.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.080
That Freedom Day event in May was Tommy's biggest allegedly free speech event that year,

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.560
and he did spend some of 2018 in jail.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.240
So it seems to me it's pretty likely that this clip of Tommy explaining that free speech

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.240
is a mask that might have come from before the Freedom Day event.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.480
I would probably say...

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.600
I have a hunch.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.280
Could be that.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.960
Either way, I find it super hard to believe that anyone working with these people wouldn't

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.320
understand that dynamic, and I think it's super embarrassing that Tommy got caught on

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.240
tape explaining the most obvious game he and his friends play.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.680
Very sad.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.320
Yeah.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.880
The point here, whether or not this tape was from before or after the Freedom Day event,

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.080
that day in 2018 is supposed to be the day that Kalen realized that Tommy Robinson used

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.560
the facade of free speech as a way to cover his racism and trick people into getting involved

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:46.880
with it.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.200
That was his Saul of Tarsus moment.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.240
That rally took place on May 6th, 2018, so it's safe to assume that anything that took

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.400
place after that point was done with the full awareness that the whole free speech argument

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.480
from the right-wing media figures is nonsense.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.640
Well, then I assume he quit at that point, right?

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.080
That date is a problem.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.040
Is that date a problem?

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.240
Why is that date a problem, Dan?

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.280
Well, for one, in his documentary You Can't Watch This, which you can watch, Kalen interviews

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.200
Alex Jones about how he was kicked off all those social media entities, which happened

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.440
in early August 2018, after the Freedom Day rally.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.520
This interview is being recorded in January 2019, even later than that.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.320
Plenty of time to reflect on how maybe Tommy Robinson isn't the only person who uses free

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.840
speech complaints to mask their bigotry.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.560
No, no, he's an aberration.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.440
To make matters worse, Tommy Robinson himself is one of the subjects of this documentary,

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.040
and the entire point of it, if you couldn't tell from the title, is that these people

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.880
who have just alternative points of view are having their free speech violated and they're

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.880
wrongly being called racists.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.520
The entire concept of this documentary is something that, based on Kalen's own timeline,

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.680
he should have completely understood was just a way of masking racism through appealing

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.360
to free speech bullshit.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.400
In January 2019, at the same time he was making this documentary, Kalen was interviewed by

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.760
Sky News.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.920
In this interview, he tells a story about a short film he made about Muslim extremists

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.800
while in college.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.960
This film that he made didn't end up making the clients his screening.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.560
And if you listen carefully to this interview, you might notice Kalen using free speech arguments

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.160
to justify people's racism.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.200
Oh, you think so?

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.080
Well, I made a, like, I think it was like a nine minute film, just about, it wasn't

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.120
an interim charity, but there was like a bunch of Muslim extremists who were walking up and

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.480
down Whitechapel and I was just interviewing a few of them, not that they would really

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.720
want to talk very much, but like going up to the cameras.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.600
And then I showed it to one of my lecturers and they were like, oh, this is, this is interesting,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.440
but we're not going to put it in the screening of the official, like of the official screening

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.880
of all the short films at the end of the year.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.920
And I was like, oh, that's really strange.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.200
I didn't really think much of it.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:51.040
But then when I started Googling about universities not like deplatforming things or maybe not

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.560
showing all different ideas.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.480
I mean, what was, what was the rationale giving to you?

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:54.960
Right.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.200
Okay, this is interesting work, but do you know what?

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.400
We're not going to have it in the end of the year.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.760
They said, I remember them using the word inflammatory, that it could be perceived as

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.800
inflammatory.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.760
I think they, it wasn't from like a super insidious way.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.160
I think they were just trying to be polite to a lot of the other students and they didn't

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.680
want to upset a lot of different people and bring that kind of argument into the classroom.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.480
Oh, you mean hate speech?

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.120
So I wasn't really that bothered about it at the time until I started researching that

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.800
other universities were doing things like that.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.040
But yeah, that was, that was sort of the first time I recognized that that was going on.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.920
I mean, is it fair for me to then join the dots between that incident, that film, and

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.920
then your later work with, with Tommy Robinson formerly of the EDL?

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:33.120
Yeah, well, this is why I say that the left created Tommy, like the left created this

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:33.920
situation as well.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.840
Like if you would only show something, maybe we have some difficult conversations and actually

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.920
not silence freedom of speech or not silence content, then people might not start questioning

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.320
this too much.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.920
People might not start dedicating their lives to it or getting involved in activism to try

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.400
and fight it.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.200
Like that wouldn't, that wouldn't be the case because there wouldn't be, there wouldn't

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:49.920
be a silence around it.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.600
There wouldn't be these issues.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.520
Sounds like he disavowed it to me.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.840
This is an appeal to the idea that the left being censorious and limiting free speech

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.880
of people like Tommy Robinson, read racists, is what causes people to become racist.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.880
These people aren't actually even racist.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.080
They're just made to look that way because normal society won't let them have the difficult

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.000
conversations that they want to have.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.080
You know, those difficult conversations like the ones his buddy Stefan Molyneux wants to

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.520
have about phrenology.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:20.480
Nothing I love more than oppressing people for hundreds of years and then blaming them

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.920
for making me feel bad.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.120
That was in 2019.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.120
It was in January 2019.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.800
And then in May 2019, Kalen appeared as a guest on RT to promote his documentary that

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.920
you can't watch this.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.320
Sure.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.400
And he discussed what the film covers.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:39.120
Once again, after he should have realized this was no good.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:39.520
Sure.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.240
He relies on whitewashing his subjects behaviors by appealing to free speech.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:49.680
The project looks into how social media is being used as a tool to exclude certain voices.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:54.400
It focuses on the online war with prominent conservatives and the implications this removal

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.800
of content has for the freedom of speech.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:02.160
The director says he hoped the film would uncover how serious and widespread it's become

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.480
and the danger it poses to our culture.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.680
Now, the film follows five controversial figures who have been victims of social media purges.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:14.880
One is British activist, Tommy Robinson, who founded the far-right English Defense League.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.120
Facebook accused Robinson of promoting hate against the Muslim community.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.440
Also featured is Alex Jones, director of the InfoWars website.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.920
Permanently banned from Twitter, Jones is said to have promoted discriminatory behavior

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.000
and spread disinformation.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.600
No, he did do that.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.480
Now, to discuss the documentary and the issue it touches upon, we're joined now by Kalen

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:42.160
Robertson, an executive producer of the documentary, You Can't Watch This, and Masoud Sajoure,

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.720
chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.640
You're both very welcome to the program.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.400
Now, Kalen, if we could start with you.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.040
Social media platforms are public forums.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:56.080
Do you not think it's a fair argument to respect the diversity of users and not to actively

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.280
provoke or offend them?

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:58.960
Well, yeah.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.960
Well, what this documentary explores is the increasing powers that social media have in

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:08.080
changing the Overton window, in influencing what people can and can't watch online as

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.560
consumers, in changing elections.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.920
And this is why it's so important.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.400
And a lot of people argue, oh, well, you know, they're private companies.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.200
They can do what they want.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.720
Well, they're actually acting like publishers, and they actually have a duty to actually

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:25.360
hold free speech as one of their core values, especially given how important social media

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.720
is in our society.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.520
Looks like someone's using free speech arguments in order to elevate the complaints of Laura

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.360
Loomer, Gavin McGinnis, Alex Jones, and Tommy Robinson.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.280
Those people all have something else in common besides censorship.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.960
But this is like a year after the Freedom Day rally when he ostensibly-

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.080
Yeah, but you can hear-

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:44.720
No, no, no.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.400
You can hear in his voice that he recognizes that what he's doing is wrong.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.040
Oh, man.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.640
It's killing him on the inside.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.000
This is a man crying out for help, Dan.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.640
Please, someone stop me from doing this.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.040
It seems like even though he'd known for at least a year that this was specifically a

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.680
tactic that one of his subjects, Tommy Robinson, used to subtly promote racist ideas to an

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.400
unsuspecting population, Kaelin was still willing to employ the same tactic to subtly

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.560
promote his film full of bigots to an unsuspecting population, which is strange.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.360
So I was sitting with this, and I was really, like, just reflecting, and I was wondering

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.800
why I was even doing this.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.000
Honestly.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:22.400
Of course.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.200
At a certain point.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.680
At a certain point, and I want to jump back here real quick, because I think there's

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.840
something interesting that I noticed in that interview that he did in January 2019 with

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.560
Sky News, and it's illuminating to me, because here he is discussing...

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.120
I know you're going to think this is going to be worse than it is, but here's Kaelin

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.320
saying some things that he thought about the civil rights era.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.040
Oh, good.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.200
I loved what the left did in the 60s, 70s, and 80s with the civil rights movement, with

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.200
the rights for women, with the rights for gays.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:53.760
It's groundbreaking.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.240
It's what made us as Westerners great.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.440
I always thought the left was fabulous.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.440
When I started at university, I was like, of course I'd be on the left.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.760
Of course.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.880
Everyone told me that, and I assumed they were the ones who were progressive, caring.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.240
That was the best thing.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.440
But it wasn't until I actually saw what was going on, until I actually started seeing

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.600
the homophobia from the people that they were already friends with, the anti-Semitism that

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.880
the left are willing to put up with, that I thought, oh, it's losing their touch a little

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.040
bit.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.160
It never used to be like that as well.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.800
They're losing their touch completely, and they need to stamp that out.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.520
Yeah, fair enough.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.040
Everybody could be a little bit better.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.800
Losing their touch, Dan.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.800
The left, we just don't got it anymore.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.400
I mean, the left can do better, but I think that if you want to compare...

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.880
No, let's not pretend that there aren't shitheads.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.520
Yeah.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:38.320
But that clip is actually a really critical point to distinguish Kalen from the rest of

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.560
the extreme right wing that he was hanging around with.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.000
His right wing existence is not philosophical.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.240
It's not rooted in the same traditions as his extreme right wing peers, who are deeply

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.720
anti-communist, and they would view the left of the 60s and 70s as one of the greatest

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.280
existential threats that the West has ever seen.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.520
If Kalen was rooted in the more entrenched school of the right wing, he would view things

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.000
like integration, voting rights, and LGBTQ protections as things that were pushed by

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.960
communists in order to divide and conquer society.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.520
Sure.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.280
It doesn't seem to me from looking through the available information that I can find

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.400
that there's a lot of depth to Kalen's right wing views.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.080
Mm-hmm. In many ways, it seems aesthetic, almost.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:18.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.520
It seems almost performed.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.160
Work that he did back when he was on The Rebel is often about dumb, pointless culture war

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.200
type complaints.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.480
Like this clip from July 2017, where he was oh-so-mad that there was a new emoji that

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:30.880
got released.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.680
Oh, for God's sakes.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.960
Where someone's wearing a hijab.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.400
The original idea, according to their website, was to have an emoji with a dark purple headscarf,

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.960
but fearing that was a little bit too crazy, they decided on a more neutral, fond color

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.520
one, which I think is a lot more appropriate, to be honest.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.240
In the change.org petition, the group asked how they were going to make progress if they

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.360
don't include everyone in their path for peace and acceptance.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.280
And oh boy, are they right.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.600
I mean, how on earth are we supposed to achieve world peace without the right emojis?

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.720
This is not going to happen.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.160
And I don't know about you, but I'm so proud to see the tech industry making such giant

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.760
leaps for humanity.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.680
And I tell you, I can't wait for the FGM emojis.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.600
Oh, wow.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.240
Great.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.600
Wow, wow, wow.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.680
He's like a, he's like a shittier Paul Watson out there.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.320
Yep.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.720
And then, you know, he unconvincingly argues that the British are at war with Islam after

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.600
the suicide bombing in Manchester in 2017, which just again, this doesn't feel convincing.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:37.120
And once again, it proves that we are currently right now at this very place in time on the

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.560
23rd of May, 2017 at war.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:46.080
And the left seem to think that they still dominate the narrative of this entire perspective.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:51.440
We had Katy Perry only hours ago saying that we need to ignore what's going on and keep

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.520
the borders open and stop hate.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.320
We've had hundreds of political figures on pretty much every side of the political spectrum

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:05.200
up and down the country, explain to all of us and lecture us about how we must come together,

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.200
how we must unite and how we must not hate anybody.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:17.520
Well, the fact is that we are coming together, but we're coming together as British people

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.880
and Islamists are coming together as themselves.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:26.000
And we are becoming even more of a target and it's a total waste of time and we are

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.640
lying to ourselves if we think that having some sort of vigil, posting notes all over

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:39.200
city centres saying that we will not be cowed and lighting candles will make any difference.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.920
Now the only differences between World War II, the last time this country looked as at

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:49.040
war as we are now, was that at least then we could name the enemy and at least then

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.360
we actually fought back.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.600
And now we don't do even slightly something like that.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.680
It just seems like an act.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.440
There's a video of him complaining about people cutting loose at Pride.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.840
There's a video of him complaining about Starbucks changing their logo in Saudi Arabia.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.840
It doesn't feel like it has anything going on.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.320
Yeah.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.720
Like, it feels like a PR person doing a right-wing piece of propaganda.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.120
Yeah.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.560
Because that's what it is.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.080
Caelan discussed the beginnings of his career in that Sky News interview from 2019.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.640
No, like, my career was always in marketing and politics and, well, sort of PR and things

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.400
like that at university and after I graduated, you know, my partner was at the BBC and I

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.600
was working in marketing and PR firms and that's where everything was really, really

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.520
focused and that's obviously how I transitioned from sort of traditional establishment sectors

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.160
into what we're doing now, sort of taking all of the textbook stuff and applying it

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.360
to kind of more sort of fringe alternative subjects, which is interesting.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.280
This isn't a person who's motivated by the same ideologies that many of the people we

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.480
talk about are.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.280
The Infos universe, particularly in the pre-Trump era but still to this day, is based on the

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.840
bedrock of ideas disseminated by the John Birch Society and their associated figures.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:07.920
It's almost entirely emerging of Cold War anti-communism run amok and extreme white

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.760
identity-tinged religious beliefs.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.800
That's what you find behind many of Alex's guests and in his own intellectual tradition.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.560
This is the same intellectual tradition that popularized conspiracies about the globalist

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.320
which have morphed into the deep state conspiracies in the past few years.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:24.960
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.720
The pool that Kaelin is swimming in was filled by anti-communist conspiracy theories, but

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.440
I don't get the sense that he knows how the plumbing works.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.720
He knows marketing.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.200
That was his job, and he's good at it.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.560
I would say I'm like an alternative producer, so covering the stories that a lot of traditional

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.400
media and establishment media don't want to talk about or are too worried to talk about,

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.520
sort of covering the other side of a lot of the conversations that aren't being discussed,

01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:54.320
even in day-to-day life, and bringing production value to that as well and legitimizing those

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.720
arguments so that they're not like fringe sort of things on the corners of the internet

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.720
and bringing that to the mainstream.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.760
In 2019, while on Sky News, prior to being on RT to promote his free speech documentary

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.880
full of racists, Kaelin fully expresses an awareness that his role is to take fringe

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:14.880
things and make them look presentable so that people might get tricked into thinking that

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.680
they're mainstream.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:24.800
What this raises is the question of like, what does it mean to disavow right-wing ideology

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.200
if you never fucking believed in it in the first place?

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:31.680
Yeah, or if your ideology was simplistic and not really based in the same things that are

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:40.080
motivating this wide swath of right-wing ideology that is back to the militia movement.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:40.560
Totally.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:48.000
And in that case, then what is he disavowing? Is he disavowing fucking opportunistic bullshit?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.720
Is he disavowing fucking deceptive editing?

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.840
Is he disavowing surprise interviews?

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.600
Like, I want to know what this is.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.960
I think that that's one of the things that I'm kind of confused by and I'm interested

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.440
in.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.160
And these are the sorts of questions that were coming up as I was taking in a lot of

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.960
this content.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.440
Yeah.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.120
I mean, it's confusing to me.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.600
I don't- Because I guess it's racism.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.800
I guess it's hate.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.440
Yeah.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.720
Okay, fine.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.880
You're a merc for Nazis.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.960
You're not a Nazi yourself.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.160
Yeah, I don't think I care about the distinction between those two all too much.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.120
Well, yeah.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:25.840
You know what I'm saying?

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.560
It's not necessarily a...

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:36.480
It's not a disavowing of right-wing ideas, although there are certainly a lot of racist

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.440
problems on the right.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.640
Sure, sure, sure.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:44.400
I don't get the sense that there was anything other than profiting off bigotry.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.280
Yeah, it was a gig.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:45.920
Yeah.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:53.520
I answered an ad and I got a job and they were like, make these PR puff pieces.

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.960
And I was like, I'm good at that.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.120
And then six years later, it turns out being a Nazi is wrong.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.360
It turns out there is a wall.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.000
Yeah.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.240
I don't think I'm going to be able to work at CNN as a line producer if I've got this

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.120
on my baggage.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:12.640
Well, the thing that I run into that I think is really difficult is that I do believe he

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.400
probably ended up in a position that was different than where he wanted to be.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:16.720
Sure.

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:22.560
I do believe that there is entirely a possibility that some of that radicalization did happen.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:22.960
Totally.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:29.920
But from everything I can tell, it's not the story of somebody who got sucked into YouTube

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.160
algorithms and got into right-wing ideology or something like that.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:40.080
It's somebody who sought out working with Tommy Robinson and rebel media in order to

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.120
produce racist content that looked better than what was being created at the time.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:45.680
Yeah.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:45.920
Yeah.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.400
He saw a market inefficiency.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:48.880
Yeah.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.360
Yeah.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:49.920
Yeah.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.480
And...

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.080
Which is also incredibly fucked up.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.160
But again, that's not Beyond Redemption 2.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:58.800
No, no, no.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.440
Of course not.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.080
It's different.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.280
It feels different than the story that we're being told.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.040
It feels different than the story that you get from reading that Hatewatch article.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:15.840
But it's not the person who's beyond care.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.200
Sure, sure.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.960
It's not somebody who's beyond respect.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.280
No.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.320
It's just that I'm gonna look a little bit differently.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:22.800
No.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.080
I mean, a PR person for an oil company sure can redeem themselves.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.200
The oil company's destroying the world.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.840
You're working for an essentially evil organization.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.960
I get it.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.360
But I mean, that's different.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.400
It's different.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:44.400
It really is different from being part and parcel of people who are there to inspire

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:44.900
violence.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.400
That's what...

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.680
Because that's ultimately the reality of it.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:55.520
I get that maybe he wasn't a believer in the deepest deep end, but he is still producing

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.600
content that is only designed to drum up violence.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.760
I mean, at least hate.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.280
And here's what else he knew.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.960
He knew that Ali would get murdered.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:09.920
Could, yeah.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.640
Right?

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.920
So he knows that violence is absolutely on the table.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:21.440
And he probably knows, or he should, or he would have to be incredibly stupid not to

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:24.240
know that that is the fucking...

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:29.200
The result of what they do is that group of people texting Tommy Robinson saying,

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.240
we'll kill that guy.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:30.720
Yeah.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.080
That's the result.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:32.480
Yeah.

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.280
And it's part of it.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.240
It's the base.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:34.640
Yeah.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.680
It's the idea.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:35.920
Yeah.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:44.400
And, you know, the production of this documentary about free speech being infringed for these

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.560
four people who are complete bigots.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.040
Sure.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:53.440
Like, that was going on after he had the Freedom Day experience.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.040
We all have our relapses, Dan.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.440
It's just tough.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.600
It's just tough for me to swallow.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.920
I'm not trying to be unempathic and I'm not trying to shit on the guy.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.480
And I hope...

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.480
I just don't know, man.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.280
I just don't know.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.400
No, I mean, we talked about this and part of why I was so vehemently against interviewing

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:20.400
is, and I don't know if I'll bore you with this one more time, but whenever my family

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.680
left the cult, before they could be accepted back in...

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.200
I think this is an important perspective.

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.680
Yeah, before they could be accepted back into their family.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.280
And it took a while.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.560
It took a while.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:36.640
They had to send actual letters of apology, single spaced, that actually enumerated,

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:43.440
we understand where we went wrong and here is what we are going to do about that to improve

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.080
things.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.080
This is a genuine apology because it's about knowing how to correct the mistake instead

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.280
of just saying, I'm sorry for the bad things that happened.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.520
Yeah, and that's what I don't hear.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.440
Yeah, and I think that there's a little bit of a delineation that needs to be made because

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:05.600
that's about personal life and I'm staying entirely in terms of professional life because

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.680
I'm not interested in Kalen's personal life.

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:09.840
I'm not interested in anything about that.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.920
I am very willing to believe that he is a good person and that he's had a change of

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.420
heart.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.960
I'm concerned about the product.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.920
I'm concerned about the effects and the work.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:32.640
Like, the path to making things right for somebody who had his hands in and produced

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:38.320
slash directed documentaries for Lauren Southern, Alex Jones, and fucking Stefan Molyneux within

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.840
the last few years.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.680
It's a path.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.520
It's tough.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.160
It's not, the public has been hurt by this.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:48.960
A lot.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:55.200
And I do think that, you know, things that you can see online, things that he said, they

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:02.400
do give the indication and suggestion, and I don't have any reason to necessarily distrust

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:06.240
it, that he wants to make that path, and I hope he does.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:14.000
I would say that the questions that I've been raised with through this is, okay, so he's,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.800
part of his redemption campaign is gotcha clips that half of which were already in the

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:26.720
fucking documentary, that show Alex Jones represents himself differently in public than

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.840
he does in private.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:34.240
And what you have just played for me is a clip of this guy representing himself differently

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:39.840
in public in the interview where he says, here's what I believe, and this is the moment

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.960
it happened to me, and then a clip from a year later talking about his fucking documentary.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.680
More or less.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.400
So to me, while those are different, they are not the same.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:50.880
No.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:57.840
They also don't point me towards believing that a guy who's very good at marketing is

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:02.240
not rebranding and is instead contrite and changing things.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:02.960
It's hard.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.640
It's hard.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.480
And it's tough.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:06.800
Yeah.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.480
It's tough because I don't want to live in that place of suspicion.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.240
That doesn't make me feel good.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.040
I'm not like, hey, you know what is great?

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.560
Thinking the worst of people.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.320
That's not true.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.120
But at the same time, we can't live in this space.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.840
Otherwise it's going to happen again and again and again like it always does.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.520
This is where we get to why I told you this off air, and I will say it again.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.840
I think that this was one of the most difficult and complicated episodes I've had to prepare

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.520
for two main reasons.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.400
The first is that I had to constantly check in on myself and make sure that I was not

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.320
doing this motivated out of spite.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:44.640
Yes.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.280
Yeah.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:49.600
I don't feel bitter about people not replying to my messages, but you never know how much

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.360
might be below the surface.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.400
There was this emotionally interesting ride that I was on as the whole thing of trying

01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:02.400
to branch out and do something like requesting raw video from somebody, and that blew up

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.360
in my face.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.040
There was a lot of processing going on.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.800
It's kind of funny to be around you with that emotional roller coaster because we don't

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.040
talk like the entire way through.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:13.440
Yeah.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.880
So I'm getting little chunks of like, oh, you're on the down wave.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.760
I can definitely get this text is definitely not a good one.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.560
And then the text where he's like, this is the most exciting thing I've ever done.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.640
It's like I'm available to snapshots.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.480
You're filtering this through your own interpretation of these snapshots.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.200
That's what I'm saying.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.640
I'm just getting snapshots.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.280
So the second reason why this was so difficult, I think is more important.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.080
I hope Kalen is sincere and that he's changed.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.160
He's co-founded a new organization that's, quote, designed to show people radicalized

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.040
into far right movements that there is a path out.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.480
That is an important goal.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.480
And people knowing that there's life after whatever thing they've fallen into is critical.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.040
I'm personally evidence of that.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:53.360
Yes.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.240
Absolutely.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.480
If this is for real, then I don't want to be a part of impeding Kalen from being able

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.960
to live a good, healthy life that can be an example to others that they can do that too.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.800
I'm not interested in being a dick about someone who's trying to make their way out

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.320
of being in the right wing.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.320
That does not benefit me at all.

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.920
And it's not interesting to me.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.560
I don't like the idea of people shitting on somebody by default.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.060
Sure.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.320
I don't like that.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:26.400
The point that I think about is regardless of whether or not he specifically is on the

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.120
right path, and just like you, I hope he is.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.120
This story is still instructive.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:35.600
Yeah.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.080
Because sure, he's on the path.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.520
There are still plenty of people who have taken advantage of this exact type of situation.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:43.680
Sure.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.720
We'll get into that in a second.

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.200
Exactly.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:45.760
Just saying.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:46.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.280
Ultimately, also, I think it's important to remember that in the big picture, it doesn't

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.760
matter whether or not we believe him.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.400
This dude doesn't owe me or you anything.

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.160
Any apologies that he needs to make are probably to other people and they could have already

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.600
happened and we don't know.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.720
And that's totally cool.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.760
And that's their business.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.800
I'm not interested in it.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.520
This show is largely created by me taking in Alex Jones's content and finding things

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.200
that stick out as interesting and seeing where curiosity takes me.

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.080
In this case, there was a high profile viral video of Alex and the exploration of the context

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.240
of it and where it came from led me to learn a bunch of stuff about a guy who's apparently

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.320
turned over a new leaf.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:31.280
The way I went through this was largely what I would do if this was a Leo Zagami clip.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:31.760
Yeah, totally.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.400
Or something.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.200
100%.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:38.080
Except, I will admit, I pulled a few punches because some of it is like, well, this is

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:38.960
probably shitty.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.440
Yeah.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.600
And also, he didn't claim to be Jesus.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:42.000
No.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.680
And I'm not here to...

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.880
I'm here to ask him to.

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.480
Leo Zagami did claim to be Jesus.

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.360
He did claim to be Jesus.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.240
And he did 9-11.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.160
I'm saying, Kalen, if you want to give back in my good graces, buddy, there's a very

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.120
very simple way.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.840
I believe in redemption wholeheartedly.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.680
Someone very important to me got sucked down a right-wing media hole and managed to find

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.760
their way out, and I know that I would have hated them back when they were in that place.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.560
For sure.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.880
I respect and I'll defend people's right to change, but I think there needs to be really

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.520
serious examination of the professional careers of people who are claiming to have changed,

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.960
because to not do so is dangerous, professionally.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.200
Recent history is full of people who tried to make dishonest re-brands.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.280
I'm sure Samantha Bee isn't happy she played along with Glenn Beck's bullshit about how

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.720
he was sorry about all that stuff, and then he went back on it.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.840
Yeah, what a surprise.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.880
In May 2019, The Daily Dot published an article about how noted white nationalist creep Baked

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:38.080
Alaska quote is a recovering alt-right troll.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.360
This article quotes him as saying, quote, I was brainwashed.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.280
I felt like I was part of a cult.

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.720
Flash forward to the present, and the last we heard of him was when he was arrested for

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.600
being part of the January 6th storming of the US Capitol.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.840
Yeah, but that was outside of a cult.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.480
Okay.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.680
People like Mike Cernovich have made more pivots than I can count, and there's many

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.800
more people like this.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.320
My kind of gist on how I'm, because I've thought about it a lot since we've been talking

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:08.320
about this whole thing, and part, I think part of the simple thing that I kind of want

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:13.200
is like, okay, you don't get to be in public.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:18.800
One thing that I've noticed so often is that it's just, I'm just going to change jobs.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.160
It's not like I'm going to do anything different.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.320
I'm just going to get a different gig.

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:25.200
Yeah.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.720
And I don't appreciate that.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:35.360
Yeah, it is just a shifting over of like, I'm going to now do stuff that isn't hateful.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:39.360
I'll make slick content to make sure people know that they can not like stuff that like

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:39.840
I used to do.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:44.240
No, they don't need to go to a judge to say, give me 100 hours of community service.

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.640
News organizations should say, we're not going to put you on TV until you do 100 hours

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.440
of, you know, like something along those lines of like, get your fucking hands dirty.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:57.760
Well, and the thing that really, I struggle with again too, is that like when you have

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:05.760
stories of people who have been sucked down rabbit holes of information like YouTube radicalization

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.360
and what have you, I feel like their stories are valuable.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:13.200
And I don't think Kalen's story is invaluable, but I think that their stories are really

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:19.280
useful because people in their position can hear them and relate to things that they're

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.320
talking about for sure.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:20.880
Yeah.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.280
Kalen's experience is pretty fucking unique and I'm not sure his testimony is going to

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:28.400
be persuasive to other right-wing propagandists.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.760
They like him saying, you can get out, you can follow my lead and get out.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:37.120
They're going to look at him the same way Alex's audience looks at the Southern Poverty

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:37.920
Law Center.

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.440
It's not going to be persuasive to other folks who are creating and disseminating this

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.400
propaganda.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:44.800
Right.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:49.440
It is going to benefit rehabbing his image.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.080
It will.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:50.560
Yeah.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:57.280
And again, I hate coming off the way that I sound because I do sound like I'm beating

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.360
the shit out of a dead horse right now.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:07.200
I'm just, you know, we're just not far away from the storming of the fucking Capitol.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:07.360
It's true.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.680
And I'm supposed to be like, oh, he's disavowed the right and I care?

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:12.640
I'm supposed to care?

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.080
Great.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:14.720
You know?

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:17.920
That's all I'm saying.

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.400
No, I know.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:18.960
It's tough.

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:19.440
Yeah.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.720
It's complicated.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:21.440
It is.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:28.400
And I mean, I don't think that rehabbing your image is wrong if you're rehabbing.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.280
Absolutely not.

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.440
I think that people deserve chances.

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:38.640
And I just like he's doing this organization that's supposed to help people get out of

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.440
right wing stuff.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:49.680
If the idea is to appeal to people who are sucked into these webs and these right wing

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:57.440
information spaces, I don't think that he is going to be a very easy or I'm sorry, I

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.160
don't think he's going to be a very hard target for the right wing propagandists to attack.

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.520
You can smear him in two seconds.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:04.080
Yeah.

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.200
Like Alex did, saying he works or hope not hate.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:13.440
Fucking, you can, again, you can play clips of him doing the thing that he's, you know,

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:17.600
blaming or he's exploiting Alex for doing.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.360
Because that's also what he's doing.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.880
He's exploiting Alex and the SPLC at the same time.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:25.360
And they're obviously exploiting his bullshit.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:30.560
And the only people who benefit from this are the three parties involved, because none

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.760
of us get shit from it.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.880
Well, the issue that I have is like, I guess you could describe it as exploiting, but I

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.280
don't know if it's intentional.

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:39.680
Sure.

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:46.320
I could see a scenario where he thinks that this is going to make a difference, the video

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:46.800
of Alex.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.280
Of course.

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:51.360
And the SPLC thinks, hey, this'll show Alex is full of shit.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:51.920
Of course.

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:54.160
And both of them just have no idea.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:54.800
Right.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.000
I could see that being possible.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.080
I see it as being fairly unlikely.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:58.960
Super unlikely.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:03.760
And would demonstrate a uncharacteristic naivete on both of their parts.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.680
Perhaps, perhaps something so.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.680
But it is possible.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:08.880
It is possible.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:14.240
So the rest of the reporting in that hate watch article that this clip was released

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:18.160
in this initial clip, it's not stuff from the video.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.160
It's just things like Kaylin telling them, you know, like that Alex brags about selling

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.720
dick pills in his audience was gullible.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:28.080
And then he paid Paul Joseph Watson $16,000 a month.

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.080
All these things are interesting.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.440
But I already know how much Jerome Corsi got paid per month.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.560
And it was about what?

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.360
$15,000 a month.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.000
I don't remember exactly, but it was some absurd number.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.800
But the problem is that I can't accept the unsubstantiated word of someone like this

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.040
just because they're telling me something I want to hear.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:45.600
Totally.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.120
That's not fair.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:47.600
Yeah.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:50.400
Also something that you should deduce.

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:56.560
It is far more likely that he is making fun of people for buying dick pills behind their

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.400
backs than otherwise.

01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:58.960
Yeah.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.440
Yeah.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.120
Well, I mean, sure.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:06.160
I feel like the entire supplement industry is laughing at us behind their backs.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.280
I feel like a lot of them are.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.160
They have to.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:14.640
I think that the problem with stuff like that, and it's definitely something that I've

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:20.720
realized over the course of doing this show, is that that is something that everybody who

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.520
isn't on the inside assumes.

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:23.840
Yeah.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.200
And everybody who's inside won't be convinced that that's the case.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:27.680
No chance.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.160
Particularly based on the hearsay of somebody being quoted by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:32.640
Totally.

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.040
It's just...

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.800
Well, I mean, you'd have to change your entire worldview because some guy who you know is

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:44.400
connected to the SPLC told you that Alex thought buying dick pills made you a joke.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:44.880
Yeah.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:45.200
You know?

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.280
And it's like, one, these are dick pills.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.040
I'm not even going to admit that I buy these.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:49.540
Yeah.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.280
Two, I am not going to believe that I've been conned out of having good boners.

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.080
Not happening!

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:56.640
Never.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:56.960
Never!

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:05.360
So at the end of this, what we come to is, you know, we have a situation where it's

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:12.720
essentially another instance of the media bungling how you report on Alex.

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.200
Yeah.

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.440
And honestly, I think that maybe you could look at this and think it was a slam dunk,

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:22.560
but, you know, if you just had a little bit of context to what was going on in Alex's

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:27.280
life at that time, you'd look at that clip entirely differently than how it's supposed

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.240
to be presented.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.200
And then after that, I just don't know, man.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.480
I don't know how I feel.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.440
We've finished recording, we're at the end of this, and I don't know how I feel.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.360
I don't know if I feel shitty about, like, looking at these things.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:41.680
Sure.

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:48.800
Um, I don't know if it is worth anyone's time to be like, hey, here is somebody who's

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:55.680
embarking on a redemption arc, and I think that's cool, I think it's possible, but I

01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:02.240
also think we need to wrestle with the fact that this isn't somebody who just came off

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.360
the YouTube.

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:08.800
It's somebody who went to New Zealand with fucking Stefan Molyneux.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.800
He went to Poland with Stefan Molyneux.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.760
Yeah.

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:14.240
It's a serious, like, this is somebody who-

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:21.200
He captured the shot of Stefan Molyneux proudly declaring himself a white nationalist, and

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.680
when he clicked cut, he was like, that was great stuff, man.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.880
Now let me edit it.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.760
I'm gonna watch hours of him saying that he's a white nationalist.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.640
Let me edit this together in a way that makes him look smart and presentable.

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.520
Exactly, yeah.

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:41.200
Yeah, so kids or youths who click on this video will see it and think like, oh, you

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.600
know what, he does make a great case for why Poland is a great country and maybe it's because

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.480
everyone's white.

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.360
Exactly.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:47.600
It's-

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:47.840
Yeah.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:56.720
And to me, the reason that I play any of the clips that I played, or any of the stuff,

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.000
is not to beat up on this guy, because I really don't want to.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:00.560
Of course not.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:09.120
I play it to illustrate that as far as I can tell, everything that I look at and I can

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:16.400
see, it's the mark of a willing and excited participant in this stuff.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.040
Yeah.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.240
It's- I think that there's a victimhood that inherently comes along with right-wing spheres.

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.720
I think that a lot of the time they abuse each other in ways that are sometimes subtle

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.160
and sometimes pretty overt.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:28.480
Yeah.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.600
And I do think that there's probably a fair amount of that, and I feel bad that he had

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.120
to be involved in any of that stuff.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:35.520
Yeah.

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:41.680
And I don't think that anybody is not a victim, to some extent, that gets in these machines.

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.640
In the same way that we talk about how Alex fires Millie Weaver for Shadow Game.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.280
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.240
It's like, you think you're important?

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:48.720
No, you're not.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:49.200
No, you're not.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.480
You're disbandable and, you know, that is an inherent abuse.

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.040
You've got to do a fight with Stevie Pease, so you're gone.

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:55.840
Bye, David Knight.

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.400
You're gone.

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.720
You've worked here for a decade and you're fucking gone, I don't care.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.680
That was a huge mistake and I'm not looking back.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:08.240
Yeah, I think that is like an inherent piece of this information world, and it is an intrinsically

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.520
abusive place to be in.

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.200
And so I'm not minimizing that, and I'm not saying, like, he doesn't have a fair point

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.240
that, like, there's probably some mistreatment along the way, and that sucks.

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:16.640
For sure.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:25.920
That said, from the second he is involved in right-wing media at Rebel, then with Tommy

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:34.000
Robinson, it's not somebody who's not, like, driving his own train.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.680
He's not on message boards.

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.040
He's filming their fucking documentaries.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:39.360
Yeah.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:39.840
You know?

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.240
Yeah.

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:47.760
Like, that's, I don't know, I don't have any place to judge by no means, but one thing

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.720
I did think when I read that article was like, oh man, I thought the SPLC would be better

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.360
than this. I really did.

01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.160
If I saw that in, like, The Times or something like that, yeah, of course, you guys are all

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.280
shitheads, but it's the SPLC hate watch!

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:07.120
They're good at this!

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.160
It's, I was, man, I was like, goddamn, you guys are, you know what?

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.960
I thought that the left had lost its touch a little bit.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.200
I don't know.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.360
Yeah.

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.960
Anyway, let's end this.

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.360
Okay.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.000
Um, apologies if anybody thought this episode was pointless.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.280
It's half pointless.

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.000
I doubt they did.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.200
But we'll be back, Jordan, but until then, we have a website.

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:31.920
Indeed we do!

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.960
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.160
Yeah, we're also on Twitter.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:34.880
We are on Twitter!

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.640
It's at knowledgefight.net, go to betjordan.

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.480
We're also, what?

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.760
Wait, we're on Facebook?

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.720
Oh, did I say?

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:41.920
No, you said we're on Twitter.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.560
Yeah, we're on Facebook.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.600
Yeah, now we're on Facebook.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:43.840
Yeah.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:44.720
We are on Facebook, Dan.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.440
I'm absent-minded.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.840
If you could, please find a local charity or by phone.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:51.280
We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo.

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:51.680
I'm Leo.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.560
I'm DZXClark.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.280
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.400
I'm absent-minded.

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.480
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:57.040
Thanks for holding.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:39:59.760
Hello, Alex.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.640
I'm a first-time caller.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.440
I'm a huge fan.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.320
I love your work.

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:20.080
I love you.
