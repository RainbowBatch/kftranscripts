N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,240
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys in knowledgefight.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:39,400
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight, I need, I need money.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:47,160
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy, stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas, it's time to pray.

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,480
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,480
Knowledgefight, N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com, I love you.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
I'm Jordan.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,560
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,760
bit about Alex Jones.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
Oh indeed we are Dan.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Jordan.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Dan!

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Jordan.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Quick question for you.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Yep.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
What's your bright spot today?

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,600
My bright spot today is something that I did not know existed and has come into my life

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,880
and I'm pretty excited about, and that is hot honey.

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
I had no idea.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
No, refuse.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
I was at the store.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Oh, what's the point?

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
It's hot.

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
I don't understand!

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,160
I was at the store, and I saw it on the shelf, and I thought, what the fuck is this?

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,880
I'd never heard of it before.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,600
It is honey that's infused with chilis, and so it's spicy, it's so good.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,520
It is so good, because it's like honey, it goes on things, it has that honey-ness to

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,760
it, but then also the heat.

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
It's great.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
It is fantastic.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,600
You can add honey to things, mustard, you can add honey to it, you can't have mustard

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
honey.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Uh-uh.

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
No.

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Honey is honey, my friend.

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Honey is honey.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
I'll be right back.

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,240
I have strong rules, I have strong opinions about whether or not-

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,600
I don't know, man, I think you might come around if you try a little bit of that.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Alright, I probably will.

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I really enjoy that.

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
It sounds incredible.

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
It's so good.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Yeah, I believe it.

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
And, you know, I've only had it on a bagel or two so far, but there's so many things

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,600
I want to explore putting it on.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Celine!

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Celine, run!

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Run, Celine!

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Get out while you can!

57
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Meow.

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Meow.

59
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Come here.

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Come here.

61
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Gotta put some honey on you.

62
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
What about you?

63
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
What's your bright spot?

64
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,640
Celine, my bright spot is also food related.

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,840
But okay, now this is going to seem simple, but have you ever had a really good pear,

66
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Dan?

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Yeah, I love pears.

68
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,080
Pears are the best, but pears have the shortest period, the shortest window of perfection.

69
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
True.

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
That is true.

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
They turn pretty quick.

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,640
You're always either eating a hard pear or you've waited too long and it's mush.

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,000
And yesterday I ate a pear at like the precise five minute window where it was perfect.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What kind of pear do you like?

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you like an Anjou?

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I like an Anjou pear.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Do you like a Bosc?

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not a Bosc pear guy.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,680
Is that even a kind of pear?

80
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,880
I like it green.

81
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
I like it real green.

82
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,320
I don't like the brown pears.

83
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Nuh-uh.

84
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Don't get me into that.

85
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,520
I realized as I started to talk, I don't know other kinds of pears.

86
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,760
I don't even think Bosc is one of them.

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,640
No, Boscayot was a pear.

88
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
That's...

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,360
Yeah, I don't know pears.

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Yeah, no.

91
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,920
I do love them though.

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Incredible.

93
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Yeah, and I always got a little bit of shade when I was younger, which I'm a little bit...

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Shade?

95
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Well, I'm a little bit peeved about this.

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Sure.

97
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm still actually a little bitter, a little raw, and I got to air my grievances.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,200
Unlike pears.

99
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,040
My dad is a huge fan of Jelly Bellies.

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,280
And so the Jelly Bellies were often in the house, jelly beans with all kinds of flavors.

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
And of course, as you're a kid, people like the toasted marshmallow.

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
That's the kind of thing that people like.

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,440
They like all these candy kind of flavors.

104
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,600
My favorite was the juicy pear.

105
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
The juicy pear.

106
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
It was the best.

107
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,920
I thought it was really good, and I took a lot of shit for it.

108
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
You took a lot of shit.

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
Took a lot of shit.

110
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
A lot of shit.

111
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
To the point where I'm 36 years old.

112
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,360
It's been a long time for you to be remembering the Jelly Belly incident of 1994.

113
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,400
Ugh, dad likes pears.

114
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,120
Left some deep wounds.

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
Um, yeah, those pears are great.

116
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Yeah, pears are amazing.

117
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,560
So, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over, a little bit different

118
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,720
than normal, and we'll get into why here in a second, but before we do, let's take a little

119
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,840
moment to say thank you to the folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

120
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Oh, that's a great idea.

121
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
So first, you're going to love this one.

122
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,920
I pooed it on Scalia's pillow.

123
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,520
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

124
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
I'm a policy wonk.

125
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,280
Thank you very much, American hero.

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,800
Next, Dan F. Great name, I know.

127
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Thank you so much.

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I'm a policy wonk.

129
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
You're now a policy wonk.

130
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Thanks, Dan.

131
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Next, Lingle Bingle.

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Not a policy wonk.

133
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I'm a policy wonk.

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Thanks, Lingle Bingle.

135
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Thank you.

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
Next, BB Star Stuff.

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Thank you so much.

138
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
You are now a policy wonk.

139
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm a policy wonk.

140
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,080
Thank you, BB Star Stuff.

141
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Just two B's.

142
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Just two B's?

143
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,140
Not the Better Business Bureau Star Stuff.

144
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,140
No.

145
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,140
Oh, okay.

146
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
Sorry.

147
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,140
Next, Zilla.

148
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
Thank you so much.

149
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140
You are now a policy wonk.

150
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
I'm a policy wonk.

151
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,140
Thank you, Zilla.

152
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
Thank you.

153
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
Next, Amara.

154
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
Thank you so much.

155
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
You are now a policy wonk.

156
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
I'm a policy wonk.

157
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
Thank you Amara.

158
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,140
Thank you, and City Bird.

159
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
Thank you so much.

160
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,460
And then finally, I got a special shout-out, a technocrat shout-out I'm gonna give out

161
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,420
to someone, this is a very special shout-out, Laura's baby needs to arrive now so she can

162
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,100
take maternity leave already!

163
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,360
Wait, hold on, I'm getting an update on this.

164
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,260
Hold on, I think we got that email just an hour ago, is there anything new coming up?

165
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,820
It turns out we have an update, congrats Laura on your baby policy wonk!

166
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,140
I'm a policy wonk!

167
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,260
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew!

168
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,500
How's your 401k doing bro?

169
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,140
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

170
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's just get down to business, we ain't making that money off that heroin, why you

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,740

172
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,140
My neck is freakishly large, I declare info war on you!

173
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,460
Congratulations Laura and baby policy wonk!

174
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,020
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

175
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,540
And Matt for no reason at all.

176
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Exactly.

177
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
But also, thank you.

178
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Thank you very much Matt.

179
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,260
So, before we get into today's episode, I just wanted to make a little bit of a correction

180
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
about our last episode.

181
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Sure.

182
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,220
When I spoke, when I was talking about Stefan Molyneux giving that speech, I had said that

183
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,540
that was in New Zealand, and I kind of fucked that up, I conflated two things in my head,

184
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,820
that was actually in Melbourne, Australia, that he gave that speech.

185
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,540
And the reason that I got it mixed up was because when they went on this tour they had

186
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,900
intended to speak in New Zealand, and New Zealand said, fuck no.

187
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Right, right, right.

188
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,700
And that was what I had mixed up in my head, and I apologize, I got that a little bit.

189
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,860
Yeah, it would be, yeah, that's a nice little bit of context to add to that, yeah, sure.

190
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,860
So that was in Australia.

191
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Yeah.

192
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,220
Good on you New Zealand, tell Stefan Molyneux to go fuck himself as much as you like.

193
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,420
So Jordan, today, I felt like it had been a while since we checked in with present day

194
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,580
Alex Jones, and honestly, I was getting pretty happy to have had that break from his uninspired

195
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
ass broadcasting.

196
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
It's been nice.

197
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,620
I was actually kind of excited though, to get back into the mud and see what his dumb

198
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,980
ass was up to, but wouldn't you know it, I checked back in, and Owen Troyer has been

199
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,860
hosting Alex's show all this week, so there's no new episodes of Alex's stuff to go over.

200
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Wow.

201
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,780
As it turns out, Alex has taken off for another workcation, this time heading up to Florida

202
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,580
to cover what he calls a mask rebellion that's taking place at a grocery store in the city

203
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
of Naples.

204
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,580
Okay.

205
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,380
The store is called Oak's Farm Seed to Table, and Alex may or may not be broadcasting many

206
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,620
special reports from live inside the store.

207
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,340
Here is a little clip.

208
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,300
As the state is so frickin' awesome.

209
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Florida is awesome!

210
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,620
Yeah, Florida!

211
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,300
And Seed to Table, the great Oak Farms, give it up for all the great crew here, folks.

212
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Yeah!

213
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Everybody's shopping in this place.

214
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
It's awesome.

215
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,020
You can hear about like two people climbing in the background.

216
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
It's sad.

217
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Yeah.

218
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
That's a long drop.

219
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,700
That's a long drop for Alex Jones.

220
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
Oh yeah.

221
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,860
I see you guys in southern Illinois at the American Legion where they're holding a mask

222
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,980
drive for no one.

223
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,300
Now if I play my cards right, I might be able to go to a car dealership opening and record

224
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
live.

225
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Alright, wow.

226
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Oh boy.

227
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,100
So the situation with this grocery store is actually kind of funny.

228
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,180
It's actually not in the city of Naples, technically, and if it were, it would not have a mask mandate

229
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,220
because the Naples city council decided against imposing one, preferring instead to just make

230
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,100
it a thing they strongly recommend.

231
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,700
However, this store is in North Naples, which is about five miles north of city limits,

232
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,580
and is subject to the jurisdiction of the county, in this case Collier County, who do

233
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,860
have a mask mandate in place.

234
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,140
As such, the store's owner, Alfie Oakes, has been waging a protracted campaign against

235
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,100
masks since he feels like this COVID-19 stuff is a hoax.

236
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Sure.

237
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,060
I poked around this story a bit, and honestly, it's kind of cookie cutter.

238
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,740
It's a Republican business owner making a mini-celebrity of himself in the anti-mask

239
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,260
game, and there's not much more to it.

240
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,620
Everything is about what you'd expect, all the way down to him calling George Floyd a

241
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,160
quote disgraceful career criminal after he was killed, and saying that Black Lives Matter

242
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
is a hoax.

243
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Alright.

244
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,080
That led to the Lee's County school district severing their contract with him, which prompted

245
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,220
Oakes to sue the school district for $50 million, claiming as all bigots do, that their free

246
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,340
speech had been violated.

247
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,060
Oh yes, of course.

248
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,160
I don't know what his contract with the school district said, but if they had a clause in

249
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,220
there about being able to terminate the contract for cause, I don't think this is a free speech

250
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
issue.

251
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,940
In fact, I would assume that since he's a staunch conservative, Alfie should be in favor

252
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,900
of the school district being able to practice free association.

253
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,580
Rules for others and not for me!

254
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,380
They shouldn't be forced to retain business ties with someone they're opposed to being

255
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
connected to?

256
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,380
Rules for others and not for me!

257
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,560
Anyway, I don't particularly care about Alfie Oakes, nor do I care too much about Alex's

258
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,500
very transparent attempt to vampirically feast on the attention Oakes is getting at the moment.

259
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,660
If Alex had done, like, a whole show from the grocery store, then you might be dealing

260
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,140
with an excited Dan.

261
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,420
But as it stands, this is just too little to get worked up about.

262
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,020
It's really funny to imagine, though, going into a Whole Foods or a Jewel and just trying

263
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,660
to get some produce and you hear a guy yelling about the UN trying to kill the children while

264
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
you're shopping.

265
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,060
Yeah, I can't get the image out of my head of Alex and Owen on Supermarket Sweep together,

266
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,100
and boy, that'd be great.

267
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Get the turkey!

268
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Grind the beans, Owen!

269
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Fill it up with the meats!

270
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,020
Get the beans!

271
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:32,180
I don't feel like that would elevate my customer experience if Alex is broadcasting live.

272
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Probably not.

273
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
Probably not.

274
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,840
So I set out to find an episode to make for the good people out there to enjoy, and as

275
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,200
luck would have it, while Alex has been in Florida, he paid a visit to a podcast in Miami

276
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,220
called Flagrant 2.

277
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,620
I watched this, thinking maybe it would be good to cover, and it's just embarrassing.

278
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,300
Is that a basketball podcast?

279
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,480
No, that's the Flagrant Ones.

280
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,080
That is a real podcast, the Flagrant Ones.

281
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,740
The guys from Hollywood Handbook and Carl Tarr.

282
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Oh, okay.

283
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
They do a podcast called the Flagrant Ones.

284
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,300
Yeah, well, Flagrant 2 is the...

285
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,580
No, because they're talking about this being like flagrantly free speech, offensive, talking...

286
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,140
It's comics talking!

287
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
Oh my god.

288
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
It's comics talking, man.

289
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Get out of here.

290
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
It's flagrant.

291
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,640
You're not funny if you're doing that.

292
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,140
I watched it, thinking maybe it would be good, like I said, but I got nothing.

293
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,700
Alex is so fucked up that it's not even fun.

294
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,840
The guy who's throwing hatchets on Christmas Eve at his own cameras in his own studio is

295
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
fun.

296
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,500
The guy who's trying, he's just trashed annoying Rob Do about the ways to learn and a crystal

297
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,780
skull covered in semen is fun.

298
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Hilarious.

299
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
This is not fun.

300
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
It's sad.

301
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,240
There was a moment in the interview that Alex did a while back with Logan Paul where one

302
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,700
of Logan's friends commented to Alex that he had a quote heavy pour when he was getting

303
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,440
another glass of booze.

304
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,300
The tone wasn't like, hey, cool pour, man.

305
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,340
It had a touch of concern in it, like telling Alex to slow down.

306
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,620
This interview has the opposite vibe, where the hosts are laughing their asses off and

307
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,460
just celebrating how basically incoherent Alex is becoming.

308
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,180
Alex lies to the host's face about things like Sandy Hook and his position on reparations,

309
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,320
illustrating that these hosts do absolutely no show prep before interviewing propagandists.

310
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,620
At the end of the thing, one of the hosts has a list of questions for Alex, like, was

311
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:20,300
9-11 a part-time job, which should give you some sense of the value and comedic merit

312
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,180
of this show.

313
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,180
The interview was so bad that I don't even think that it rises to the level of deserving

314
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
criticism.

315
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,240
Like the only thing that I heard in it that I thought was interesting was Alex really

316
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,420
drunk trying to explain why we need to cut off all foreign aid.

317
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Okay.

318
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
I'm like, wait, hold on.

319
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,420
Now we're back on all foreign aid now?

320
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,060
What did this happen?

321
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Yeah.

322
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,980
Well, Ron Paul still lives in his drunken soul.

323
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,060
Yeah, right?

324
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,760
There's also a very, very just depressing stretch where Alex is really drunk and he

325
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,340
tries to call Rogan a few times.

326
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,280
He's like, let's get Rogan on the phone.

327
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,560
And Joe doesn't answer.

328
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
It's such a mess.

329
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,380
It's not worthwhile as an episode.

330
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,380
Brutal.

331
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,140
So I was trying to figure out like, what are we going to do?

332
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,140
And then I remember, oh, that's right.

333
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,500
There's another motherfucker I've been meaning to talk about.

334
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Oh shit.

335
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,260
I haven't gotten a chance very often.

336
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,700
That motherfucker is named Harrison Smith.

337
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,860
Oh no, we're doing white nationalist happy hour with Harrison Smith in the mornings?

338
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,740
Host of the American journal.

339
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Oh boy.

340
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Harrison Smith.

341
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,220
He had caught my eye a while back because of, first of all, his gleeful, the Patriots

342
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,580
have taken over the Capitol.

343
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,580
We won guys.

344
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,580
We did it.

345
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,740
And then also just listening to some of his shows, they'll be like, this is pretty overt

346
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
shit man.

347
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Yeah.

348
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,580
This is pretty, this is pretty a biggity.

349
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,580
And so I decided I'm going to get back in, see what he's been up to.

350
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,060
I didn't think that this was a possibility for a while cause he's been gone.

351
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,660
He just had a paternity leave.

352
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,020
Oh, he just had a baby.

353
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,860
Congratulations Harrison.

354
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,860
And he's been gone.

355
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:54,020
So Rob Dew had been hosting and Tom Papert had been hosting and boy, no good.

356
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,180
But now Harrison's back.

357
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,200
Do white nationalists have to scream like, take that great replacement every time they

358
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
have a kid?

359
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Probably.

360
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,020
In the living room, whenever the kid comes out, they're like, it's breaching.

361
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,300
They have to be like, take that great replacement theory.

362
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,580
At very least they make a little fun jokes with their partners.

363
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,140
Won't replace this one.

364
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
All right.

365
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
Hey, here we go.

366
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,140
You don't love me anymore.

367
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Okay.

368
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,580
Um, so we, uh, there's one particular reason that I decided to actually look at this particular

369
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,460
episode just March 10th and it turns out I fucked up.

370
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,060
So we're actually going to have to listen to another thing, but here is the beginning

371
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,700
of March 10th, still got some good fucking music.

372
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,660
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, you're watching American general info wars.com band.video.

373
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,300
What a day full of news I have for you today.

374
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,900
And at the end of this program at around 10 30 central standard time, Alex Jones will

375
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,620
be taking over the broadcast from his outpost in the state of Florida, a grocery store.

376
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,580
Very excited to bring a lot of information to you to take your calls as well.

377
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,500
And we do have a new sale at info war store.com.

378
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,740
I'll give you that information very shortly, but first let us begin as we always do with

379
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,180
our daily dispatch.

380
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,980
Roll the stinger, please.

381
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,580
What he's got sound effects.

382
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,580
Wow.

383
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,900
We're doing got a fax machine getting in the headlights.

384
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
All right.

385
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Okay.

386
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
All right.

387
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,780
So this is directed by Quentin Tarantino and there's a fax machine.

388
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
That's all I know.

389
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,940
William Fear bringing us in the king of the pan flute.

390
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
Still love it.

391
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,780
I don't care if that's the, if that's like intro music for like the beginning of the

392
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
show.

393
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
It's mellow as hell.

394
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,740
I think I pointed this out after our last time we talked about him, but I still enjoy

395
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
it.

396
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
Yeah, no, it's great.

397
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,540
But, uh, you know, isn't that the song that bill dies to and kill bill volume two or something?

398
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,060
So it's in kill bill, kill bill at least.

399
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,180
And that's why he knows the song.

400
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Well, of course.

401
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,020
But, um, the thing I think is really interesting is like that, like beep, beep, beep, beep,

402
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
beep.

403
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:59,820
The thing is like, okay, you're, you're showing the barest bones, uh, attempt at craft.

404
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Yeah.

405
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,860
And that's interesting because no one else really tries that is fair.

406
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,220
And then he just goes on to like read off headlines and I don't really share.

407
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,340
It's a very boring segment.

408
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:15,420
So, um, he, uh, at the beginning of this episode, he has a quite a pronouncement in today's

409
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,420
program.

410
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,780
I'll be laying out what I think is a rather convincing argument for the fact that we are

411
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:27,500
rapidly racing towards a conflict that I would call world war three, the battle lines are

412
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,060
being drawn.

413
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:35,620
And we're seeing a lot of posturing that portends great devastation in our future has to do

414
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:46,800
with China, Iran, and the Western powers aligning themselves against, uh, those, those bad countries.

415
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
We're the good guys.

416
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,100
The new development that is also a Harrison clearly hasn't gotten the memo according to

417
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,960
his anti communist buddies like Alex, world war three already happened.

418
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,340
The cold war was world war three and some even think that the Iraq war is turned into

419
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,440
world war four.

420
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,260
So if there's another one coming, Harrison should be calling it world war five.

421
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,140
I thought we were still fighting world war two since Nazis still seem to be the bad guys

422
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,140
in this case.

423
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,640
I think that him using world war three sounds a lot more exciting.

424
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,180
So I merely understand why Harrison would just go ahead and stick with that branding

425
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,900
scaremongering.

426
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,700
So not only does Alfie Oaks think that, uh, you know, George Floyd, you know, was a criminal

427
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,540
and blah, blah, blah, Harrison has some thoughts.

428
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:36,580
Meanwhile the election of, or the, uh, uh, trial rather of George Floyd continues to

429
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:43,500
move forward and, uh, more revelations are being made, uh, releasing of the autopsy report

430
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:51,900
has revealed massive amounts of drugs in his system and as they say, no injuries that would

431
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
lead to death.

432
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,780
In other words, Jeffrey Epstein may not have killed himself, but it looks like George Floyd

433
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
did.

434
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
This is nonsense.

435
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,820
There aren't revelations coming out about the case at this point because the trial was

436
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,440
still in the jury selection phase.

437
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,140
The coroner's report and autopsy information that the public has access to is the exact

438
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,860
same information we've had for like six months and it doesn't show what Harrison is claiming.

439
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,740
He's pretending that there's a new piece of information that's come out that verifies

440
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,100
his preexisting talking points because he knows that no one in the audience demands

441
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,520
better and they already believe that George Floyd's death is no big deal.

442
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,140
The Washington Post had an article about the upcoming trial on March 10th and here's what

443
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,980
they had to say, quote, when Chauvin's trial for his alleged role in Floyd's tragic death

444
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,140
begins, much of the argument will center instead on the autopsy details, most specifically

445
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,700
whether fentanyl and underlying health conditions, not the police officer's actions, stopped

446
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,660
Floyd's heart and lungs.

447
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,020
Seven experts in toxicology, cardiology, and illegal drug use consulted by the Washington

448
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,260
Post largely disagreed with that idea, most of them strenuously.

449
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,900
All but one said the autopsy findings and other court documents coupled with the well-known

450
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,060
chain of events that evening made death by fentanyl overdose unlikely to impossible.

451
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,340
And the other one was just Rudy Giuliani wearing a doctor's coat, right?

452
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,260
Experts who have weighed in on the matter are pretty clear that what happened to Floyd

453
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,460
doesn't resemble what happens in cases of opiate overdose, which is why no one on the

454
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,840
scene administered naloxone, which they did have it.

455
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,580
They had the drug that would be used in the case of an opiate.

456
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
They have to.

457
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,580
Yeah.

458
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,460
The overwhelming consensus is that though there were drugs in his system, drugs were

459
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,940
not the cause of George Floyd's death.

460
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,420
As the WAPO article points out, this defense is one that police use all the time when they

461
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
kill people.

462
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Abuse all the time.

463
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,540
Yeah, it's what they did in the case of the Rodney King beating, when it was alleged that

464
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,940
King was on PCP, and that made him such a threat that it justified the police's actions.

465
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,940
Totally.

466
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,540
This is just something that they do, and this is Harrison Smith essentially just, you know,

467
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:55,340
taking defense arguments uncritically, and then also toeing the line for just sort of

468
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,540
like exactly what cops say all the time.

469
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,780
And it's weird how people are trying to litigate this, like the NFL tries to litigate what

471
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,660
a catch is, you know, like, oh, you got to get all the way, and you have to take one

472
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,140
step forward for it to be a catch, and you have to make a football move, whatever the

473
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,620
fuck it is, you know, and it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

474
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,960
George Floyd is dead because of Derek Chauvin and his buddies.

475
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
The end.

476
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,020
There's no, there's no, you can talk about how much, you know, it's like, did he murder

477
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
him?

478
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
Premeditated.

479
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
Did he do all that stuff?

480
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,340
But no, he was dead because of those guys.

481
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
The end.

482
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,700
And it appears that even if there were some sort of a, like, I'm not saying this is the

483
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,780
case, but if there, like this argument that is being made by Harrison were even true,

484
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,100
then you still have negligent homicide on the part of these cops who would have had

485
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,500
a responsibility to address the medical condition that was supposedly happening.

486
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,620
Cops are supposed to keep people alive now?

487
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,980
That's their job, Dan.

488
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Protecting and serving?

489
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,340
I don't understand those words at all when applied to cops.

490
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
Cool.

491
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,300
So this show starts out a little bit slow.

492
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,040
I know Harrison has declared that World War III is upon us, and I gotta be honest, I didn't

493
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,100
make it to him explaining that if he did, because I got sidetracked.

494
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,060
Honestly, on Info Wars, World War III is a slow news day.

495
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
Yeah.

496
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,540
And this is, this is just like, there's like scattershot headlines until he goes to calls.

497
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,340
And here's another one of these, these little petty complaints he has.

498
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,220
This one's about Biden not giving enough press conferences.

499
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
Oh no.

500
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,860
You can only imagine if President Trump had dared to go 50 days without taking questions

501
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
from the press.

502
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Can you imagine that?

503
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,940
I mean, they'd be impeaching him already for this.

504
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,900
In February 2020, it was reported that it had been over 300 days since Trump had had

505
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,120
a formal press briefing.

506
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,260
So Harrison can go ahead and shove that stupid tone of his up his own ass.

507
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,740
Yeah, I was going to say, go fuck yourself.

508
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,660
Yeah, to make matters worse, ABC News reported in September 2019 that not only had Trump

509
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,960
not done these press conferences, but it had been, quote, six months since a White House

510
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,900
press secretary last came to the podium in a briefing room to field questions from reporters.

511
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,100
Yeah, and if Biden had done that, that, wait, what?

512
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,500
I do think that Biden should face criticism for not having press conferences enough or

513
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,140
yet, since I think it would, you know, it's a helpful piece of moving forward.

514
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,760
And I directed the same criticism at Trump when he was doing the same thing, because

515
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,800
I think the transparency and availability to the public is a good thing to encourage

516
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,120
in our leadership.

517
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,860
Harrison and Infowars don't really have any underlying beliefs.

518
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,060
They just attack their predetermined enemies and glorify whoever they like at the moment,

519
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,540
regardless if they're doing the same things.

520
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,560
They'll pretend that their hero didn't actually do what the villain is now doing.

521
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,840
But worse, not long ago, because if they did acknowledge that, they'd have to explain why

522
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,420
it wasn't a big deal for them when Trump did the same thing that they're so upset Biden

523
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
is doing now.

524
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,860
And that would unravel the game.

525
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,280
It would really make things difficult if you had to have sort of like a consistent position

526
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,820
throughout your whole.

527
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,100
That would really fuck up the game.

528
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,380
Yeah, it would be tough.

529
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,860
Yeah, they'd be out of business.

530
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,860
You know what, maybe, maybe there's something to this not having press conferences.

531
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
Right.

532
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,100
Perhaps again, we can take another lesson from this, which is this is maybe what Trump

533
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,420
should have done.

534
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,860
Maybe they just cut off the press and you just do whatever the hell you want without

535
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,500
taking questions, without accepting criticism.

536
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,900
Harrison, you're in luck.

537
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,620
Harrison, I have got great news for you.

538
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,260
I've got great news.

539
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:35,100
You can get rid of the maybe you can get rid of the what if this is so dumb.

540
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,020
You are talking about a thing a man has done recently.

541
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,660
And if I recall, your network celebrated extensively.

542
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,860
Yeah.

543
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,220
So anyway, Trump is out of office.

544
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,600
But there's someone else who's in office that I think that Infowars is warming up to quite

545
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
a bit.

546
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,820
And that person is Marjorie Taylor Greene.

547
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,680
And with that, I'd like to go to another video here.

548
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:05,860
It's Marjorie Taylor Greene talking on the floor of the Congress yesterday talking about

549
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:12,860
House Resolution 8 and House Resolution 1446 gun control legislation.

550
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,840
So it's really cool to see them warming up to Marjorie Taylor Greene definitely wouldn't

551
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,020
have suspected that was the inevitable destination of the path that begins with hero worshipping

552
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
Ron Paul.

553
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
Yeah.

554
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,840
Anyway, HR 8 is about expanding background checks for people purchasing guns.

555
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,340
The other bill they're talking about is meant to close what's known as the Charleston loophole,

556
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,720
named after the 2015 shooting because it was how Dylan Roof was able to purchase the guns

557
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,720
that he used to kill nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

558
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,420
He shouldn't have been able to pass a gun background check, but he did because of this

559
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,420
loophole.

560
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,660
See, when you go to buy a gun, your name is run through the National Instant Criminal

561
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,180
Background Check System, which should provide a yes or no result within minutes.

562
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,680
However, in some cases, the automated system runs into complications and can't make a determination.

563
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,460
In these cases, the FBI who run the system have three days to provide a yes or no to

564
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
the gun seller.

565
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,420
And if they fail to give a determination in that time, the seller gets to decide if they

566
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,020
sell the guns or not.

567
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,420
And you better believe they almost always do, because they're selling guns.

568
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:23,260
Yeah, I do appreciate that guns operate under the same laws as pumpkins that turn into carriages.

569
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,360
Yeah.

570
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,360
This bill that Harrison's complaining about would change that window from three days to

571
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,780
ten days to hopefully provide more oversight that would stop things like future Dylan Roofs

572
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,300
having easy access to guns.

573
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,860
Consider this stat from a report put out by the Center for American Progress, quote, in

574
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,740
2018, 4,240 background checks were denied nationwide after the three-day investigation

575
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,580
period elapsed.

576
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,000
In at least 3,960 of those cases, a gun was sold to the prohibited buyer at the discretion

577
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,920
of the dealer, requiring officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and

578
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,560
Explosives to attempt to retrieve these guns from individuals with a potentially dangerous

579
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
criminal history.

580
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,020
This loophole results in tons of people who shouldn't be allowed to have guns getting

581
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,260
guns, which poses a bit of a threat and also creates a ton of work and expense for the

582
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,460
ATF to try and correct the mistakes caused by a clearly too short window of time being

583
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,500
given for these background check systems to provide an answer.

584
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:31,940
I am really confused as to what situations require a gun so fast that we cannot wait

585
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,780
for the FBI to give a determination.

586
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,980
I mean, three days or ten days or a year, what do you need a gun for now?

587
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,020
If someone's barging into your house, you need a gun immediately, perhaps.

588
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,020
The background check delay isn't going to help you one way or another whether it exists

589
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
or not.

590
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
It doesn't seem like it.

591
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,020
No.

592
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,860
And if you miss out on hunting season this year, I feel like that's your fault.

593
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,540
You should have gone two weeks earlier.

594
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,260
You could have gone two weeks earlier.

595
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,260
Not a problem.

596
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Yeah.

597
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,500
I don't know.

598
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,660
I think that both of these bills are completely sensible, so it's great to see Harrison try

599
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,580
to attack them by not discussing the bills in detail at all and relying on a video of

600
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,940
a QAnon weirdo in Congress to make his argument for him.

601
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
This is just pathetic.

602
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
It's all you need to do.

603
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
This is outrageously dumb.

604
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,060
I'm going to go to a recording I made of Marjorie Taylor Greene's remarks on the house floor.

605
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:26,220
She made a bit of a better argument than that.

606
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,220
Did she?

607
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
I think so.

608
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:34,140
Um, Harrison, uh, is, uh, wanting to go to calls, but there's not enough calls.

609
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,780
And I would suspect that this is because Rob Doo fucked up his show.

610
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,340
I need this phone line full.

611
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,580
We got empty spaces here.

612
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,740
I'm not used to seeing this.

613
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,660
I was hosting American Journal for a little over a month.

614
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,780
Full phone lines the whole time.

615
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,140
I go away for two weeks.

616
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,980
Take care of my new baby boy.

617
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Come back.

618
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,980
Nobody's calling in.

619
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,980
This is unacceptable, folks.

620
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,980
I need your help.

621
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,900
I can't do this show by myself.

622
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,700
I need the info warriors calling in.

623
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:06,620
I suspect what we're going to learn about some of these callers, I have a very strong

624
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,220
theory about why calls might have dropped out whenever Harrison left and was on vacation.

625
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,540
Because Rob Doo was like, no Nazis, please.

626
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
Yes.

627
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,540
Yeah.

628
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
That was, that was, that sounds right.

629
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,540
I have a hunch.

630
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,540
That sounds right.

631
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
Yeah.

632
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
Excuse me.

633
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,020
Could you please get rid of everybody who says code words for Jew?

634
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,020
I'm going to have to hang up.

635
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
The phone lines are empty.

636
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
Yeah.

637
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
Oh my God.

638
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,020
What happened?

639
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Yup.

640
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,580
So we get to this first caller and I just think he's weird.

641
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,900
I think this is a weird dude.

642
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,060
And with that, we will go to our first call.

643
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,820
We have Andy in California wants to talk about the upcoming Passover.

644
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,080
Thanks for calling in Andy.

645
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
You're on the air.

646
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Uh, hi.

647
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Can you hear me?

648
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
All right.

649
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
I can hear you fine.

650
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Thanks for calling in.

651
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
All right.

652
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Thank you for having the show.

653
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:59,540
Um, yeah, this year I noticed that the Easter and Passover on the same day, April 4th, interesting.

654
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
No, it's not.

655
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Yeah.

656
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
No, it's not.

657
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
Harrison.

658
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:10,980
When you look at the book of Deuteronomy chapter 38, it talks about the blessing of God will

659
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:19,140
give you if you follow his ways and the second half of the chapter is, uh, all of the curses

660
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,660
that'll happen if you go after straight gods.

661
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Right.

662
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Right.

663
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,280
And, uh, sounds like a real shitty God to me, this star being, uh, not anything really

664
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,100
to do with God's law, uh, a Phoenician fertility goddess.

665
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,180
It's just kind of like slapped my face like, wow, maybe this is one of our chances to maybe

666
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
get it right.

667
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,260
Uh, before it gets any worse, because if you look at everything you guys talk about and

668
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:54,100
what we're looking at in the world today, uh, it fits those curses, uh, I mean, perfectly,

669
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:01,140
and it's not, uh, satanic organization or whatnot that are doing it.

670
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,060
It's it's, well, I mean, they might have a chain in it, but God definitely allows it

671
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,060
to happen.

672
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,340
So in case you want to learn something, uh, or Harrison, if you're listening, Easter and

673
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:18,020
Passover are both religious observances that don't involve specific dates on our calendars.

674
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,580
Christmas, for instance, like that's always observed on December 25th, because it's tied

675
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,900
to our calendar.

676
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,980
Easter and Passover, however, are both observed based on the lunar calendar, which results

677
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,180
in the holidays lining up with different dates every year, according to our Gregorian calendar.

678
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,140
Easter is always the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring and last you're

679
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,860
following the Eastern Orthodox tradition, which is an issue that's too complicated to

680
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,380
get into, because Harrison and this caller aren't even touching on that aspect of things.

681
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,500
Ah, I want to get into it now, because I've had a lot to, I've been quarreling with the

682
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,180
Eastern Orthodox about this for a long time, Dale.

683
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,660
Well, I'm going to leave you to that.

684
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,700
Passover is based on the Hebrew calendar, which in turn is lunar-based, and begins in

685
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,140
the middle of the Hebrew month of Nisan and lasts a week.

686
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,260
Typically, because of how these dates are determined, they'll end up being very close

687
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,900
to each other, and very often, Easter does fall within the week of Passover.

688
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,180
This year, Easter is on the last day of Passover, April 4th, which I guess this caller thinks

689
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,700
means something nefarious, I don't know.

690
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,620
It's very interesting, according to Harrison Smith.

691
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,420
This is Blood Moons all over again.

692
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,020
Yeah, it's 100% Blood Moons racist shit, what are we doing?

693
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,240
The more important aspect of this caller, I think, is how much he's internalized the

694
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,020
underlying message of a lot of Alex's rhetoric.

695
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,300
There are demons out there, sure, but the curses that are plaguing everyone are the

696
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,740
result of God letting this stuff happen, because you aren't good enough for him to protect.

697
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,560
This is the messaging of cults, and it's very present in Alex's content, with his regular

698
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,700
outbursts about how the world deserves to burn for things like allowing abortions.

699
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
Yeah.

700
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
It's ridiculous.

701
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,500
Yep, yep, if all of us don't act in perfect accord, well, all of us will be killed.

702
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,700
Look, God's going to lift his protection, and there you go, here come, here comes, and

703
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
it's your fault.

704
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,820
God operates under the same laws as, like, a teacher, and if you're a student who didn't

705
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,980
bring enough gum for the class, well, everybody gets punished.

706
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,700
Nobody gets any gum, and you all get sent to hell.

707
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,500
Everybody knows that that's the way God works.

708
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,340
Yeah, and conceivably, it's your fault, as an individual, because you didn't-

709
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,660
Should've brought more gum to the class.

710
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,980
Well, but what is bringing gum to the class a metaphor for, in this case?

711
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,660
Basically setting up a religiously ordered society?

712
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,660
Exactly.

713
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Basically setting up a theocracy?

714
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,060
A theocracy, you should have overthrown the teacher, brutally deposed her and murdered

715
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,100
her, and then God would have showered you with all the gum in the world, Dan.

716
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,420
Yeah, it's a little bit worrying when you start to think about the ramifications of

717
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,620
internalizing the blame for God's wrath.

718
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,740
It is a little bit of a problem, yeah.

719
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Gets you into trouble.

720
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,900
So, Harrison starts talking about how the pope, you know, that globalist pope?

721
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
I've heard of the globalist pope.

722
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
Cool pope.

723
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,780
He's been in jail for well over a year.

724
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,220
Yeah, according to expert sources, please.

725
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,700
But, Jordan, what about that pope that I've seen going around?

726
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
Fake pope.

727
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
You haven't seen anybody.

728
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
False flag pope.

729
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,700
False flag pope.

730
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
You haven't seen shit.

731
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:11,100
Steve Porchenek arrested the pope like a year ago, but I guess the fake pope, somebody pretending

732
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:17,980
to be the pope recently, I guess in an interview had said that climate change is possibly going

733
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,820
to cause another flood.

734
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,300
Those comments are what they are.

735
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,320
And Christians took that very simply and calmly as him saying that there would be a regular

736
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
flood.

737
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,740
Harrison has decided that the pope is calling God a liar.

738
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
There we go!

739
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
I knew it!

740
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,620
He also came out and said that because of climate change, we face threat of a new flood

741
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,620
from God.

742
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,340
Now, I don't know, maybe I was just a child.

743
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Maybe I misunderstood.

744
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:53,620
But it wasn't one of the key aspects of the flood that God promised never to do it again.

745
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,140
Wasn't that a promise God made, and is the pope calling God a liar?

746
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,180
Yeah, so the pope's calling God a liar.

747
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,380
Now we'll get into this here in a second, but something I think is really interesting

748
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,220
is that Harrison starts thinking about the flood.

749
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,660
Starts thinking about the flood story, and he gets a little bit weird with it.

750
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,760
The original reason that God flooded the earth was sexual immorality.

751
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,620
What does the pope have to say about that?

752
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,020
I'm pretty sure what he has to say about that is, don't worry about it.

753
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
It's fine.

754
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Come on!

755
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,060
Free love, pope!

756
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,540
So this is interesting to me, because the flood in the Bible happens pretty early in

757
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
the book.

758
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
It happens pretty fast.

759
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,100
It's in Genesis chapter 6, so I decided I would go back and refresh my memory about

760
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,880
the lead-up to the flood, and see if it happened because people weren't fucking the way that

761
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
God wanted them to.

762
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
They weren't fucking right!

763
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,400
So Genesis 1 is the creation of the world, and then chapter 2 is about the making of

764
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,620
Adam and Eve.

765
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,100
Genesis 3 is about the fall of Adam and Eve, having eaten from the tree of knowledge, and

766
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,580
in retaliation, God made snakes all slithery.

767
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,300
That one was guest-written by C.S. Lewis.

768
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
A lot of people don't know that.

769
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,940
He created painful child-birthing in male-dominated relationship structures, and then he also

770
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,060
turned Adam into a farmer.

771
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,600
Yeah, it was really important to get the male-dominated social structures in right away, like, right

772
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
from the jump.

773
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Yeah.

774
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,620
First chapter, men rule everything, moving on!

775
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,620
And it's gonna hurt when you give birth.

776
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,620
Yeah, and it's gonna hurt!

777
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,820
And it's your fault for eating that fucking apple later!

778
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,900
Genesis 4 deals with Cain killing Abel, and then there's a bunch of names in a family

779
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
tree.

780
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,700
Genesis 5 is a bunch more names and how long they lived, bridging the gap from Adam all

781
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
the way down to Noah.

782
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
Sure.

783
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,380
In Genesis 6, God gets a little bit tired of people and decides they shouldn't be living

784
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,380
so long.

785
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,220
In addition to that, he sees that quote, sons of God were marrying quote, daughters of humans,

786
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,500
which I guess is supposed to mean that angels were breeding with humans.

787
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,660
Strange that there aren't any lady angels wooing human dudes, but I'll get off my SJW

788
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
soapbox here.

789
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Don't worry about it, Dan.

790
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
Come on, now.

791
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,460
Here in, uh, here's Genesis 6, verses 5 through 7.

792
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,740
Quote, the Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on earth, and

793
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,220
that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.

794
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,420
The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply

795
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,420
troubled.

796
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,020
So the Lord said, I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created,

797
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,340
and with them the animals and the birds and the creatures that move along the ground,

798
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,220
for I regret that I have made them.

799
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,420
Wait, hold on, God.

800
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Real quick.

801
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
Just quick question, God.

802
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,380
Um, just, we're in the planning stages.

803
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,940
I can see that you're reacting emotionally.

804
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,820
And frankly, I think it's a little bit offensive of you to say that they're acting evil all

805
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,820
the time?

806
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Sure.

807
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
I mean, come on, man.

808
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
Sure.

809
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
Also, what did the birds do?

810
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,820
Birds are just hanging out!

811
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,260
Well, I mean, look, if you want to defend the birds, that's your business.

812
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
That's what I want to do?

813
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,540
I have a long-standing beef with birds.

814
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
Okay, that's fair.

815
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,820
Um, I'm not going to go to bat for them, but I am going to say that I was reading over

816
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,140
this, and it struck me how weird this is, that like, you know, it's a big decision to

817
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,060
create a race of humans.

818
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,900
The existence of all things.

819
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,540
It's very weird that God wouldn't see it coming, that he would regret doing it.

820
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,500
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

821
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,660
He was a young God at the time!

822
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,460
We were young, he was young, everybody makes mistakes, this is teenage God.

823
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,180
That seems something strange to fit into the conception of a God, is a regret over the

824
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,580
creation of humans.

825
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,860
Woof, man, those guys were shit!

826
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,380
I fucked that one up.

827
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,380
Whoops!

828
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,380
Yeah.

829
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,380
Whoops-a-doodle.

830
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
Very weird.

831
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
Yeah.

832
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,340
And, by the way, even if, like, God was justified in being disappointed by humans, is extermination

833
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,540
a rational solution to that problem?

834
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,860
After all, it was God that created humans, so wiping them out is really just him trying

835
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,420
to cover up his own mistakes?

836
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,980
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

837
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,820
Anyway, that brings us to Noah.

838
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,820
God liked Noah because he was unlike the rest of the people.

839
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,780
From Genesis 6-11, quote, Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.

840
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,020
God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted

841
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
their ways.

842
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,500
So God said to Noah, I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled

843
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,540
with violence because of them.

844
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,580
Twice in three verses the complaint of violence is raised in relation to God's decision to

845
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,420
kill everyone off with the flood, and weirdly, sexual impropriety isn't brought up at all.

846
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,540
It is odd that God would care more about violence than sexual impropriety.

847
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,160
That seems so weird, Dan.

848
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,700
After Noah builds the ark and saves all the animals, the flood comes and they have to

849
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,060
live on that boat that's comically oversized for about a year.

850
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,060
Noah is 600 years old at that point.

851
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,380
When the flood ends, Noah gets off the boat and makes an altar to God, which pleases God.

852
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,660
In appreciation, God says, quote, Never again will I curse the ground because of humans,

853
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,020
even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood.

854
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,380
And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.

855
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,060
This story is fucked up, but the promise that God makes at the end of it doesn't preclude

856
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,980
God from causing the kind of flooding that we would see arise from climate change.

857
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,220
People aren't suggesting that we're going to end up in Waterworld or some shit, just

858
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,580
that there are a lot of places that will become uninhabitable, and this will lead to mass

859
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,100
displacement and likely a lot of death.

860
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,940
That's completely compatible with God's promise to never again destroy all living creatures.

861
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Yeah.

862
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Yep.

863
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,260
David Smith is a dumbfuck religious zealot who's trying to repurpose religious stories

864
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,980
to suit his extremist agenda.

865
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,180
In this case, his opposition to LGBTQ rights and access to reproductive health care.

866
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,220
It's a pathetic display, and honestly, it's important to recognize that this is not a

867
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,580
news show.

868
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,420
They aren't even really conspiracy theory shows at this point.

869
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Nope.

870
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,780
They're extremist religious programming that's masquerading as something political or about

871
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,180
conspiracy in order to make them more interesting and attractive to an audience that would reject

872
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,580
them instantly if they were aware that the message they were being delivered and was

873
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,340
being pushed to them was religious in nature.

874
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,780
These guys on this podcast where they're all drunk, if they realized what was behind Alex's

875
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,780
rhetoric and his messaging and how it was really largely a religious message, I don't

876
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,380
think they would think this was as funny.

877
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,380
Hey, hey guys.

878
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,020
I know we've had a lot of fun, but just to remind you, the earth is only 10,000 years

879
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,420
old and your sinfulness is going to get you sent to hell forever.

880
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,380
Anyways, don't abort a baby.

881
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,060
Hey, I know I'm three quarters of the way through this bottle of Jameson, but I should

882
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:09,260
tell you I'm a conception of angels and demons and how very serious it is that I can see

883
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
them demons.

884
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,460
You know, when you read the biblical flood myth, you really start to think, was this

885
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,100
written by a dude, because I think it might have been.

886
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,860
It feels very dude written.

887
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,980
It's weird to go back and read it after a long time.

888
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:32,540
It had been quite a while since I had read the story directly from the source and it

889
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,500
was like, hmm, I don't know.

890
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,260
I don't know what it is about my brain, but I can pick out little things that I missed

891
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
when I was younger.

892
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,020
Like, oh, that's a weird detail.

893
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Yeah.

894
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:50,620
Isn't it really kind of strange when you sit down and grapple with reality and where we

895
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:56,340
are as a society now and you look back and you're like, so are you telling me that I

896
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:03,460
was taught when I was a child that God just irrationally murdered everything and I'm like,

897
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,420
and that's the guy I need to worship until I die.

898
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,180
That part of the story is really underplayed.

899
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Really not important.

900
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:16,260
I do think that there's still like some metaphorical value in terms of, you know, I don't know,

901
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,000
steadfastness and faithfulness.

902
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,100
Or just educational value in learning about how people explain disasters throughout history

903
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
in an oral tradition.

904
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
Anthropological kind of thing.

905
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

906
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
I agree.

907
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
I agree.

908
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,420
But I just think, I think it would be interesting if back in my Bible study groups or Sunday

909
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,420
school we'd discussed the ramifications of extermination.

910
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,420
Yeah.

911
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,000
And there are so many better flood myths too.

912
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,660
There were actual floods.

913
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,660
Everybody's got a flood myth that was around at the time.

914
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,660
There were some great ones.

915
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,500
The only explanation I remember is like, they're all bad.

916
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Yep.

917
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
The people who died were bad.

918
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
100%.

919
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
100%.

920
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
That's what they, that's what they argued.

921
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
That's not cool.

922
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Yeah, yeah.

923
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,700
No, from the jump in the Bible, it's like, well, listen, killing everything that's evil

924
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,220
is on the table, obviously.

925
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,220
Yeah.

926
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah.

927
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:11,220
So I think that Harrison believes on some level that the motivation behind the flood

928
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:19,260
on God's part was something to the effect of something related to LGBTQ rights.

929
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,420
He might be conflating the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

930
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,580
So he weaves that in.

931
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Of course he does.

932
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
Yeah, yeah.

933
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,100
And I think the reason that he's doing that is because he doesn't actually remember the

934
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,300
flood myth one.

935
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,140
Maybe not, but he does remember that the rainbow is the sign of God's covenant.

936
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,140
Everybody does.

937
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,780
And of course you look at the, you know, in Christian mythology, I guess you could call

938
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:44,780
it the rainbow was the sign from God as a promise that he would never flood the earth

939
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
again.

940
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,060
So just think about this, that you have God flooding the earth because of sexual immorality.

941
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,860
And then you have the symbol of this.

942
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:03,420
The symbol of his promise to never do it again has been co-opted by alternative sexual lifestyles.

943
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
Ooh.

944
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,660
Satanic to its very core, I have to say.

945
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
What?

946
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,340
It's as interesting as Easter and Passover happening on the same day, Dan.

947
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,460
Is he trying to say that people who have alternative...

948
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,460
The gay stole the rainbow.

949
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
Well, sure, but...

950
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,460
That's what he's saying.

951
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,460
Of course.

952
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,860
But beyond that, I think what he's saying is that people who have quote unquote alternative

953
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,460
lifestyles are immoral.

954
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,460
Yeah.

955
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,460
He is.

956
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,580
He is saying that it is immoral to be a lesbian or gay.

957
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Anything other than straight.

958
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,580
Yeah.

959
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,580
That's cool.

961
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,340
I mean, I guess, you know, just own that position then, Harrison.

962
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,460
It seems like that's what you want to say.

963
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,460
Yeah.

964
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,140
No, it seems like that is what you are saying.

965
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Yeah.

966
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

967
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
It's fucked up.

968
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,580
Just come out and say that you think everybody who's not straight should be put to the sword.

969
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,580
Yeah.

970
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,900
You know, like your God does.

971
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,380
I think Harrison might be only a little ways away from that.

972
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,860
Yeah, you're probably not wrong.

973
00:43:54,860 --> 00:44:00,300
So we get another caller here, and this caller, like, I'm still reeling from this.

974
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Okay.

975
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,300
This is a minute long.

976
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,300
Okay.

977
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,300
Listen to the...

978
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,300
Mic down for this.

979
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,300
Okay.

980
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,300
All right.

981
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Because this is confusing.

982
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,500
This is coming to Carlos in Texas.

983
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,980
Thanks so much for calling in, Carlos.

984
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,980
You are on the air, sir.

985
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,980
Yeah.

986
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,980
What's up, Harrison?

987
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,820
I want to congratulate you on your newborn child.

988
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
Thank you very much.

989
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,820
You're going to...

990
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,820
Yeah, no problem, man.

991
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,820
You're going to raise a great info warrior.

992
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:25,580
I've been listening since David Knight, and ever since you came out on the show, you've

993
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,860
been a great addition, bro.

994
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,220
They should have been had you on.

995
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,220
Thank you, man.

996
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,220
I appreciate that.

997
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,220
Yeah, man.

998
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,220
You do a great job.

999
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,220
Hope you keep it up.

1000
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Thank you.

1001
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,220
I want to give a huge shout out.

1002
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,220
Huge shout out.

1003
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,820
I want to give a special extra strength formula.

1004
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,220
Here I am sitting in a parking lot outside my university with a 5G tower beaming right

1005
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,220
at me, and I'm ready to go for the day, dude.

1006
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:54,340
I took these pills last night and had a great sleep.

1007
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,500
And I'm ready to go for the day.

1008
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,860
And not only that, I took some more this morning, and we're chilling, and we're ready to go

1009
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,860
and start the day, man.

1010
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,860
And that's it.

1011
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,860
That's all I have to say.

1012
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,860
Oh, that's awesome, man.

1013
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,860
Yeah.

1014
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,860
No problem.

1015
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Peace, bro.

1016
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,860
Thank you very much.

1017
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,460
That's Dr. Jones's Natural Extra Strength Kava Chill and a beautiful plug from Carlos

1018
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,460
from Texas.

1019
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:22,220
The whole call, the only reason he called in at all was to plug this product.

1020
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,220
So wait.

1021
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
So you're saying-

1022
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,220
There wasn't anything else to the call.

1023
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:32,900
So this guy is just like, man, my friends and I took this Infowars product, and we were

1024
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,260
like, fuck yeah.

1025
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,780
I got a good sleep last night.

1026
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,780
Good call, guys.

1027
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,780
I got a good sleep last night.

1028
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Yeah.

1029
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,780
And then I took some more, and I'm chilling.

1030
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,780
I'm ready to start the day.

1031
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,780
Ready to start the day.

1032
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,780
I'm on campus.

1033
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
There's a 5G tower.

1034
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,780
It's not getting in my way.

1035
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,780
Not a problem.

1036
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,780
Not a problem.

1037
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,780
I've got to call Harrison.

1038
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,780
I am chill.

1039
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,780
I'm so chill.

1040
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,780
I'm going to give Harrison a call.

1041
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,860
Let him know I love David Knight, but listen, the White Nationalist Happy Hour is so better.

1042
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,380
Harrison has to know how chill I am right now.

1043
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,780
I'm so fucking chill.

1044
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,900
I got to call Infowars.

1045
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,760
That's nuts.

1046
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,860
That is nuts.

1047
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,860
That is nuts.

1048
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,460
And it doesn't sound like a plant because it did sound like that guy was just a little

1049
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,460
bit high.

1050
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
He sounded a bit high.

1051
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,460
He sounded pretty damn high.

1052
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,460
He sounded a bit chill.

1053
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,460
He sounded fairly chill.

1054
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,460
Yeah.

1055
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
I don't know.

1056
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,980
I think it could have been a plant, though.

1057
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,100
I think it could have because it almost felt like he was bailing when he ended the call.

1058
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,260
It felt like maybe there was something else, and he was like, ah, fuck it.

1059
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,260
Yeah, whatever.

1060
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,620
Why the fuck would you call into this show and just be like, hey, your product works?

1061
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,660
I guess to let everybody know that it gets you high, man.

1062
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,660
What a waste of time.

1063
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:48,060
Anyway, we get to this next caller, and actually this caller starts by talking about-

1064
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,820
It's like calling up your weed dealer and being like, man, this stuff did it.

1065
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,820
Shit's good.

1066
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,820
All right, that was a good call, guys.

1067
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,860
I'm going to get out of here.

1068
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:59,840
So this next caller, Jordan, I had got into this episode and I'd started listening to

1069
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,980
it because I thought that this was the episode where Harrison interviews Stuart Rhodes.

1070
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,980
Oh, shit.

1071
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,940
And so I wanted to hear that.

1072
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:13,220
And when this caller started up, he says, I want to talk about Stuart Rhodes' interview.

1073
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,580
So I was like, ah, shit, I got the wrong day.

1074
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,580
Yeah.

1075
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,620
However, this caller then proceeds to really freak me out.

1076
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,620
Okay.

1077
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,380
Let's go now to Scott in Florida who has a comment about our guest from yesterday,

1078
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,620
Stuart Rhodes, leader of the Oathkeeper, he was on for an hour or so breaking his media

1079
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:35,500
silence to talk about some of the fallout from January 6th.

1080
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,900
And a caller, Scott, from Florida has some comments about this.

1081
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,220
Thanks for calling in, Scott.

1082
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,660
Did you enjoy the interview or do you have some concerns about it?

1083
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,660
What's your take here?

1084
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,660
Yes.

1085
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:50,580
Good morning, Mr. Smith, and congratulations on your child, your dad, and that's such an

1086
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,580
awesome responsibility.

1087
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,460
You know, I'd like to say this, Stuart Rhodes is a hero.

1088
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,620
He's a hero and a patriot, a leader of the Oathkeepers.

1089
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:04,660
I pray for him and his family that this evil government does not incarcerate him.

1090
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,540
You know, you should have you should have a panel if you can do a show.

1091
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,220
I don't know if you can do this, where you could get the leaders of the Oathkeepers,

1092
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:16,260
the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo Boys, the Three Percenters, my favorite group, the John Birch

1093
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,260
Society.

1094
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,820
I haven't heard from the John Birch Society, if ever there was a group to get involved

1095
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:28,340
with the takeover of communism, the United States is a John Birch Society, sovereign

1096
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,060
citizens, West broke out this church.

1097
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,980
Look, let's be honest.

1098
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,980
Whoa.

1099
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,780
OK, so this list spiraled.

1100
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,580
Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:45,340
I mean, we're we're on the edge of being like, and also let's get Lex Luthor in there.

1102
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:50,980
Bad guys from Captain Planet, like, come on, let's do the whole Legion of Doom.

1103
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,980
Get him in there.

1104
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,980
Get him in there.

1105
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,980
Come on, buddy.

1106
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,580
Let's just go for all evil everywhere.

1107
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,580
Yeah, exactly.

1108
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,620
I mean, like, I get the idea of like, let's have a roundtable powwow with Stuart Rhodes,

1109
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,140
maybe someone from the Proud Boys.

1110
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,540
That seems like, OK, this is where your show is at now.

1111
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,900
You add the John Birch Society and it's like, oh, you're harkening back to your roots.

1112
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,900
Yeah, that makes sense.

1113
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,420
Right, right, right, the Westboro Baptist Church.

1114
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,420
No, what?

1115
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,420
What?

1116
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,420
Why?

1117
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,420
Sovereign citizens.

1118
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,420
Jesus, dude.

1119
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,420
They don't even have a leader by rules.

1120
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,420
Yeah.

1121
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,420
What are we doing?

1122
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,420
This is very weird.

1123
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,140
When he said the Westboro Baptist Church, that was one like my like, oh, oh, oh, what's

1124
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,140
going on here?

1125
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,140
What are we doing?

1126
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,020
And this caller, it was this is only the beginning of the trouble with that really was the beginning

1127
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,020
of the trouble.

1128
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,020
Oh, yes.

1129
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,020
Oh, boy.

1130
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,740
So this guy is going to put forth the theory or is the position that January 6th was the

1131
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,780
beginning of the Second American Revolution.

1132
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,780
OK.

1133
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,780
And I hate to mike down you twice.

1134
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,780
Oh, boy.

1135
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,980
This is fast.

1136
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,980
You're going to scream.

1137
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,980
OK.

1138
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:56,460
January 6th, 2021 is going to go on in American history is the second American beginning of

1139
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,060
the Second American Revolution.

1140
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:04,340
It's going to be the pinnacle of the beginning of it, because this is not over, Mr. Smith.

1141
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:10,180
The American people are being persecuted by a Zionist occupied government.

1142
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:18,020
And let me relate what that means when you've got an FBI that interrogates, threatens people

1143
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:22,260
like you were saying yesterday, because they don't like their opinions.

1144
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,180
They don't like their thought processes.

1145
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,700
This smacks of a Zionist occupied government.

1146
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,300
What I mean by that, I want to be vague.

1147
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:36,100
I'm talking specifically about a government that is controlled by APAC, American Israel

1148
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,420
Public Affairs Committee, a Federal Reserve that is the Rothschild bank, just mentioned

1149
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,740
a moment ago, Linda Rothschild.

1150
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,740
That doesn't surprise me talking about a capitalist world order.

1151
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,380
International Jewry is at stake here, is involved here.

1152
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,220
And I know what you said with me last time.

1153
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,220
Well, let's stop.

1154
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,860
It's not just I'm not talking about average Jews.

1155
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,740
I'm talking about international Jews.

1156
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,020
Oh, boy.

1157
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,300
This is off the rails.

1158
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,300
Wow.

1159
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,980
I feel like I feel like when Rob Dues hosting, he knows to hang up on.

1160
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,100
People who say Zionist occupied government.

1161
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,220
I'm talking about a Zionist occupied government.

1162
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,460
And let me be clear on what that means, sir.

1163
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:17,860
I believe the moment you talk about a Zionist occupied government, you have been clear on

1164
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,860
what that means.

1165
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,860
Click.

1166
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,860
Yes.

1167
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,860
Yeah.

1168
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:27,300
Here at Infowars, our branding is supposed to be that we're against that kind of stuff.

1169
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,020
In order to support that kind of stuff, we have to be pretend to be against it.

1170
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,020
Oh, boy.

1171
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,540
International Jewry, my friend.

1172
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,340
I have never heard that in a positive way.

1173
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,620
Have you ever heard, like, it's national, let's celebrate the International Jewry Day.

1174
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,620
No.

1175
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:51,500
What was the name of that book that Ford put out during World War II?

1176
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,900
The International Jew?

1177
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,060
This is Nazi shit.

1178
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,900
That is straight up Nazi shit.

1179
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,900
Yeah.

1180
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,900
Yeah.

1181
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,860
And I would argue, buddy, just I mean, and look, I'm going to go out on a limb here and

1182
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:11,600
I'm going to say that he's very mad at the FBI for choosing to go after people who don't

1183
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,540
share his opinions now.

1184
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:19,360
I get the feeling that he was a big fan of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI.

1185
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,860
You know, I think he was probably a fan of the FBI murdering people who would say things

1186
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,980
like Black Lives Matter and the like.

1187
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,980
Sure.

1188
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:34,540
Or when the tide was so anti-communist and trying to root out communist sympathizers

1189
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,540
everywhere.

1190
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,540
Yeah.

1191
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,540
Yeah.

1192
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,900
I'm willing to bet there would be a slightly different tone.

1193
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:44,140
Now the thing is that this dude is fucking overt.

1194
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,260
He doesn't give a shit.

1195
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,500
He's putting it all out there.

1196
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,540
He's talking about how it's the International Jews, not your regular everyday Jews.

1197
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:58,500
Well, because he's so comfortable, you know, floating all this stuff, he kind of makes

1198
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,460
clear something that we already know.

1199
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:09,300
When Mr. Jones says globalist, I know exactly what he means.

1200
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,780
I'm not pinning it on him.

1201
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,780
I'll say it.

1202
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,820
In my opinion, when I hear the word globalist, I think of the Rothschilds.

1203
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,580
I think of the Protestant family.

1204
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:24,140
I think of a cabal of international Jewry that is pushing forward this new world order,

1205
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,220
which I call the Jew world order.

1206
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,340
And I hate what's happening in America.

1207
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,980
He laughed at that.

1208
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,860
Harrison laughed at this guy saying the Jew world order.

1209
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,860
Harrison is straight up a Nazi.

1210
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,860
This is outrageous.

1211
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,860
Harrison's a Nazi.

1212
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:37,860
This is outrageous.

1213
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,860
That's a real Nazi.

1214
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,060
How is this happening on air?

1215
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,140
That is a Nazi broadcast.

1216
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,940
That's Nazis, that's Nazis doing Nazi shit.

1217
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,700
And he's giving up the game a little bit that whenever I hear Alex say globalist, I know

1218
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,700
what he's talking about.

1219
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,700
Yeah.

1220
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,700
I don't know if that made me, I have a weird reaction to that because part of that made

1221
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,420
me feel like, well, good for you, buddy.

1222
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,520
You understand what he's saying.

1223
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,160
It's nice that he at least can read between the lines.

1224
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,020
I don't know if many people can do that.

1225
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:12,900
I think it's bad that he can and does and believes that it's okay to do that.

1226
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:19,220
Well, the experience that I had was like thinking, no duh, but like, you know, I'm so, I'm so

1227
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:24,740
dull or numb to the fact that like that is the code, that the characterization that Alex

1228
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,980
uses the globalist rely so much on these archaic forms of antisemitic tropes.

1229
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,980
Yeah, yeah.

1230
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,780
And like, I get that and I know that and so it doesn't surprise me.

1231
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,620
Although it is a little bit shocking to hear somebody just be like, come on, let's talk

1232
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,620
honestly.

1233
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,620
I know.

1234
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,620
It is weird.

1235
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,620
Yeah.

1236
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,620
It's really weird.

1237
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,700
It's strange because it does indicate that, I mean, this guy isn't the only person in

1238
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:54,020
the audience who has a cognizant sort of self-awareness that that's what he thinks Alex is talking

1239
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,020
about.

1240
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,500
Well, yeah, obviously.

1241
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,500
Everybody gets it.

1242
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Everybody gets it.

1243
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Dude.

1244
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,220
Why do you think we use the code word?

1245
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,220
So we don't sound like this.

1246
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,220
So we don't say it on the air.

1247
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,220
So we don't sound like this.

1248
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,220
Yeah, man.

1249
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,340
God damn it, dude.

1250
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:13,940
So this guy, he has some reading materials that he might want to promote to the audience

1251
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,140
and Harrison lets him.

1252
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,140
Is he a Pez dispenser?

1253
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:22,220
Your listeners are confused and frightened and want some sanity on what's going on.

1254
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,340
Please God, tell me what's going on.

1255
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,220
Read a book called The Protocols.

1256
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,980
There we go, he's the Pez dispenser.

1257
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,980
That's a fortune.

1258
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:30,980
No, it's not a fortune.

1259
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Sure, sure.

1260
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,980
And you've made this point before, Scott.

1261
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,980
And I know you've also mentioned that if you've talked to Scott before, you've called in a

1262
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:37,980
few times.

1263
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,980
Yes, I am.

1264
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,980
By the way, I am Jewish.

1265
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,020
That sounds like identity politics to me.

1266
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,020
Great, great.

1267
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,020
Sure.

1268
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,020
I don't care.

1269
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,020
I really don't care.

1270
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,220
It does not make any of the things you're saying any better.

1271
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,220
No, no, no, no, no.

1272
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,220
Nope.

1273
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,220
Don't care.

1274
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,220
Don't care.

1275
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,220
Wow.

1276
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,660
I'm kind of back by that, like, oh, these guys know each other.

1277
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,420
Yeah, that's real.

1278
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,780
That makes me even more uncomfortable, where you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, no, no, it's

1279
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,780
this guy.

1280
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,460
Of course I'm going to let him say that he hates all Jews.

1281
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,460
Duh.

1282
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:11,140
Of course I'm going to let him promote the protocols on my fucking show.

1283
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,420
You've made this point before.

1284
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,420
Hang up on this guy.

1285
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,420
Yeah.

1286
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,420
Jesus.

1287
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,420
You know what point he's going to make.

1288
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,420
Jesus Christ.

1289
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:21,380
Anyway, Harrison, not one to shy away.

1290
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:28,140
How is it that people are bitching about banning books and the protocol still isn't banned?

1291
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,140
Yeah.

1292
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,380
Dr. Seuss, far more dangerous.

1293
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,860
Oh, so angry.

1294
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:39,020
So Harrison doesn't really, like, push back too much on this guy.

1295
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,020
I am Jewish.

1296
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,020
Okay.

1297
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,020
Yeah.

1298
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,680
Let me just say, you know, it's interesting that you, you bring it up with Stuart Rhodes

1299
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,720
because actually one of the things I was going to mention yesterday that I didn't get to

1300
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:54,840
with Stuart Rhodes is the fact that the organizations who are actually advising the FBI on what

1301
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,340
to do, I mean, you know, essentially you have the FBI and you would think that they would

1302
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,540
be answerable only to politicians.

1303
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,300
They would be taking directives from civilian oversight.

1304
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:08,460
But in reality, what you see, and there's stories going back all the way to 2017, is

1305
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:14,140
that it's organizations like the ADL and the SPLC that are actually directing the FBI.

1306
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,140
Does that sound true to you, Harrison?

1307
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,740
They're calling the ADL and SPLC Jewish organizations.

1308
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,860
They're calling themselves that, right?

1309
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:26,700
So you have an organization that is of, you know, of a certain ideology that is not claiming

1310
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,700
to be for everybody.

1311
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,620
It's the Anti-Defamation League.

1312
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,960
It's a Jewish organization.

1313
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,220
And yet they're the ones who are directing the FBI.

1314
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:41,040
Now, there is a weird sort of disconnect in the American psyche where it's like, how do

1315
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,980
we not see that that's weird and wrong?

1316
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:47,660
That it's a private organization that I consider a hate group that has articles about me calling

1317
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,300
me an anti-semite, calling me a homophobe, calling me a racist, calling me all sorts

1318
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,500
of horrible things that are completely untrue and totally baseless.

1319
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:03,540
Yeah, that's a little tough.

1320
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,540
That's a little...

1321
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,540
Completely baseless.

1322
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,540
What did they do?

1323
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,060
Listen to the previous 10 minutes?

1324
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,760
How would they have known any of these things to claim if they had not listened to me speak

1325
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,500
for the previous 10 minutes?

1326
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Yeah.

1327
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Wow.

1328
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
Wowzers.

1329
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Wow.

1330
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:24,740
When you have a caller who's insinuating that international Jewry is a cabal that's trying

1331
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:29,300
to push the Jew world order, and if anybody in the audience is afraid, they should just

1332
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,020
read the protocols of the elders of Zion.

1333
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:38,380
And then if you then respond with, hey, you know, the SPLC and ADL are Jewish organizations

1334
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:45,260
and they run our FBI and they're a hate group that runs our FBI, they're like, hey buddy,

1335
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,660
you are signing off on what this guy is saying.

1336
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1337
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,580
You are not disagreeing with him.

1338
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,580
This isn't a debate.

1339
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,360
This isn't an airing of alternative ideas that you have.

1340
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,500
You guys are just both fucking out there.

1341
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:04,540
It is interesting the difference in reaction between, because I feel like now that they're

1342
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,500
all just letting it out, just like, hey, we're Nazis as fuck, how are you guys doing?

1343
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,900
I'm a Nazi, you're a Nazi, let's have a great old conversation about Nazi shit.

1344
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:19,080
I can feel my guard being lowered a little bit because I'm not like, what is this supposed

1345
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,620
to mean?

1346
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,420
In what way are they trying to hide?

1347
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,020
In what way are they trying to lie?

1348
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,020
Yeah.

1349
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,940
However, I have let my guard down there and put it up to fight because I would like to

1350
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,940
fight them.

1351
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:36,740
The moment you're just like, hey, we love being Nazis, I'm like, ah, then you're fair

1352
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,740
game.

1353
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,740
Right.

1354
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,740
You know?

1355
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:40,740
It's brutal.

1356
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,740
Ah, I hate these guys.

1357
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:42,740
It's a mess.

1358
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,740
Ugh.

1359
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,840
So Harrison does have one rebuttal that I would say he gives, and it's just to protect

1360
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,100
the business.

1361
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,220
It's just to protect the game.

1362
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,860
He has to disagree that globalist means international Jewish person.

1363
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,100
Sure, but he will admit that the ADL, the SBLC, and the FBI, as well as the government

1364
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,940
He'll not only admit that, he will bring that to the conversation.

1365
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,940
Yes, of course.

1366
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:04,940
Okay.

1367
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,860
And so I do disagree with you there where it's like, oh, globalist is just a code word.

1368
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,860
It's not.

1369
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,860
It's a certain thing.

1370
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:15,700
It's a very particular thing that you can subscribe to whatever religion you are, and

1371
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,240
it doesn't mean you subscribe to it if you're Jewish.

1372
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,720
So I do disagree with you on certain points.

1373
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,060
That's not even what that guy was saying.

1374
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,060
Yeah, no, that's not even close.

1375
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:29,700
He's responding to a false point in order to try and protect the Infowars use of globalist

1376
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,980
as a dog whistle.

1377
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,580
Yeah, no, you're just a Nazi, Harrison.

1378
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,620
Yeah, it's unfortunate for you.

1379
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,460
Yeah, for you, and for the existence of the rest of us.

1380
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,900
And it's unfortunate for him because I don't listen to his show much, and then I dip in

1381
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,900
and there's this.

1382
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,780
It's like, I think you are going to be a lot of my media diet in the future.

1383
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,140
Wow, just straight up Nazi shit.

1384
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,140
Yeah.

1385
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,140
God damn.

1386
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,740
So I got through that call and listened to a little bit more, and I just started to get

1387
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,740
bored.

1388
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:06,740
And I'm so overwhelmed by that call and how overt and offensive it was.

1389
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,260
And I'm like, nothing's going to be worse than that.

1390
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,260
You can't.

1391
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,940
I can't imagine that it would be worse than that.

1392
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,740
Next caller.

1393
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,280
And that caller had said that the Stuart Rhodes interview that I was looking for was on the

1394
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,440
other day.

1395
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,440
So I turned this episode off and went over to the Stuart Rhodes.

1396
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,140
You didn't wait to see if somebody called in and said the Holocaust didn't happen and

1397
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,820
that Jews are also responsible for all the problems in the world?

1398
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,820
I don't think it was a caller.

1399
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,820
That might have been a guest.

1400
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,260
That could have been Harrison.

1401
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:37,060
So I went to the interview with Stuart Rhodes because there was some news about him recently

1402
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,620
related to the 6th.

1403
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,620
Right, right, right.

1404
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:44,260
That he was a super cool dude and that everybody loves him and I never wanted any violence

1405
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,260
at all.

1406
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,840
I wanted to check in on his response to it, and I thought it was interesting that it's

1407
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:54,760
on the American Journal, but that's because Alex is deep in the grocery store.

1408
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:01,420
So here we find the introduction to Stuart's interview and Harrison has some bad ideas.

1409
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,900
This is also, I should say, this is from March 9th.

1410
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:11,220
Again, you have to begrudgingly admire the ability of the mainstream media and the corrupt

1411
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:17,140
establishment, their ability to manipulate the minds of the American people, especially

1412
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:22,580
when it comes to an event like January 6th, 2021.

1413
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,540
It was, of course, as more information is coming out, we know, essentially an inside

1414
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,540
job.

1415
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,340
The same way that 9-11 was an inside job, 1-6 was an inside job.

1416
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,700
Flashback to our- The Patriots have taken the Capitol.

1417
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,100
If anyone wants to listen to our coverage of January 6th, Harrison's tone was very different

1418
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,900
on that actual day.

1419
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,700
The Patriots have taken the Capitol.

1420
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,260
This is him doing the, I don't know why the SPLC thinks we're racist.

1421
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:55,140
It's a little bit, it's tough to take with a straight face, like I don't really believe

1422
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,500
any sincerity here.

1423
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,100
No, no, no, fuck Harrison.

1424
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:02,580
So he gets talking about this, the January 6th protest, and he says something that is

1425
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,860
categorically not true.

1426
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:10,900
What was occurring there was the largest protest, I believe, in American history, the most number

1427
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:16,260
of people ever to gather in a single place for a political movement, probably upwards

1428
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,140
of a million, if I had to guess.

1429
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,140
That's not true.

1430
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,300
I believe is doing a heavy lifting job in that sense.

1431
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,340
I believe that that was the biggest, well, yeah.

1432
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:31,260
So Stewart comes in and here's what he has to say about all these people who were talking

1433
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,860
a bunch of noise about how it was an insurrection.

1434
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,860
Sure.

1435
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,860
And they're going for your head, man.

1436
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,940
I mean, what has it been like for you?

1437
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:45,300
Well, it's been like something out of Orwell's 1984.

1438
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:51,020
It's thought crime and face crime and all the things that we've seen in the past that's

1439
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:55,220
been done to others is now being done, not just to me, but anybody else who was in DC.

1440
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,220
It's ridiculous.

1441
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,820
As you were saying earlier, there were no weapons.

1442
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,820
No one brought guns.

1443
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,620
What kind of an insurrection is that?

1444
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:07,740
You know, frankly, it's an insult to the competence of American patriots that were there to allege

1445
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,220
that was some planned insurrection.

1446
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,440
So Stewart Rhodes is coming on the show to try to get out in front of some pretty damning

1447
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,740
information that's just been released.

1448
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:21,360
It's related to the U.S.'s case against Thomas Caldwell, an oathkeeper who was arrested related

1449
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,180
to the storming of the Capitol.

1450
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:27,020
Caldwell had made a motion to reconsider his detention, and this document that was filed

1451
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:30,340
in the evening of March 8th was a response to that motion.

1452
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,060
There's some interesting bits in here.

1453
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,980
The first thing that's important to remember is that the charge this guy is facing is conspiracy

1454
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:41,320
to, quote, stop delay and hinder Congress's certification of the Electoral College vote.

1455
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,740
That's key, because the conspiracy wasn't to storm the building.

1456
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,180
The storming of the building was, quote, an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,

1457
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:53,100
regardless of when they formed the intent to take these actions.

1458
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,500
The prosecution isn't claiming that anyone conspired to storm the Capitol, just that

1459
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,180
they conspired to make it so Congress couldn't carry out its work.

1460
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,940
This should scare the shit out of someone like Stewart Rhodes.

1461
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,700
Yeah, because he did that.

1462
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,540
The reason it should scare him is that this filing also reveals that the government is

1463
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:16,060
in possession of logs from a signal chat titled, quote, DC op January 6th, 21, which was previously

1464
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,560
undisclosed.

1465
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,400
Caldwell himself has not been proven to have been in that chat, but Jessica Watkins, as

1466
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,420
well as another unnamed person who were both oathkeepers who were arrested with Caldwell,

1467
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:32,720
were in there, as were multiple, quote, regional oathkeeper leaders from multiple states across

1468
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,100
the country and Stewart Rhodes.

1469
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:40,260
Who would have guessed that the people who believe that the government is surveilling

1470
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:46,060
them at all times, trying to constantly implant them with computer chips to track them, would

1471
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:51,260
have absolutely no idea that the government could actually read these fucking conversations.

1472
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,760
These chat logs clearly show that Stewart Rhodes was in contact with multiple people

1473
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,220
associated with the oathkeepers who stormed the Capitol, and also establishes fairly well

1474
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:03,180
that they were all involved in a plan to mess with the certification of the Electoral College

1475
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,180
votes.

1476
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:07,660
And based on the publicly available evidence, it looks like Stewart could get rolled up

1477
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,300
in this conspiracy charge, should the government want to pursue that.

1478
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,040
The full extent of the chats aren't disclosed, but Stewart did tell the group, quote, we

1479
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,500
have several well-equipped, quick reaction forces outside DC.

1480
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,460
There are many, many others from other groups who will be watching and waiting on the outside

1481
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,020
in case of worst case scenarios.

1482
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:29,620
Maybe these people didn't have weapons because they had a plan that involved heavily armed

1483
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,620
backup teams.

1484
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:34,140
Yeah, they didn't have weapons in the Capitol because we were keeping them outside of the

1485
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,540
Capitol to use on people who tried to escape the Capitol, dummies!

1486
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:38,540
Duh!

1487
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,540
Duh!

1488
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,540
On January 3rd, Thomas Caldwell sent a message to a three-percenter group asking, quote,

1489
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:47,320
how many people either in the militia or not, who are still supportive of our efforts to

1490
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,940
save the Republic, have a boat on a trailer that could handle a Potomac crossing?

1491
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,700
If we had someone standing by at a dock ramp, we could have our quick response team with

1492
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:59,900
the heavy weapons standing by, quickly load them and ferry them across the river to our

1493
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,220
waiting arms.

1494
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:04,660
He then sent maps to people alleged to have been part of his response team.

1495
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,100
Well, that doesn't sound good.

1496
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,500
I wonder, and to be clear, I'm just spitballing here, I'm not being sarcastic or facetious

1497
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,860
at all, I'm just curious, I wonder if this dude got the idea to use the Potomac from

1498
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,220
listening to Alex's show.

1499
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:21,460
On the December 31st episode of Alex's show, just days before Caldwell tried to get this

1500
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:26,260
boat planned together, Alex had a caller on his show who suggested this.

1501
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:32,900
Just wanted to touch bases with you with the March on D.C., or the occupation of D.C.

1502
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:37,820
I think that you, I'm going to talk to all the Cajun Navy and all these people that did

1503
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:44,780
boat parades for the past three to four months, we need to have every single one of those

1504
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:47,980
people plug up the Potomac.

1505
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,980
Because you know...

1506
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,100
That is a genius idea, and can you get boats from a Potomac?

1507
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:57,380
Well, I can set out some Facebook posts and stuff, but they definitely need to get boats

1508
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,380
from a Potomac.

1509
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,100
No, what I'm asking you is, I don't see a lot of boats from a Potomac.

1510
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,340
I mean, boats can get on the Potomac, can't they?

1511
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:06,060
Yeah, well, I'm sure they can, especially like the Cajun Navy, when the hurricanes come

1512
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,940
in, they have to go in there and help get people out.

1513
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,220
I agree, well, we need to see the Cajun Navy come in and then get on the ground with us,

1514
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:14,220
but I totally agree.

1515
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,220
We need to see...

1516
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:18,540
Well, because I'm looking at it, if they tie up those boats, even if they try to shut down

1517
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,780
those bridges, and that's a free, you can get into, I mean, that's a public area, tie

1518
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,780
up those boats.

1519
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:28,300
If they try to shut down those bridges, just imagine the info war army crossing the country.

1520
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,940
And by the way, let me tell you what this is about.

1521
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,780
It's about global government, it's about lockdowns, it's about control.

1522
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,740
That's what the whole COVID hoax is about.

1523
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,140
Alex changes the subject there a little bit.

1524
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,860
It's not quite the same thing.

1525
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:42,340
This caller is talking about clogging the river with the boats, whereas Caldwell wanted

1526
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:46,500
to use them to ferry weapons, but there are some similarities in terms of what's being

1527
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,500
suggested.

1528
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,100
So clearly this caller doesn't mean that the entire river should be clogged up, but that

1529
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:56,620
these boats should tie together and block the area off so info wars types could cross

1530
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:59,700
the river in the event that the bridges were closed.

1531
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,060
There's thematic similarities to what Caldwell was trying to achieve, but it's probably not

1532
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,500
connected in any way.

1533
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:11,020
I just thought it was really interesting that it was just a couple days before.

1534
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:15,740
And maybe this is just kind of how these folks' minds work, you know, parallel thinking in

1535
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,940
terms of like, well, all right, we could use the river.

1536
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:24,420
Yeah, it does seem like these are plans that they cobbled together from half-remembered

1537
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,020
war movies.

1538
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,260
This sounds something like I remember from Bridge on the River Kwai.

1539
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,940
We're going to go into the Potomac, I guess, I don't know.

1540
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:37,300
Anyway, the point here is that Stuart Rhodes is going to have a really interesting year,

1541
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,740
and it also makes a whole lot more sense why he was trying to promote Jessica Watkins'

1542
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,860
legal defense fund after the 6th.

1543
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,100
Yeah, that does make sense.

1544
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:50,740
So Stuart, he has a bit of a lie here about the Signal messages that he's been sending.

1545
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,740
Sure, sure, sure.

1546
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:56,580
The only thing they've got is a message from me posted on our operational chat on Signal

1547
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:02,780
saying, anybody who's not on a PSD come to the northeast corner of the Capitol, that's

1548
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,180
where I was standing, I wanted to be there.

1549
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:09,260
And my intent was to make sure that our guys stayed out of trouble.

1550
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,260
This is a lie.

1551
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:17,300
On January 6th, Stuart posted in that chat, quote, all I see Trump doing is complaining.

1552
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,860
I see no intent by him to do anything, so the Patriots are taking it into their own

1553
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:21,860
hands.

1554
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,860
They've had enough.

1555
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:27,780
Later, Stuart sent a message to regroup on the south side of the Capitol, not the northeast

1556
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,740
side, as he's saying here on the show.

1557
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:35,220
At 2.41, Stuart posted a photo of the southeast side of the Capitol captioned, quote, south

1558
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:39,180
side of US Capitol, Patriots pounding on doors.

1559
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,620
By that point, multiple people in the chat had entered the US Capitol.

1560
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,620
Of course.

1561
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,620
We'll see how this shakes out and everything, but Stuart is totally full of shit here.

1562
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,340
It's outrageous.

1563
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,340
That's fucked.

1564
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,340
Yep.

1565
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:52,340
That is fucked.

1566
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,780
Now, it's interesting because Stuart has a little bit of a, eh, what are you gonna do,

1567
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,780
kind of defense.

1568
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,780
Sure.

1569
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,780
Here.

1570
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,780
What other defense do you have?

1571
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,260
You've been caught red-handed.

1572
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,260
Listen to this.

1573
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,580
All right.

1574
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:07,260
And let me give you something to think about while you're listening to this.

1575
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,260
Okay.

1576
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,260
He's telling the truth.

1577
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,260
I will do my best.

1578
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,620
Now, ask yourself, if he's telling the truth, is this okay?

1579
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,620
Okay.

1580
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,620
Because it's not.

1581
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,620
Okay.

1582
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:22,140
And we had a situation with North Carolina, sadly, our North Carolina chapter had already

1583
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:27,100
gone on a road, and it declared on a chat that I wasn't even on, they declared to other

1584
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:33,100
guys in North Carolina that in DC on January the 6th, they were not gonna have anything

1585
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,820
to do with National or take part in anything that National was doing, they were gonna do

1586
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:37,820
their own thing.

1587
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:41,100
And they had posted that on December 31st.

1588
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,260
A member took a screenshot and sent it to me.

1589
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,260
So there's that.

1590
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:45,260
So there's that.

1591
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,260
Right.

1592
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,260
So...

1593
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,260
North Carolina's gone rogue.

1594
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:49,260
Yeah.

1595
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,260
Okay.

1596
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,260
Okay.

1597
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,260
So, look, guys.

1598
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,260
It's what?

1599
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,260
What?

1600
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:58,140
So I built this organization entirely around right-wing violence.

1601
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:02,140
And a super strong distrust of centralization.

1602
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,140
Yep, yep.

1603
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:08,620
And then, strangely enough, one chapter went rogue and decided that I had no control over

1604
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,620
them.

1605
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:10,940
One chapter essentially declared states rights.

1606
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:11,940
Yeah!

1607
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:12,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1608
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:13,940
That's cool.

1609
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:14,940
That's cool.

1610
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,940
Yeah.

1611
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:16,940
That's cool.

1612
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:17,940
I've created these heavily armed mini-armies.

1613
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:18,940
Yeah.

1614
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,460
And, hey, oh, they don't want to cooperate with me.

1615
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,460
Oh, that's trouble.

1616
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,460
Yeah.

1617
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,460
It turns out, I accidentally created warlords.

1618
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,180
My bad, guys.

1619
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,180
My bad.

1620
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,100
I created roving bands of warlords.

1621
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,220
Really a huge mistake on my part.

1622
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,220
Oops.

1623
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,900
That would be one of the reasons why people don't like what you do.

1624
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,900
Yeah.

1625
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,180
And people have been pointing out stuff like this.

1626
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,180
Oh, okay.

1627
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,460
So you guys were talking about the warlord problem.

1628
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,460
No, no, no.

1629
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,460
Now I see what you were talking about.

1630
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:48,340
Oh, you were saying that if I create this loosely connected group of armies, what of

1631
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,820
them might go rogue?

1632
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,300
Oh, crazy.

1633
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:55,180
You know what's strange about lionizing a leaderless resistance?

1634
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,060
It seems that they don't want to follow my leadership for some reason.

1635
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:02,660
Yeah, I mean, if this is true and, like, let's say that the North Carolina crew was responsible

1636
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,060
for everything, I still think Stuart should get sued.

1637
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:07,340
Yeah, I think you still created the whole shebang.

1638
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,020
You don't just get to say, like, whoops, my group went rogue.

1639
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,380
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

1640
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,380
Look, it happens.

1641
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,380
Yeah.

1642
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,380
Yeah, no.

1643
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,380
Anyway.

1644
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:17,460
I'm off the hook because they went rogue, see?

1645
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,140
No accountability there.

1646
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:23,140
In this next clip, Stuart misrepresents what the government's argument is, and keep in

1647
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:29,140
mind that the charge that this Oathkeeper is facing is related to conspiracy to obstruct

1648
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:33,900
and interfere with the Congress's electoral vote.

1649
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:39,300
They're trying to say that because we said the election was stolen, this was very dangerous

1650
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:44,220
about this, anyone who said the election was stolen and then encouraged people to go to

1651
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:49,420
DC, and then, like we did, encouraged Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, and we said

1652
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:54,300
that if he does, we're willing to serve as the militia if he calls us in the service,

1653
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,340
which is a perfectly constitutional and legal act by the president.

1654
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:03,980
He declares an insurrection and calls us up under federal law as the militia to call us

1655
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:04,980
in the service.

1656
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:06,900
He has every right and authority to do so.

1657
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,740
They're trying to make that a crime.

1658
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:10,420
They're trying to allege that that-

1659
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,860
No, they're not.

1660
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,860
No.

1661
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,180
That's not at all what they're doing.

1662
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,340
If so, you would already be in prison.

1663
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,340
Yeah.

1664
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,340
Yeah.

1665
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:24,860
I mean, anybody could say, come to DC, anybody could say, come be a part of this protest.

1666
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:30,060
You can't, you can't conspire to interfere with Congress's business.

1667
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,060
Well, there's that.

1668
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,060
Well, you actually can.

1669
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,060
Yeah.

1670
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,060
As long as you don't do anything.

1671
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,060
Right.

1672
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:39,860
You can conspire unless you make an overt act towards furtherance of the conspiracy.

1673
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,700
See, here's what my defense would be.

1674
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,900
My defense would be, it was a nonviolent protest.

1675
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,500
Now the problem with that defense is that it wasn't.

1676
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,780
So that kind of changes your, yeah.

1677
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:55,660
You know, like if nothing had happened and they were levying this charge to stop the

1678
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,660
vote, you could have been like, see, nothing happened.

1679
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,660
We didn't do anything.

1680
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,660
We didn't go anywhere.

1681
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:01,660
It was just a protest.

1682
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,660
Let's say no one breached the Capitol.

1683
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,660
No one breached the Capitol.

1684
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,660
And they just had a protest outside.

1685
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,300
Just a regular old protest.

1686
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,500
Then nothing would be happening.

1687
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,500
Nothing would happen.

1688
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,500
No.

1689
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,500
Nobody's-

1690
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,500
You know why?

1691
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,500
The problem is what happened after the thing.

1692
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,780
If Congress's ability to carry out the vote wouldn't have been impeded.

1693
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,780
No.

1694
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,780
No, no, no.

1695
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,780
So it wouldn't have been a crime.

1696
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,780
Right.

1697
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,780
It would have been just a regular protest.

1698
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:24,980
If overt acts weren't taken to further the conspiracy, the conspiracy wouldn't be prosecuted.

1699
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:25,980
Yeah.

1700
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:31,860
I think they're mistaking that they think we're criminalizing the first part where you're

1701
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:34,180
like, hey, we don't like this thing.

1702
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,120
Let's all get together and be like, no.

1703
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,080
Whenever our problem was the second part when they were like, let's go kill people.

1704
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,860
That was my problem with it.

1705
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:47,700
I don't like the combination of it, but it's the second part that's a legal problem.

1706
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,700
Yeah.

1707
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,060
That's the one that's coming back to bite you in the ass.

1708
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,060
Yeah.

1709
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:56,740
So it turns out that because of what's happening and the prosecution of these people for storming

1710
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:02,100
the Capitol and all this, it turns out there's no more Constitution.

1711
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,100
Oh.

1712
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,900
That we are now living in a post-Constitution America.

1713
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:06,900
Right.

1714
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:12,300
And the act they take just makes that clearer and clearer to more Americans.

1715
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:17,380
You are not going to get justice at the hands of this so-called justice department as you

1716
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,940
call it, the injustice department.

1717
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,940
Nice.

1718
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:20,940
Get them.

1719
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,940
I don't know.

1720
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:25,380
I mean, this is one of those things that's so fucking dramatic.

1721
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,380
Yeah.

1722
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:32,100
This is again, the, just the drama nonsense of these people we're in a post-Constitution

1723
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,100
America.

1724
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,700
Well, Hey, I mean, if you're in a post-Constitution America, guess what?

1725
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,700
You don't have the right to own guns.

1726
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:37,700
Yeah.

1727
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,700
So.

1728
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,980
So we can take those real quick.

1729
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,980
I got bad news.

1730
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,980
Bummer.

1731
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,980
Bummer.

1732
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:43,980
You're gonna have to quarter some soldiers.

1733
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,020
We're living in a post-Constitution.

1734
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,020
Fuck off.

1735
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,020
Grow up.

1736
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,580
And the thing that makes it even more silly.

1737
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:50,580
Cosplaying cowards.

1738
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:55,260
Well, the thing that makes it even more silly is that Harrison agrees with him that we're

1739
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,260
living in a post-Constitution America.

1740
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:01,740
And then he plays a clip of Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about defending the second

1741
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:02,740
amendment.

1742
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:08,780
Well, today representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congresswoman rose to speak against

1743
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:16,380
HR 8, which is a national gun at registration and HR 1 4 4 6, which is a permanent firearm

1744
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:17,500
waiting list.

1745
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:24,520
So the Democrats are coming after our constitutionally guaranteed rights one after the other.

1746
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,820
And there's no sense of them slowing down, only increasing their speed.

1747
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,900
They're not constitutionally protected anymore.

1748
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,900
According to you, there's no constitution.

1749
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:32,900
We're post-Constitution.

1750
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:33,900
We're post-Constitution.

1751
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:34,900
What are you talking about?

1752
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,540
You guys gotta adjust your fucking rhetoric.

1753
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:40,420
If you're gonna say we're living in a post-Constitutional America, don't fucking talk to me about the

1754
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:41,740
Constitution then.

1755
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,740
Which one?

1756
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,740
Fuck your second amendment if it's post-Constitution.

1757
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,780
None of you have fucking read it to begin with!

1758
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:46,780
Fair enough.

1759
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,780
And that's all good and well.

1760
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:48,780
But, like, uh, okay.

1761
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,900
I mean, if it's, like, it's Thunderdome then.

1762
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,060
It's, like, what are you...

1763
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,060
Yeah.

1764
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,060
Yeah.

1765
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,060
Come, fucking, let's do this then.

1766
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,180
It's, if we're living, if you really sincerely believe...

1767
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,180
Mad Max me.

1768
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,180
Let's go.

1769
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:07,420
If you sincerely believe that the Constitution no longer applies, we're in a post-Constitution

1770
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:14,820
America, and you're not just saying that to be a dramatic weirdo, then it should implicate

1771
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,140
a whole bunch of your other beliefs.

1772
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,140
Yeah, totally.

1773
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:20,420
And you should no longer be talking about protecting the second amendment because if

1774
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,700
there is no Constitution there's no amendments to the Constitution.

1775
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,060
No, no, there's only the amendments.

1776
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:28,100
I guess you probably should stop complaining about free speech.

1777
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,940
Well, don't worry about that too much.

1778
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:30,940
That's not guaranteed.

1779
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:31,940
No, not anymore.

1780
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:32,940
If it's the post-Constitution America.

1781
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:33,940
No.

1782
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:37,700
No, and if you're gonna say post-Constitutional America, then essentially what you're saying

1783
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:43,940
is if we want the Constitution back, we're going to have to overthrow the fucking United

1784
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,940
States government.

1785
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:47,060
Yes, and write a new one or whatever.

1786
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,060
Exactly.

1787
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,060
Yeah.

1788
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:53,880
Or re-establish the old one, but either way, ultimately, you are saying we need to overthrow

1789
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,420
the United States government.

1790
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,780
And the way we're gonna do that, according to Stewart, is purging the GOP.

1791
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,240
See, there we go.

1792
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:05,660
It's disgusting to watch all these so-called Republican leaders throw everyone at the Capitol

1793
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:10,220
under the bus, condemn them all, and agree with the Democrats.

1794
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,740
This was an insurrection and all this nonsense.

1795
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:17,580
We have got to purge the Republican Party, and it has to start at the bottom up.

1796
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:22,780
You gotta purge out all the rhinos, all the cowards or traitors that dominate the GOP.

1797
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:23,780
Oh, they're gone.

1798
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:28,080
It is full, infested with both of those, both traitors and cowards.

1799
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,380
You gotta purge them out and put real patriots in there, like Mrs. Green, and you gotta get

1800
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:33,380
more of that.

1801
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:36,380
You gotta get more Marjorie Taylor Greens in there.

1802
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:42,180
Do not, do not, for one second, do not, Stewart Rhodes, for one second, say that someone else

1803
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,660
is a coward.

1804
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:44,660
For one second.

1805
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:49,660
One, you're going on this show lying about the shit that you did on the 6th.

1806
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:54,760
If you were not a coward, Stewart fucking coward-ass Rhodes, then you would have turned

1807
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,020
yourself in, you would have claimed that this whole thing is bullshit, and you would have

1808
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,860
said, I'm going to stand and fight these fucking charges because I'm not a coward.

1809
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:08,740
And instead, you went on a radio show, not even a good one, you went on a shitty radio

1810
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:11,980
show to say, ooh, I didn't do any, no, no, no, no, no.

1811
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,620
They're going to blame me for stuff that I had nothing to do with.

1812
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,940
I'm not involved in the, they went rogue.

1813
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,940
The North Carolina guys went rogue.

1814
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,660
I'm not, we need to get rid of cowards and traitors because the North Carolina guys went

1815
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,660
rogue.

1816
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:28,180
The North Carolina guys went rogue and did all the things that we constantly talk about

1817
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,180
doing.

1818
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:32,460
No one is a bigger coward than Stewart Rhodes.

1819
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,460
No, no, no, no.

1820
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:34,460
That fucking coward.

1821
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,460
No, no, no.

1822
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1823
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:37,460
Marco Rubio.

1824
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:38,460
Oh, that's fair.

1825
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,460
That's fair.

1826
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,460
Mainline Republicans.

1827
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:43,860
We need to vote him out and get more Marjorie Taylor Greene's in.

1828
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,260
We need to get rid of cowards.

1829
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:49,060
Now, whoa, whoa, whoa, the federal government did, I didn't do anything, oh, no, no, I will

1830
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,900
never take responsibility for any of my actions.

1831
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:51,900
Of course not.

1832
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:56,500
It also insinuates that even if that goes through, it might, it's not going to really

1833
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,940
work, but it might help.

1834
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:58,940
What a fucking asshole.

1835
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,580
Still thinks that violence probably is going to happen.

1836
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,580
What an asshole.

1837
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:06,600
So we get towards the end of this interview and Harrison gives us, you know, basically

1838
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,620
like what this is mostly really actually about.

1839
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,620
Yeah.

1840
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,740
I want you to tell us, Stewart, what, like somebody who's listening right now, they see

1841
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:17,360
what's going on and they're thinking, what do I do as soon as this program's over?

1842
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,360
What do I do?

1843
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,360
Of course, go to Infowarsstore.com.

1844
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,420
You can go to Oathkeepers.org, but what can they do?

1845
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,420
Who do they call?

1846
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,420
Ghostbusters.

1847
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,420
Yep.

1848
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:26,420
All right.

1849
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,420
Yep.

1850
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:34,820
I mean, it's more or less a 40 minute infomercial for, uh, for, uh, Stewart Rhodes feigning

1851
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,940
ignorance and innocence and then also trying to get money.

1852
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,820
Why not just tell Stewart to take some of that fucking chill, man?

1853
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:47,660
If you're going to be dramatic about the post-constitutional America, we got some products that will chill

1854
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:48,820
you the fuck down.

1855
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,820
I will say-

1856
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:52,100
Protect you from 5G and get you ready for your day.

1857
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,100
Here's that it works.

1858
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,300
It seemed to get that dude pretty high.

1859
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,300
Yeah.

1860
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,300
I don't know.

1861
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,020
I mean, I have trouble sleeping sometimes.

1862
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,580
Maybe I should, uh, I mean, no, I will not.

1863
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,580
I want to make this clear.

1864
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:07,300
I have gotten this question a couple of times and, uh, especially recently people have asked,

1865
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,700
have I ever tried Alex's product?

1866
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,700
Oh, good god no.

1867
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:11,700
Fuck no.

1868
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,700
And we haven't addressed this in a while.

1869
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,700
No.

1870
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,700
No.

1871
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,700
Nor would I ever.

1872
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,700
No, no, no, no, no.

1873
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:17,700
Other people do those videos.

1874
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,700
You can watch them.

1875
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:19,700
But for us, we're just going to be sad.

1876
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:20,700
Yeah.

1877
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:21,980
We're going to be like, ugh, this is disgusting.

1878
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,980
Why would anybody do this to themselves?

1879
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:23,980
It would be a real bummer.

1880
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,460
And then we would be realizing that we were doing it.

1881
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,260
And then we'd get so sad.

1882
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:32,540
So we come to the end of this and one of the things that I really am pretty insistent on

1883
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:36,620
in my own head is I'm going to be paying more attention to Harrison.

1884
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:39,340
This dude is a real fucking problem.

1885
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:41,300
This dude's a Nazi Nazi.

1886
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:50,260
I mean, the kind of thing that is apparently acceptable conversation on his show is further

1887
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:53,980
than most of the time that you see on Alex's show.

1888
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:57,500
It's outrageous, the kind of things that you'll hear on here.

1889
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:02,900
I did not think I would get to this point, but Harrison brought me here a lot faster

1890
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,700
than I was expecting.

1891
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,740
I miss David Knight.

1892
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:07,740
Yeah.

1893
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:09,340
Boring as hell.

1894
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,700
Boring, but he wasn't a...

1895
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,620
But he knew how to walk that line.

1896
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:19,580
And honestly, I think that, not to be too explicit about my feelings about this, I honestly

1897
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,740
think that this is revealing too much.

1898
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:25,780
I think that this is actually an incredibly bad strategy on their part.

1899
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:30,540
I think that this is bad for Infowars and as such, it appears to be a head poking up

1900
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,460
and I'm going to play whack-a-mole with it.

1901
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:37,740
I'm going to pay more attention to him because I think it's a soft exposed underbelly and

1902
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:42,940
a fucking idiot who doesn't know how to play the game that Alex and Owen Troyer clearly

1903
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,860
play better, where they can shut this stuff down.

1904
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:50,020
They can give the appearance of signaling to these white nationalists and anti-Semites.

1905
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:53,300
Listen, I love your call, but this isn't really the topic that we're going on right now.

1906
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,300
Click next one.

1907
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,300
Yes, absolutely.

1908
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,300
Yep, totally.

1909
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:02,480
Harrison clearly either doesn't have the desire or the ability or the smoothness to be able

1910
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,740
to have all that in the package of his presentation.

1911
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:11,740
And I think that through that we'll probably see a lot of really, really fucked up stuff.

1912
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:17,620
Yeah, we, we, I used to joke about it that one of the reasons that it was edifying to

1913
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:21,480
watch Alex Jones, one of the reasons that we do this show is because Alex was the weakest

1914
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,900
link in the propaganda chain.

1915
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,740
And now Harrison is the weakest link of Infowars.

1916
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,940
Harrison is way weaker than him.

1917
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,940
Harrison's not even a link.

1918
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:29,940
Holy shit.

1919
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:33,660
Harrison's a fucking flower, a dandelion, people twirled into a circle.

1920
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:38,220
So we'll check back in on him from time to time, I'll be trying to pay attention, keep

1921
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:40,620
up with him, as well as Alex.

1922
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:46,340
Monday, hopefully Alex will be back from his grocery store adventure and we'll have a Alex

1923
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,340
Jones episode.

1924
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,700
That's something that's really funny, just to cleanse our-

1925
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:51,700
Sorry, sorry guys.

1926
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,980
We were going to do an Alex episode, but he was at the grocery store.

1927
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:59,880
Just to cleanse our palates after this, we have Stuart Rhodes lying his ass off, Harrison

1928
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,140
fielding calls from outright anti-Semite Nazi types.

1929
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,660
And all the meanwhile, Alex.

1930
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:09,020
Because the state is so frickin' awesome.

1931
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,020
Florida is awesome!

1932
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,020
Yeah, Florida!

1933
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:16,020
And seed the table, the great old farms!

1934
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:20,740
Give it up for all the great crew here, folks!

1935
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,740
Yeah!

1936
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:23,460
Everybody's shopping in this place, it's awesome.

1937
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,580
Alex flew to Florida for three claps.

1938
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,860
Everybody be shopping.

1939
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:34,060
Hey, this seems like a great way to take a vacation while still pretending to work.

1940
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,780
Yeah, and go pay Roger a visit, I'm sure.

1941
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:37,780
Yeah, exactly.

1942
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:38,780
Yeah, yeah.

1943
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,420
Anyway, we'll be back on Monday, but until then Jordan, we have a website.

1944
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,140
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

1945
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,060
Yes, we are also on Twitter.

1946
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,380
We are on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.com, go to bed Jordan!

1947
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,660
Yep, we're also on Facebook.

1948
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:48,660
We are on Facebook!

1949
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:52,900
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1950
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,900
doing God's work right now.

1951
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,860
Yep, we'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX, Clark, I'm Daryl

1952
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:01,940
Arundis, I am the prince of the pan flute.

1953
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:03,940
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

1954
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:08,940
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

1955
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:28,620
I love you.
