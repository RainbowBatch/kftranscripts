N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.440
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.240
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.240 --> 00:29.880
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys in knowledgefight.

00:29.880 --> 00:39.400
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight, I need, I need money.

00:39.400 --> 00:47.160
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy, stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas, it's time to pray.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.480
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.480
Knowledgefight, N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com, I love you.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.480
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.480
I'm Jordan.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.560
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little

01:04.560 --> 01:05.760
bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.040
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
Jordan.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
Dan!

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
Jordan.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
Quick question for you.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
Yep.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.600
My bright spot today is something that I did not know existed and has come into my life

01:14.600 --> 01:20.880
and I'm pretty excited about, and that is hot honey.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.880
I had no idea.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.880
No, refuse.

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
I was at the store.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Oh, what's the point?

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
It's hot.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
I don't understand!

01:27.880 --> 01:32.160
I was at the store, and I saw it on the shelf, and I thought, what the fuck is this?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.880
I'd never heard of it before.

01:33.880 --> 01:39.600
It is honey that's infused with chilis, and so it's spicy, it's so good.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.520
It is so good, because it's like honey, it goes on things, it has that honey-ness to

01:44.520 --> 01:46.760
it, but then also the heat.

01:46.760 --> 01:47.760
It's great.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.760
It is fantastic.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.600
You can add honey to things, mustard, you can add honey to it, you can't have mustard

01:53.600 --> 01:54.600
honey.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
Uh-uh.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.600
No.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
Honey is honey, my friend.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
Honey is honey.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
I'll be right back.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.240
I have strong rules, I have strong opinions about whether or not-

02:01.240 --> 02:04.600
I don't know, man, I think you might come around if you try a little bit of that.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.600
Alright, I probably will.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
I really enjoy that.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.600
It sounds incredible.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.600
It's so good.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.600
Yeah, I believe it.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.800
And, you know, I've only had it on a bagel or two so far, but there's so many things

02:11.800 --> 02:13.600
I want to explore putting it on.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.600
Celine!

02:14.600 --> 02:15.600
Celine, run!

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
Run, Celine!

02:16.600 --> 02:18.600
Get out while you can!

02:18.600 --> 02:19.600
Meow.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.600
Meow.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.600
Come here.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.600
Come here.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.600
Gotta put some honey on you.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
What about you?

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
What's your bright spot?

02:26.600 --> 02:30.640
Celine, my bright spot is also food related.

02:30.640 --> 02:36.840
But okay, now this is going to seem simple, but have you ever had a really good pear,

02:36.840 --> 02:37.840
Dan?

02:37.840 --> 02:38.840
Yeah, I love pears.

02:38.840 --> 02:45.080
Pears are the best, but pears have the shortest period, the shortest window of perfection.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.080
True.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.080
That is true.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.080
They turn pretty quick.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.640
You're always either eating a hard pear or you've waited too long and it's mush.

02:52.640 --> 03:00.000
And yesterday I ate a pear at like the precise five minute window where it was perfect.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
What kind of pear do you like?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Do you like an Anjou?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I like an Anjou pear.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Do you like a Bosc?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm not a Bosc pear guy.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.680
Is that even a kind of pear?

03:06.680 --> 03:07.880
I like it green.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.880
I like it real green.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.320
I don't like the brown pears.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.320
Nuh-uh.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.320
Don't get me into that.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.520
I realized as I started to talk, I don't know other kinds of pears.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.760
I don't even think Bosc is one of them.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.640
No, Boscayot was a pear.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.640
That's...

03:20.640 --> 03:23.360
Yeah, I don't know pears.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.360
Yeah, no.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.920
I do love them though.

03:25.920 --> 03:26.920
Incredible.

03:26.920 --> 03:31.200
Yeah, and I always got a little bit of shade when I was younger, which I'm a little bit...

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
Shade?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.200
Well, I'm a little bit peeved about this.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
Sure.

03:34.200 --> 03:38.000
I'm still actually a little bitter, a little raw, and I got to air my grievances.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.200
Unlike pears.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.040
My dad is a huge fan of Jelly Bellies.

03:43.040 --> 03:47.280
And so the Jelly Bellies were often in the house, jelly beans with all kinds of flavors.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.040
And of course, as you're a kid, people like the toasted marshmallow.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.400
That's the kind of thing that people like.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.440
They like all these candy kind of flavors.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.600
My favorite was the juicy pear.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.600
The juicy pear.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
It was the best.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.920
I thought it was really good, and I took a lot of shit for it.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.920
You took a lot of shit.

04:01.920 --> 04:02.920
Took a lot of shit.

04:02.920 --> 04:03.920
A lot of shit.

04:03.920 --> 04:04.920
To the point where I'm 36 years old.

04:04.920 --> 04:10.360
It's been a long time for you to be remembering the Jelly Belly incident of 1994.

04:10.360 --> 04:13.400
Ugh, dad likes pears.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.120
Left some deep wounds.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.400
Um, yeah, those pears are great.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
Yeah, pears are amazing.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.560
So, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over, a little bit different

04:21.560 --> 04:25.720
than normal, and we'll get into why here in a second, but before we do, let's take a little

04:25.720 --> 04:27.840
moment to say thank you to the folks who have signed up and are supporting the show.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.840
Oh, that's a great idea.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.040
So first, you're going to love this one.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.920
I pooed it on Scalia's pillow.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.520
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.520
I'm a policy wonk.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.280
Thank you very much, American hero.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.800
Next, Dan F. Great name, I know.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
Thank you so much.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
I'm a policy wonk.

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
You're now a policy wonk.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
Thanks, Dan.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
Next, Lingle Bingle.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
Not a policy wonk.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.800
I'm a policy wonk.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.800
Thanks, Lingle Bingle.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
Thank you.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.160
Next, BB Star Stuff.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.160
Thank you so much.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.160
You are now a policy wonk.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.160
I'm a policy wonk.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.080
Thank you, BB Star Stuff.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
Just two B's.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.080
Just two B's?

04:57.080 --> 04:58.140
Not the Better Business Bureau Star Stuff.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.140
No.

04:59.140 --> 05:00.140
Oh, okay.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.140
Sorry.

05:01.140 --> 05:02.140
Next, Zilla.

05:02.140 --> 05:03.140
Thank you so much.

05:03.140 --> 05:04.140
You are now a policy wonk.

05:04.140 --> 05:05.140
I'm a policy wonk.

05:05.140 --> 05:06.140
Thank you, Zilla.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.140
Thank you.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.140
Next, Amara.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.140
Thank you so much.

05:09.140 --> 05:10.140
You are now a policy wonk.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.140
I'm a policy wonk.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.140
Thank you Amara.

05:12.140 --> 05:13.140
Thank you, and City Bird.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.140
Thank you so much.

05:14.140 --> 05:18.460
And then finally, I got a special shout-out, a technocrat shout-out I'm gonna give out

05:18.460 --> 05:24.420
to someone, this is a very special shout-out, Laura's baby needs to arrive now so she can

05:24.420 --> 05:26.100
take maternity leave already!

05:26.100 --> 05:28.360
Wait, hold on, I'm getting an update on this.

05:28.360 --> 05:34.260
Hold on, I think we got that email just an hour ago, is there anything new coming up?

05:34.260 --> 05:37.820
It turns out we have an update, congrats Laura on your baby policy wonk!

05:37.820 --> 05:39.140
I'm a policy wonk!

05:39.140 --> 05:42.260
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew!

05:42.260 --> 05:43.500
How's your 401k doing bro?

05:43.500 --> 05:46.140
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

05:46.140 --> 05:50.000
Let's just get down to business, we ain't making that money off that heroin, why you

05:50.000 --> 05:51.740
pimps so good?

05:51.740 --> 05:56.140
My neck is freakishly large, I declare info war on you!

05:56.140 --> 05:58.460
Congratulations Laura and baby policy wonk!

05:58.460 --> 06:00.020
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.540
And Matt for no reason at all.

06:01.540 --> 06:02.540
Exactly.

06:02.540 --> 06:03.540
But also, thank you.

06:03.540 --> 06:04.540
Thank you very much Matt.

06:04.540 --> 06:08.260
So, before we get into today's episode, I just wanted to make a little bit of a correction

06:08.260 --> 06:09.260
about our last episode.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.260
Sure.

06:10.260 --> 06:14.220
When I spoke, when I was talking about Stefan Molyneux giving that speech, I had said that

06:14.220 --> 06:18.540
that was in New Zealand, and I kind of fucked that up, I conflated two things in my head,

06:18.540 --> 06:22.820
that was actually in Melbourne, Australia, that he gave that speech.

06:22.820 --> 06:26.540
And the reason that I got it mixed up was because when they went on this tour they had

06:26.540 --> 06:29.900
intended to speak in New Zealand, and New Zealand said, fuck no.

06:29.900 --> 06:30.900
Right, right, right.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.700
And that was what I had mixed up in my head, and I apologize, I got that a little bit.

06:34.700 --> 06:39.860
Yeah, it would be, yeah, that's a nice little bit of context to add to that, yeah, sure.

06:39.860 --> 06:40.860
So that was in Australia.

06:40.860 --> 06:41.860
Yeah.

06:41.860 --> 06:46.220
Good on you New Zealand, tell Stefan Molyneux to go fuck himself as much as you like.

06:46.220 --> 06:50.420
So Jordan, today, I felt like it had been a while since we checked in with present day

06:50.420 --> 06:56.580
Alex Jones, and honestly, I was getting pretty happy to have had that break from his uninspired

06:56.580 --> 06:57.580
ass broadcasting.

06:57.580 --> 06:58.580
It's been nice.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.620
I was actually kind of excited though, to get back into the mud and see what his dumb

07:01.620 --> 07:06.980
ass was up to, but wouldn't you know it, I checked back in, and Owen Troyer has been

07:06.980 --> 07:11.860
hosting Alex's show all this week, so there's no new episodes of Alex's stuff to go over.

07:11.860 --> 07:12.860
Wow.

07:12.860 --> 07:17.780
As it turns out, Alex has taken off for another workcation, this time heading up to Florida

07:17.780 --> 07:22.580
to cover what he calls a mask rebellion that's taking place at a grocery store in the city

07:22.580 --> 07:23.580
of Naples.

07:23.580 --> 07:24.580
Okay.

07:24.580 --> 07:29.380
The store is called Oak's Farm Seed to Table, and Alex may or may not be broadcasting many

07:29.380 --> 07:32.620
special reports from live inside the store.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.340
Here is a little clip.

07:34.340 --> 07:37.300
As the state is so frickin' awesome.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.300
Florida is awesome!

07:39.300 --> 07:41.620
Yeah, Florida!

07:41.620 --> 07:48.300
And Seed to Table, the great Oak Farms, give it up for all the great crew here, folks.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.300
Yeah!

07:49.300 --> 07:50.300
Everybody's shopping in this place.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.300
It's awesome.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.020
You can hear about like two people climbing in the background.

07:54.020 --> 07:55.020
It's sad.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.020
Yeah.

07:56.020 --> 07:57.020
That's a long drop.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.700
That's a long drop for Alex Jones.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.700
Oh yeah.

07:59.700 --> 08:04.860
I see you guys in southern Illinois at the American Legion where they're holding a mask

08:04.860 --> 08:06.980
drive for no one.

08:06.980 --> 08:13.300
Now if I play my cards right, I might be able to go to a car dealership opening and record

08:13.300 --> 08:14.300
live.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.300
Alright, wow.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.300
Oh boy.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.100
So the situation with this grocery store is actually kind of funny.

08:19.100 --> 08:24.180
It's actually not in the city of Naples, technically, and if it were, it would not have a mask mandate

08:24.180 --> 08:28.220
because the Naples city council decided against imposing one, preferring instead to just make

08:28.220 --> 08:30.100
it a thing they strongly recommend.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.700
However, this store is in North Naples, which is about five miles north of city limits,

08:34.700 --> 08:38.580
and is subject to the jurisdiction of the county, in this case Collier County, who do

08:38.580 --> 08:40.860
have a mask mandate in place.

08:40.860 --> 08:45.140
As such, the store's owner, Alfie Oakes, has been waging a protracted campaign against

08:45.140 --> 08:49.100
masks since he feels like this COVID-19 stuff is a hoax.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.100
Sure.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.060
I poked around this story a bit, and honestly, it's kind of cookie cutter.

08:53.060 --> 08:56.740
It's a Republican business owner making a mini-celebrity of himself in the anti-mask

08:56.740 --> 08:59.260
game, and there's not much more to it.

08:59.260 --> 09:02.620
Everything is about what you'd expect, all the way down to him calling George Floyd a

09:02.620 --> 09:08.160
quote disgraceful career criminal after he was killed, and saying that Black Lives Matter

09:08.160 --> 09:09.160
is a hoax.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.160
Alright.

09:10.160 --> 09:14.080
That led to the Lee's County school district severing their contract with him, which prompted

09:14.080 --> 09:19.220
Oakes to sue the school district for $50 million, claiming as all bigots do, that their free

09:19.220 --> 09:20.340
speech had been violated.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.060
Oh yes, of course.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.160
I don't know what his contract with the school district said, but if they had a clause in

09:25.160 --> 09:29.220
there about being able to terminate the contract for cause, I don't think this is a free speech

09:29.220 --> 09:30.220
issue.

09:30.220 --> 09:33.940
In fact, I would assume that since he's a staunch conservative, Alfie should be in favor

09:33.940 --> 09:36.900
of the school district being able to practice free association.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.580
Rules for others and not for me!

09:39.580 --> 09:42.380
They shouldn't be forced to retain business ties with someone they're opposed to being

09:42.380 --> 09:43.380
connected to?

09:43.380 --> 09:45.380
Rules for others and not for me!

09:45.380 --> 09:49.560
Anyway, I don't particularly care about Alfie Oakes, nor do I care too much about Alex's

09:49.560 --> 09:55.500
very transparent attempt to vampirically feast on the attention Oakes is getting at the moment.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.660
If Alex had done, like, a whole show from the grocery store, then you might be dealing

09:59.660 --> 10:01.140
with an excited Dan.

10:01.140 --> 10:04.420
But as it stands, this is just too little to get worked up about.

10:04.420 --> 10:08.020
It's really funny to imagine, though, going into a Whole Foods or a Jewel and just trying

10:08.020 --> 10:11.660
to get some produce and you hear a guy yelling about the UN trying to kill the children while

10:11.660 --> 10:12.660
you're shopping.

10:12.660 --> 10:18.060
Yeah, I can't get the image out of my head of Alex and Owen on Supermarket Sweep together,

10:18.060 --> 10:20.100
and boy, that'd be great.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.100
Get the turkey!

10:21.100 --> 10:22.100
Grind the beans, Owen!

10:22.100 --> 10:24.100
Fill it up with the meats!

10:24.100 --> 10:26.020
Get the beans!

10:26.020 --> 10:32.180
I don't feel like that would elevate my customer experience if Alex is broadcasting live.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.180
Probably not.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.180
Probably not.

10:34.180 --> 10:37.840
So I set out to find an episode to make for the good people out there to enjoy, and as

10:37.840 --> 10:42.200
luck would have it, while Alex has been in Florida, he paid a visit to a podcast in Miami

10:42.200 --> 10:44.220
called Flagrant 2.

10:44.220 --> 10:47.620
I watched this, thinking maybe it would be good to cover, and it's just embarrassing.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.300
Is that a basketball podcast?

10:49.300 --> 10:52.480
No, that's the Flagrant Ones.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.080
That is a real podcast, the Flagrant Ones.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.740
The guys from Hollywood Handbook and Carl Tarr.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.740
Oh, okay.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.740
They do a podcast called the Flagrant Ones.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.300
Yeah, well, Flagrant 2 is the...

10:59.300 --> 11:04.580
No, because they're talking about this being like flagrantly free speech, offensive, talking...

11:04.580 --> 11:06.140
It's comics talking!

11:06.140 --> 11:07.140
Oh my god.

11:07.140 --> 11:08.140
It's comics talking, man.

11:08.140 --> 11:09.140
Get out of here.

11:09.140 --> 11:10.140
It's flagrant.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.640
You're not funny if you're doing that.

11:11.640 --> 11:16.140
I watched it, thinking maybe it would be good, like I said, but I got nothing.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.700
Alex is so fucked up that it's not even fun.

11:18.700 --> 11:22.840
The guy who's throwing hatchets on Christmas Eve at his own cameras in his own studio is

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
fun.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.500
The guy who's trying, he's just trashed annoying Rob Do about the ways to learn and a crystal

11:28.500 --> 11:30.780
skull covered in semen is fun.

11:30.780 --> 11:31.780
Hilarious.

11:31.780 --> 11:32.780
This is not fun.

11:32.780 --> 11:33.780
It's sad.

11:33.780 --> 11:37.240
There was a moment in the interview that Alex did a while back with Logan Paul where one

11:37.240 --> 11:41.700
of Logan's friends commented to Alex that he had a quote heavy pour when he was getting

11:41.700 --> 11:43.440
another glass of booze.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.300
The tone wasn't like, hey, cool pour, man.

11:46.300 --> 11:50.340
It had a touch of concern in it, like telling Alex to slow down.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.620
This interview has the opposite vibe, where the hosts are laughing their asses off and

11:53.620 --> 11:57.460
just celebrating how basically incoherent Alex is becoming.

11:57.460 --> 12:02.180
Alex lies to the host's face about things like Sandy Hook and his position on reparations,

12:02.180 --> 12:07.320
illustrating that these hosts do absolutely no show prep before interviewing propagandists.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.620
At the end of the thing, one of the hosts has a list of questions for Alex, like, was

12:10.620 --> 12:20.300
9-11 a part-time job, which should give you some sense of the value and comedic merit

12:20.300 --> 12:22.180
of this show.

12:22.180 --> 12:26.180
The interview was so bad that I don't even think that it rises to the level of deserving

12:26.180 --> 12:27.180
criticism.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.240
Like the only thing that I heard in it that I thought was interesting was Alex really

12:30.240 --> 12:33.420
drunk trying to explain why we need to cut off all foreign aid.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.420
Okay.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.420
I'm like, wait, hold on.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.420
Now we're back on all foreign aid now?

12:37.420 --> 12:39.060
What did this happen?

12:39.060 --> 12:40.060
Yeah.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.980
Well, Ron Paul still lives in his drunken soul.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.060
Yeah, right?

12:44.060 --> 12:49.760
There's also a very, very just depressing stretch where Alex is really drunk and he

12:49.760 --> 12:51.340
tries to call Rogan a few times.

12:51.340 --> 12:53.280
He's like, let's get Rogan on the phone.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.560
And Joe doesn't answer.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.560
It's such a mess.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.380
It's not worthwhile as an episode.

12:57.380 --> 12:58.380
Brutal.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.140
So I was trying to figure out like, what are we going to do?

13:00.140 --> 13:03.140
And then I remember, oh, that's right.

13:03.140 --> 13:05.500
There's another motherfucker I've been meaning to talk about.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.500
Oh shit.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.260
I haven't gotten a chance very often.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.700
That motherfucker is named Harrison Smith.

13:10.700 --> 13:14.860
Oh no, we're doing white nationalist happy hour with Harrison Smith in the mornings?

13:14.860 --> 13:16.740
Host of the American journal.

13:16.740 --> 13:17.740
Oh boy.

13:17.740 --> 13:18.740
Harrison Smith.

13:18.740 --> 13:23.220
He had caught my eye a while back because of, first of all, his gleeful, the Patriots

13:23.220 --> 13:24.580
have taken over the Capitol.

13:24.580 --> 13:25.580
We won guys.

13:25.580 --> 13:26.580
We did it.

13:26.580 --> 13:30.740
And then also just listening to some of his shows, they'll be like, this is pretty overt

13:30.740 --> 13:31.740
shit man.

13:31.740 --> 13:32.740
Yeah.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.580
This is pretty, this is pretty a biggity.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.580
And so I decided I'm going to get back in, see what he's been up to.

13:38.580 --> 13:42.060
I didn't think that this was a possibility for a while cause he's been gone.

13:42.060 --> 13:43.660
He just had a paternity leave.

13:43.660 --> 13:45.020
Oh, he just had a baby.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.860
Congratulations Harrison.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.860
And he's been gone.

13:47.860 --> 13:54.020
So Rob Dew had been hosting and Tom Papert had been hosting and boy, no good.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.180
But now Harrison's back.

13:56.180 --> 14:01.200
Do white nationalists have to scream like, take that great replacement every time they

14:01.200 --> 14:02.200
have a kid?

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
Probably.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.020
In the living room, whenever the kid comes out, they're like, it's breaching.

14:06.020 --> 14:09.300
They have to be like, take that great replacement theory.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.580
At very least they make a little fun jokes with their partners.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.140
Won't replace this one.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.140
All right.

14:15.140 --> 14:16.140
Hey, here we go.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.140
You don't love me anymore.

14:17.140 --> 14:18.140
Okay.

14:18.140 --> 14:22.580
Um, so we, uh, there's one particular reason that I decided to actually look at this particular

14:22.580 --> 14:25.460
episode just March 10th and it turns out I fucked up.

14:25.460 --> 14:29.060
So we're actually going to have to listen to another thing, but here is the beginning

14:29.060 --> 14:34.700
of March 10th, still got some good fucking music.

14:34.700 --> 14:40.660
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, you're watching American general info wars.com band.video.

14:40.660 --> 14:44.300
What a day full of news I have for you today.

14:44.300 --> 14:49.900
And at the end of this program at around 10 30 central standard time, Alex Jones will

14:49.900 --> 14:55.620
be taking over the broadcast from his outpost in the state of Florida, a grocery store.

14:55.620 --> 15:00.580
Very excited to bring a lot of information to you to take your calls as well.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.500
And we do have a new sale at info war store.com.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.740
I'll give you that information very shortly, but first let us begin as we always do with

15:06.740 --> 15:08.180
our daily dispatch.

15:08.180 --> 15:09.980
Roll the stinger, please.

15:09.980 --> 15:13.580
What he's got sound effects.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.580
Wow.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.900
We're doing got a fax machine getting in the headlights.

15:17.900 --> 15:18.900
All right.

15:18.900 --> 15:19.900
Okay.

15:19.900 --> 15:20.900
All right.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.780
So this is directed by Quentin Tarantino and there's a fax machine.

15:22.780 --> 15:23.780
That's all I know.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.940
William Fear bringing us in the king of the pan flute.

15:26.940 --> 15:27.940
Still love it.

15:27.940 --> 15:31.780
I don't care if that's the, if that's like intro music for like the beginning of the

15:31.780 --> 15:32.780
show.

15:32.780 --> 15:33.780
It's mellow as hell.

15:33.780 --> 15:36.740
I think I pointed this out after our last time we talked about him, but I still enjoy

15:36.740 --> 15:37.740
it.

15:37.740 --> 15:38.740
Yeah, no, it's great.

15:38.740 --> 15:42.540
But, uh, you know, isn't that the song that bill dies to and kill bill volume two or something?

15:42.540 --> 15:45.060
So it's in kill bill, kill bill at least.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.180
And that's why he knows the song.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.180
Well, of course.

15:47.180 --> 15:52.020
But, um, the thing I think is really interesting is like that, like beep, beep, beep, beep,

15:52.020 --> 15:53.020
beep.

15:53.020 --> 15:59.820
The thing is like, okay, you're, you're showing the barest bones, uh, attempt at craft.

15:59.820 --> 16:00.820
Yeah.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.860
And that's interesting because no one else really tries that is fair.

16:03.860 --> 16:07.220
And then he just goes on to like read off headlines and I don't really share.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.340
It's a very boring segment.

16:09.340 --> 16:15.420
So, um, he, uh, at the beginning of this episode, he has a quite a pronouncement in today's

16:15.420 --> 16:16.420
program.

16:16.420 --> 16:19.780
I'll be laying out what I think is a rather convincing argument for the fact that we are

16:19.780 --> 16:27.500
rapidly racing towards a conflict that I would call world war three, the battle lines are

16:27.500 --> 16:29.060
being drawn.

16:29.060 --> 16:35.620
And we're seeing a lot of posturing that portends great devastation in our future has to do

16:35.620 --> 16:46.800
with China, Iran, and the Western powers aligning themselves against, uh, those, those bad countries.

16:46.800 --> 16:47.800
We're the good guys.

16:47.800 --> 16:53.100
The new development that is also a Harrison clearly hasn't gotten the memo according to

16:53.100 --> 16:56.960
his anti communist buddies like Alex, world war three already happened.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.340
The cold war was world war three and some even think that the Iraq war is turned into

17:00.340 --> 17:01.440
world war four.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.260
So if there's another one coming, Harrison should be calling it world war five.

17:04.260 --> 17:08.140
I thought we were still fighting world war two since Nazis still seem to be the bad guys

17:08.140 --> 17:09.140
in this case.

17:09.140 --> 17:11.640
I think that him using world war three sounds a lot more exciting.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.180
So I merely understand why Harrison would just go ahead and stick with that branding

17:15.180 --> 17:18.900
scaremongering.

17:18.900 --> 17:25.700
So not only does Alfie Oaks think that, uh, you know, George Floyd, you know, was a criminal

17:25.700 --> 17:29.540
and blah, blah, blah, Harrison has some thoughts.

17:29.540 --> 17:36.580
Meanwhile the election of, or the, uh, uh, trial rather of George Floyd continues to

17:36.580 --> 17:43.500
move forward and, uh, more revelations are being made, uh, releasing of the autopsy report

17:43.500 --> 17:51.900
has revealed massive amounts of drugs in his system and as they say, no injuries that would

17:51.900 --> 17:52.900
lead to death.

17:52.900 --> 17:57.780
In other words, Jeffrey Epstein may not have killed himself, but it looks like George Floyd

17:57.780 --> 17:58.780
did.

17:58.780 --> 17:59.780
This is nonsense.

17:59.780 --> 18:02.820
There aren't revelations coming out about the case at this point because the trial was

18:02.820 --> 18:05.440
still in the jury selection phase.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.140
The coroner's report and autopsy information that the public has access to is the exact

18:09.140 --> 18:13.860
same information we've had for like six months and it doesn't show what Harrison is claiming.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.740
He's pretending that there's a new piece of information that's come out that verifies

18:16.740 --> 18:20.100
his preexisting talking points because he knows that no one in the audience demands

18:20.100 --> 18:24.520
better and they already believe that George Floyd's death is no big deal.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.140
The Washington Post had an article about the upcoming trial on March 10th and here's what

18:28.140 --> 18:32.980
they had to say, quote, when Chauvin's trial for his alleged role in Floyd's tragic death

18:32.980 --> 18:38.140
begins, much of the argument will center instead on the autopsy details, most specifically

18:38.140 --> 18:42.700
whether fentanyl and underlying health conditions, not the police officer's actions, stopped

18:42.700 --> 18:44.660
Floyd's heart and lungs.

18:44.660 --> 18:49.020
Seven experts in toxicology, cardiology, and illegal drug use consulted by the Washington

18:49.020 --> 18:53.260
Post largely disagreed with that idea, most of them strenuously.

18:53.260 --> 18:56.900
All but one said the autopsy findings and other court documents coupled with the well-known

18:56.900 --> 19:02.060
chain of events that evening made death by fentanyl overdose unlikely to impossible.

19:02.060 --> 19:06.340
And the other one was just Rudy Giuliani wearing a doctor's coat, right?

19:06.340 --> 19:09.260
Experts who have weighed in on the matter are pretty clear that what happened to Floyd

19:09.260 --> 19:13.460
doesn't resemble what happens in cases of opiate overdose, which is why no one on the

19:13.460 --> 19:16.840
scene administered naloxone, which they did have it.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.580
They had the drug that would be used in the case of an opiate.

19:19.580 --> 19:20.580
They have to.

19:20.580 --> 19:21.580
Yeah.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.460
The overwhelming consensus is that though there were drugs in his system, drugs were

19:24.460 --> 19:26.940
not the cause of George Floyd's death.

19:26.940 --> 19:32.420
As the WAPO article points out, this defense is one that police use all the time when they

19:32.420 --> 19:33.420
kill people.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.420
Abuse all the time.

19:34.420 --> 19:38.540
Yeah, it's what they did in the case of the Rodney King beating, when it was alleged that

19:38.540 --> 19:42.940
King was on PCP, and that made him such a threat that it justified the police's actions.

19:42.940 --> 19:43.940
Totally.

19:43.940 --> 19:48.540
This is just something that they do, and this is Harrison Smith essentially just, you know,

19:48.540 --> 19:55.340
taking defense arguments uncritically, and then also toeing the line for just sort of

19:55.340 --> 19:57.540
like exactly what cops say all the time.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:59.540 --> 20:04.780
And it's weird how people are trying to litigate this, like the NFL tries to litigate what

20:04.780 --> 20:09.660
a catch is, you know, like, oh, you got to get all the way, and you have to take one

20:09.660 --> 20:14.140
step forward for it to be a catch, and you have to make a football move, whatever the

20:14.140 --> 20:17.620
fuck it is, you know, and it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:17.620 --> 20:20.960
George Floyd is dead because of Derek Chauvin and his buddies.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
The end.

20:21.960 --> 20:27.020
There's no, there's no, you can talk about how much, you know, it's like, did he murder

20:27.020 --> 20:28.020
him?

20:28.020 --> 20:29.020
Premeditated.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.020
Did he do all that stuff?

20:30.020 --> 20:32.340
But no, he was dead because of those guys.

20:32.340 --> 20:33.340
The end.

20:33.340 --> 20:38.700
And it appears that even if there were some sort of a, like, I'm not saying this is the

20:38.700 --> 20:45.780
case, but if there, like this argument that is being made by Harrison were even true,

20:45.780 --> 20:51.100
then you still have negligent homicide on the part of these cops who would have had

20:51.100 --> 20:56.500
a responsibility to address the medical condition that was supposedly happening.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.620
Cops are supposed to keep people alive now?

20:58.620 --> 20:59.980
That's their job, Dan.

20:59.980 --> 21:00.980
Protecting and serving?

21:00.980 --> 21:04.340
I don't understand those words at all when applied to cops.

21:04.340 --> 21:05.340
Cool.

21:05.340 --> 21:07.300
So this show starts out a little bit slow.

21:07.300 --> 21:12.040
I know Harrison has declared that World War III is upon us, and I gotta be honest, I didn't

21:12.040 --> 21:18.100
make it to him explaining that if he did, because I got sidetracked.

21:18.100 --> 21:22.060
Honestly, on Info Wars, World War III is a slow news day.

21:22.060 --> 21:23.060
Yeah.

21:23.060 --> 21:27.540
And this is, this is just like, there's like scattershot headlines until he goes to calls.

21:27.540 --> 21:31.340
And here's another one of these, these little petty complaints he has.

21:31.340 --> 21:34.220
This one's about Biden not giving enough press conferences.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.220
Oh no.

21:35.220 --> 21:40.860
You can only imagine if President Trump had dared to go 50 days without taking questions

21:40.860 --> 21:41.860
from the press.

21:41.860 --> 21:42.860
Can you imagine that?

21:42.860 --> 21:45.940
I mean, they'd be impeaching him already for this.

21:45.940 --> 21:49.900
In February 2020, it was reported that it had been over 300 days since Trump had had

21:49.900 --> 21:51.120
a formal press briefing.

21:51.120 --> 21:54.260
So Harrison can go ahead and shove that stupid tone of his up his own ass.

21:54.260 --> 21:55.740
Yeah, I was going to say, go fuck yourself.

21:55.740 --> 22:00.660
Yeah, to make matters worse, ABC News reported in September 2019 that not only had Trump

22:00.660 --> 22:04.960
not done these press conferences, but it had been, quote, six months since a White House

22:04.960 --> 22:09.900
press secretary last came to the podium in a briefing room to field questions from reporters.

22:09.900 --> 22:13.100
Yeah, and if Biden had done that, that, wait, what?

22:13.100 --> 22:17.500
I do think that Biden should face criticism for not having press conferences enough or

22:17.500 --> 22:22.140
yet, since I think it would, you know, it's a helpful piece of moving forward.

22:22.140 --> 22:25.760
And I directed the same criticism at Trump when he was doing the same thing, because

22:25.760 --> 22:29.800
I think the transparency and availability to the public is a good thing to encourage

22:29.800 --> 22:31.120
in our leadership.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.860
Harrison and Infowars don't really have any underlying beliefs.

22:33.860 --> 22:38.060
They just attack their predetermined enemies and glorify whoever they like at the moment,

22:38.060 --> 22:40.540
regardless if they're doing the same things.

22:40.540 --> 22:44.560
They'll pretend that their hero didn't actually do what the villain is now doing.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.840
But worse, not long ago, because if they did acknowledge that, they'd have to explain why

22:48.840 --> 22:52.420
it wasn't a big deal for them when Trump did the same thing that they're so upset Biden

22:52.420 --> 22:53.420
is doing now.

22:53.420 --> 22:54.860
And that would unravel the game.

22:54.860 --> 22:59.280
It would really make things difficult if you had to have sort of like a consistent position

22:59.280 --> 23:00.820
throughout your whole.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.100
That would really fuck up the game.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.380
Yeah, it would be tough.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.860
Yeah, they'd be out of business.

23:04.860 --> 23:10.860
You know what, maybe, maybe there's something to this not having press conferences.

23:10.860 --> 23:11.860
Right.

23:11.860 --> 23:15.100
Perhaps again, we can take another lesson from this, which is this is maybe what Trump

23:15.100 --> 23:16.420
should have done.

23:16.420 --> 23:20.860
Maybe they just cut off the press and you just do whatever the hell you want without

23:20.860 --> 23:23.500
taking questions, without accepting criticism.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.900
Harrison, you're in luck.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.620
Harrison, I have got great news for you.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.260
I've got great news.

23:29.260 --> 23:35.100
You can get rid of the maybe you can get rid of the what if this is so dumb.

23:35.100 --> 23:40.020
You are talking about a thing a man has done recently.

23:40.020 --> 23:44.660
And if I recall, your network celebrated extensively.

23:44.660 --> 23:45.860
Yeah.

23:45.860 --> 23:47.220
So anyway, Trump is out of office.

23:47.220 --> 23:50.600
But there's someone else who's in office that I think that Infowars is warming up to quite

23:50.600 --> 23:51.600
a bit.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.820
And that person is Marjorie Taylor Greene.

23:53.820 --> 23:56.680
And with that, I'd like to go to another video here.

23:56.680 --> 24:05.860
It's Marjorie Taylor Greene talking on the floor of the Congress yesterday talking about

24:05.860 --> 24:12.860
House Resolution 8 and House Resolution 1446 gun control legislation.

24:12.860 --> 24:16.840
So it's really cool to see them warming up to Marjorie Taylor Greene definitely wouldn't

24:16.840 --> 24:21.020
have suspected that was the inevitable destination of the path that begins with hero worshipping

24:21.020 --> 24:22.020
Ron Paul.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.020
Yeah.

24:23.020 --> 24:27.840
Anyway, HR 8 is about expanding background checks for people purchasing guns.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.340
The other bill they're talking about is meant to close what's known as the Charleston loophole,

24:32.340 --> 24:36.720
named after the 2015 shooting because it was how Dylan Roof was able to purchase the guns

24:36.720 --> 24:41.720
that he used to kill nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.420
He shouldn't have been able to pass a gun background check, but he did because of this

24:45.420 --> 24:46.420
loophole.

24:46.420 --> 24:50.660
See, when you go to buy a gun, your name is run through the National Instant Criminal

24:50.660 --> 24:55.180
Background Check System, which should provide a yes or no result within minutes.

24:55.180 --> 25:00.680
However, in some cases, the automated system runs into complications and can't make a determination.

25:00.680 --> 25:05.460
In these cases, the FBI who run the system have three days to provide a yes or no to

25:05.460 --> 25:06.460
the gun seller.

25:06.460 --> 25:10.420
And if they fail to give a determination in that time, the seller gets to decide if they

25:10.420 --> 25:12.020
sell the guns or not.

25:12.020 --> 25:15.420
And you better believe they almost always do, because they're selling guns.

25:15.420 --> 25:23.260
Yeah, I do appreciate that guns operate under the same laws as pumpkins that turn into carriages.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.360
Yeah.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.360
This bill that Harrison's complaining about would change that window from three days to

25:28.360 --> 25:33.780
ten days to hopefully provide more oversight that would stop things like future Dylan Roofs

25:33.780 --> 25:36.300
having easy access to guns.

25:36.300 --> 25:41.860
Consider this stat from a report put out by the Center for American Progress, quote, in

25:41.860 --> 25:46.740
2018, 4,240 background checks were denied nationwide after the three-day investigation

25:46.740 --> 25:48.580
period elapsed.

25:48.580 --> 25:55.000
In at least 3,960 of those cases, a gun was sold to the prohibited buyer at the discretion

25:55.000 --> 25:59.920
of the dealer, requiring officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and

25:59.920 --> 26:04.560
Explosives to attempt to retrieve these guns from individuals with a potentially dangerous

26:04.560 --> 26:05.560
criminal history.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.020
This loophole results in tons of people who shouldn't be allowed to have guns getting

26:09.020 --> 26:13.260
guns, which poses a bit of a threat and also creates a ton of work and expense for the

26:13.260 --> 26:19.460
ATF to try and correct the mistakes caused by a clearly too short window of time being

26:19.460 --> 26:22.500
given for these background check systems to provide an answer.

26:22.500 --> 26:31.940
I am really confused as to what situations require a gun so fast that we cannot wait

26:31.940 --> 26:33.780
for the FBI to give a determination.

26:33.780 --> 26:39.980
I mean, three days or ten days or a year, what do you need a gun for now?

26:39.980 --> 26:44.020
If someone's barging into your house, you need a gun immediately, perhaps.

26:44.020 --> 26:48.020
The background check delay isn't going to help you one way or another whether it exists

26:48.020 --> 26:49.020
or not.

26:49.020 --> 26:50.020
It doesn't seem like it.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.020
No.

26:51.020 --> 26:53.860
And if you miss out on hunting season this year, I feel like that's your fault.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.540
You should have gone two weeks earlier.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.260
You could have gone two weeks earlier.

26:57.260 --> 26:58.260
Not a problem.

26:58.260 --> 26:59.260
Yeah.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.500
I don't know.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.660
I think that both of these bills are completely sensible, so it's great to see Harrison try

27:04.660 --> 27:08.580
to attack them by not discussing the bills in detail at all and relying on a video of

27:08.580 --> 27:11.940
a QAnon weirdo in Congress to make his argument for him.

27:11.940 --> 27:12.940
This is just pathetic.

27:12.940 --> 27:13.940
It's all you need to do.

27:13.940 --> 27:14.940
This is outrageously dumb.

27:14.940 --> 27:20.060
I'm going to go to a recording I made of Marjorie Taylor Greene's remarks on the house floor.

27:20.060 --> 27:26.220
She made a bit of a better argument than that.

27:26.220 --> 27:27.220
Did she?

27:27.220 --> 27:28.220
I think so.

27:28.220 --> 27:34.140
Um, Harrison, uh, is, uh, wanting to go to calls, but there's not enough calls.

27:34.140 --> 27:37.780
And I would suspect that this is because Rob Doo fucked up his show.

27:37.780 --> 27:39.340
I need this phone line full.

27:39.340 --> 27:40.580
We got empty spaces here.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.740
I'm not used to seeing this.

27:42.740 --> 27:47.660
I was hosting American Journal for a little over a month.

27:47.660 --> 27:48.780
Full phone lines the whole time.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.140
I go away for two weeks.

27:50.140 --> 27:51.980
Take care of my new baby boy.

27:51.980 --> 27:52.980
Come back.

27:52.980 --> 27:53.980
Nobody's calling in.

27:53.980 --> 27:54.980
This is unacceptable, folks.

27:54.980 --> 27:55.980
I need your help.

27:55.980 --> 27:57.900
I can't do this show by myself.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.700
I need the info warriors calling in.

27:59.700 --> 28:06.620
I suspect what we're going to learn about some of these callers, I have a very strong

28:06.620 --> 28:12.220
theory about why calls might have dropped out whenever Harrison left and was on vacation.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.540
Because Rob Doo was like, no Nazis, please.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.540
Yes.

28:15.540 --> 28:16.540
Yeah.

28:16.540 --> 28:17.540
That was, that was, that sounds right.

28:17.540 --> 28:18.540
I have a hunch.

28:18.540 --> 28:19.540
That sounds right.

28:19.540 --> 28:20.540
Yeah.

28:20.540 --> 28:21.540
Excuse me.

28:21.540 --> 28:24.020
Could you please get rid of everybody who says code words for Jew?

28:24.020 --> 28:25.020
I'm going to have to hang up.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.020
The phone lines are empty.

28:26.020 --> 28:27.020
Yeah.

28:27.020 --> 28:28.020
Oh my God.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.020
What happened?

28:29.020 --> 28:30.020
Yup.

28:30.020 --> 28:32.580
So we get to this first caller and I just think he's weird.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.900
I think this is a weird dude.

28:33.900 --> 28:36.060
And with that, we will go to our first call.

28:36.060 --> 28:39.820
We have Andy in California wants to talk about the upcoming Passover.

28:39.820 --> 28:41.080
Thanks for calling in Andy.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.080
You're on the air.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.080
Uh, hi.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.080
Can you hear me?

28:44.080 --> 28:45.080
All right.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.080
I can hear you fine.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.080
Thanks for calling in.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
All right.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.080
Thank you for having the show.

28:49.080 --> 28:59.540
Um, yeah, this year I noticed that the Easter and Passover on the same day, April 4th, interesting.

28:59.540 --> 29:00.540
No, it's not.

29:00.540 --> 29:01.540
Yeah.

29:01.540 --> 29:02.540
No, it's not.

29:02.540 --> 29:03.540
Harrison.

29:03.540 --> 29:10.980
When you look at the book of Deuteronomy chapter 38, it talks about the blessing of God will

29:10.980 --> 29:19.140
give you if you follow his ways and the second half of the chapter is, uh, all of the curses

29:19.140 --> 29:21.660
that'll happen if you go after straight gods.

29:21.660 --> 29:22.660
Right.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.660
Right.

29:23.660 --> 29:29.280
And, uh, sounds like a real shitty God to me, this star being, uh, not anything really

29:29.280 --> 29:34.100
to do with God's law, uh, a Phoenician fertility goddess.

29:34.100 --> 29:40.180
It's just kind of like slapped my face like, wow, maybe this is one of our chances to maybe

29:40.180 --> 29:41.180
get it right.

29:41.180 --> 29:46.260
Uh, before it gets any worse, because if you look at everything you guys talk about and

29:46.260 --> 29:54.100
what we're looking at in the world today, uh, it fits those curses, uh, I mean, perfectly,

29:54.100 --> 30:01.140
and it's not, uh, satanic organization or whatnot that are doing it.

30:01.140 --> 30:06.060
It's it's, well, I mean, they might have a chain in it, but God definitely allows it

30:06.060 --> 30:09.060
to happen.

30:09.060 --> 30:13.340
So in case you want to learn something, uh, or Harrison, if you're listening, Easter and

30:13.340 --> 30:18.020
Passover are both religious observances that don't involve specific dates on our calendars.

30:18.020 --> 30:22.580
Christmas, for instance, like that's always observed on December 25th, because it's tied

30:22.580 --> 30:23.900
to our calendar.

30:23.900 --> 30:27.980
Easter and Passover, however, are both observed based on the lunar calendar, which results

30:27.980 --> 30:33.180
in the holidays lining up with different dates every year, according to our Gregorian calendar.

30:33.180 --> 30:37.140
Easter is always the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring and last you're

30:37.140 --> 30:40.860
following the Eastern Orthodox tradition, which is an issue that's too complicated to

30:40.860 --> 30:44.380
get into, because Harrison and this caller aren't even touching on that aspect of things.

30:44.380 --> 30:49.500
Ah, I want to get into it now, because I've had a lot to, I've been quarreling with the

30:49.500 --> 30:52.180
Eastern Orthodox about this for a long time, Dale.

30:52.180 --> 30:54.660
Well, I'm going to leave you to that.

30:54.660 --> 30:58.700
Passover is based on the Hebrew calendar, which in turn is lunar-based, and begins in

30:58.700 --> 31:02.140
the middle of the Hebrew month of Nisan and lasts a week.

31:02.140 --> 31:05.260
Typically, because of how these dates are determined, they'll end up being very close

31:05.260 --> 31:09.900
to each other, and very often, Easter does fall within the week of Passover.

31:09.900 --> 31:15.180
This year, Easter is on the last day of Passover, April 4th, which I guess this caller thinks

31:15.180 --> 31:17.700
means something nefarious, I don't know.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.620
It's very interesting, according to Harrison Smith.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.420
This is Blood Moons all over again.

31:21.420 --> 31:25.020
Yeah, it's 100% Blood Moons racist shit, what are we doing?

31:25.020 --> 31:28.240
The more important aspect of this caller, I think, is how much he's internalized the

31:28.240 --> 31:31.020
underlying message of a lot of Alex's rhetoric.

31:31.020 --> 31:35.300
There are demons out there, sure, but the curses that are plaguing everyone are the

31:35.300 --> 31:39.740
result of God letting this stuff happen, because you aren't good enough for him to protect.

31:39.740 --> 31:43.560
This is the messaging of cults, and it's very present in Alex's content, with his regular

31:43.560 --> 31:47.700
outbursts about how the world deserves to burn for things like allowing abortions.

31:47.700 --> 31:48.700
Yeah.

31:48.700 --> 31:49.700
It's ridiculous.

31:49.700 --> 31:54.500
Yep, yep, if all of us don't act in perfect accord, well, all of us will be killed.

31:54.500 --> 31:58.700
Look, God's going to lift his protection, and there you go, here come, here comes, and

31:58.700 --> 31:59.700
it's your fault.

31:59.700 --> 32:04.820
God operates under the same laws as, like, a teacher, and if you're a student who didn't

32:04.820 --> 32:07.980
bring enough gum for the class, well, everybody gets punished.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.700
Nobody gets any gum, and you all get sent to hell.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.500
Everybody knows that that's the way God works.

32:12.500 --> 32:16.340
Yeah, and conceivably, it's your fault, as an individual, because you didn't-

32:16.340 --> 32:17.660
Should've brought more gum to the class.

32:17.660 --> 32:21.980
Well, but what is bringing gum to the class a metaphor for, in this case?

32:21.980 --> 32:24.660
Basically setting up a religiously ordered society?

32:24.660 --> 32:25.660
Exactly.

32:25.660 --> 32:26.660
Basically setting up a theocracy?

32:26.660 --> 32:32.060
A theocracy, you should have overthrown the teacher, brutally deposed her and murdered

32:32.060 --> 32:36.100
her, and then God would have showered you with all the gum in the world, Dan.

32:36.100 --> 32:40.420
Yeah, it's a little bit worrying when you start to think about the ramifications of

32:40.420 --> 32:42.620
internalizing the blame for God's wrath.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.740
It is a little bit of a problem, yeah.

32:44.740 --> 32:45.740
Gets you into trouble.

32:45.740 --> 32:48.900
So, Harrison starts talking about how the pope, you know, that globalist pope?

32:48.900 --> 32:49.900
I've heard of the globalist pope.

32:49.900 --> 32:50.900
Cool pope.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.780
He's been in jail for well over a year.

32:52.780 --> 32:56.220
Yeah, according to expert sources, please.

32:56.220 --> 32:59.700
But, Jordan, what about that pope that I've seen going around?

32:59.700 --> 33:00.700
Fake pope.

33:00.700 --> 33:01.700
You haven't seen anybody.

33:01.700 --> 33:02.700
False flag pope.

33:02.700 --> 33:03.700
False flag pope.

33:03.700 --> 33:04.700
You haven't seen shit.

33:04.700 --> 33:11.100
Steve Porchenek arrested the pope like a year ago, but I guess the fake pope, somebody pretending

33:11.100 --> 33:17.980
to be the pope recently, I guess in an interview had said that climate change is possibly going

33:17.980 --> 33:21.820
to cause another flood.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.300
Those comments are what they are.

33:23.300 --> 33:28.320
And Christians took that very simply and calmly as him saying that there would be a regular

33:28.320 --> 33:29.320
flood.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.740
Harrison has decided that the pope is calling God a liar.

33:31.740 --> 33:32.740
There we go!

33:32.740 --> 33:33.740
I knew it!

33:33.740 --> 33:40.620
He also came out and said that because of climate change, we face threat of a new flood

33:40.620 --> 33:41.620
from God.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.340
Now, I don't know, maybe I was just a child.

33:45.340 --> 33:46.340
Maybe I misunderstood.

33:46.340 --> 33:53.620
But it wasn't one of the key aspects of the flood that God promised never to do it again.

33:53.620 --> 33:57.140
Wasn't that a promise God made, and is the pope calling God a liar?

33:57.140 --> 33:59.180
Yeah, so the pope's calling God a liar.

33:59.180 --> 34:03.380
Now we'll get into this here in a second, but something I think is really interesting

34:03.380 --> 34:06.220
is that Harrison starts thinking about the flood.

34:06.220 --> 34:11.660
Starts thinking about the flood story, and he gets a little bit weird with it.

34:11.660 --> 34:15.760
The original reason that God flooded the earth was sexual immorality.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.620
What does the pope have to say about that?

34:17.620 --> 34:21.020
I'm pretty sure what he has to say about that is, don't worry about it.

34:21.020 --> 34:22.020
It's fine.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.020
Come on!

34:23.020 --> 34:24.060
Free love, pope!

34:24.060 --> 34:27.540
So this is interesting to me, because the flood in the Bible happens pretty early in

34:27.540 --> 34:28.540
the book.

34:28.540 --> 34:29.540
It happens pretty fast.

34:29.540 --> 34:33.100
It's in Genesis chapter 6, so I decided I would go back and refresh my memory about

34:33.100 --> 34:36.880
the lead-up to the flood, and see if it happened because people weren't fucking the way that

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
God wanted them to.

34:37.880 --> 34:38.880
They weren't fucking right!

34:38.880 --> 34:42.400
So Genesis 1 is the creation of the world, and then chapter 2 is about the making of

34:42.400 --> 34:43.620
Adam and Eve.

34:43.620 --> 34:48.100
Genesis 3 is about the fall of Adam and Eve, having eaten from the tree of knowledge, and

34:48.100 --> 34:50.580
in retaliation, God made snakes all slithery.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.300
That one was guest-written by C.S. Lewis.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.300
A lot of people don't know that.

34:53.300 --> 34:57.940
He created painful child-birthing in male-dominated relationship structures, and then he also

34:57.940 --> 35:00.060
turned Adam into a farmer.

35:00.060 --> 35:06.600
Yeah, it was really important to get the male-dominated social structures in right away, like, right

35:06.600 --> 35:07.600
from the jump.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.600
Yeah.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.620
First chapter, men rule everything, moving on!

35:10.620 --> 35:11.620
And it's gonna hurt when you give birth.

35:11.620 --> 35:12.620
Yeah, and it's gonna hurt!

35:12.620 --> 35:16.820
And it's your fault for eating that fucking apple later!

35:16.820 --> 35:20.900
Genesis 4 deals with Cain killing Abel, and then there's a bunch of names in a family

35:20.900 --> 35:21.900
tree.

35:21.900 --> 35:25.700
Genesis 5 is a bunch more names and how long they lived, bridging the gap from Adam all

35:25.700 --> 35:26.700
the way down to Noah.

35:26.700 --> 35:27.700
Sure.

35:27.700 --> 35:31.380
In Genesis 6, God gets a little bit tired of people and decides they shouldn't be living

35:31.380 --> 35:32.380
so long.

35:32.380 --> 35:37.220
In addition to that, he sees that quote, sons of God were marrying quote, daughters of humans,

35:37.220 --> 35:40.500
which I guess is supposed to mean that angels were breeding with humans.

35:40.500 --> 35:44.660
Strange that there aren't any lady angels wooing human dudes, but I'll get off my SJW

35:44.660 --> 35:45.660
soapbox here.

35:45.660 --> 35:46.660
Don't worry about it, Dan.

35:46.660 --> 35:47.660
Come on, now.

35:47.660 --> 35:51.460
Here in, uh, here's Genesis 6, verses 5 through 7.

35:51.460 --> 35:55.740
Quote, the Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on earth, and

35:55.740 --> 36:00.220
that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time.

36:00.220 --> 36:03.420
The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply

36:03.420 --> 36:04.420
troubled.

36:04.420 --> 36:08.020
So the Lord said, I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created,

36:08.020 --> 36:11.340
and with them the animals and the birds and the creatures that move along the ground,

36:11.340 --> 36:13.220
for I regret that I have made them.

36:13.220 --> 36:14.420
Wait, hold on, God.

36:14.420 --> 36:15.420
Real quick.

36:15.420 --> 36:16.420
Just quick question, God.

36:16.420 --> 36:18.380
Um, just, we're in the planning stages.

36:18.380 --> 36:20.940
I can see that you're reacting emotionally.

36:20.940 --> 36:24.820
And frankly, I think it's a little bit offensive of you to say that they're acting evil all

36:24.820 --> 36:25.820
the time?

36:25.820 --> 36:26.820
Sure.

36:26.820 --> 36:27.820
I mean, come on, man.

36:27.820 --> 36:28.820
Sure.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.820
Also, what did the birds do?

36:29.820 --> 36:31.820
Birds are just hanging out!

36:31.820 --> 36:35.260
Well, I mean, look, if you want to defend the birds, that's your business.

36:35.260 --> 36:36.260
That's what I want to do?

36:36.260 --> 36:37.540
I have a long-standing beef with birds.

36:37.540 --> 36:38.540
Okay, that's fair.

36:38.540 --> 36:42.820
Um, I'm not going to go to bat for them, but I am going to say that I was reading over

36:42.820 --> 36:47.140
this, and it struck me how weird this is, that like, you know, it's a big decision to

36:47.140 --> 36:49.060
create a race of humans.

36:49.060 --> 36:51.900
The existence of all things.

36:51.900 --> 36:55.540
It's very weird that God wouldn't see it coming, that he would regret doing it.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.500
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.660
He was a young God at the time!

37:00.660 --> 37:04.460
We were young, he was young, everybody makes mistakes, this is teenage God.

37:04.460 --> 37:09.180
That seems something strange to fit into the conception of a God, is a regret over the

37:09.180 --> 37:10.580
creation of humans.

37:10.580 --> 37:12.860
Woof, man, those guys were shit!

37:12.860 --> 37:14.380
I fucked that one up.

37:14.380 --> 37:15.380
Whoops!

37:15.380 --> 37:16.380
Yeah.

37:16.380 --> 37:17.380
Whoops-a-doodle.

37:17.380 --> 37:18.380
Very weird.

37:18.380 --> 37:19.380
Yeah.

37:19.380 --> 37:24.340
And, by the way, even if, like, God was justified in being disappointed by humans, is extermination

37:24.340 --> 37:26.540
a rational solution to that problem?

37:26.540 --> 37:30.860
After all, it was God that created humans, so wiping them out is really just him trying

37:30.860 --> 37:32.420
to cover up his own mistakes?

37:32.420 --> 37:33.980
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.820
Anyway, that brings us to Noah.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.820
God liked Noah because he was unlike the rest of the people.

37:38.820 --> 37:44.780
From Genesis 6-11, quote, Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.

37:44.780 --> 37:48.020
God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted

37:48.020 --> 37:49.020
their ways.

37:49.020 --> 37:52.500
So God said to Noah, I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled

37:52.500 --> 37:54.540
with violence because of them.

37:54.540 --> 37:58.580
Twice in three verses the complaint of violence is raised in relation to God's decision to

37:58.580 --> 38:03.420
kill everyone off with the flood, and weirdly, sexual impropriety isn't brought up at all.

38:03.420 --> 38:07.540
It is odd that God would care more about violence than sexual impropriety.

38:07.540 --> 38:09.160
That seems so weird, Dan.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.700
After Noah builds the ark and saves all the animals, the flood comes and they have to

38:12.700 --> 38:17.060
live on that boat that's comically oversized for about a year.

38:17.060 --> 38:20.060
Noah is 600 years old at that point.

38:20.060 --> 38:24.380
When the flood ends, Noah gets off the boat and makes an altar to God, which pleases God.

38:24.380 --> 38:28.660
In appreciation, God says, quote, Never again will I curse the ground because of humans,

38:28.660 --> 38:32.020
even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood.

38:32.020 --> 38:36.380
And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.

38:36.380 --> 38:40.060
This story is fucked up, but the promise that God makes at the end of it doesn't preclude

38:40.060 --> 38:43.980
God from causing the kind of flooding that we would see arise from climate change.

38:43.980 --> 38:47.220
People aren't suggesting that we're going to end up in Waterworld or some shit, just

38:47.220 --> 38:50.580
that there are a lot of places that will become uninhabitable, and this will lead to mass

38:50.580 --> 38:53.100
displacement and likely a lot of death.

38:53.100 --> 38:57.940
That's completely compatible with God's promise to never again destroy all living creatures.

38:57.940 --> 38:58.940
Yeah.

38:58.940 --> 38:59.940
Yep.

38:59.940 --> 39:03.260
David Smith is a dumbfuck religious zealot who's trying to repurpose religious stories

39:03.260 --> 39:04.980
to suit his extremist agenda.

39:04.980 --> 39:10.180
In this case, his opposition to LGBTQ rights and access to reproductive health care.

39:10.180 --> 39:14.220
It's a pathetic display, and honestly, it's important to recognize that this is not a

39:14.220 --> 39:15.580
news show.

39:15.580 --> 39:18.420
They aren't even really conspiracy theory shows at this point.

39:18.420 --> 39:19.420
Nope.

39:19.420 --> 39:22.780
They're extremist religious programming that's masquerading as something political or about

39:22.780 --> 39:27.180
conspiracy in order to make them more interesting and attractive to an audience that would reject

39:27.180 --> 39:31.580
them instantly if they were aware that the message they were being delivered and was

39:31.580 --> 39:34.340
being pushed to them was religious in nature.

39:34.340 --> 39:39.780
These guys on this podcast where they're all drunk, if they realized what was behind Alex's

39:39.780 --> 39:44.780
rhetoric and his messaging and how it was really largely a religious message, I don't

39:44.780 --> 39:46.380
think they would think this was as funny.

39:46.380 --> 39:47.380
Hey, hey guys.

39:47.380 --> 39:52.020
I know we've had a lot of fun, but just to remind you, the earth is only 10,000 years

39:52.020 --> 39:56.420
old and your sinfulness is going to get you sent to hell forever.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.380
Anyways, don't abort a baby.

39:58.380 --> 40:03.060
Hey, I know I'm three quarters of the way through this bottle of Jameson, but I should

40:03.060 --> 40:09.260
tell you I'm a conception of angels and demons and how very serious it is that I can see

40:09.260 --> 40:10.260
them demons.

40:10.260 --> 40:16.460
You know, when you read the biblical flood myth, you really start to think, was this

40:16.460 --> 40:20.100
written by a dude, because I think it might have been.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.860
It feels very dude written.

40:22.860 --> 40:26.980
It's weird to go back and read it after a long time.

40:26.980 --> 40:32.540
It had been quite a while since I had read the story directly from the source and it

40:32.540 --> 40:35.500
was like, hmm, I don't know.

40:35.500 --> 40:40.260
I don't know what it is about my brain, but I can pick out little things that I missed

40:40.260 --> 40:41.260
when I was younger.

40:41.260 --> 40:43.020
Like, oh, that's a weird detail.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.020
Yeah.

40:44.020 --> 40:50.620
Isn't it really kind of strange when you sit down and grapple with reality and where we

40:50.620 --> 40:56.340
are as a society now and you look back and you're like, so are you telling me that I

40:56.340 --> 41:03.460
was taught when I was a child that God just irrationally murdered everything and I'm like,

41:03.460 --> 41:06.420
and that's the guy I need to worship until I die.

41:06.420 --> 41:09.180
That part of the story is really underplayed.

41:09.180 --> 41:10.180
Really not important.

41:10.180 --> 41:16.260
I do think that there's still like some metaphorical value in terms of, you know, I don't know,

41:16.260 --> 41:19.000
steadfastness and faithfulness.

41:19.000 --> 41:25.100
Or just educational value in learning about how people explain disasters throughout history

41:25.100 --> 41:26.100
in an oral tradition.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.100
Anthropological kind of thing.

41:27.100 --> 41:28.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.100
I agree.

41:29.100 --> 41:30.100
I agree.

41:30.100 --> 41:35.420
But I just think, I think it would be interesting if back in my Bible study groups or Sunday

41:35.420 --> 41:39.420
school we'd discussed the ramifications of extermination.

41:39.420 --> 41:40.420
Yeah.

41:40.420 --> 41:44.000
And there are so many better flood myths too.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.660
There were actual floods.

41:45.660 --> 41:47.660
Everybody's got a flood myth that was around at the time.

41:47.660 --> 41:48.660
There were some great ones.

41:48.660 --> 41:51.500
The only explanation I remember is like, they're all bad.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.500
Yep.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.500
The people who died were bad.

41:53.500 --> 41:54.500
100%.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.500
100%.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.500
That's what they, that's what they argued.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.500
That's not cool.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.500
Yeah, yeah.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.700
No, from the jump in the Bible, it's like, well, listen, killing everything that's evil

42:01.700 --> 42:03.220
is on the table, obviously.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.220
Yeah.

42:04.220 --> 42:05.220
Yeah.

42:05.220 --> 42:11.220
So I think that Harrison believes on some level that the motivation behind the flood

42:11.220 --> 42:19.260
on God's part was something to the effect of something related to LGBTQ rights.

42:19.260 --> 42:22.420
He might be conflating the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

42:22.420 --> 42:23.580
So he weaves that in.

42:23.580 --> 42:24.580
Of course he does.

42:24.580 --> 42:25.580
Yeah, yeah.

42:25.580 --> 42:28.100
And I think the reason that he's doing that is because he doesn't actually remember the

42:28.100 --> 42:29.300
flood myth one.

42:29.300 --> 42:33.140
Maybe not, but he does remember that the rainbow is the sign of God's covenant.

42:33.140 --> 42:34.140
Everybody does.

42:34.140 --> 42:38.780
And of course you look at the, you know, in Christian mythology, I guess you could call

42:38.780 --> 42:44.780
it the rainbow was the sign from God as a promise that he would never flood the earth

42:44.780 --> 42:45.780
again.

42:45.780 --> 42:51.060
So just think about this, that you have God flooding the earth because of sexual immorality.

42:51.060 --> 42:55.860
And then you have the symbol of this.

42:55.860 --> 43:03.420
The symbol of his promise to never do it again has been co-opted by alternative sexual lifestyles.

43:03.420 --> 43:04.420
Ooh.

43:04.420 --> 43:07.660
Satanic to its very core, I have to say.

43:07.660 --> 43:08.660
What?

43:08.660 --> 43:13.340
It's as interesting as Easter and Passover happening on the same day, Dan.

43:13.340 --> 43:15.460
Is he trying to say that people who have alternative...

43:15.460 --> 43:16.460
The gay stole the rainbow.

43:16.460 --> 43:17.460
Well, sure, but...

43:17.460 --> 43:18.460
That's what he's saying.

43:18.460 --> 43:19.460
Of course.

43:19.460 --> 43:23.860
But beyond that, I think what he's saying is that people who have quote unquote alternative

43:23.860 --> 43:25.460
lifestyles are immoral.

43:25.460 --> 43:26.460
Yeah.

43:26.460 --> 43:27.460
He is.

43:27.460 --> 43:30.580
He is saying that it is immoral to be a lesbian or gay.

43:30.580 --> 43:31.580
Anything other than straight.

43:31.580 --> 43:32.580
Yeah.

43:32.580 --> 43:33.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:33.580 --> 43:34.580
That's cool.

43:34.580 --> 43:38.340
I mean, I guess, you know, just own that position then, Harrison.

43:38.340 --> 43:40.460
It seems like that's what you want to say.

43:40.460 --> 43:41.460
Yeah.

43:41.460 --> 43:43.140
No, it seems like that is what you are saying.

43:43.140 --> 43:44.140
Yeah.

43:44.140 --> 43:45.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:45.140 --> 43:46.140
It's fucked up.

43:46.140 --> 43:48.580
Just come out and say that you think everybody who's not straight should be put to the sword.

43:48.580 --> 43:49.580
Yeah.

43:49.580 --> 43:50.900
You know, like your God does.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.380
I think Harrison might be only a little ways away from that.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.860
Yeah, you're probably not wrong.

43:54.860 --> 44:00.300
So we get another caller here, and this caller, like, I'm still reeling from this.

44:00.300 --> 44:01.300
Okay.

44:01.300 --> 44:02.300
This is a minute long.

44:02.300 --> 44:03.300
Okay.

44:03.300 --> 44:04.300
Listen to the...

44:04.300 --> 44:05.300
Mic down for this.

44:05.300 --> 44:06.300
Okay.

44:06.300 --> 44:07.300
All right.

44:07.300 --> 44:08.300
Because this is confusing.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.500
This is coming to Carlos in Texas.

44:10.500 --> 44:11.980
Thanks so much for calling in, Carlos.

44:11.980 --> 44:12.980
You are on the air, sir.

44:12.980 --> 44:13.980
Yeah.

44:13.980 --> 44:14.980
What's up, Harrison?

44:14.980 --> 44:17.820
I want to congratulate you on your newborn child.

44:17.820 --> 44:18.820
Thank you very much.

44:18.820 --> 44:19.820
You're going to...

44:19.820 --> 44:20.820
Yeah, no problem, man.

44:20.820 --> 44:21.820
You're going to raise a great info warrior.

44:21.820 --> 44:25.580
I've been listening since David Knight, and ever since you came out on the show, you've

44:25.580 --> 44:26.860
been a great addition, bro.

44:26.860 --> 44:28.220
They should have been had you on.

44:28.220 --> 44:29.220
Thank you, man.

44:29.220 --> 44:30.220
I appreciate that.

44:30.220 --> 44:31.220
Yeah, man.

44:31.220 --> 44:32.220
You do a great job.

44:32.220 --> 44:33.220
Hope you keep it up.

44:33.220 --> 44:34.220
Thank you.

44:34.220 --> 44:35.220
I want to give a huge shout out.

44:35.220 --> 44:36.220
Huge shout out.

44:36.220 --> 44:38.820
I want to give a special extra strength formula.

44:38.820 --> 44:45.220
Here I am sitting in a parking lot outside my university with a 5G tower beaming right

44:45.220 --> 44:48.220
at me, and I'm ready to go for the day, dude.

44:48.220 --> 44:54.340
I took these pills last night and had a great sleep.

44:54.340 --> 44:56.500
And I'm ready to go for the day.

44:56.500 --> 45:00.860
And not only that, I took some more this morning, and we're chilling, and we're ready to go

45:00.860 --> 45:01.860
and start the day, man.

45:01.860 --> 45:02.860
And that's it.

45:02.860 --> 45:03.860
That's all I have to say.

45:03.860 --> 45:05.860
Oh, that's awesome, man.

45:05.860 --> 45:06.860
Yeah.

45:06.860 --> 45:07.860
No problem.

45:07.860 --> 45:08.860
Peace, bro.

45:08.860 --> 45:09.860
Thank you very much.

45:09.860 --> 45:14.460
That's Dr. Jones's Natural Extra Strength Kava Chill and a beautiful plug from Carlos

45:14.460 --> 45:15.460
from Texas.

45:15.460 --> 45:22.220
The whole call, the only reason he called in at all was to plug this product.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.220
So wait.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.220
So you're saying-

45:24.220 --> 45:25.220
There wasn't anything else to the call.

45:25.220 --> 45:32.900
So this guy is just like, man, my friends and I took this Infowars product, and we were

45:32.900 --> 45:35.260
like, fuck yeah.

45:35.260 --> 45:36.780
I got a good sleep last night.

45:36.780 --> 45:37.780
Good call, guys.

45:37.780 --> 45:38.780
I got a good sleep last night.

45:38.780 --> 45:39.780
Yeah.

45:39.780 --> 45:40.780
And then I took some more, and I'm chilling.

45:40.780 --> 45:41.780
I'm ready to start the day.

45:41.780 --> 45:42.780
Ready to start the day.

45:42.780 --> 45:43.780
I'm on campus.

45:43.780 --> 45:44.780
There's a 5G tower.

45:44.780 --> 45:45.780
It's not getting in my way.

45:45.780 --> 45:46.780
Not a problem.

45:46.780 --> 45:47.780
Not a problem.

45:47.780 --> 45:48.780
I've got to call Harrison.

45:48.780 --> 45:49.780
I am chill.

45:49.780 --> 45:50.780
I'm so chill.

45:50.780 --> 45:52.780
I'm going to give Harrison a call.

45:52.780 --> 45:57.860
Let him know I love David Knight, but listen, the White Nationalist Happy Hour is so better.

45:57.860 --> 46:01.380
Harrison has to know how chill I am right now.

46:01.380 --> 46:02.780
I'm so fucking chill.

46:02.780 --> 46:06.900
I got to call Infowars.

46:06.900 --> 46:08.760
That's nuts.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.860
That is nuts.

46:09.860 --> 46:10.860
That is nuts.

46:10.860 --> 46:13.460
And it doesn't sound like a plant because it did sound like that guy was just a little

46:13.460 --> 46:14.460
bit high.

46:14.460 --> 46:15.460
He sounded a bit high.

46:15.460 --> 46:16.460
He sounded pretty damn high.

46:16.460 --> 46:17.460
He sounded a bit chill.

46:17.460 --> 46:18.460
He sounded fairly chill.

46:18.460 --> 46:19.460
Yeah.

46:19.460 --> 46:20.460
I don't know.

46:20.460 --> 46:22.980
I think it could have been a plant, though.

46:22.980 --> 46:28.100
I think it could have because it almost felt like he was bailing when he ended the call.

46:28.100 --> 46:31.260
It felt like maybe there was something else, and he was like, ah, fuck it.

46:31.260 --> 46:32.260
Yeah, whatever.

46:32.260 --> 46:37.620
Why the fuck would you call into this show and just be like, hey, your product works?

46:37.620 --> 46:40.660
I guess to let everybody know that it gets you high, man.

46:40.660 --> 46:41.660
What a waste of time.

46:41.660 --> 46:48.060
Anyway, we get to this next caller, and actually this caller starts by talking about-

46:48.060 --> 46:51.820
It's like calling up your weed dealer and being like, man, this stuff did it.

46:51.820 --> 46:52.820
Shit's good.

46:52.820 --> 46:53.820
All right, that was a good call, guys.

46:53.820 --> 46:54.860
I'm going to get out of here.

46:54.860 --> 46:59.840
So this next caller, Jordan, I had got into this episode and I'd started listening to

46:59.840 --> 47:04.980
it because I thought that this was the episode where Harrison interviews Stuart Rhodes.

47:04.980 --> 47:05.980
Oh, shit.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.940
And so I wanted to hear that.

47:07.940 --> 47:13.220
And when this caller started up, he says, I want to talk about Stuart Rhodes' interview.

47:13.220 --> 47:15.580
So I was like, ah, shit, I got the wrong day.

47:15.580 --> 47:16.580
Yeah.

47:16.580 --> 47:20.620
However, this caller then proceeds to really freak me out.

47:20.620 --> 47:21.620
Okay.

47:21.620 --> 47:25.380
Let's go now to Scott in Florida who has a comment about our guest from yesterday,

47:25.380 --> 47:30.620
Stuart Rhodes, leader of the Oathkeeper, he was on for an hour or so breaking his media

47:30.620 --> 47:35.500
silence to talk about some of the fallout from January 6th.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.900
And a caller, Scott, from Florida has some comments about this.

47:37.900 --> 47:39.220
Thanks for calling in, Scott.

47:39.220 --> 47:42.660
Did you enjoy the interview or do you have some concerns about it?

47:42.660 --> 47:43.660
What's your take here?

47:43.660 --> 47:44.660
Yes.

47:44.660 --> 47:50.580
Good morning, Mr. Smith, and congratulations on your child, your dad, and that's such an

47:50.580 --> 47:52.580
awesome responsibility.

47:52.580 --> 47:55.460
You know, I'd like to say this, Stuart Rhodes is a hero.

47:55.460 --> 47:58.620
He's a hero and a patriot, a leader of the Oathkeepers.

47:58.620 --> 48:04.660
I pray for him and his family that this evil government does not incarcerate him.

48:04.660 --> 48:07.540
You know, you should have you should have a panel if you can do a show.

48:07.540 --> 48:11.220
I don't know if you can do this, where you could get the leaders of the Oathkeepers,

48:11.220 --> 48:16.260
the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo Boys, the Three Percenters, my favorite group, the John Birch

48:16.260 --> 48:17.260
Society.

48:17.260 --> 48:22.820
I haven't heard from the John Birch Society, if ever there was a group to get involved

48:22.820 --> 48:28.340
with the takeover of communism, the United States is a John Birch Society, sovereign

48:28.340 --> 48:31.060
citizens, West broke out this church.

48:31.060 --> 48:32.980
Look, let's be honest.

48:32.980 --> 48:33.980
Whoa.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.780
OK, so this list spiraled.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.580
Yeah, yeah.

48:37.580 --> 48:45.340
I mean, we're we're on the edge of being like, and also let's get Lex Luthor in there.

48:45.340 --> 48:50.980
Bad guys from Captain Planet, like, come on, let's do the whole Legion of Doom.

48:50.980 --> 48:51.980
Get him in there.

48:51.980 --> 48:52.980
Get him in there.

48:52.980 --> 48:53.980
Come on, buddy.

48:53.980 --> 48:55.580
Let's just go for all evil everywhere.

48:55.580 --> 48:56.580
Yeah, exactly.

48:56.580 --> 49:01.620
I mean, like, I get the idea of like, let's have a roundtable powwow with Stuart Rhodes,

49:01.620 --> 49:04.140
maybe someone from the Proud Boys.

49:04.140 --> 49:08.540
That seems like, OK, this is where your show is at now.

49:08.540 --> 49:11.900
You add the John Birch Society and it's like, oh, you're harkening back to your roots.

49:11.900 --> 49:12.900
Yeah, that makes sense.

49:12.900 --> 49:15.420
Right, right, right, the Westboro Baptist Church.

49:15.420 --> 49:16.420
No, what?

49:16.420 --> 49:17.420
What?

49:17.420 --> 49:18.420
Why?

49:18.420 --> 49:19.420
Sovereign citizens.

49:19.420 --> 49:20.420
Jesus, dude.

49:20.420 --> 49:21.420
They don't even have a leader by rules.

49:21.420 --> 49:22.420
Yeah.

49:22.420 --> 49:23.420
What are we doing?

49:23.420 --> 49:24.420
This is very weird.

49:24.420 --> 49:29.140
When he said the Westboro Baptist Church, that was one like my like, oh, oh, oh, what's

49:29.140 --> 49:30.140
going on here?

49:30.140 --> 49:31.140
What are we doing?

49:31.140 --> 49:35.020
And this caller, it was this is only the beginning of the trouble with that really was the beginning

49:35.020 --> 49:36.020
of the trouble.

49:36.020 --> 49:37.020
Oh, yes.

49:37.020 --> 49:38.020
Oh, boy.

49:38.020 --> 49:42.740
So this guy is going to put forth the theory or is the position that January 6th was the

49:42.740 --> 49:44.780
beginning of the Second American Revolution.

49:44.780 --> 49:45.780
OK.

49:45.780 --> 49:46.780
And I hate to mike down you twice.

49:46.780 --> 49:47.780
Oh, boy.

49:47.780 --> 49:48.980
This is fast.

49:48.980 --> 49:49.980
You're going to scream.

49:49.980 --> 49:50.980
OK.

49:50.980 --> 49:56.460
January 6th, 2021 is going to go on in American history is the second American beginning of

49:56.460 --> 49:59.060
the Second American Revolution.

49:59.060 --> 50:04.340
It's going to be the pinnacle of the beginning of it, because this is not over, Mr. Smith.

50:04.340 --> 50:10.180
The American people are being persecuted by a Zionist occupied government.

50:10.180 --> 50:18.020
And let me relate what that means when you've got an FBI that interrogates, threatens people

50:18.020 --> 50:22.260
like you were saying yesterday, because they don't like their opinions.

50:22.260 --> 50:25.180
They don't like their thought processes.

50:25.180 --> 50:27.700
This smacks of a Zionist occupied government.

50:27.700 --> 50:29.300
What I mean by that, I want to be vague.

50:29.300 --> 50:36.100
I'm talking specifically about a government that is controlled by APAC, American Israel

50:36.100 --> 50:40.420
Public Affairs Committee, a Federal Reserve that is the Rothschild bank, just mentioned

50:40.420 --> 50:42.740
a moment ago, Linda Rothschild.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.740
That doesn't surprise me talking about a capitalist world order.

50:46.740 --> 50:49.380
International Jewry is at stake here, is involved here.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.220
And I know what you said with me last time.

50:51.220 --> 50:52.220
Well, let's stop.

50:52.220 --> 50:54.860
It's not just I'm not talking about average Jews.

50:54.860 --> 50:56.740
I'm talking about international Jews.

50:56.740 --> 50:58.020
Oh, boy.

50:58.020 --> 51:00.300
This is off the rails.

51:00.300 --> 51:01.300
Wow.

51:01.300 --> 51:05.980
I feel like I feel like when Rob Dues hosting, he knows to hang up on.

51:05.980 --> 51:09.100
People who say Zionist occupied government.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.220
I'm talking about a Zionist occupied government.

51:11.220 --> 51:13.460
And let me be clear on what that means, sir.

51:13.460 --> 51:17.860
I believe the moment you talk about a Zionist occupied government, you have been clear on

51:17.860 --> 51:18.860
what that means.

51:18.860 --> 51:19.860
Click.

51:19.860 --> 51:20.860
Yes.

51:20.860 --> 51:21.860
Yeah.

51:21.860 --> 51:27.300
Here at Infowars, our branding is supposed to be that we're against that kind of stuff.

51:27.300 --> 51:32.020
In order to support that kind of stuff, we have to be pretend to be against it.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.020
Oh, boy.

51:33.020 --> 51:35.540
International Jewry, my friend.

51:35.540 --> 51:39.340
I have never heard that in a positive way.

51:39.340 --> 51:44.620
Have you ever heard, like, it's national, let's celebrate the International Jewry Day.

51:44.620 --> 51:45.620
No.

51:45.620 --> 51:51.500
What was the name of that book that Ford put out during World War II?

51:51.500 --> 51:54.900
The International Jew?

51:54.900 --> 51:56.060
This is Nazi shit.

51:56.060 --> 51:57.900
That is straight up Nazi shit.

51:57.900 --> 51:58.900
Yeah.

51:58.900 --> 51:59.900
Yeah.

51:59.900 --> 52:04.860
And I would argue, buddy, just I mean, and look, I'm going to go out on a limb here and

52:04.860 --> 52:11.600
I'm going to say that he's very mad at the FBI for choosing to go after people who don't

52:11.600 --> 52:14.540
share his opinions now.

52:14.540 --> 52:19.360
I get the feeling that he was a big fan of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI.

52:19.360 --> 52:24.860
You know, I think he was probably a fan of the FBI murdering people who would say things

52:24.860 --> 52:26.980
like Black Lives Matter and the like.

52:26.980 --> 52:27.980
Sure.

52:27.980 --> 52:34.540
Or when the tide was so anti-communist and trying to root out communist sympathizers

52:34.540 --> 52:35.540
everywhere.

52:35.540 --> 52:36.540
Yeah.

52:36.540 --> 52:37.540
Yeah.

52:37.540 --> 52:38.900
I'm willing to bet there would be a slightly different tone.

52:38.900 --> 52:44.140
Now the thing is that this dude is fucking overt.

52:44.140 --> 52:46.260
He doesn't give a shit.

52:46.260 --> 52:47.500
He's putting it all out there.

52:47.500 --> 52:52.540
He's talking about how it's the International Jews, not your regular everyday Jews.

52:52.540 --> 52:58.500
Well, because he's so comfortable, you know, floating all this stuff, he kind of makes

52:58.500 --> 53:01.460
clear something that we already know.

53:01.460 --> 53:09.300
When Mr. Jones says globalist, I know exactly what he means.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.780
I'm not pinning it on him.

53:10.780 --> 53:11.780
I'll say it.

53:11.780 --> 53:16.820
In my opinion, when I hear the word globalist, I think of the Rothschilds.

53:16.820 --> 53:18.580
I think of the Protestant family.

53:18.580 --> 53:24.140
I think of a cabal of international Jewry that is pushing forward this new world order,

53:24.140 --> 53:26.220
which I call the Jew world order.

53:26.220 --> 53:28.340
And I hate what's happening in America.

53:28.340 --> 53:29.980
He laughed at that.

53:29.980 --> 53:32.860
Harrison laughed at this guy saying the Jew world order.

53:32.860 --> 53:34.860
Harrison is straight up a Nazi.

53:34.860 --> 53:35.860
This is outrageous.

53:35.860 --> 53:36.860
Harrison's a Nazi.

53:36.860 --> 53:37.860
This is outrageous.

53:37.860 --> 53:38.860
That's a real Nazi.

53:38.860 --> 53:40.060
How is this happening on air?

53:40.060 --> 53:43.140
That is a Nazi broadcast.

53:43.140 --> 53:45.940
That's Nazis, that's Nazis doing Nazi shit.

53:45.940 --> 53:50.700
And he's giving up the game a little bit that whenever I hear Alex say globalist, I know

53:50.700 --> 53:51.700
what he's talking about.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.700
Yeah.

53:52.700 --> 53:56.700
I don't know if that made me, I have a weird reaction to that because part of that made

53:56.700 --> 53:59.420
me feel like, well, good for you, buddy.

53:59.420 --> 54:02.520
You understand what he's saying.

54:02.520 --> 54:05.160
It's nice that he at least can read between the lines.

54:05.160 --> 54:07.020
I don't know if many people can do that.

54:07.020 --> 54:12.900
I think it's bad that he can and does and believes that it's okay to do that.

54:12.900 --> 54:19.220
Well, the experience that I had was like thinking, no duh, but like, you know, I'm so, I'm so

54:19.220 --> 54:24.740
dull or numb to the fact that like that is the code, that the characterization that Alex

54:24.740 --> 54:28.980
uses the globalist rely so much on these archaic forms of antisemitic tropes.

54:28.980 --> 54:29.980
Yeah, yeah.

54:29.980 --> 54:33.780
And like, I get that and I know that and so it doesn't surprise me.

54:33.780 --> 54:37.620
Although it is a little bit shocking to hear somebody just be like, come on, let's talk

54:37.620 --> 54:38.620
honestly.

54:38.620 --> 54:39.620
I know.

54:39.620 --> 54:40.620
It is weird.

54:40.620 --> 54:41.620
Yeah.

54:41.620 --> 54:42.620
It's really weird.

54:42.620 --> 54:45.700
It's strange because it does indicate that, I mean, this guy isn't the only person in

54:45.700 --> 54:54.020
the audience who has a cognizant sort of self-awareness that that's what he thinks Alex is talking

54:54.020 --> 54:55.020
about.

54:55.020 --> 54:56.500
Well, yeah, obviously.

54:56.500 --> 54:57.500
Everybody gets it.

54:57.500 --> 54:58.500
Everybody gets it.

54:58.500 --> 54:59.500
Dude.

54:59.500 --> 55:04.220
Why do you think we use the code word?

55:04.220 --> 55:05.220
So we don't sound like this.

55:05.220 --> 55:06.220
So we don't say it on the air.

55:06.220 --> 55:07.220
So we don't sound like this.

55:07.220 --> 55:08.220
Yeah, man.

55:08.220 --> 55:09.340
God damn it, dude.

55:09.340 --> 55:13.940
So this guy, he has some reading materials that he might want to promote to the audience

55:13.940 --> 55:15.140
and Harrison lets him.

55:15.140 --> 55:16.140
Is he a Pez dispenser?

55:16.140 --> 55:22.220
Your listeners are confused and frightened and want some sanity on what's going on.

55:22.220 --> 55:24.340
Please God, tell me what's going on.

55:24.340 --> 55:26.220
Read a book called The Protocols.

55:26.220 --> 55:28.980
There we go, he's the Pez dispenser.

55:28.980 --> 55:29.980
That's a fortune.

55:29.980 --> 55:30.980
No, it's not a fortune.

55:30.980 --> 55:31.980
Sure, sure.

55:31.980 --> 55:32.980
And you've made this point before, Scott.

55:32.980 --> 55:36.980
And I know you've also mentioned that if you've talked to Scott before, you've called in a

55:36.980 --> 55:37.980
few times.

55:37.980 --> 55:38.980
Yes, I am.

55:38.980 --> 55:41.980
By the way, I am Jewish.

55:41.980 --> 55:44.020
That sounds like identity politics to me.

55:44.020 --> 55:45.020
Great, great.

55:45.020 --> 55:46.020
Sure.

55:46.020 --> 55:47.020
I don't care.

55:47.020 --> 55:48.020
I really don't care.

55:48.020 --> 55:50.220
It does not make any of the things you're saying any better.

55:50.220 --> 55:51.220
No, no, no, no, no.

55:51.220 --> 55:52.220
Nope.

55:52.220 --> 55:53.220
Don't care.

55:53.220 --> 55:54.220
Don't care.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.220
Wow.

55:55.220 --> 55:57.660
I'm kind of back by that, like, oh, these guys know each other.

55:57.660 --> 55:59.420
Yeah, that's real.

55:59.420 --> 56:02.780
That makes me even more uncomfortable, where you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, no, no, it's

56:02.780 --> 56:03.780
this guy.

56:03.780 --> 56:05.460
Of course I'm going to let him say that he hates all Jews.

56:05.460 --> 56:06.460
Duh.

56:06.460 --> 56:11.140
Of course I'm going to let him promote the protocols on my fucking show.

56:11.140 --> 56:12.420
You've made this point before.

56:12.420 --> 56:13.420
Hang up on this guy.

56:13.420 --> 56:14.420
Yeah.

56:14.420 --> 56:15.420
Jesus.

56:15.420 --> 56:16.420
You know what point he's going to make.

56:16.420 --> 56:17.420
Jesus Christ.

56:17.420 --> 56:21.380
Anyway, Harrison, not one to shy away.

56:21.380 --> 56:28.140
How is it that people are bitching about banning books and the protocol still isn't banned?

56:28.140 --> 56:29.140
Yeah.

56:29.140 --> 56:31.380
Dr. Seuss, far more dangerous.

56:31.380 --> 56:33.860
Oh, so angry.

56:33.860 --> 56:39.020
So Harrison doesn't really, like, push back too much on this guy.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.020
I am Jewish.

56:40.020 --> 56:41.020
Okay.

56:41.020 --> 56:42.020
Yeah.

56:42.020 --> 56:44.680
Let me just say, you know, it's interesting that you, you bring it up with Stuart Rhodes

56:44.680 --> 56:47.720
because actually one of the things I was going to mention yesterday that I didn't get to

56:47.720 --> 56:54.840
with Stuart Rhodes is the fact that the organizations who are actually advising the FBI on what

56:54.840 --> 56:58.340
to do, I mean, you know, essentially you have the FBI and you would think that they would

56:58.340 --> 57:00.540
be answerable only to politicians.

57:00.540 --> 57:04.300
They would be taking directives from civilian oversight.

57:04.300 --> 57:08.460
But in reality, what you see, and there's stories going back all the way to 2017, is

57:08.460 --> 57:14.140
that it's organizations like the ADL and the SPLC that are actually directing the FBI.

57:14.140 --> 57:15.140
Does that sound true to you, Harrison?

57:15.140 --> 57:18.740
They're calling the ADL and SPLC Jewish organizations.

57:18.740 --> 57:19.860
They're calling themselves that, right?

57:19.860 --> 57:26.700
So you have an organization that is of, you know, of a certain ideology that is not claiming

57:26.700 --> 57:27.700
to be for everybody.

57:27.700 --> 57:29.620
It's the Anti-Defamation League.

57:29.620 --> 57:30.960
It's a Jewish organization.

57:30.960 --> 57:34.220
And yet they're the ones who are directing the FBI.

57:34.220 --> 57:41.040
Now, there is a weird sort of disconnect in the American psyche where it's like, how do

57:41.040 --> 57:42.980
we not see that that's weird and wrong?

57:42.980 --> 57:47.660
That it's a private organization that I consider a hate group that has articles about me calling

57:47.660 --> 57:51.300
me an anti-semite, calling me a homophobe, calling me a racist, calling me all sorts

57:51.300 --> 57:55.500
of horrible things that are completely untrue and totally baseless.

57:55.500 --> 58:03.540
Yeah, that's a little tough.

58:03.540 --> 58:04.540
That's a little...

58:04.540 --> 58:05.540
Completely baseless.

58:05.540 --> 58:06.540
What did they do?

58:06.540 --> 58:08.060
Listen to the previous 10 minutes?

58:08.060 --> 58:11.760
How would they have known any of these things to claim if they had not listened to me speak

58:11.760 --> 58:13.500
for the previous 10 minutes?

58:13.500 --> 58:14.500
Yeah.

58:14.500 --> 58:15.500
Wow.

58:15.500 --> 58:16.500
Wowzers.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.500
Wow.

58:17.500 --> 58:24.740
When you have a caller who's insinuating that international Jewry is a cabal that's trying

58:24.740 --> 58:29.300
to push the Jew world order, and if anybody in the audience is afraid, they should just

58:29.300 --> 58:32.020
read the protocols of the elders of Zion.

58:32.020 --> 58:38.380
And then if you then respond with, hey, you know, the SPLC and ADL are Jewish organizations

58:38.380 --> 58:45.260
and they run our FBI and they're a hate group that runs our FBI, they're like, hey buddy,

58:45.260 --> 58:47.660
you are signing off on what this guy is saying.

58:47.660 --> 58:48.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:48.660 --> 58:50.580
You are not disagreeing with him.

58:50.580 --> 58:51.580
This isn't a debate.

58:51.580 --> 58:55.360
This isn't an airing of alternative ideas that you have.

58:55.360 --> 58:59.500
You guys are just both fucking out there.

58:59.500 --> 59:04.540
It is interesting the difference in reaction between, because I feel like now that they're

59:04.540 --> 59:08.500
all just letting it out, just like, hey, we're Nazis as fuck, how are you guys doing?

59:08.500 --> 59:12.900
I'm a Nazi, you're a Nazi, let's have a great old conversation about Nazi shit.

59:12.900 --> 59:19.080
I can feel my guard being lowered a little bit because I'm not like, what is this supposed

59:19.080 --> 59:20.620
to mean?

59:20.620 --> 59:22.420
In what way are they trying to hide?

59:22.420 --> 59:24.020
In what way are they trying to lie?

59:24.020 --> 59:25.020
Yeah.

59:25.020 --> 59:29.940
However, I have let my guard down there and put it up to fight because I would like to

59:29.940 --> 59:30.940
fight them.

59:30.940 --> 59:36.740
The moment you're just like, hey, we love being Nazis, I'm like, ah, then you're fair

59:36.740 --> 59:37.740
game.

59:37.740 --> 59:38.740
Right.

59:38.740 --> 59:39.740
You know?

59:39.740 --> 59:40.740
It's brutal.

59:40.740 --> 59:41.740
Ah, I hate these guys.

59:41.740 --> 59:42.740
It's a mess.

59:42.740 --> 59:43.740
Ugh.

59:43.740 --> 59:47.840
So Harrison does have one rebuttal that I would say he gives, and it's just to protect

59:47.840 --> 59:49.100
the business.

59:49.100 --> 59:51.220
It's just to protect the game.

59:51.220 --> 59:55.860
He has to disagree that globalist means international Jewish person.

59:55.860 --> 01:00:00.100
Sure, but he will admit that the ADL, the SBLC, and the FBI, as well as the government

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.940
He'll not only admit that, he will bring that to the conversation.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.940
Yes, of course.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.940
Okay.

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.860
And so I do disagree with you there where it's like, oh, globalist is just a code word.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:08.860
It's not.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.860
It's a certain thing.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:15.700
It's a very particular thing that you can subscribe to whatever religion you are, and

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.240
it doesn't mean you subscribe to it if you're Jewish.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.720
So I do disagree with you on certain points.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.060
That's not even what that guy was saying.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.060
Yeah, no, that's not even close.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:29.700
He's responding to a false point in order to try and protect the Infowars use of globalist

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.980
as a dog whistle.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.580
Yeah, no, you're just a Nazi, Harrison.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.620
Yeah, it's unfortunate for you.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.460
Yeah, for you, and for the existence of the rest of us.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.900
And it's unfortunate for him because I don't listen to his show much, and then I dip in

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900
and there's this.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:49.780
It's like, I think you are going to be a lot of my media diet in the future.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.140
Wow, just straight up Nazi shit.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.140
Yeah.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.140
God damn.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.740
So I got through that call and listened to a little bit more, and I just started to get

01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.740
bored.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:06.740
And I'm so overwhelmed by that call and how overt and offensive it was.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.260
And I'm like, nothing's going to be worse than that.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.260
You can't.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.940
I can't imagine that it would be worse than that.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.740
Next caller.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.280
And that caller had said that the Stuart Rhodes interview that I was looking for was on the

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.440
other day.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.440
So I turned this episode off and went over to the Stuart Rhodes.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.140
You didn't wait to see if somebody called in and said the Holocaust didn't happen and

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.820
that Jews are also responsible for all the problems in the world?

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.820
I don't think it was a caller.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:29.820
That might have been a guest.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.260
That could have been Harrison.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:37.060
So I went to the interview with Stuart Rhodes because there was some news about him recently

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.620
related to the 6th.

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.620
Right, right, right.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:44.260
That he was a super cool dude and that everybody loves him and I never wanted any violence

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.260
at all.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.840
I wanted to check in on his response to it, and I thought it was interesting that it's

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.760
on the American Journal, but that's because Alex is deep in the grocery store.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:01.420
So here we find the introduction to Stuart's interview and Harrison has some bad ideas.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.900
This is also, I should say, this is from March 9th.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:11.220
Again, you have to begrudgingly admire the ability of the mainstream media and the corrupt

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:17.140
establishment, their ability to manipulate the minds of the American people, especially

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:22.580
when it comes to an event like January 6th, 2021.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:26.540
It was, of course, as more information is coming out, we know, essentially an inside

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.540
job.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:31.340
The same way that 9-11 was an inside job, 1-6 was an inside job.

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:35.700
Flashback to our- The Patriots have taken the Capitol.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.100
If anyone wants to listen to our coverage of January 6th, Harrison's tone was very different

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.900
on that actual day.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.700
The Patriots have taken the Capitol.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:49.260
This is him doing the, I don't know why the SPLC thinks we're racist.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:55.140
It's a little bit, it's tough to take with a straight face, like I don't really believe

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.500
any sincerity here.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.100
No, no, no, fuck Harrison.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.580
So he gets talking about this, the January 6th protest, and he says something that is

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.860
categorically not true.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:10.900
What was occurring there was the largest protest, I believe, in American history, the most number

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:16.260
of people ever to gather in a single place for a political movement, probably upwards

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.140
of a million, if I had to guess.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.140
That's not true.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.300
I believe is doing a heavy lifting job in that sense.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.340
I believe that that was the biggest, well, yeah.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:31.260
So Stewart comes in and here's what he has to say about all these people who were talking

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.860
a bunch of noise about how it was an insurrection.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.860
Sure.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.860
And they're going for your head, man.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.940
I mean, what has it been like for you?

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:45.300
Well, it's been like something out of Orwell's 1984.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:51.020
It's thought crime and face crime and all the things that we've seen in the past that's

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:55.220
been done to others is now being done, not just to me, but anybody else who was in DC.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.220
It's ridiculous.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.820
As you were saying earlier, there were no weapons.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:00.820
No one brought guns.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.620
What kind of an insurrection is that?

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:07.740
You know, frankly, it's an insult to the competence of American patriots that were there to allege

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.220
that was some planned insurrection.

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.440
So Stewart Rhodes is coming on the show to try to get out in front of some pretty damning

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.740
information that's just been released.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.360
It's related to the U.S.'s case against Thomas Caldwell, an oathkeeper who was arrested related

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.180
to the storming of the Capitol.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:27.020
Caldwell had made a motion to reconsider his detention, and this document that was filed

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.340
in the evening of March 8th was a response to that motion.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.060
There's some interesting bits in here.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.980
The first thing that's important to remember is that the charge this guy is facing is conspiracy

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:41.320
to, quote, stop delay and hinder Congress's certification of the Electoral College vote.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.740
That's key, because the conspiracy wasn't to storm the building.

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:49.180
The storming of the building was, quote, an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:53.100
regardless of when they formed the intent to take these actions.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.500
The prosecution isn't claiming that anyone conspired to storm the Capitol, just that

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.180
they conspired to make it so Congress couldn't carry out its work.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.940
This should scare the shit out of someone like Stewart Rhodes.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.700
Yeah, because he did that.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.540
The reason it should scare him is that this filing also reveals that the government is

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:16.060
in possession of logs from a signal chat titled, quote, DC op January 6th, 21, which was previously

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.560
undisclosed.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:21.400
Caldwell himself has not been proven to have been in that chat, but Jessica Watkins, as

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:27.420
well as another unnamed person who were both oathkeepers who were arrested with Caldwell,

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:32.720
were in there, as were multiple, quote, regional oathkeeper leaders from multiple states across

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.100
the country and Stewart Rhodes.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:40.260
Who would have guessed that the people who believe that the government is surveilling

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:46.060
them at all times, trying to constantly implant them with computer chips to track them, would

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.260
have absolutely no idea that the government could actually read these fucking conversations.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.760
These chat logs clearly show that Stewart Rhodes was in contact with multiple people

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.220
associated with the oathkeepers who stormed the Capitol, and also establishes fairly well

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.180
that they were all involved in a plan to mess with the certification of the Electoral College

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.180
votes.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.660
And based on the publicly available evidence, it looks like Stewart could get rolled up

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:11.300
in this conspiracy charge, should the government want to pursue that.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.040
The full extent of the chats aren't disclosed, but Stewart did tell the group, quote, we

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.500
have several well-equipped, quick reaction forces outside DC.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.460
There are many, many others from other groups who will be watching and waiting on the outside

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.020
in case of worst case scenarios.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:29.620
Maybe these people didn't have weapons because they had a plan that involved heavily armed

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.620
backup teams.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:34.140
Yeah, they didn't have weapons in the Capitol because we were keeping them outside of the

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:37.540
Capitol to use on people who tried to escape the Capitol, dummies!

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:38.540
Duh!

01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.540
Duh!

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.540
On January 3rd, Thomas Caldwell sent a message to a three-percenter group asking, quote,

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.320
how many people either in the militia or not, who are still supportive of our efforts to

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.940
save the Republic, have a boat on a trailer that could handle a Potomac crossing?

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.700
If we had someone standing by at a dock ramp, we could have our quick response team with

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:59.900
the heavy weapons standing by, quickly load them and ferry them across the river to our

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.220
waiting arms.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.660
He then sent maps to people alleged to have been part of his response team.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.100
Well, that doesn't sound good.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.500
I wonder, and to be clear, I'm just spitballing here, I'm not being sarcastic or facetious

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.860
at all, I'm just curious, I wonder if this dude got the idea to use the Potomac from

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.220
listening to Alex's show.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:21.460
On the December 31st episode of Alex's show, just days before Caldwell tried to get this

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:26.260
boat planned together, Alex had a caller on his show who suggested this.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:32.900
Just wanted to touch bases with you with the March on D.C., or the occupation of D.C.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.820
I think that you, I'm going to talk to all the Cajun Navy and all these people that did

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:44.780
boat parades for the past three to four months, we need to have every single one of those

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.980
people plug up the Potomac.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980
Because you know...

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:53.100
That is a genius idea, and can you get boats from a Potomac?

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.380
Well, I can set out some Facebook posts and stuff, but they definitely need to get boats

01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:58.380
from a Potomac.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.100
No, what I'm asking you is, I don't see a lot of boats from a Potomac.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.340
I mean, boats can get on the Potomac, can't they?

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:06.060
Yeah, well, I'm sure they can, especially like the Cajun Navy, when the hurricanes come

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.940
in, they have to go in there and help get people out.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.220
I agree, well, we need to see the Cajun Navy come in and then get on the ground with us,

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.220
but I totally agree.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.220
We need to see...

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.540
Well, because I'm looking at it, if they tie up those boats, even if they try to shut down

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:23.780
those bridges, and that's a free, you can get into, I mean, that's a public area, tie

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:24.780
up those boats.

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.300
If they try to shut down those bridges, just imagine the info war army crossing the country.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.940
And by the way, let me tell you what this is about.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:32.780
It's about global government, it's about lockdowns, it's about control.

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.740
That's what the whole COVID hoax is about.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.140
Alex changes the subject there a little bit.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.860
It's not quite the same thing.

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:42.340
This caller is talking about clogging the river with the boats, whereas Caldwell wanted

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:46.500
to use them to ferry weapons, but there are some similarities in terms of what's being

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.500
suggested.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.100
So clearly this caller doesn't mean that the entire river should be clogged up, but that

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:56.620
these boats should tie together and block the area off so info wars types could cross

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.700
the river in the event that the bridges were closed.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.060
There's thematic similarities to what Caldwell was trying to achieve, but it's probably not

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.500
connected in any way.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:11.020
I just thought it was really interesting that it was just a couple days before.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:15.740
And maybe this is just kind of how these folks' minds work, you know, parallel thinking in

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.940
terms of like, well, all right, we could use the river.

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:24.420
Yeah, it does seem like these are plans that they cobbled together from half-remembered

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.020
war movies.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.260
This sounds something like I remember from Bridge on the River Kwai.

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.940
We're going to go into the Potomac, I guess, I don't know.

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.300
Anyway, the point here is that Stuart Rhodes is going to have a really interesting year,

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.740
and it also makes a whole lot more sense why he was trying to promote Jessica Watkins'

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.860
legal defense fund after the 6th.

01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.100
Yeah, that does make sense.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:50.740
So Stuart, he has a bit of a lie here about the Signal messages that he's been sending.

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.740
Sure, sure, sure.

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:56.580
The only thing they've got is a message from me posted on our operational chat on Signal

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:02.780
saying, anybody who's not on a PSD come to the northeast corner of the Capitol, that's

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.180
where I was standing, I wanted to be there.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:09.260
And my intent was to make sure that our guys stayed out of trouble.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.260
This is a lie.

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:17.300
On January 6th, Stuart posted in that chat, quote, all I see Trump doing is complaining.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.860
I see no intent by him to do anything, so the Patriots are taking it into their own

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:21.860
hands.

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.860
They've had enough.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:27.780
Later, Stuart sent a message to regroup on the south side of the Capitol, not the northeast

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:29.740
side, as he's saying here on the show.

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:35.220
At 2.41, Stuart posted a photo of the southeast side of the Capitol captioned, quote, south

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.180
side of US Capitol, Patriots pounding on doors.

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.620
By that point, multiple people in the chat had entered the US Capitol.

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:43.620
Of course.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:47.620
We'll see how this shakes out and everything, but Stuart is totally full of shit here.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.340
It's outrageous.

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.340
That's fucked.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.340
Yep.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:52.340
That is fucked.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.780
Now, it's interesting because Stuart has a little bit of a, eh, what are you gonna do,

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.780
kind of defense.

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.780
Sure.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:58.780
Here.

01:10:58.780 --> 01:10:59.780
What other defense do you have?

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.260
You've been caught red-handed.

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:02.260
Listen to this.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.580
All right.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.260
And let me give you something to think about while you're listening to this.

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:08.260
Okay.

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.260
He's telling the truth.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.260
I will do my best.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:14.620
Now, ask yourself, if he's telling the truth, is this okay?

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.620
Okay.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.620
Because it's not.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.620
Okay.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:22.140
And we had a situation with North Carolina, sadly, our North Carolina chapter had already

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:27.100
gone on a road, and it declared on a chat that I wasn't even on, they declared to other

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:33.100
guys in North Carolina that in DC on January the 6th, they were not gonna have anything

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.820
to do with National or take part in anything that National was doing, they were gonna do

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:37.820
their own thing.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:41.100
And they had posted that on December 31st.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.260
A member took a screenshot and sent it to me.

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.260
So there's that.

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:45.260
So there's that.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.260
Right.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.260
So...

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.260
North Carolina's gone rogue.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.260
Yeah.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.260
Okay.

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.260
Okay.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.260
So, look, guys.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.260
It's what?

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.260
What?

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:58.140
So I built this organization entirely around right-wing violence.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:02.140
And a super strong distrust of centralization.

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.140
Yep, yep.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:08.620
And then, strangely enough, one chapter went rogue and decided that I had no control over

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.620
them.

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.940
One chapter essentially declared states rights.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:11.940
Yeah!

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:12.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:13.940
That's cool.

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:14.940
That's cool.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.940
Yeah.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:16.940
That's cool.

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:17.940
I've created these heavily armed mini-armies.

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:18.940
Yeah.

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.460
And, hey, oh, they don't want to cooperate with me.

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.460
Oh, that's trouble.

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460
Yeah.

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.460
It turns out, I accidentally created warlords.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.180
My bad, guys.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.180
My bad.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.100
I created roving bands of warlords.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.220
Really a huge mistake on my part.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.220
Oops.

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.900
That would be one of the reasons why people don't like what you do.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:35.900
Yeah.

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.180
And people have been pointing out stuff like this.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.180
Oh, okay.

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.460
So you guys were talking about the warlord problem.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.460
No, no, no.

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460
Now I see what you were talking about.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:48.340
Oh, you were saying that if I create this loosely connected group of armies, what of

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.820
them might go rogue?

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.300
Oh, crazy.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:55.180
You know what's strange about lionizing a leaderless resistance?

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.060
It seems that they don't want to follow my leadership for some reason.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:02.660
Yeah, I mean, if this is true and, like, let's say that the North Carolina crew was responsible

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.060
for everything, I still think Stuart should get sued.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.340
Yeah, I think you still created the whole shebang.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.020
You don't just get to say, like, whoops, my group went rogue.

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.380
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.380
Look, it happens.

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.380
Yeah.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.380
Yeah, no.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.380
Anyway.

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.460
I'm off the hook because they went rogue, see?

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.140
No accountability there.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.140
In this next clip, Stuart misrepresents what the government's argument is, and keep in

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:29.140
mind that the charge that this Oathkeeper is facing is related to conspiracy to obstruct

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:33.900
and interfere with the Congress's electoral vote.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:39.300
They're trying to say that because we said the election was stolen, this was very dangerous

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:44.220
about this, anyone who said the election was stolen and then encouraged people to go to

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:49.420
DC, and then, like we did, encouraged Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, and we said

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:54.300
that if he does, we're willing to serve as the militia if he calls us in the service,

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:58.340
which is a perfectly constitutional and legal act by the president.

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:03.980
He declares an insurrection and calls us up under federal law as the militia to call us

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:04.980
in the service.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.900
He has every right and authority to do so.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.740
They're trying to make that a crime.

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.420
They're trying to allege that that-

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.860
No, they're not.

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860
No.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.180
That's not at all what they're doing.

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.340
If so, you would already be in prison.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.340
Yeah.

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.340
Yeah.

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:24.860
I mean, anybody could say, come to DC, anybody could say, come be a part of this protest.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:30.060
You can't, you can't conspire to interfere with Congress's business.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.060
Well, there's that.

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.060
Well, you actually can.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.060
Yeah.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.060
As long as you don't do anything.

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.060
Right.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:39.860
You can conspire unless you make an overt act towards furtherance of the conspiracy.

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.700
See, here's what my defense would be.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.900
My defense would be, it was a nonviolent protest.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.500
Now the problem with that defense is that it wasn't.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.780
So that kind of changes your, yeah.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.660
You know, like if nothing had happened and they were levying this charge to stop the

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.660
vote, you could have been like, see, nothing happened.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.660
We didn't do anything.

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.660
We didn't go anywhere.

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.660
It was just a protest.

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.660
Let's say no one breached the Capitol.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:03.660
No one breached the Capitol.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.660
And they just had a protest outside.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.300
Just a regular old protest.

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.500
Then nothing would be happening.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500
Nothing would happen.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.500
No.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500
Nobody's-

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500
You know why?

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.500
The problem is what happened after the thing.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.780
If Congress's ability to carry out the vote wouldn't have been impeded.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.780
No.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:17.780
No, no, no.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:18.780
So it wouldn't have been a crime.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780
Right.

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780
It would have been just a regular protest.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.980
If overt acts weren't taken to further the conspiracy, the conspiracy wouldn't be prosecuted.

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.980
Yeah.

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:31.860
I think they're mistaking that they think we're criminalizing the first part where you're

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.180
like, hey, we don't like this thing.

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.120
Let's all get together and be like, no.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.080
Whenever our problem was the second part when they were like, let's go kill people.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.860
That was my problem with it.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:47.700
I don't like the combination of it, but it's the second part that's a legal problem.

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.700
Yeah.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.060
That's the one that's coming back to bite you in the ass.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.060
Yeah.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:56.740
So it turns out that because of what's happening and the prosecution of these people for storming

01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:02.100
the Capitol and all this, it turns out there's no more Constitution.

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.100
Oh.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.900
That we are now living in a post-Constitution America.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:06.900
Right.

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:12.300
And the act they take just makes that clearer and clearer to more Americans.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:17.380
You are not going to get justice at the hands of this so-called justice department as you

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.940
call it, the injustice department.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.940
Nice.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:20.940
Get them.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.940
I don't know.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.380
I mean, this is one of those things that's so fucking dramatic.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.380
Yeah.

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:32.100
This is again, the, just the drama nonsense of these people we're in a post-Constitution

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.100
America.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.700
Well, Hey, I mean, if you're in a post-Constitution America, guess what?

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:36.700
You don't have the right to own guns.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.700
Yeah.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.700
So.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.980
So we can take those real quick.

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:40.980
I got bad news.

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:41.980
Bummer.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:42.980
Bummer.

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:43.980
You're gonna have to quarter some soldiers.

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.020
We're living in a post-Constitution.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.020
Fuck off.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.020
Grow up.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.580
And the thing that makes it even more silly.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:50.580
Cosplaying cowards.

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:55.260
Well, the thing that makes it even more silly is that Harrison agrees with him that we're

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.260
living in a post-Constitution America.

01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:01.740
And then he plays a clip of Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about defending the second

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:02.740
amendment.

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:08.780
Well, today representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congresswoman rose to speak against

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:16.380
HR 8, which is a national gun at registration and HR 1 4 4 6, which is a permanent firearm

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.500
waiting list.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:24.520
So the Democrats are coming after our constitutionally guaranteed rights one after the other.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.820
And there's no sense of them slowing down, only increasing their speed.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.900
They're not constitutionally protected anymore.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:31.900
According to you, there's no constitution.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.900
We're post-Constitution.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.900
We're post-Constitution.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900
What are you talking about?

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.540
You guys gotta adjust your fucking rhetoric.

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:40.420
If you're gonna say we're living in a post-Constitutional America, don't fucking talk to me about the

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.740
Constitution then.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.740
Which one?

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.740
Fuck your second amendment if it's post-Constitution.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.780
None of you have fucking read it to begin with!

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:46.780
Fair enough.

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:47.780
And that's all good and well.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.780
But, like, uh, okay.

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.900
I mean, if it's, like, it's Thunderdome then.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.060
It's, like, what are you...

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.060
Yeah.

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.060
Yeah.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.060
Come, fucking, let's do this then.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:00.180
It's, if we're living, if you really sincerely believe...

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.180
Mad Max me.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:02.180
Let's go.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:07.420
If you sincerely believe that the Constitution no longer applies, we're in a post-Constitution

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:14.820
America, and you're not just saying that to be a dramatic weirdo, then it should implicate

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.140
a whole bunch of your other beliefs.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.140
Yeah, totally.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:20.420
And you should no longer be talking about protecting the second amendment because if

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.700
there is no Constitution there's no amendments to the Constitution.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:24.060
No, no, there's only the amendments.

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:28.100
I guess you probably should stop complaining about free speech.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.940
Well, don't worry about that too much.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:30.940
That's not guaranteed.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.940
No, not anymore.

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.940
If it's the post-Constitution America.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.940
No.

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:37.700
No, and if you're gonna say post-Constitutional America, then essentially what you're saying

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:43.940
is if we want the Constitution back, we're going to have to overthrow the fucking United

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
States government.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.060
Yes, and write a new one or whatever.

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:48.060
Exactly.

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.060
Yeah.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:53.880
Or re-establish the old one, but either way, ultimately, you are saying we need to overthrow

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.420
the United States government.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:58.780
And the way we're gonna do that, according to Stewart, is purging the GOP.

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.240
See, there we go.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.660
It's disgusting to watch all these so-called Republican leaders throw everyone at the Capitol

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.220
under the bus, condemn them all, and agree with the Democrats.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.740
This was an insurrection and all this nonsense.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.580
We have got to purge the Republican Party, and it has to start at the bottom up.

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:22.780
You gotta purge out all the rhinos, all the cowards or traitors that dominate the GOP.

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:23.780
Oh, they're gone.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:28.080
It is full, infested with both of those, both traitors and cowards.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.380
You gotta purge them out and put real patriots in there, like Mrs. Green, and you gotta get

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:33.380
more of that.

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.380
You gotta get more Marjorie Taylor Greens in there.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:42.180
Do not, do not, for one second, do not, Stewart Rhodes, for one second, say that someone else

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.660
is a coward.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.660
For one second.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:49.660
One, you're going on this show lying about the shit that you did on the 6th.

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:54.760
If you were not a coward, Stewart fucking coward-ass Rhodes, then you would have turned

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.020
yourself in, you would have claimed that this whole thing is bullshit, and you would have

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.860
said, I'm going to stand and fight these fucking charges because I'm not a coward.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:08.740
And instead, you went on a radio show, not even a good one, you went on a shitty radio

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:11.980
show to say, ooh, I didn't do any, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:14.620
They're going to blame me for stuff that I had nothing to do with.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.940
I'm not involved in the, they went rogue.

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:18.940
The North Carolina guys went rogue.

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:23.660
I'm not, we need to get rid of cowards and traitors because the North Carolina guys went

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:24.660
rogue.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:28.180
The North Carolina guys went rogue and did all the things that we constantly talk about

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:29.180
doing.

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:32.460
No one is a bigger coward than Stewart Rhodes.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.460
No, no, no, no.

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.460
That fucking coward.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.460
No, no, no.

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:37.460
Marco Rubio.

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:38.460
Oh, that's fair.

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:39.460
That's fair.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.460
Mainline Republicans.

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.860
We need to vote him out and get more Marjorie Taylor Greene's in.

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.260
We need to get rid of cowards.

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:49.060
Now, whoa, whoa, whoa, the federal government did, I didn't do anything, oh, no, no, I will

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.900
never take responsibility for any of my actions.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:51.900
Of course not.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:56.500
It also insinuates that even if that goes through, it might, it's not going to really

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.940
work, but it might help.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:58.940
What a fucking asshole.

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.580
Still thinks that violence probably is going to happen.

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:01.580
What an asshole.

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:06.600
So we get towards the end of this interview and Harrison gives us, you know, basically

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.620
like what this is mostly really actually about.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.620
Yeah.

01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:13.740
I want you to tell us, Stewart, what, like somebody who's listening right now, they see

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.360
what's going on and they're thinking, what do I do as soon as this program's over?

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360
What do I do?

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.360
Of course, go to Infowarsstore.com.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.420
You can go to Oathkeepers.org, but what can they do?

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:23.420
Who do they call?

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.420
Ghostbusters.

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:25.420
Yep.

01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:26.420
All right.

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:27.420
Yep.

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:34.820
I mean, it's more or less a 40 minute infomercial for, uh, for, uh, Stewart Rhodes feigning

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:38.940
ignorance and innocence and then also trying to get money.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.820
Why not just tell Stewart to take some of that fucking chill, man?

01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:47.660
If you're going to be dramatic about the post-constitutional America, we got some products that will chill

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:48.820
you the fuck down.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:49.820
I will say-

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.100
Protect you from 5G and get you ready for your day.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.100
Here's that it works.

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.300
It seemed to get that dude pretty high.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.300
Yeah.

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:57.300
I don't know.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.020
I mean, I have trouble sleeping sometimes.

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:01.580
Maybe I should, uh, I mean, no, I will not.

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.580
I want to make this clear.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:07.300
I have gotten this question a couple of times and, uh, especially recently people have asked,

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.700
have I ever tried Alex's product?

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:10.700
Oh, good god no.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:11.700
Fuck no.

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.700
And we haven't addressed this in a while.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:13.700
No.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:14.700
No.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.700
Nor would I ever.

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.700
No, no, no, no, no.

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.700
Other people do those videos.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.700
You can watch them.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:19.700
But for us, we're just going to be sad.

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.700
Yeah.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.980
We're going to be like, ugh, this is disgusting.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:22.980
Why would anybody do this to themselves?

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.980
It would be a real bummer.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.460
And then we would be realizing that we were doing it.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.260
And then we'd get so sad.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:32.540
So we come to the end of this and one of the things that I really am pretty insistent on

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:36.620
in my own head is I'm going to be paying more attention to Harrison.

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.340
This dude is a real fucking problem.

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.300
This dude's a Nazi Nazi.

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:50.260
I mean, the kind of thing that is apparently acceptable conversation on his show is further

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.980
than most of the time that you see on Alex's show.

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:57.500
It's outrageous, the kind of things that you'll hear on here.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:02.900
I did not think I would get to this point, but Harrison brought me here a lot faster

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.700
than I was expecting.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.740
I miss David Knight.

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:07.740
Yeah.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:09.340
Boring as hell.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.700
Boring, but he wasn't a...

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.620
But he knew how to walk that line.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:19.580
And honestly, I think that, not to be too explicit about my feelings about this, I honestly

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.740
think that this is revealing too much.

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:25.780
I think that this is actually an incredibly bad strategy on their part.

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:30.540
I think that this is bad for Infowars and as such, it appears to be a head poking up

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.460
and I'm going to play whack-a-mole with it.

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:37.740
I'm going to pay more attention to him because I think it's a soft exposed underbelly and

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:42.940
a fucking idiot who doesn't know how to play the game that Alex and Owen Troyer clearly

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.860
play better, where they can shut this stuff down.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.020
They can give the appearance of signaling to these white nationalists and anti-Semites.

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:53.300
Listen, I love your call, but this isn't really the topic that we're going on right now.

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.300
Click next one.

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.300
Yes, absolutely.

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.300
Yep, totally.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:02.480
Harrison clearly either doesn't have the desire or the ability or the smoothness to be able

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:06.740
to have all that in the package of his presentation.

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:11.740
And I think that through that we'll probably see a lot of really, really fucked up stuff.

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:17.620
Yeah, we, we, I used to joke about it that one of the reasons that it was edifying to

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:21.480
watch Alex Jones, one of the reasons that we do this show is because Alex was the weakest

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.900
link in the propaganda chain.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.740
And now Harrison is the weakest link of Infowars.

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.940
Harrison is way weaker than him.

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.940
Harrison's not even a link.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:29.940
Holy shit.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:33.660
Harrison's a fucking flower, a dandelion, people twirled into a circle.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:38.220
So we'll check back in on him from time to time, I'll be trying to pay attention, keep

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:40.620
up with him, as well as Alex.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:46.340
Monday, hopefully Alex will be back from his grocery store adventure and we'll have a Alex

01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:47.340
Jones episode.

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.700
That's something that's really funny, just to cleanse our-

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.700
Sorry, sorry guys.

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.980
We were going to do an Alex episode, but he was at the grocery store.

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:59.880
Just to cleanse our palates after this, we have Stuart Rhodes lying his ass off, Harrison

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.140
fielding calls from outright anti-Semite Nazi types.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.660
And all the meanwhile, Alex.

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:09.020
Because the state is so frickin' awesome.

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:11.020
Florida is awesome!

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:12.020
Yeah, Florida!

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:16.020
And seed the table, the great old farms!

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:20.740
Give it up for all the great crew here, folks!

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.740
Yeah!

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:23.460
Everybody's shopping in this place, it's awesome.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.580
Alex flew to Florida for three claps.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.860
Everybody be shopping.

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:34.060
Hey, this seems like a great way to take a vacation while still pretending to work.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.780
Yeah, and go pay Roger a visit, I'm sure.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:37.780
Yeah, exactly.

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:38.780
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.420
Anyway, we'll be back on Monday, but until then Jordan, we have a website.

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.140
We do have a website, it's knowledgefight.com.

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:44.060
Yes, we are also on Twitter.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.380

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:52.900
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.900
doing God's work right now.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:57.860

01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:01.940
Arundis, I am the prince of the pan flute.

01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:03.940

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:08.940
