Daaaagh

00:13.460 --> 00:16.020
Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh

00:16.020 --> 00:18.300
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.300 --> 00:19.340
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

00:19.340 --> 00:20.540
knowledgefight.com

00:20.540 --> 00:21.360
It's time to pray

00:21.360 --> 00:24.000
I have great respect for knowledge fight

00:24.000 --> 00:25.100
Knowledge fight

00:25.100 --> 00:27.400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.400 --> 00:28.940
saying we are the bad guys

00:28.940 --> 00:30.060
Knowledge Fight.

Dan and Jorg.

Ah, need, ah, need money.

00:36.380 --> 00:39.340
Riddle word, riddle word, riddle word.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.380
Andy and Kansas.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.220
Andy and Kansas.

00:42.220 --> 00:42.860
Stop it.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.620
Andy and Can, Andy and Kansas.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.220
Andy and, Andy.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.180
It's time to pray.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.540
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:48.540 --> 00:49.340
Thanks for holding.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.060
Hello, Alex.

00:50.060 --> 00:51.020
I'm a first-time caller.

00:51.020 --> 00:51.820
I'm a huge fan.

00:51.820 --> 00:53.020
I love your work.

00:53.020 --> 00:53.820
Knowledge Fight.

00:55.740 --> 00:56.860
Knowledge Fight dot com.

00:56.860 --> 00:59.340
I love you.

00:59.340 --> 01:00.300
Hey, everybody.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.180
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:01.180 --> 01:01.500
I'm Dan.

01:01.500 --> 01:01.980
I'm Jordan.

01:01.980 --> 01:02.540
We're a couple dudes.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.140
Like to sit around, drink novelty beverages,

01:04.140 --> 01:05.580
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.180
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.180 --> 01:07.660
Jordan.

01:07.660 --> 01:08.300
Dan.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.340
Jordan.

01:09.340 --> 01:10.140
I have a quick question.

01:10.140 --> 01:10.860
Sure, what up?

01:10.860 --> 01:11.820
What's your bright spot today?

01:11.820 --> 01:15.500
My bright spot today, Jordan, is that we're back to Alex Jones.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.140
He came back.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.660
He came back from the grocery store?

01:17.660 --> 01:18.860
He came back from the grocery store.

01:18.860 --> 01:20.300
That's a little surprising.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.060
Yeah, it is, and that's why it's a bright spot.

01:22.060 --> 01:25.420
I actually feel like I'm doing the thing that I set out to do

01:25.420 --> 01:29.020
instead of looking at Owen Schroyer filling in,

01:29.020 --> 01:31.020
and just being like, where is he?

01:31.580 --> 01:32.540
What is going on?

01:32.540 --> 01:36.140
And his stories of his time away, not to be believed.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.020
I'm very excited.

01:37.020 --> 01:37.580
Oh, OK.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.780
A lot of globalists and a lot of hot tubs.

01:40.780 --> 01:41.980
Maybe the reverse of that.

01:41.980 --> 01:42.220
OK.

01:42.220 --> 01:46.060
Anti-globalist outside of hot tubs.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.900
OK, that's a new genre of story.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.340
Yeah, but it feels good.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.500
It feels good for Alex to be back in studio

01:51.500 --> 01:54.220
and be full of shit, and I enjoy that.

01:54.220 --> 01:55.900
It's a sad bright spot.

01:55.900 --> 01:56.300
It is.

01:57.820 --> 02:01.500
Part of me hoped that Alex would give up the whole radio thing

02:01.500 --> 02:04.780
and just become kind of a troll that lives in the grocery store

02:04.780 --> 02:07.820
in the Mexican food section, just popping out and being like,

02:07.820 --> 02:08.940
are you sure you want this?

02:09.500 --> 02:10.780
You want the big enchilada.

02:10.780 --> 02:11.820
Yeah, exactly.

02:11.820 --> 02:12.860
Like, OK, all right.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.620
We're going to get to the big enchilada here in a second

02:14.620 --> 02:15.820
after this next break.

02:15.820 --> 02:18.700
Apparently, this grocery store is racist at me.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.260
I feel like Alex would fit in in the deli.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.860
I don't know, I actually don't even know.

02:24.860 --> 02:25.340
Here's the thing.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.020
Interesting thing about that grocery store

02:27.020 --> 02:29.260
is that it's also like a big restaurant.

02:29.260 --> 02:30.060
Naturally, yes.

02:30.060 --> 02:34.220
So it's like this large market slash Alex could...

02:34.220 --> 02:35.660
It's like a bazaar, if you will.

02:35.660 --> 02:37.660
Alex could, like, clean up, maybe.

02:37.660 --> 02:38.140
I don't know.

02:38.140 --> 02:38.620
Sure.

02:38.620 --> 02:39.900
I wouldn't hire him.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.420
He seems like a bad employee.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.340
I do feel like eventually we're going to see

02:44.140 --> 02:46.940
a remake of The Wrestler, but it's just Alex.

02:46.940 --> 02:50.300
A lot of that movie will be about insubordination

02:50.300 --> 02:52.140
on the part of Alex as an employee.

02:52.140 --> 02:53.820
I don't think he would take direction well.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.580
It's a pound and a half of meat.

02:55.580 --> 02:56.060
Take it.

02:57.580 --> 02:58.860
So what's your bright spot?

02:58.860 --> 03:01.820
My bright spot, Dan, is H. John Benjamin.

03:01.820 --> 03:02.380
He's great.

03:02.380 --> 03:05.580
I was watching some Bob's Burgers, as you do,

03:05.580 --> 03:06.860
because it's a fantastic show.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.620
You're trying to catch up on the Jay Johnson news?

03:08.620 --> 03:09.260
Of course.

03:09.260 --> 03:09.660
Of course.

03:09.660 --> 03:10.540
I want to see where...

03:10.540 --> 03:13.100
Do you think there's any clues as to whether or not

03:13.100 --> 03:14.060
it was him at the Capitol?

03:14.060 --> 03:15.900
Yeah, I want to see if Jimmy Pesto is OK.

03:17.580 --> 03:18.860
But then I started thinking about it.

03:18.860 --> 03:22.380
I really... I have been listening to H. John Benjamin

03:22.380 --> 03:23.820
since I was like 10.

03:23.820 --> 03:24.940
Yeah, Dr. Katz.

03:24.940 --> 03:25.900
Dr. Katz?

03:25.900 --> 03:29.500
Yeah, from the jump I was watching Dr. Katz

03:29.500 --> 03:30.860
as like a little kid.

03:30.860 --> 03:31.260
Yeah.

03:31.260 --> 03:35.420
And now I'm a full grown man and H. John Benjamin

03:35.420 --> 03:36.860
is still in my life.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.700
Yeah, that is interesting to think about.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.300
I don't know if I have gone a year.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.500
Archer? Other shows?

03:45.820 --> 03:46.860
Yeah, probably not.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.900
He's even had his own shows on Comedy Central

03:49.900 --> 03:51.580
that were incredibly short lived.

03:52.220 --> 03:52.620
Sure.

03:52.620 --> 03:53.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.540
I think he's been everywhere for 20 years at least.

03:57.180 --> 04:01.420
And so I wanted to celebrate that I've always enjoyed

04:01.420 --> 04:02.780
H. John Benjamin in my life.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.380
I've never had a moment where I was like,

04:04.380 --> 04:05.340
oh, too much.

04:05.340 --> 04:05.820
Yeah.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.100
Now that's an achievement.

04:07.100 --> 04:07.740
Yeah, for sure.

04:07.740 --> 04:08.140
Yeah.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.940
Some of his stand up stuff was really funny too,

04:10.940 --> 04:13.260
like from that Invite Them Up CD.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.060
Totally.

04:14.060 --> 04:15.500
That Forgetta Buddies.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.540
He's really funny in like a genuine,

04:18.540 --> 04:20.140
he's not just a voice either.

04:20.140 --> 04:21.340
No, he's incredible.

04:21.340 --> 04:25.340
One of our generation's great comedic talents

04:25.340 --> 04:31.180
and so jealous of his career in terms of how famous he is.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.820
Because he could probably go to that store,

04:33.820 --> 04:35.020
that grocery store where Alex is at.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.140
No one has any idea.

04:36.140 --> 04:36.620
Yeah, exactly.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.060
He's perfect famous.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.620
As long as he does a slightly different voice.

04:40.620 --> 04:41.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.380
He could slide by without people bothering him probably.

04:44.380 --> 04:47.100
It is nice that, and also it's not

04:47.100 --> 04:50.380
like he's a guy who got famous for doing

04:50.380 --> 04:52.300
so many different voices.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.660
It's his voice.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.020
It's mostly the same voice.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.380
And a little bit different.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.140
And it's perfect every day.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.940
So anyway, Jordan, let's get down to business

05:00.940 --> 05:01.580
on today's episode.

05:01.580 --> 05:02.060
Let's do it.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.500
Today what we're going to be doing

05:03.500 --> 05:06.300
is talking about March 15th and 16th, 2021.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.100
Blackjack!

05:07.100 --> 05:07.580
That was a tie.

05:07.580 --> 05:08.300
Oh, that was a tie.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.100
That was pretty close.

05:09.100 --> 05:09.660
That was probably a tie.

05:09.660 --> 05:11.820
I was really, I was looking at your lips,

05:11.820 --> 05:13.340
like waiting for it to begin.

05:13.340 --> 05:13.980
Yeah, yeah.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.660
It might've been as close as we've come to.

05:15.660 --> 05:17.180
That was, hey, dealer got blackjacked.

05:17.180 --> 05:17.820
Yeah, that's true.

05:17.820 --> 05:18.380
That's a push.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.100
You still won though.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.140
Did you get insurance?

05:20.140 --> 05:21.260
I did not.

05:21.260 --> 05:21.820
Nope.

05:21.820 --> 05:22.620
All right.

05:22.620 --> 05:23.660
Well, all right.

05:24.780 --> 05:26.300
So it's interesting.

05:26.300 --> 05:27.500
I was thinking about this, and this

05:27.500 --> 05:30.140
is kind of an indication of how like my brain went

05:30.140 --> 05:31.340
into some flights of fancy.

05:31.980 --> 05:36.940
Like, hey, you know, like the 14th, that's Pi Day 3.14.

05:36.940 --> 05:37.260
Sure.

05:37.260 --> 05:37.900
Right?

05:37.900 --> 05:39.420
15th is the Ides of March.

05:39.420 --> 05:39.900
True.

05:39.900 --> 05:43.020
16th is 3.16, Austin 3.16.

05:43.020 --> 05:45.500
Naturally, this is a big three stretch.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.060
It's amazing.

05:46.060 --> 05:46.620
It's huge.

05:46.620 --> 05:49.340
I don't know if there are, like, obviously there's like

05:49.340 --> 05:52.380
Christmas Eve, Christmas Boxing Day kind of thing.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.060
Those are kind of related.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.580
When's St. Patrick's Day this year?

05:56.140 --> 05:59.020
I think St. Patrick's Day weekend was this last weekend.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.220
We already have it?

06:00.220 --> 06:00.540
Oh.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.980
I know that they turned the river green.

06:01.980 --> 06:02.540
Did they?

06:02.540 --> 06:03.100
Yeah.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.380
Pandemic really changes Chicago and St. Patrick's Day.

06:06.380 --> 06:09.100
Yeah, you don't get to see people throwing up on walls.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.060
It's not terrible.

06:10.060 --> 06:10.940
It's not all bad.

06:10.940 --> 06:14.060
I don't miss when I used to live over by Clark Street,

06:14.060 --> 06:15.020
over by Wrigleyville.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.340
That was a menace.

06:17.340 --> 06:18.220
No, no.

06:18.220 --> 06:18.860
Oh, God.

06:18.860 --> 06:21.500
A friend talked me into going to that Sluggers,

06:21.500 --> 06:24.060
that bar that has a batting cage on the second floor.

06:24.060 --> 06:24.700
Oh, no.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.300
On St. Patrick's Day weekend.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.060
No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:28.060 --> 06:28.700
Oh, no.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.100
Just the humanity that you witnessed.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.580
I'm so proud that you're still here.

06:33.580 --> 06:34.140
Yeah.

06:34.140 --> 06:35.660
It was touch and go for a little bit.

06:36.460 --> 06:40.380
But anyway, three stretch days of holidays

06:40.380 --> 06:42.060
that aren't really holidays aside.

06:42.940 --> 06:43.580
Well, for us, then.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.340
We're back to Alex Jones, and that's exciting.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.620
So we'll get down to business on that.

06:46.620 --> 06:47.820
But before we do, Jordan, let's take a moment

06:47.820 --> 06:50.380
to say thank you to some folks who are wonks.

06:50.380 --> 06:51.580
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:51.580 --> 06:52.380
Here's what we got today.

06:52.380 --> 06:52.860
What do we got?

06:52.860 --> 06:53.980
We got a couple of wonks.

06:53.980 --> 06:54.300
OK.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.420
Couple of technocrats.

06:55.420 --> 06:55.820
All right.

06:55.820 --> 06:56.700
Got some birthdays.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.820
Anybody get married?

06:57.820 --> 07:00.780
No, no marriages that I remember.

07:00.780 --> 07:03.580
But then we have to have a symposium

07:03.580 --> 07:05.500
about the whole birthday thing.

07:05.500 --> 07:05.820
OK.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.260
I want to pitch a new plan.

07:09.260 --> 07:09.500
OK.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.260
And so we'll get to that here in a moment.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.100
First, Eric the HR jerk.

07:13.100 --> 07:13.580
Thank you so much.

07:13.580 --> 07:14.940
You are now a policy wonk.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.060
I'm a policy wonk.

07:16.060 --> 07:16.860
Thanks, Eric.

07:16.860 --> 07:17.260
Thank you.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.300
Next, 21 Blackjack.

07:19.100 --> 07:19.500
All right.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.100
Well, that's hardly fair.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.220
I'm a policy wonk.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.260
Thank you very much.

07:23.260 --> 07:23.820
The 21.

07:24.540 --> 07:25.100
Blackjack.

07:25.100 --> 07:25.660
There you go.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.540
I'll let you have that.

07:26.540 --> 07:26.940
Thank you.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.100
And shout out to a couple of technocrats.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.740
There are hot raptors seeking chocolate in your area.

07:31.740 --> 07:32.300
Thank you so much.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.420
You are now a technocrat.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.940
And Ian Kay, aka Carn Dog.

07:36.940 --> 07:37.500
Thank you so much.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.940
You are now a technocrat.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.140
I'm a policy wonk.

07:40.140 --> 07:40.940
Crikey, mate.

07:40.940 --> 07:41.820
That's fantastic.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.180
Have yourself a brew.

07:43.180 --> 07:44.620
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:44.620 --> 07:44.860
All right.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.420
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

07:47.420 --> 07:48.700
Let's just get down to business.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.780
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:50.780 --> 07:52.060
Why are you pimps so good?

07:52.780 --> 07:54.460
My neck is freakishly large.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.020
I declare info war on you.

07:57.020 --> 07:57.740
Thank you so much.

07:57.740 --> 07:59.660
There are hot raptors seeking chocolate in your area.

07:59.660 --> 08:00.380
And Carn Dog.

08:00.380 --> 08:00.780
Yes.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.220
Thank you very much to the both of you.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.260
So Jordan, here's the thing.

08:03.820 --> 08:07.660
I'm a little bit sometimes behind on some messages.

08:07.660 --> 08:08.060
A little bit.

08:08.060 --> 08:10.860
Every now and again, I lose track of some of the inbox.

08:10.860 --> 08:14.060
And so I sometimes don't see some of these birthday shout

08:14.060 --> 08:14.860
outs, and I feel bad.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.260
As is the case with a couple of these shout outs today.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.260
These are bladed birthday shout outs.

08:19.260 --> 08:19.660
Yeah, of course.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.500
This is like when your grandma would send a check,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.820
and it would be like for $5, and it would come three weeks

08:23.820 --> 08:24.140
late.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.500
Right, right, right, right.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.860
Yeah, this is from March 22, 2020.

08:29.980 --> 08:30.860
It's not that far.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.020
So what I want to do, I want to institute a new thing,

08:35.020 --> 08:36.460
because this is getting to be too much.

08:36.460 --> 08:39.500
And I love making people's birthdays special.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.500
I love being able to do that.

08:41.500 --> 08:41.820
Yeah.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.020
We got to do this once a month.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.980
We got to do birthday roundup for the months.

08:45.980 --> 08:49.500
So from now on, by the end of the month,

08:49.500 --> 08:51.660
if you want to send me a birthday shout out

08:51.660 --> 08:54.940
that you want us to do for the next month, we'll do it.

08:56.380 --> 08:57.900
I'll probably lose track of some.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.500
I was going to say this.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.460
This isn't going to work.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.820
This is going to be such a...

09:03.820 --> 09:06.860
I do like any solution that doesn't have anything

09:06.860 --> 09:08.780
to do with the problem, which is that we're

09:08.780 --> 09:10.380
terrible with correspondence.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.700
Terrible with correspondence, and I'm

09:12.700 --> 09:15.980
only good at keeping certain things in order in my head.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.700
It's unfortunate that we live in a world

09:18.700 --> 09:21.260
where we read every email and respond in our head

09:21.260 --> 09:22.940
and then forget to actually do it.

09:22.940 --> 09:23.900
That is a big problem.

09:23.900 --> 09:24.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:24.540 --> 09:26.140
And then the second problem that I have

09:26.140 --> 09:28.460
is I think I'm just a little bit too old.

09:28.460 --> 09:31.100
If I was born maybe a couple of years earlier,

09:31.100 --> 09:34.060
I would have really integrated a lot of the technologies

09:34.060 --> 09:37.660
in terms of organization and like, I don't know.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.340
What is like QuickBooks for a to-do list?

09:41.340 --> 09:44.540
Yeah, but it goes a little too far sometimes.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.580
My partner, she'll respond to emails from students

09:47.580 --> 09:51.260
at like 10 p.m. because it shows up on her phone.

09:51.260 --> 09:53.420
And it's like, well, that's not a good work-life balance.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.260
I think that might be better, though,

09:55.260 --> 09:59.740
in terms of keeping things moving smoothly.

09:59.740 --> 10:00.460
There's that.

10:00.460 --> 10:03.580
But Mitch W., you had a birthday earlier this month.

10:03.580 --> 10:04.220
Happy birthday.

10:04.220 --> 10:04.540
Happy birthday, Mitch.

10:04.540 --> 10:05.660
Hope you had a great one.

10:05.660 --> 10:08.940
Also, Adrian, Trey wants to send a little happy birthday

10:08.940 --> 10:11.020
message out to you earlier this month.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.140
Sorry we missed it.

10:12.140 --> 10:12.780
Yeah.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.300
And Dylan.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.180
What's up, Dylan?

10:15.180 --> 10:15.900
Hey, Dylan.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.740
Carrie got in touch with us, wants

10:17.740 --> 10:18.700
to wish you a happy birthday.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.580
March babies.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.940
Yeah, we got it.

10:22.940 --> 10:23.500
All right.

10:23.500 --> 10:23.820
OK.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.580
So Jordan, we had an interesting episode

10:25.580 --> 10:27.180
to go over, a whole lot of bullshit.

10:27.180 --> 10:30.780
And in lieu of an out-of-context drop,

10:30.780 --> 10:32.780
I wanted to do something a little bit special.

10:33.740 --> 10:38.220
And so Mika, or maybe Micah, I'm not entirely sure, M-I-K-A,

10:38.220 --> 10:38.940
got in touch.

10:38.940 --> 10:44.780
And their partner had, it's the anniversary

10:44.780 --> 10:46.540
of working from home.

10:46.540 --> 10:47.580
Oh, no.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.980
And apparently, they may have some hydration problems.

10:49.980 --> 10:50.460
OK.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.540
So Jason Bowman, go drink some water.

10:52.540 --> 10:57.020
The UN says you don't need vitamin C, oxygen, or water.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.700
Now, when you fly in an airplane,

10:59.340 --> 11:01.660
do not drink the water.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.380
No.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.460
Is Putin putting sugar water in people?

11:04.460 --> 11:06.140
Absolutely, to end the hysteria.

11:06.780 --> 11:09.660
I have water samples still that I

11:09.660 --> 11:12.220
have kept for several months in my refrigerator.

11:12.220 --> 11:16.620
And it's amazing what happens over the long term.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.420
You should shoot a YouTube video of that and show it.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.420
But that's really unscientific.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.660
And I'm not poo-pooing the fact that you're doing that.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.820
That's a good way to start out observing things.

11:25.820 --> 11:26.940
But I appreciate your call.

11:26.940 --> 11:27.820
Go drink some water.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.740
Go drink some goddamn water.

11:29.740 --> 11:30.060
All right.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.100
Now, down to business.

11:31.100 --> 11:31.340
OK.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.580
We'll start here on the 15th.

11:33.580 --> 11:38.060
And I would say that Alex, he's been gone for a week.

11:38.060 --> 11:41.980
And I was interested to see how he was going to return.

11:41.980 --> 11:42.940
And he came in.

11:42.940 --> 11:46.780
And the way I would describe him is dramatic and a little low

11:46.780 --> 11:47.340
register.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.340
He comes back from his weird vacations, usually.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.180
Well, he's got a day where he's a little bit down.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.140
He's a little sleepy.

11:54.140 --> 11:54.380
Yeah.

11:55.260 --> 11:57.820
Ladies and gentlemen, we could not

11:57.820 --> 11:59.980
be doing more important work right now.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.140
I'm very honored to be your host.

12:02.140 --> 12:07.740
Very honored to be here with you on this live March 15th,

12:07.740 --> 12:10.620
Monday, global transmission, the Ides of March.

12:10.620 --> 12:21.260
I am going to air a special report here.

12:22.780 --> 12:26.620
And then when I return, we're going to get into the earth

12:26.620 --> 12:31.660
shaking developments that are unfolding here today.

12:31.660 --> 12:32.780
Weird vibe.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.820
I'm going to start the show and then leave.

12:35.820 --> 12:37.340
I'm going to play a report.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.220
I'm going to get out of here.

12:38.220 --> 12:41.660
It's a weird vibe, but it's also not that weird from listening

12:41.660 --> 12:42.940
to his show a lot.

12:42.940 --> 12:47.900
It's fairly like do regular for Alex, but it is weird.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.100
It's a strange vibe.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.180
And I was like, there's something going on.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.020
And then I realized what it was later.

12:53.020 --> 12:54.060
Alex reveals.

12:54.060 --> 12:55.980
So the mystery will be solved.

12:55.980 --> 12:57.260
Why is Alex so weird?

12:57.260 --> 12:57.980
That's good.

12:57.980 --> 13:01.260
But he breaks down some of the big headlines like boxing

13:01.260 --> 13:02.620
great Marvin Hagler.

13:02.620 --> 13:03.740
Oh, rest in peace.

13:03.740 --> 13:03.980
Yeah.

13:03.980 --> 13:09.980
You don't just have marvelous Marvin Hagler dying a day after

13:09.980 --> 13:10.700
he took the vaccine.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.540
You don't just have Hank Aaron dying after he got the second

13:14.540 --> 13:18.780
vaccine. You have the media lying and battling to keep that

13:18.780 --> 13:21.980
information coming out from the families because they can

13:21.980 --> 13:23.580
cover up average people dying.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.900
It's hard to cover up sports icons.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.020
So the idea that boxing great Marvin Hagler died after getting

13:29.020 --> 13:32.300
a COVID-19 vaccine didn't come from any solid reporting that

13:32.300 --> 13:33.900
Alex is working off of.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.780
He's taking that information from a random Facebook post by

13:36.780 --> 13:38.060
another boxer.

13:38.060 --> 13:40.620
Hagler's wife, Kay, has come out and been clear that this is

13:40.620 --> 13:43.420
not the case and that he passed away from natural causes.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.540
I can't determine whether or not Hagler had been vaccinated.

13:46.540 --> 13:49.580
And if he had, I have no idea when he would have gotten the

13:49.580 --> 13:50.220
vaccine.

13:50.220 --> 13:53.180
My point here is that I really want to demonstrate the flimsy

13:53.180 --> 13:55.340
level of information Alex works with.

13:55.340 --> 13:58.140
He has absolutely zero evidence past that Facebook post that

13:58.140 --> 14:00.860
Hagler's death is related to a vaccination, and that's

14:00.860 --> 14:03.580
sufficient for him to report it definitively.

14:03.580 --> 14:05.820
No one interested in getting the story right could possibly

14:05.820 --> 14:07.420
use that as a workflow.

14:07.420 --> 14:10.460
Also, there's been no evidence found that suggests that Hank

14:10.460 --> 14:12.780
Aaron's death was related to getting vaccinated two weeks

14:12.780 --> 14:13.340
prior.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.780
He was 86 years old.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.180
So who knows what the case is there?

14:17.180 --> 14:18.540
Yeah, it's also shit.

14:18.540 --> 14:22.300
Also, Alex should keep those two names specifically out the

14:22.300 --> 14:23.260
fuck of his mouth.

14:23.260 --> 14:23.820
You'd be nice.

14:23.820 --> 14:29.500
Those Marvelous Marvin dealt with so much goddamn racism

14:29.500 --> 14:32.700
from guys exactly like fucking Alex.

14:32.700 --> 14:36.940
Hank Aaron dealt with so much fucking racism from guys like

14:36.940 --> 14:37.740
fucking Alex.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.660
Keep their names out of your mouth.

14:39.660 --> 14:40.220
You'd be nice.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.740
So as we know, Alex was hanging out in a grocery store for

14:43.740 --> 14:44.220
a little bit.

14:44.220 --> 14:44.780
Sure.

14:44.780 --> 14:48.140
But early on in the show, he gives us a little bit of an

14:48.140 --> 14:50.380
indication of what he might have actually been up to.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.980
He might have been doing something a little bit

14:51.980 --> 14:52.540
nefarious.

14:53.420 --> 14:56.380
I'm very honored to be back in studio with all of you.

14:56.380 --> 15:03.580
I had an amazingly powerful trip in Florida that I'm not at

15:03.580 --> 15:06.140
liberty to get into any of on, basically.

15:06.140 --> 15:10.460
But I will give you just some of the basics of how exciting

15:10.460 --> 15:15.900
things are, the major resistance forming, and also a sense

15:15.900 --> 15:20.620
of what this broadcast has done and what this broadcast has

15:20.620 --> 15:22.940
been able to do.

15:22.940 --> 15:26.060
I was like, are you trying to imply that you raised an army

15:26.060 --> 15:26.540
in Florida?

15:26.540 --> 15:31.980
Yeah, he did some clandestine operations down in Florida.

15:31.980 --> 15:32.220
Yeah.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.580
What are we talking about here?

15:33.580 --> 15:36.540
I'm not entirely sure, but he doesn't elaborate more until

15:36.540 --> 15:37.500
later. But I was listening to it.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.740
I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

15:39.740 --> 15:42.540
I talked to Roger Stone for five minutes and he winked at

15:42.540 --> 15:45.420
me. So I know that we're going to destroy the government.

15:45.420 --> 15:49.260
Roger and I were smoking cigars and getting wasted.

15:49.260 --> 15:52.780
And I went to that weird podcast, drank three quarters of

15:52.780 --> 15:54.060
a bottle of Jameson.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.180
You know, it's a good weekend.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.420
Yeah. So then he goes to a special report.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.020
So that's why he doesn't elaborate more.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.420
And man, this is important stuff, man.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.900
Like, I understand Alex has been gone for a week.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.460
He comes in, he's like, we got these special reports we

16:06.460 --> 16:07.020
got to get to.

16:07.020 --> 16:10.700
And I'm like, thank God you did, because hard hitting journalism.

16:11.260 --> 16:15.260
It would have been inspiring to witness the real musicians

16:15.260 --> 16:19.020
who won plenty of awards perform and speak to the public

16:19.020 --> 16:20.220
that supported them.

16:20.220 --> 16:23.420
Stay tuned, because when we come back, Lil Baby gives a

16:23.420 --> 16:25.820
performance you do not want to miss.

16:25.820 --> 16:29.260
But at this point, that is probably too much to ask the

16:29.260 --> 16:32.780
narcissistic hacks who have hijacked the soul of American

16:32.780 --> 16:35.740
music. The real award show would have gotten massive

16:35.740 --> 16:36.220
ratings.

16:36.220 --> 16:39.340
If Grammy winning legends, Bobby Rush, Toots and the

16:39.340 --> 16:43.100
My Tals, John Pine, Chick Corea, and many others had been

16:43.100 --> 16:45.500
given a moment to receive their awards.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.100
Some of them posthumously.

16:47.100 --> 16:51.020
Instead, American music night looked more like a funeral

16:51.020 --> 16:52.140
in a brothel.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.700
Man, John Brown is mad at the Grammys.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.380
Who could have predicted it?

16:56.380 --> 16:58.780
I just don't care.

16:58.780 --> 17:01.180
Yeah, this is one of the more predictable takes.

17:01.740 --> 17:04.300
Info Wars employee mad at Grammys.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.540
Yeah, I was going to say, oh my God.

17:06.540 --> 17:11.100
Oh, no, conservative men are unhappy with women and people

17:11.100 --> 17:12.460
doing interesting things.

17:12.460 --> 17:15.180
Oh, what a strange existence we lead.

17:15.180 --> 17:17.500
But I was also listening to this, and there was a really,

17:18.140 --> 17:20.780
like, there was a part in his report that made me, like,

17:20.780 --> 17:22.700
really, I think he's trolling.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.620
Yeah, I don't think John Brown's serious.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.740
I think he's fucking with people trying to get a rise out

17:27.740 --> 17:30.860
of them so then he can talk about how everyone's mad at

17:30.860 --> 17:31.980
his stupid report.

17:31.980 --> 17:35.980
And here was that point all overseen by the self proclaimed

17:35.980 --> 17:39.900
King and Queen of Crowley and Magic, Beyonce and Jay-Z.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.100
Why has it come to this?

17:41.100 --> 17:45.820
You may ask because the potential of infinite freedom real

17:45.820 --> 17:49.900
American music represents must never be allowed out of its

17:49.900 --> 17:53.660
box, which is buried beneath the Grammy stage.

17:53.660 --> 17:58.380
Opening that box would spread truth far and wide to a populace

17:58.380 --> 17:59.740
that is craving it.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.340
John Bound reporting.

18:01.340 --> 18:02.460
Info Wars.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.220
Tomorrow's news today.

18:04.220 --> 18:05.420
I think he's fucking around.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.260
Like, I don't think he's being serious.

18:07.260 --> 18:07.660
Yeah.

18:07.660 --> 18:09.580
But then what is being serious?

18:09.580 --> 18:09.820
Right.

18:09.820 --> 18:13.420
Like, how much of it is just goofing off and being a dumbass?

18:13.420 --> 18:13.660
Yeah.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.980
And how much, like, do you actually think that Beyonce

18:15.980 --> 18:17.260
does Crowley and Magic?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.140
Of course.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.740
Because I know that Alex would probably say that on his show

18:21.740 --> 18:23.100
of Crowley and Magic, Dan.

18:24.140 --> 18:27.260
That's in line with the Info Wars editorial position.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.500
They're witches and warlocks.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.540
I do appreciate.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.580
Here's how much Beyonce is the Queen.

18:33.580 --> 18:37.980
Even her enemies have to describe her as a Queen in some

18:37.980 --> 18:41.980
fashion. There's no mistaking that she is a powerhouse.

18:41.980 --> 18:42.620
Okay.

18:42.620 --> 18:45.340
So you might as well recontextualize it to her being a

18:45.340 --> 18:46.700
powerhouse at Magic.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.860
Crowley and Witch Lady.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.700
They know Crowley didn't actually do magic, right?

18:52.700 --> 18:57.180
I think that he's just, you know, just trying to piss people

18:57.180 --> 18:59.980
off or just trying to be a dick about stuff that maybe

18:59.980 --> 19:01.340
people will pay attention to.

19:01.340 --> 19:01.740
Sure.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.260
So then, oh, isn't this fun?

19:03.260 --> 19:06.540
Where I can give this a clickbait headline.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.380
Maybe we'll get a thousand more views on it.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.100
Yeah, exactly.

19:09.100 --> 19:09.740
It's very sad.

19:09.740 --> 19:13.180
Can't say wet ass pussy, but I can absolutely say that

19:13.180 --> 19:16.780
Beyonce is a master of Crowley and Magic.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.380
So we get back to Alex after Jon Bowne's very dumb report.

19:20.380 --> 19:23.100
And he wants to talk more about Hagler.

19:23.740 --> 19:26.300
Oh, you're not going to see the big corporate produced

19:26.300 --> 19:29.500
establishment program talking about why are all of these

19:29.500 --> 19:32.460
old people and young people and black people and white

19:32.460 --> 19:35.820
people and others dying from the mRNA vaccines?

19:35.820 --> 19:40.620
Oh, no, you're not going to hear about all of these baseball

19:40.620 --> 19:43.260
players and famous boxers, heavyweight champion of the world.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.580
Marvelous Marvin Hagler dying a day after he took the shot.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.500
His family said that's what killed him.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.220
Totally healthy.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.060
Took it dead 24 hours later.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.340
His liver dissolved.

19:53.340 --> 19:55.660
So Alex is reporting that Hagler's family has said that

19:55.660 --> 19:57.100
the death was related to the vaccine.

19:57.100 --> 20:00.140
And I would like to officially challenge him to back that

20:00.140 --> 20:00.940
claim up.

20:00.940 --> 20:03.260
The only statement I can find from his family is from his

20:03.260 --> 20:06.140
wife, who said, quote, for sure wasn't the vaccine that

20:06.140 --> 20:07.180
caused his death.

20:07.180 --> 20:10.860
My baby left in peace with his usual smile, and now is not

20:10.860 --> 20:12.700
the time to talk nonsense.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.420
Alex needs to back up his claim or else he needs to retract

20:15.420 --> 20:19.100
this slanderous bit of business and apologize to the Hagler

20:19.100 --> 20:21.980
family. Their pain is not a prop for him to use to push

20:21.980 --> 20:23.260
anti-vax narratives.

20:23.260 --> 20:24.620
This is just horseshit.

20:24.620 --> 20:29.180
No, and, you know, he was a fighter.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.300
He took a lot of hits.

20:32.300 --> 20:35.740
And Marvelous Marvin was somewhat known for being willing

20:35.740 --> 20:39.580
to take a hit and just keep coming and beat the shit out

20:39.580 --> 20:40.300
of you.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.100
He was so good.

20:41.900 --> 20:42.380
Yeah.

20:42.380 --> 20:42.940
Yeah.

20:42.940 --> 20:47.260
So I was, like I said, in a strange state where I was like,

20:47.260 --> 20:49.500
Alex has got a weird fucking energy at the beginning of

20:49.500 --> 20:50.220
this. What's going on?

20:50.220 --> 20:52.780
He's going immediately to reports after being gone for a

20:52.780 --> 20:55.180
week. Like, shouldn't he be hungry?

20:55.180 --> 20:57.660
And then I realized what was going on.

20:57.660 --> 20:58.540
We're going to go to break.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.220
I'm going to come back with all the news, but I wanted to

21:00.220 --> 21:01.020
get to that first.

21:03.340 --> 21:04.540
And this is a live broadcast.

21:04.540 --> 21:06.780
Quite frankly, the start of the show, I was having earpiece

21:06.780 --> 21:09.500
problems, so we had to air some of those reports.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.340
Those are great reports need air anyways.

21:11.340 --> 21:12.780
Maybe I should just air our reports here.

21:12.780 --> 21:15.580
Maybe I should just hang it up and hang the hat up for a

21:15.580 --> 21:16.380
while. Do it.

21:17.740 --> 21:18.700
Go back to the store.

21:18.700 --> 21:19.740
I'm not going back in the face of all this.

21:19.740 --> 21:25.020
I just realized, though, that if Americans themselves don't

21:25.020 --> 21:27.820
stand up and don't say no and don't resist this, we don't

21:27.820 --> 21:28.460
have a future.

21:28.460 --> 21:29.820
We don't have any hope.

21:29.820 --> 21:33.020
I should quit because my earpiece is fucking up.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.020
Quite frankly, none of you are fighting hard enough.

21:35.020 --> 21:35.520
Yep.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.780
My earpiece doesn't work, so that puts me in a bad mood.

21:38.780 --> 21:42.060
So I assume none of you are doing anything right.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.060
And it's all your fault.

21:44.060 --> 21:47.020
I would never quit because I'm a whiny baby.

21:47.020 --> 21:50.060
No, it is absolutely because of you people.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.620
A whiny baby who pays John bound to complain about the

21:52.620 --> 21:53.100
Grammys.

21:53.100 --> 21:53.740
Exactly.

21:53.740 --> 21:54.380
Yes.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.860
The most relevant thing to music.

21:56.860 --> 21:57.340
Damn.

21:57.340 --> 21:57.660
Yeah.

21:57.660 --> 21:58.460
What a dork.

21:58.460 --> 21:58.960
Yeah.

21:59.340 --> 22:02.380
Anyway, Alex gets back to his Florida trip, and here is

22:02.380 --> 22:05.180
where I started to get a sense of what might have been

22:05.180 --> 22:05.740
going on.

22:06.460 --> 22:10.060
And I went to Florida and met with the who's who's that

22:10.060 --> 22:10.300
are there.

22:10.300 --> 22:11.900
And basically, the who's who's are there.

22:13.020 --> 22:13.660
They're all there.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.780
And I wouldn't even call most of these secret meetings,

22:16.780 --> 22:19.100
but there's no reason to name names and get into all of

22:19.100 --> 22:20.940
it. But it was very, very exciting.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.620
And I was given the same message by everyone that I spoke

22:24.620 --> 22:27.420
with that are very, very prominent names in the fight

22:27.420 --> 22:28.460
against the New World Order.

22:28.460 --> 22:29.500
I'll just leave it at that.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.620
The top names, period, are all in Florida.

22:32.620 --> 22:35.580
And they just said, Jones, you launched the whole revolution.

22:36.620 --> 22:37.740
We need you.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.180
We are counting on you.

22:39.180 --> 22:40.700
We're counting on your listeners.

22:40.700 --> 22:46.060
And basically, that we are the engine that is driving

22:47.660 --> 22:50.300
most of the rebellion you see here today.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.660
So Alex has been bestowed the title of the leader of the

22:53.660 --> 22:54.300
rebellion.

22:54.300 --> 22:54.780
Yeah.

22:54.780 --> 22:55.340
Yeah.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.820
I think he's really heavily trying to imply that he went

22:57.820 --> 22:58.540
and talked to Trump.

22:58.540 --> 22:58.860
Yes.

22:58.860 --> 22:59.660
Yeah, of course.

22:59.660 --> 23:00.380
Really heavily.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.180
Of course.

23:01.180 --> 23:04.860
But I think we would know it would have been reported on.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.860
Not only that, Alex would have shot a video there.

23:08.860 --> 23:09.180
Yeah.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.660
He would be yelling about how I met with Trump.

23:11.660 --> 23:11.900
Yeah.

23:11.900 --> 23:15.420
But even then, even if it was like Trump wanted to, you know,

23:15.420 --> 23:18.140
Trump and his team were like, we're not actually going to

23:18.140 --> 23:22.300
let you do that because, you know, you know.

23:22.300 --> 23:22.620
Yeah.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.060
You know, they don't even have to say.

23:24.060 --> 23:25.020
They're just, you know.

23:25.020 --> 23:25.260
Yeah.

23:25.260 --> 23:28.060
You know, but even then, it would have been reported, like,

23:28.060 --> 23:31.660
Alex Jones seen walking into Mar-a-Lago, you know, it would

23:31.660 --> 23:33.020
have been, we would have known.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.180
Stephen Miller spotted at grocery store.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.220
Yeah, exactly.

23:36.220 --> 23:36.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.540
Axis of Evil revived at grocery store.

23:40.540 --> 23:42.940
Yeah, I don't know what to believe about this.

23:42.940 --> 23:46.060
I mean, I think that the world is so fucked up that I could

23:46.060 --> 23:47.820
believe that maybe he did talk to Trump.

23:47.820 --> 23:48.380
Totally.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.940
And I could also believe that he wants people to think that,

23:50.940 --> 23:53.820
and he just hung out with Roger and at a grocery store, and

23:53.820 --> 23:57.260
now is pretending that Trump anointed him leader.

23:57.260 --> 23:57.580
Yeah.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.940
And I can also believe him telling Roger Stone to tell Trump

24:00.940 --> 24:03.500
something is him being like, see, I totally talked to Trump.

24:03.500 --> 24:03.740
Yep.

24:03.740 --> 24:04.140
Yeah.

24:04.140 --> 24:07.100
We have seen many instances of that over the course of this

24:07.100 --> 24:07.340
show.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:08.060 --> 24:12.780
So, but the bigwigs in the anti-globalist fight that Alex

24:12.780 --> 24:14.380
is engaged in.

24:14.380 --> 24:14.700
Sure.

24:14.700 --> 24:15.660
And he's the leader of them.

24:15.660 --> 24:16.460
Sure, sure.

24:17.420 --> 24:17.980
Pop names.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.940
They want to know, like, how do you know what you know, man?

24:20.940 --> 24:22.060
You're so smart.

24:22.060 --> 24:22.540
Dreams.

24:22.540 --> 24:29.980
The most prominent names in the country fighting the

24:29.980 --> 24:31.580
globalist all ask me the same question.

24:31.580 --> 24:32.780
How did you know all that?

24:34.380 --> 24:40.060
And I said, well, I went off globalist documents, but yeah,

24:40.060 --> 24:41.260
there's a lot of documents.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.420
And I said, no, but I know the key groups and their key

24:43.420 --> 24:45.740
plan, and I've seen what they've built so far.

24:45.740 --> 24:47.900
And I see the predictive programming in the news.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.340
So I know what they're going to do.

24:49.340 --> 24:53.740
And they said, well, you certainly do know that I met with

24:53.740 --> 24:56.300
the former head of two US intelligence agencies.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.580
I'll leave it at that.

24:57.580 --> 25:01.980
I met with a lot of other very prominent people, but it was

25:01.980 --> 25:03.100
a form of satisfaction.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.300
I'm not experienced.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.580
I wasn't a triumph.

25:05.580 --> 25:06.380
It wasn't a powerful.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.820
It wasn't good for my ego.

25:07.820 --> 25:11.340
It was like a £1000 weight was taken off my shoulders.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.580
There's still a lot of weight on my shoulders, but I've had

25:13.580 --> 25:17.100
this mission and I've known it was my job, but this time

25:17.100 --> 25:18.940
we're now in to do what we've done.

25:18.940 --> 25:21.260
And I told you that for 20 plus years, I said, this is all

25:21.260 --> 25:21.660
going to come.

25:21.660 --> 25:24.620
It's my mission to get it out upfront so that others can

25:24.620 --> 25:25.660
then carry the ball.

25:25.660 --> 25:28.780
And I just literally have like a vision, but it was beyond

25:28.780 --> 25:31.660
a vision, not like where I saw a hallucination and an angel

25:31.660 --> 25:32.860
appeared or God appeared.

25:32.860 --> 25:34.220
It was more of like a download.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.260
Like you will do this.

25:35.260 --> 25:36.140
This will then happen.

25:36.140 --> 25:37.500
This will then unfold.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.580
And then this next operation will unfold.

25:39.580 --> 25:44.380
And then now I know that I am inspired with my discernment

25:44.380 --> 25:46.940
and my own research to know what to look at, to know what

25:46.940 --> 25:49.900
to understand, and that my understanding of human nature

25:49.900 --> 25:52.220
and how to fight the globalist was dead on.

25:52.220 --> 25:54.460
But that was all given to me by God.

25:55.340 --> 25:59.900
Smartest thing Rush Limbaugh said was talent on loan from

25:59.900 --> 26:03.980
God. And so I just am very humbled to be here, very humble,

26:03.980 --> 26:05.420
very thankful to be with all of you.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.060
I come in here and research all this information and get

26:08.060 --> 26:11.100
very frustrated on air because it's very hard to have time

26:11.100 --> 26:13.100
to get to all of it properly.

26:13.100 --> 26:13.820
I want to tell you this.

26:13.820 --> 26:16.140
We are 40 minutes into the show now.

26:16.140 --> 26:18.460
I kind of thought and Alex hasn't covered anything.

26:19.420 --> 26:22.220
I have written down the moment he said we do important work

26:22.220 --> 26:25.500
here. I was like, okay, let's just tally up some important

26:25.500 --> 26:25.820
work. Yeah.

26:25.820 --> 26:26.380
What do we got?

26:26.380 --> 26:28.860
We've got Marvelous Marvin and Hank Aaron.

26:28.860 --> 26:31.180
We've got his mysterious trip times two.

26:31.180 --> 26:31.820
Right.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.540
We've got the Grammys and we've got my earpiece doesn't

26:34.540 --> 26:35.500
work. Yep.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.140
Important.

26:36.140 --> 26:36.860
That's a lot of it.

26:36.860 --> 26:39.740
Yeah, there were two John bound special reports because

26:39.740 --> 26:41.020
he needed to fix his earpiece.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.700
That was what was going on.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.940
And then he rambled a bunch about how he was anointed the

26:44.940 --> 26:47.340
King of the Patriots when he was hanging out in Florida.

26:47.340 --> 26:50.780
So it's fucking brazen for Alex to complain at this point

26:50.780 --> 26:53.260
that he doesn't have time to get to the real meat and cover

26:53.260 --> 26:54.220
it properly.

26:54.220 --> 26:55.580
He has all the time in the world.

26:55.580 --> 26:58.460
He just knows full well that if he ever tried to go anywhere

26:58.460 --> 27:01.260
deeper than surface level on any of these stories he covers,

27:01.260 --> 27:03.580
it would become clear immediately that he has no idea

27:03.580 --> 27:06.140
what he's talking about and his arguments make no sense.

27:06.140 --> 27:08.940
And his audience will put up with him just rambling about

27:08.940 --> 27:12.060
God giving him a download or whatever about what his career

27:12.060 --> 27:14.860
is going to be when everything is a direct contradiction.

27:14.860 --> 27:19.500
It's not like 20 years ago God told him one day you will

27:19.500 --> 27:23.500
be a foot soldier in Donald Trump's war against regulation

27:23.500 --> 27:24.300
or whatever the fuck.

27:24.300 --> 27:24.780
Definitely not.

27:24.780 --> 27:27.500
Yeah, months before he supported him, Alex was talking

27:27.500 --> 27:29.020
about how Trump was in the mob.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.380
God, I'm so disgusted.

27:30.380 --> 27:32.540
Wouldn't God have warned him not to do that because it's

27:32.540 --> 27:34.220
embarrassing for that to be on tape?

27:34.220 --> 27:38.060
God works in mysterious ways and sometimes that includes

27:38.060 --> 27:41.340
making you tell everybody that your God King is actually

27:41.340 --> 27:42.380
a mobbed up liar.

27:42.380 --> 27:46.860
If Alex had some kind of a download of what he was going

27:46.860 --> 27:50.220
to do and some kind of an idea of his future, then he couldn't

27:50.220 --> 27:54.380
have possibly known anything past supporting Trump because

27:55.500 --> 28:00.140
this whole time has been so a vast departure from God.

28:00.140 --> 28:01.820
God didn't tell him that part.

28:01.820 --> 28:02.540
Sure.

28:02.540 --> 28:06.300
Also, I'm struggling to believe that you want to follow

28:07.260 --> 28:11.020
top names in anti-globalism who are willing to take you

28:11.020 --> 28:14.300
at face value when they say, how do you know everything

28:14.300 --> 28:14.860
you know?

28:14.860 --> 28:17.180
Ah, well, I had a vision 20 years ago.

28:17.180 --> 28:17.980
I'm sorry.

28:17.980 --> 28:19.420
I'm so sorry.

28:19.420 --> 28:20.700
You tell that to them.

28:21.260 --> 28:22.780
You don't tell that to us.

28:22.780 --> 28:23.340
Sorry, buddy.

28:23.340 --> 28:23.660
Yeah.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.100
We're top anti-globalist.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.260
I don't imagine that conversation with anything like that

28:27.260 --> 28:28.620
if it's even a real conversation.

28:28.620 --> 28:29.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:29.580 --> 28:33.020
That's the kind of stuff that happens at like, I don't know,

28:33.020 --> 28:34.540
Aleister Crowley circles.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.780
I will tell you that the King of Crowley and Magic does

28:38.780 --> 28:39.900
also get visions.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.420
Yeah, yeah.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.860
That's the place for that conversation.

28:42.860 --> 28:44.140
Not this dumb, dumb shit.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.980
Anyway, Alex has, like you said, in that last clip, he

28:47.980 --> 28:50.460
felt like a big weight was lifted from him.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.940
That's because he's kind of completed his mission.

28:53.660 --> 28:56.460
I don't feel like my mission's over, but I do feel like

28:56.460 --> 29:00.220
I've completed what I was sent here to do.

29:00.220 --> 29:02.700
And you've been sent to this planet as well for what

29:02.700 --> 29:03.900
you're here doing.

29:03.900 --> 29:06.380
That's why God created you, why God put you in this body

29:06.940 --> 29:08.460
and why you're on this planet right now.

29:08.460 --> 29:13.580
But so I've completed the main mission, and I've got more

29:13.580 --> 29:18.460
missions, but God literally had his hand on these people

29:18.460 --> 29:21.500
to tell me all the same message, the same message.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.300
Take care of yourself.

29:22.300 --> 29:23.580
You've done a great job.

29:23.580 --> 29:24.940
You helped launch this whole thing.

29:24.940 --> 29:25.260
You're the leader.

29:25.260 --> 29:26.300
Leave us alone.

29:26.300 --> 29:26.860
You're the leader.

29:26.860 --> 29:27.500
Put down the drink.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.060
Go away.

29:29.340 --> 29:30.060
We apologize.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.260
We didn't think you were right about all this.

29:31.260 --> 29:32.540
You've been dead on about everything else.

29:32.540 --> 29:34.540
Sir, you're making a scene.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.140
And it was a huge weight loss.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.620
Don't threaten to push that lady off the stage.

29:38.620 --> 29:41.980
Not that now people are asking me what to do at that level

29:41.980 --> 29:45.740
specifically, but that I've completed the mission so far

29:45.740 --> 29:48.940
now that they've got the template now and don't even need

29:48.940 --> 29:51.980
me. And like the space shuttle going into orbit, the main

29:51.980 --> 29:53.580
boosters just fall off.

29:53.580 --> 29:57.740
And imagine being those boosters driving shaking and finally

30:00.460 --> 30:01.100
you see what I'm saying?

30:01.100 --> 30:03.500
It's like now the big heavy payloads going into orbit.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.220
Absolutely not.

30:04.220 --> 30:04.860
I'm on the ship.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.060
You're on the ship too, folks.

30:06.060 --> 30:07.820
But we were the boosters, folks.

30:08.540 --> 30:11.020
And as bad as things are, we're now in the main fight.

30:11.020 --> 30:16.300
This was all prepositioning for what's coming and God's

30:16.300 --> 30:18.140
people versus Satan's people.

30:18.140 --> 30:20.380
And this was setting up the chess pieces.

30:20.380 --> 30:23.260
Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, it is game on.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.380
This is very stupid.

30:24.380 --> 30:24.880
Yeah.

30:26.220 --> 30:28.780
I mean, like, honestly, as somebody who listens to a ton

30:28.780 --> 30:32.700
of Alex, I mean, like one of our episodes that people like

30:32.700 --> 30:37.020
a lot was the episode The Drunk Hotel Interview with Patrick

30:37.020 --> 30:37.660
Bet David.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.380
That's because life is very fragile.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.340
We learned in that interview.

30:41.340 --> 30:45.260
And we also learned that Alex was he completed his mission

30:45.260 --> 30:46.220
and he felt really great.

30:46.220 --> 30:46.540
Yep.

30:46.540 --> 30:51.500
These are just things that are like it's a refrain that comes

30:51.500 --> 30:54.460
back from time to time whenever Alex feels a certain way.

30:54.460 --> 30:59.020
And I would guess that he talked to somebody, maybe not

30:59.020 --> 31:03.580
Trump, but it's somebody who gave him a real sense of affirmation.

31:03.580 --> 31:04.060
Yeah.

31:04.060 --> 31:07.580
Somebody validated him in a way that he doesn't feel generally

31:07.580 --> 31:08.380
validated by.

31:09.740 --> 31:12.860
And I would almost say maybe it was a fine answer.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.420
Maybe he got some money.

31:15.420 --> 31:17.820
Maybe he was down in Florida trying to get some money to

31:17.820 --> 31:18.620
stay afloat.

31:18.620 --> 31:19.420
That could be.

31:19.420 --> 31:24.220
And someone agreed to throw a couple bucks at Info Wars.

31:24.220 --> 31:26.460
Is Steve Lindell in Florida right now?

31:26.460 --> 31:27.420
Mike Lindell.

31:27.420 --> 31:27.980
Whatever.

31:27.980 --> 31:29.420
You might not have any money in a little bit.

31:30.060 --> 31:32.220
Well, that's why you should give it to Info Wars now.

31:32.220 --> 31:34.700
Could be the guy who runs that fucking grocery store.

31:36.140 --> 31:36.620
I don't know.

31:36.620 --> 31:37.340
It's very weird.

31:37.340 --> 31:40.460
All I hear is like whenever Alex talks about these, like this

31:40.460 --> 31:42.860
idea of like the weight is lifted from him.

31:42.860 --> 31:46.220
It's just like someone patted you on the head and you feel

31:46.220 --> 31:47.580
really good about it.

31:47.580 --> 31:50.540
I'm glad you had a great trip, but you still I made everything

31:50.540 --> 31:51.820
that it still sucks.

31:51.820 --> 31:52.060
Yeah.

31:52.060 --> 31:55.020
And that's why he's down right now is because he's coming off

31:55.020 --> 31:57.100
the high of being like, I'm so great.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.380
And now he's in a bad mood.

31:58.380 --> 31:59.980
So he's telling you how great he is.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.100
Because of the earpiece.

32:01.100 --> 32:01.900
Yeah.

32:01.900 --> 32:02.860
And that's your fault.

32:02.860 --> 32:03.180
Yeah.

32:03.180 --> 32:03.980
Well, that's fair.

32:03.980 --> 32:04.220
Yeah.

32:05.260 --> 32:09.420
So Alex finally stops talking about his own dumb ass and

32:09.420 --> 32:11.660
starts talking about some issues.

32:11.660 --> 32:14.860
He gets into a little bit of stuff about climate change.

32:15.420 --> 32:18.540
And I found this fascinating.

32:18.540 --> 32:21.740
This framing of two different ideas.

32:21.740 --> 32:22.460
Okay.

32:22.460 --> 32:24.460
And I'm sure you've all heard me of a regular listener

32:24.460 --> 32:28.300
probably 5000 times say when they collapse the third world

32:28.300 --> 32:31.020
with the lockdowns and the giant third world masses flood

32:31.020 --> 32:35.660
us, they're going to say that that was because of climate

32:35.660 --> 32:38.540
change, even though the lockdowns, what did it sure as

32:38.540 --> 32:40.700
hell, Nancy Pelosi came out and said it.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.660
And I said, they're also going to say that the new viruses

32:43.660 --> 32:46.060
are rising because of climate change.

32:46.060 --> 32:48.220
And that's why they're developing because there's too many

32:48.220 --> 32:48.460
people.

32:48.460 --> 32:51.420
So see, they always criticize Pat Robertson when there's our

32:51.420 --> 32:52.140
bad hurricane.

32:52.140 --> 32:54.780
And this is God judging us.

32:54.780 --> 32:55.580
Well, maybe he's wrong.

32:55.580 --> 32:56.140
Maybe he's right.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.660
But they're saying, oh, humans are bad.

32:59.660 --> 33:03.820
That's why there's a snowstorm or a dust storm or climate

33:03.820 --> 33:05.020
change caused a volcano.

33:05.020 --> 33:05.820
You've heard that.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.180
That's pure bull.

33:07.180 --> 33:10.620
So a couple of quick clarifications long before COVID was

33:10.620 --> 33:11.500
known to anyone.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.660
There were many people discussing the dynamic that when

33:13.660 --> 33:16.940
climates change, it makes some regions uninhabitable, or

33:16.940 --> 33:20.540
at least it can, whether by the risk of rising sea levels,

33:20.540 --> 33:23.660
diminishing water supply or some other variable shifting.

33:23.660 --> 33:26.620
This leads inevitably to some degree of displacement of

33:26.620 --> 33:29.500
people, the extent of which is left to be seen.

33:30.060 --> 33:32.460
Second, when people discuss climate change causing new

33:32.460 --> 33:35.500
diseases, they're talking about how changing climate displaces

33:35.500 --> 33:36.940
animals as well.

33:36.940 --> 33:39.900
And as that happens, animals who previously would not have

33:39.900 --> 33:42.460
been in contact with humans end up contacting humans.

33:42.460 --> 33:45.340
And in those cases, there's a possibility for transmission

33:45.340 --> 33:46.860
of novel diseases.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.260
There's also the matter of rising sea temperatures, making

33:49.260 --> 33:52.060
water more hospitable for things like flesh eating bacteria.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.860
But all of it is a discussion surrounding cause and effect

33:54.860 --> 33:56.220
relationships.

33:56.220 --> 33:58.540
Not every new interaction between an animal and a human is

33:58.540 --> 33:59.900
going to result in a new disease.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.700
But the more that it does happen, the more possibilities

34:02.700 --> 34:04.300
there are for new diseases popping up.

34:05.100 --> 34:07.900
This is something that I guess Alex is conflating with Pat

34:07.900 --> 34:10.540
Robertson saying that natural disasters are God's punishment

34:10.540 --> 34:14.300
for the US accepting LGBTQ folk as humans with rights.

34:15.100 --> 34:18.700
In 2015, Pat Robertson said that a drop in the Dow Jones

34:18.700 --> 34:21.900
industrial average was God punishing the Obama administration

34:21.900 --> 34:24.220
for supporting access to reproductive health care.

34:24.220 --> 34:25.980
Oh, yeah, but that one actually was true.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.740
Robertson does this shit all the time.

34:27.740 --> 34:29.100
It's just one of his things.

34:29.740 --> 34:32.460
There's an important difference between these two things that

34:32.460 --> 34:35.660
Alex is embarrassingly not understanding, and that is that

34:35.660 --> 34:38.860
one is moralistic and the other is descriptive.

34:38.860 --> 34:41.900
The conversation about climate change can be something that

34:41.900 --> 34:45.260
you can discuss with moral implications, but it can also be

34:45.260 --> 34:47.980
a conversation that you have strictly as a matter of X will

34:47.980 --> 34:50.700
cause Y, and it still makes sense.

34:50.700 --> 34:53.420
Robertson's claims are things that only work as a moral

34:53.420 --> 34:56.860
argument, a dumb and flimsy one, but they can't possibly be

34:56.860 --> 34:58.940
taken seriously in any other context.

34:59.580 --> 35:02.540
There's no way to coherently explain how Planned Parenthood

35:02.540 --> 35:05.980
existing causes hurricanes, except if you embrace the

35:05.980 --> 35:08.780
worldview that we're living at the whim of a vengeful God

35:08.780 --> 35:11.260
who's decided that reproductive health care is immoral and

35:11.260 --> 35:13.340
the punishment for immorality is a hurricane.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.540
That's the only way that Robertson's shit even makes sense

35:16.540 --> 35:18.140
from a grammar standpoint.

35:18.140 --> 35:21.020
But the same is not true for the conversations that people

35:21.020 --> 35:23.500
have about the side effects of climate change.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.740
It's really amazing to see this kind of equivalence being

35:25.740 --> 35:29.260
made and realize that there's actually no, it's probably how

35:29.260 --> 35:30.940
Alex's brain works.

35:30.940 --> 35:33.660
These two things probably do feel about the same to him.

35:33.660 --> 35:37.020
He just thinks that Robertson's claims are closer to reality.

35:37.020 --> 35:39.020
Like it's staggering.

35:39.020 --> 35:40.940
Yeah, it's weird to exist.

35:41.900 --> 35:45.580
And we've talked about this before, but we exist in multiple

35:45.580 --> 35:48.620
different time periods simultaneously.

35:48.620 --> 35:53.180
Like it's weird to understand the main factors of climate

35:53.180 --> 35:57.020
change and how they swirl around in a global sense, which

35:57.020 --> 36:01.260
is incredible in such a short period of time to like,

36:01.260 --> 36:06.060
relatively speaking, we've gone from believing that witches

36:06.060 --> 36:09.340
cause all of our problems to understanding what those

36:09.340 --> 36:12.700
problems come from on a scientific and real level.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.580
And at the same time, people still believe that witches cause

36:15.580 --> 36:16.300
our problems.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.420
This is an issue.

36:17.420 --> 36:18.300
Crowley and witches.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.260
Yes, exactly.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.620
Like, what are we doing?

36:20.620 --> 36:22.140
How can you do that?

36:22.140 --> 36:23.980
Yeah, it's interesting to me.

36:23.980 --> 36:28.460
And the sort of hinge point of it is Alex seems to think

36:28.460 --> 36:31.180
that the conversations about these potential new diseases

36:31.180 --> 36:34.220
that we will come in contact with as animals get displaced

36:34.220 --> 36:37.980
as climates change is something that is intrinsically about

36:37.980 --> 36:39.260
humans being bad.

36:39.260 --> 36:44.940
And that's not at all a meaningful conversation that I've

36:44.940 --> 36:46.860
heard anyone having, except Alex.

36:46.860 --> 36:47.260
Yeah.

36:47.260 --> 36:49.740
It's a straw man in order for him to make this somehow

36:49.740 --> 36:53.340
an equivalent of Pat Robertson saying gay people cause hurricanes.

36:53.340 --> 36:53.840
Great.

36:54.380 --> 36:54.860
Whatever.

36:54.860 --> 36:56.460
It's so dumb.

36:56.460 --> 36:57.180
Yeah.

36:57.180 --> 36:57.740
Yeah.

36:57.740 --> 37:03.340
It's real difficult to swing with that bullshit.

37:03.340 --> 37:03.660
Yeah.

37:03.660 --> 37:04.540
Oh, man.

37:04.540 --> 37:08.460
So this next clip we got is I think it's a good indication

37:08.460 --> 37:12.700
and example of how a lot of the stuff that Alex does is

37:12.700 --> 37:13.660
kind of a trap.

37:14.540 --> 37:17.260
Oh, by the way, Fentanyl in the last two months, just since

37:17.260 --> 37:22.540
Biden got in, the DEA says he's up 360 plus percent.

37:23.500 --> 37:24.860
I think it's 362%.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.380
I saw the article this weekend.

37:27.420 --> 37:29.340
360 plus percent.

37:32.060 --> 37:34.300
It's killing hundreds of thousands of people, a lot of them

37:34.300 --> 37:38.460
black, but oh, you're not going to see the Emmys or the Grammys

37:38.460 --> 37:39.980
or any of these shows pushing this.

37:39.980 --> 37:40.620
Yeah, there it is.

37:40.620 --> 37:41.580
Biden's border advisor.

37:41.580 --> 37:42.460
That's because they're the Emmys.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.380
Trump's policies prevent illegal immigration.

37:45.980 --> 37:49.500
Fentanyl importation in the US explodes.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.380
So Infowars quotes Acting Customs and Border Protection

37:52.380 --> 37:54.780
Commissioner Troy Miller as saying the following during

37:54.780 --> 37:56.700
a media call on March 10th.

37:56.700 --> 38:00.060
Quote, we're seeing a dramatic increase in fentanyl seizures

38:00.060 --> 38:04.060
this fiscal year, more than 360% higher than this time last

38:04.060 --> 38:07.660
year. Now here's a fun game, and this is why disinformation

38:07.660 --> 38:09.980
is almost impossible to get rid of ever.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.940
Alex can use that to argue that there's so much more fentanyl

38:12.940 --> 38:15.260
coming into the country than when Trump was president,

38:15.260 --> 38:17.900
because Biden has signaled to the cartels that it's open

38:17.900 --> 38:20.700
season. Of course, this doesn't really explain why the police

38:20.700 --> 38:22.140
are seizing all of it, but who cares?

38:22.140 --> 38:25.660
Now, imagine that Miller, the Acting Customs and Border

38:25.660 --> 38:28.380
Protection Commissioner, what if he had reported that

38:28.380 --> 38:30.380
seizures were way down from last year?

38:31.260 --> 38:33.820
Would you imagine Alex's narrative would be at that point?

38:33.820 --> 38:38.700
Um, I believe it would be that they are hiding the number

38:38.700 --> 38:40.380
of seizures that are occurring.

38:40.380 --> 38:41.900
Or they're just letting it all through.

38:41.900 --> 38:42.700
Yeah, totally.

38:42.700 --> 38:43.980
You know, the message has gone out.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.380
Just let them on through with the fentanyl.

38:46.380 --> 38:46.780
Yeah.

38:46.780 --> 38:47.180
Yeah.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.300
It's a trap.

38:48.300 --> 38:49.260
It doesn't matter.

38:49.260 --> 38:53.340
And also, I don't care what anyone from Customs and Border

38:53.340 --> 38:54.700
Protection has to say.

38:54.700 --> 38:54.940
Fine.

38:55.580 --> 38:56.460
That's fair.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.220
You can't trust a single word from them.

38:58.220 --> 38:58.860
It's fair.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.220
That's a side issue.

39:00.220 --> 39:03.900
In this case, at least it's somewhat reliant on stats.

39:03.900 --> 39:04.540
Sure.

39:04.540 --> 39:07.500
So the actual facts or information that come out don't

39:07.500 --> 39:09.260
matter in cases like this.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.500
The argument is that Trump's approach to the border was

39:11.500 --> 39:12.700
good and Biden's is bad.

39:12.700 --> 39:15.340
So no matter what details get provided, they get filtered

39:15.340 --> 39:18.140
through that lens and the predetermined argument is made.

39:18.860 --> 39:20.460
That's all that's going on.

39:20.460 --> 39:23.420
As for Biden's advisor admitting that Trump's policies work,

39:23.420 --> 39:25.980
Alex is just reading an InfoWars headline that fails to

39:25.980 --> 39:27.500
capture the real story.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.380
This was about the southern border coordinator Roberta

39:30.380 --> 39:32.940
Jacobson discussing how there may be a relationship between

39:32.940 --> 39:36.300
the ending of Trump's inhumane policies and a spike in people

39:36.300 --> 39:37.420
heading towards the border.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.180
There was a hope for a more humane policy after four years

39:41.180 --> 39:43.740
of pent-up demand, so I don't know if I would call that a

39:43.740 --> 39:47.020
coincidence, but the idea that a more humane policy would

39:47.020 --> 39:49.820
be in place may have driven people to make that decision.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.700
But perhaps more importantly, it definitely drove smugglers

39:52.700 --> 39:55.980
to express disinformation, spread disinformation about

39:55.980 --> 39:57.740
what was now possible.

39:57.740 --> 40:00.380
This is not what Alex is reporting because it's just a little

40:00.380 --> 40:02.620
bit deeper than the surface appearance level and he can't

40:02.620 --> 40:04.140
really handle that kind of material.

40:04.140 --> 40:08.220
So it's entirely possible that people were like, oh, the

40:08.220 --> 40:11.260
president doesn't actively want to murder us, so maybe now

40:11.260 --> 40:14.060
would be a better time than it was a couple months ago.

40:14.060 --> 40:15.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:15.260 --> 40:17.820
And there are people who are taking advantage of that.

40:17.820 --> 40:18.220
Naturally.

40:18.220 --> 40:21.820
Perhaps selling people a bill of goods about getting them

40:21.820 --> 40:22.380
over the border.

40:22.380 --> 40:23.420
Right, right, right, right.

40:23.420 --> 40:27.900
And, you know, the interview that Jacobson did was talking

40:27.900 --> 40:31.260
about trying to balance messaging responsibly with policy.

40:31.260 --> 40:31.740
Right.

40:31.740 --> 40:35.420
Yeah, it's just a little bit more complicated than Alex

40:35.420 --> 40:37.100
wants it to be.

40:37.100 --> 40:37.820
Naturally.

40:37.820 --> 40:43.820
So Alex is, you know, he's this guy who's like above the

40:43.820 --> 40:44.140
fray.

40:44.700 --> 40:45.420
Sure.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.700
The left-right paradigm.

40:46.700 --> 40:50.220
That doesn't sound true when you have a God King, but...

40:50.220 --> 40:52.700
And as the enemy ups their game, we up our game.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.780
And as long as we don't give up, they're going to run out

40:54.780 --> 40:55.100
of time.

40:55.100 --> 40:56.060
They're going to fall apart.

40:56.060 --> 40:58.220
And no matter how much propaganda or election fraud

40:58.220 --> 41:01.020
they've got, everybody's going to know you run from Democrats.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.140
You run from communists.

41:02.140 --> 41:03.420
You run from socialists.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.460
You run from leftists.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.380
You run from liberals because they're monsters.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.820
They're part of a criminal syndicate.

41:07.820 --> 41:10.540
And most of the people that serve the left are idiots being

41:10.540 --> 41:12.780
used and destroyed themselves.

41:15.660 --> 41:16.620
So that's all coming up.

41:16.620 --> 41:18.700
I mean, look at these headlines.

41:18.700 --> 41:19.980
Returning from a grocery store.

41:19.980 --> 41:23.500
The Pentagon openly calls for a tax on citizens that criticize

41:23.500 --> 41:24.060
the Pentagon.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.020
That's totally illegal.

41:25.020 --> 41:27.740
Man, I could have sworn he was above the left-right divide.

41:27.740 --> 41:28.860
It does sound right.

41:28.860 --> 41:31.420
That was just a way that the man got people to fight with

41:31.420 --> 41:31.900
each other.

41:31.900 --> 41:32.620
Does sound right.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.700
Weird how none of the groups that Alex is talking about you

41:34.700 --> 41:36.940
need to run from because they're monsters are right-wing

41:36.940 --> 41:37.500
at all.

41:37.500 --> 41:38.380
That is strange.

41:38.380 --> 41:38.860
Weird.

41:38.860 --> 41:39.260
Yeah.

41:39.260 --> 41:40.940
This is really important to understand.

41:41.580 --> 41:44.460
Alex's branding in his earlier career really relied on him

41:44.460 --> 41:47.100
pretending to not be extremely right-wing.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.180
He was making arguments that were straight out of the John

41:49.180 --> 41:51.900
Birch Society and putting forward ideas that were far to

41:51.900 --> 41:53.660
the right of the GOP in the 90s.

41:53.660 --> 41:56.620
So in order to mask that and expand his potential audience

41:56.620 --> 42:00.060
beyond the weirdo militia people, he had to lie.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.540
The essential lie of his career is that he's above the party

42:02.540 --> 42:04.860
system and that he's opposed to Democrats and Republicans

42:04.860 --> 42:05.660
equally.

42:05.660 --> 42:07.100
He's not and he's never been.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.900
He likes extremists and only the Republican sort.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.780
When liberal-leaning people got tricked into thinking that

42:12.780 --> 42:15.820
he was just an iconoclast, truth-telling kind of guy,

42:15.820 --> 42:17.900
what they were actually being tricked into is supporting

42:17.900 --> 42:20.940
his right-wing extremist ideology, though they thought

42:20.940 --> 42:23.580
that they were being sold as just an alliance against the

42:23.580 --> 42:24.060
man.

42:24.060 --> 42:24.540
Yeah.

42:24.540 --> 42:27.580
This was done because on its face, Alex's shit is weak and

42:27.580 --> 42:30.380
dumb and people would see right through it and reject it

42:30.380 --> 42:33.500
if it was delivered in any way other than in a Trojan horse.

42:34.220 --> 42:36.460
As for that thing about the Pentagon at the end there,

42:36.460 --> 42:39.180
Alex is just covering something Tucker Carlson is whining

42:39.180 --> 42:39.680
about.

42:40.140 --> 42:43.180
On his show last week on Tuesday, Tucker went on a little

42:43.180 --> 42:46.460
jag about how the military is too feminine and, you know,

42:46.460 --> 42:49.020
considering the needs of soldiers who may not be male is

42:49.020 --> 42:51.260
quote, a mockery of the US military.

42:51.260 --> 42:52.860
How is that guy still legal?

42:52.860 --> 42:53.660
I don't know.

42:53.660 --> 42:54.060
Right?

42:54.060 --> 42:56.700
Like that's whatever that guy is.

42:56.700 --> 43:00.300
As a society, we should just be like, just that guy.

43:00.300 --> 43:02.780
You know, like let's not even worry about free speech

43:02.780 --> 43:04.060
implications or anything.

43:04.060 --> 43:06.220
Let's just be like, no, no, those guys.

43:06.220 --> 43:06.460
Yeah.

43:06.460 --> 43:09.980
Whatever that is, if you do exactly that, it's illegal.

43:09.980 --> 43:12.780
Well, it just doesn't seem like a sincere position.

43:13.420 --> 43:15.340
It's not even a position.

43:15.340 --> 43:18.460
It's a nonsense made of grumpy asshole.

43:18.460 --> 43:21.100
So naturally, a lot of folks in the services were offended

43:21.100 --> 43:23.180
by these comments and spoke out about it.

43:23.180 --> 43:26.220
Speaking to reporters, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby expressed

43:26.220 --> 43:29.340
revulsion with Tucker's comments, and as reported by CNN,

43:29.340 --> 43:32.140
quote, said the military still had a lot of work to do to

43:32.140 --> 43:34.620
become more inclusive, more respectful of everyone,

43:34.620 --> 43:35.820
especially women.

43:35.820 --> 43:37.900
We pledge to do better and we will.

43:37.900 --> 43:41.020
What we absolutely won't do is take personnel advice from

43:41.020 --> 43:43.500
a talk show host or the Chinese military.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.660
Maybe those folks feel like they have something to prove

43:45.660 --> 43:46.540
that's on them.

43:46.540 --> 43:46.940
Sure.

43:46.940 --> 43:49.260
Tucker went on his show and whined about how the Pentagon

43:49.260 --> 43:51.500
was attacking him, and it's an outrage.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.980
Now Alex is reporting on Tucker's whining.

43:53.980 --> 43:56.700
This is a game for people like Alex and Tucker.

43:56.700 --> 43:59.260
They say something that they know is offensive and demeaning.

43:59.260 --> 44:01.740
Then people respond that what they said was offensive

44:01.740 --> 44:02.540
and demeaning.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.460
And then they pretend that they're victims of being

44:04.460 --> 44:06.940
oppressed by people expressing that what they said sucks.

44:06.940 --> 44:07.180
Yeah.

44:07.180 --> 44:09.660
Everybody gets a good news news cycle out of it.

44:09.660 --> 44:12.780
And then we all move on the next day because we're all stupid.

44:12.780 --> 44:15.260
It's outrageously dumb and a waste of everyone's time and

44:15.260 --> 44:15.660
energy.

44:15.660 --> 44:16.220
Yep.

44:16.220 --> 44:19.260
And that is the best argument, I think, for making Tucker

44:19.260 --> 44:20.540
Carlson not street legal.

44:20.540 --> 44:20.940
Yeah.

44:20.940 --> 44:23.740
I mean, it's like it's such a waste of resources.

44:23.740 --> 44:25.100
It shouldn't even be hard.

44:25.100 --> 44:29.020
Like in a literal sense, it should just be like you can.

44:29.020 --> 44:33.660
It's against the law to be Tucker Carlson on air.

44:33.660 --> 44:36.460
And if somebody does that, then you just play clips of

44:36.460 --> 44:40.060
Tucker Carlson saying that at court, and then you convict

44:40.060 --> 44:42.460
them for saying Tucker Carlson shit.

44:42.460 --> 44:42.940
Interesting.

44:42.940 --> 44:43.580
It's not hard.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.340
So are you a linguist?

44:47.260 --> 44:49.260
I like to ask random questions sometimes.

44:50.060 --> 44:50.300
No.

44:51.260 --> 44:51.820
Interesting.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.620
I want to know what you think about this.

44:55.180 --> 44:56.060
Alex is a linguist.

44:56.060 --> 44:57.180
Oh, I don't.

44:57.180 --> 44:59.660
I he has the right to make up words.

44:59.660 --> 45:02.300
Sometimes even when he does, he's not making up a word.

45:02.300 --> 45:02.860
Okay.

45:02.860 --> 45:03.820
He's an innovator.

45:04.540 --> 45:10.620
The crew just found something very, very interesting that

45:10.620 --> 45:14.300
I had remembered a few months ago and then basically

45:14.300 --> 45:14.940
forgotten about.

45:16.060 --> 45:18.300
And so I'm so glad that they didn't let it fall through

45:18.300 --> 45:18.780
the cracks.

45:18.780 --> 45:21.340
And one of the crew members saw this and notice it

45:21.340 --> 45:25.340
themselves, the pre-programming of wearing mask in Hollywood

45:25.340 --> 45:28.300
movies, setting the future as a dystopia.

45:29.340 --> 45:32.060
That's why I call them dystopics or dystopians.

45:34.700 --> 45:35.980
And then I saw some talk show.

45:35.980 --> 45:37.820
I was making fun of me a few weeks ago.

45:37.820 --> 45:38.700
I just happened to run into it.

45:38.700 --> 45:41.260
They go, Jones doesn't even know how to say dystopia.

45:42.140 --> 45:43.580
No, it's called dystopic.

45:45.260 --> 45:49.340
That's another word you can create new words, or you can

45:49.340 --> 45:50.940
put different ends on them.

45:50.940 --> 45:54.860
Dystopic is a word I came up with people that want to create

45:54.860 --> 45:59.980
a dystopia as a form of governance on purpose, like fascist

45:59.980 --> 46:01.180
or communist.

46:01.180 --> 46:02.620
I call them dystopics.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.620
And just as I started using the term dystopic, it's been

46:06.620 --> 46:07.180
picked up.

46:07.180 --> 46:07.980
Okay, that's fine.

46:07.980 --> 46:10.140
That's not a word that Alex invented.

46:10.140 --> 46:12.540
No, I was going to say that's an adjective.

46:12.540 --> 46:14.940
Yeah, it's a clunkier version of the exact same word as

46:14.940 --> 46:17.660
dystopian, since both are adjectives that connote something

46:17.660 --> 46:19.660
being similar to a dystopia.

46:19.660 --> 46:22.060
You can find some really interesting debate among amateur

46:22.060 --> 46:24.380
linguists on message boards about whether or not you should

46:24.380 --> 46:27.260
ever use dystopic instead of dystopian, and the general

46:27.260 --> 46:29.900
consensus is that there's no real good reason to.

46:29.900 --> 46:30.940
But also, who cares?

46:31.900 --> 46:33.740
Alex did not come up with this word.

46:33.740 --> 46:36.060
The earliest appearance of the word in Google's archive

46:36.060 --> 46:39.740
of printed works appears to be in 1905, but interestingly,

46:39.740 --> 46:43.500
the frequency of its use jumps after the 1960s.

46:44.060 --> 46:46.700
I found an interesting article on the website Daily Writing

46:46.700 --> 46:50.140
Tips that offers a potential theory for why Alex has this

46:50.140 --> 46:52.380
as, like, his preferred word or a word that's in his head.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.340
The author of this site was discussing how they use the

46:55.340 --> 46:58.700
word dystopic and then wondered if it was actually a word.

46:58.700 --> 47:01.580
Quote, I think my use of it in an article may stem from

47:01.580 --> 47:03.420
frequent reading of film criticism.

47:03.420 --> 47:06.380
They then go on to give some examples of instances where

47:06.380 --> 47:09.660
the word is used generally in the discussion of pop culture

47:09.660 --> 47:10.380
science fiction.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.580
Well, there is that.

47:11.580 --> 47:14.780
I suspect Alex is so entrenched in and so influenced by pop

47:14.780 --> 47:17.500
culture science fiction and thinking that it's real that

47:17.500 --> 47:20.220
he's probably encountered the word dystopic in that context

47:20.220 --> 47:22.860
quite a bit, and now I guess he just thinks he coined the

47:22.860 --> 47:25.980
term. Whether my theory is right or not, this is just some

47:25.980 --> 47:28.860
embarrassing time-wasting that Alex is engaging in here.

47:28.860 --> 47:30.780
You know, I actually did invent a word, Dan.

47:30.780 --> 47:31.340
Is that right?

47:31.340 --> 47:34.380
Yes. Have you ever heard the word exsanguinate?

47:35.820 --> 47:36.780
That's a real word, isn't it?

47:36.780 --> 47:37.580
It is a real word.

47:37.580 --> 47:40.300
To remove blood from something, right?

47:40.300 --> 47:43.420
So I created the word exsanguinate.

47:43.420 --> 47:44.380
No, no, no, no.

47:44.380 --> 47:45.500
Exsplatterate.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.300
That's peeing?

47:46.300 --> 47:50.140
Which is when you're watching, like, a samurai movie.

47:50.140 --> 47:52.620
They get exsanguinated, but it goes all over the place.

47:52.620 --> 47:53.340
It's a splatter version.

47:53.340 --> 47:54.460
It's a splatterate, yeah.

47:54.460 --> 47:55.100
See?

47:55.100 --> 47:55.500
See?

47:55.500 --> 47:56.540
That's a good word!

47:56.540 --> 47:56.940
I'm gonna...

47:58.140 --> 48:01.020
I think it's gonna take the world by storm among people

48:01.020 --> 48:03.020
who watch a lot of samurai movies.

48:03.580 --> 48:04.300
Yeah, it could.

48:05.500 --> 48:09.100
Yeah, I was really thinking, I'm like, did we make fun of

48:09.100 --> 48:12.300
Alex for saying that? Like, we're using dystopian.

48:12.300 --> 48:14.620
I was trying to think, who cares?

48:14.620 --> 48:15.660
I don't think so.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.900
Who else other than us would be paying attention?

48:17.900 --> 48:21.340
Yeah, and I've used dystopic on this show.

48:21.900 --> 48:24.700
Yeah, I would imagine it's come out of our mouths.

48:24.700 --> 48:25.180
I like it.

48:25.180 --> 48:26.620
I prefer it to dystopian.

48:26.620 --> 48:27.980
And I think people...

48:27.980 --> 48:31.340
Dystopian is the proper, like, more accepted version,

48:31.340 --> 48:35.100
but it's not that dystopic isn't a word that you can use.

48:35.100 --> 48:35.660
Yeah, no, no, no.

48:35.660 --> 48:37.180
Dystopian's very elitist.

48:37.180 --> 48:38.060
That Ian.

48:38.060 --> 48:38.940
That Ian?

48:38.940 --> 48:39.500
Uh-uh.

48:39.500 --> 48:40.220
I don't like it.

48:40.220 --> 48:40.860
Ick.

48:40.860 --> 48:42.380
That's the way I roll, buddy.

48:42.380 --> 48:45.180
All right, you and Alex can hang out in a hot tub and talk

48:45.180 --> 48:45.580
about it.

48:45.580 --> 48:46.460
Sounds good.

48:46.460 --> 48:48.620
So, Fauci, Ailani Fauci.

48:48.620 --> 48:49.500
What is he up to now?

48:49.500 --> 48:53.660
He's disturbed that Trump voters don't want the vaccine.

48:53.660 --> 48:54.780
Yes, we all are.

48:54.780 --> 48:59.500
Fauci says it's so disturbing that Trump voters skeptical

48:59.500 --> 49:02.060
of experimental mRNA vaccines.

49:02.060 --> 49:03.660
Why would you be skeptical?

49:03.660 --> 49:05.260
Let me just read you some of these headlines again.

49:05.820 --> 49:08.860
Marvelous Marvin Hagler dead one day after taking it.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.980
Let me just read you some of the things I lie about.

49:11.980 --> 49:13.900
A couple days after he took it.

49:13.900 --> 49:14.860
No big deal.

49:14.860 --> 49:18.780
Germany suspends AstraZeneca mRNA vaccine amid clotting

49:18.780 --> 49:21.580
concerns and links to deaths and people being paralyzed

49:21.580 --> 49:22.700
and having strokes.

49:22.700 --> 49:24.300
But that's no big deal.

49:24.300 --> 49:27.020
I think it's okay to be skeptical about a vaccine that

49:27.020 --> 49:29.580
was developed as quickly as these ones were.

49:29.580 --> 49:30.380
That's fine.

49:30.940 --> 49:33.980
When you find yourself feeling skeptical, the appropriate

49:33.980 --> 49:36.780
thing to do is to look into the source of your skepticism

49:36.780 --> 49:38.860
and see if you can resolve that skepticism.

49:39.420 --> 49:42.140
Chronic skepticism isn't really healthy.

49:42.140 --> 49:44.860
And whenever possible, you should transfer your skepticism

49:44.860 --> 49:47.500
in the direction of finding a concrete position.

49:47.500 --> 49:48.300
If you can.

49:48.300 --> 49:51.100
Yeah, that's why they killed Socrates.

49:51.100 --> 49:53.740
They were just sick of that guy being an asshole.

49:53.740 --> 49:56.300
This is the kind of sleight of hand that Alex likes to use

49:56.300 --> 49:56.860
a lot.

49:56.860 --> 49:59.580
When he's actually advancing a pointlessly and aggressively

49:59.580 --> 50:02.060
anti-vax position, he hides behind the illusion that he's

50:02.060 --> 50:03.340
just being skeptical.

50:03.340 --> 50:05.580
Is it so bad to be skeptical?

50:05.580 --> 50:07.740
When he's pushing narratives to his audience about how

50:07.740 --> 50:10.700
various victims of gun violence are actors and the whole

50:10.700 --> 50:13.660
events were staged as an excuse to take his guns, he's

50:13.660 --> 50:15.340
actually telling his audience that.

50:15.340 --> 50:17.820
But when he gets called on it, he hides behind the illusion

50:17.820 --> 50:20.060
that he's just asking questions and examining things from

50:20.060 --> 50:20.700
all sides.

50:20.700 --> 50:22.380
What's so wrong with asking questions?

50:22.380 --> 50:25.900
Alex does this because on some level he knows that his

50:25.900 --> 50:28.140
bullshit doesn't stand up to adult scrutiny.

50:28.140 --> 50:31.020
So the only way for it to fly at all is for him to preemptively

50:31.020 --> 50:33.740
give up on his own narratives as opposed to be forced to

50:33.740 --> 50:34.700
defend them.

50:34.700 --> 50:38.300
It's easy to criticize him, but it's very hard to criticize

50:38.300 --> 50:41.020
being skeptical or asking questions about interesting topics.

50:41.020 --> 50:42.620
That's why he plays the game that he does.

50:42.620 --> 50:43.260
Yeah.

50:43.260 --> 50:45.820
Alex is lying about Marvin Hagler, and he doesn't even have

50:45.820 --> 50:48.620
the conspiracy timeline of Hank Aaron's death, right?

50:48.620 --> 50:51.500
Now, as for that other issue in Germany, they are just

50:51.500 --> 50:54.620
temporarily halting the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine

50:54.620 --> 50:57.820
quote over a small number of blood clot concerns.

50:58.460 --> 51:00.540
There weren't people in Germany who ended up with blood

51:00.540 --> 51:03.020
clots, but there were a couple cases reported in Denmark

51:03.020 --> 51:03.740
and Norway.

51:03.740 --> 51:05.980
So Germany decided to hold things as a precaution.

51:06.620 --> 51:09.500
There have been 37 reported cases of blood clots in the

51:09.500 --> 51:12.300
population of over 17 million people in the world who have

51:12.300 --> 51:14.060
received the AstraZeneca vaccine.

51:14.060 --> 51:16.380
And according to the company, quote, there is no evidence

51:16.380 --> 51:19.020
the vaccine carries an increased risk of clots.

51:19.020 --> 51:21.420
It's entirely possible that that number of people out of

51:21.420 --> 51:23.820
17 million would have gotten them anyway.

51:23.820 --> 51:24.540
Yeah.

51:24.540 --> 51:27.180
Italy halted the use of the vaccine as well, quote, as a

51:27.180 --> 51:30.380
precaution and temporarily after there was concerns that

51:30.380 --> 51:32.620
one man in the country died after getting the shot.

51:32.620 --> 51:35.180
But it's not clear that the death is related to the vaccine.

51:35.900 --> 51:38.620
This is all just countries being hyper cautious about the

51:38.620 --> 51:41.740
vaccine rollout, and it isn't any evidence that it's killing

51:41.740 --> 51:43.980
anyone or everyone or the vaccine is dangerous.

51:44.700 --> 51:48.220
When I brought up Alex's fake and false skepticism, it's

51:48.220 --> 51:51.180
important to realize that these are the first three stories

51:51.180 --> 51:54.220
that he comes up with to justify that skepticism about

51:54.220 --> 51:55.340
the vaccine.

51:55.340 --> 51:57.900
This is bad work and the level of shit that he's bringing

51:57.900 --> 51:58.860
to the table.

51:58.860 --> 52:01.900
It would be wise for everyone to recognize that Alex has

52:01.900 --> 52:05.660
not succeeded in justifying his skeptical position here.

52:05.660 --> 52:08.140
His opposition to the vaccine doesn't rest on facts and

52:08.140 --> 52:08.780
reality.

52:08.780 --> 52:10.700
It exists in spite of them.

52:10.700 --> 52:11.340
Yeah.

52:11.340 --> 52:15.340
I was thinking about why it is, you know, like this vaccine

52:15.340 --> 52:16.620
was developed so fast.

52:16.620 --> 52:19.660
And I think part of the reason that we are skeptical about

52:19.660 --> 52:23.100
it is because it's almost utopic.

52:23.100 --> 52:28.940
You know, it's almost like how, how, how have we advanced

52:28.940 --> 52:32.220
that far and how quickly we did it suggest?

52:32.220 --> 52:34.620
Like, how quickly can we do it?

52:34.620 --> 52:35.660
Is there a situation?

52:35.660 --> 52:37.020
It implies a lot of potential.

52:37.020 --> 52:37.260
Yeah.

52:37.260 --> 52:40.620
Is there a situation in a few years where we can manufacture

52:40.620 --> 52:42.780
vaccines almost instantly?

52:42.780 --> 52:46.140
You know, like that's the type of shit that is almost too

52:46.140 --> 52:47.740
good to be true.

52:47.740 --> 52:51.420
And so the skepticism there, it comes from a place of awe

52:51.420 --> 52:52.300
and wonder.

52:52.300 --> 52:53.020
Yeah.

52:53.020 --> 52:58.060
And I don't think, I don't think that being taken aback by

52:58.620 --> 53:01.740
the circumstances of the world, particularly, you know,

53:01.740 --> 53:05.820
the last year has been so insane and adjustments are so

53:05.820 --> 53:08.700
complicated and difficult that the people have had to make

53:08.700 --> 53:12.780
that I think that you can have a reaction that is in some

53:12.780 --> 53:17.420
way skeptical, whether it's worry, anxiety-based, awe-based,

53:17.420 --> 53:20.940
whatever it is, but you do have resources that you can go

53:20.940 --> 53:23.420
to explore that skepticism and resolve it.

53:23.420 --> 53:27.180
And if you behave like Alex does and throw out stupid headlines

53:27.180 --> 53:29.900
that mean nothing and don't take into context the actual

53:29.900 --> 53:32.300
circumstances, then what you're going to do is you're going

53:32.300 --> 53:36.060
to end up staying in that skeptical place or retreating

53:36.060 --> 53:39.420
into a dumb position that was where Alex wanted you to begin

53:39.420 --> 53:39.580
with.

53:39.580 --> 53:40.140
Yeah.

53:40.140 --> 53:41.740
It's not, it's not healthy.

53:41.740 --> 53:45.180
Yeah. It's also a little hard to believe that we can manufacture

53:45.180 --> 53:50.220
a vaccine so quickly at the same time as half of Republican

53:50.220 --> 53:52.860
men believe in witches causing our problems.

53:52.860 --> 53:53.260
Right.

53:53.260 --> 53:54.780
So that's a little bit weird.

53:54.780 --> 53:55.180
Yeah.

53:55.180 --> 53:55.740
Yeah.

53:55.740 --> 53:58.060
It's hard to believe, but that's because we have human

53:58.060 --> 53:58.460
brains.

53:58.460 --> 53:59.660
Yes, exactly.

53:59.660 --> 54:04.220
And we can believe it also because we have human brains.

54:04.220 --> 54:04.700
Yeah.

54:04.700 --> 54:07.580
So Alex referenced earlier that there was a movie that was

54:07.580 --> 54:08.620
predictive programming.

54:08.620 --> 54:08.940
Sure.

54:08.940 --> 54:09.500
Right.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.180
Are we going to talk about Oblivion again?

54:11.180 --> 54:11.660
No.

54:11.660 --> 54:14.060
Are we going to talk about that one where Will Smith fights

54:14.060 --> 54:14.940
orcs or something?

54:16.300 --> 54:17.020
The what?

54:17.020 --> 54:19.340
The one where, like, he's the last guy on earth?

54:19.340 --> 54:19.500
Yeah.

54:19.500 --> 54:19.980
Something like that.

54:19.980 --> 54:20.620
I am legend?

54:20.620 --> 54:21.660
No, no, no, no.

54:21.660 --> 54:23.340
He fights orcs in a different one.

54:23.340 --> 54:24.700
That's technically vampires.

54:25.900 --> 54:26.540
Is it?

54:26.540 --> 54:27.340
Are they actually?

54:27.340 --> 54:28.380
I mean, from the original, I suppose.

54:28.380 --> 54:29.260
Isn't he the bad guy?

54:29.820 --> 54:30.700
Yes, he is.

54:30.700 --> 54:31.820
That's the reveal, Dan.

54:31.820 --> 54:32.540
Yeah.

54:32.540 --> 54:34.060
I am the evil.

54:35.500 --> 54:39.740
What about after earth?

54:39.740 --> 54:41.660
Was that the one where he's in space?

54:41.660 --> 54:42.140
I don't know.

54:42.140 --> 54:45.100
I think I'm only going to watch movies that either Vincent

54:45.100 --> 54:47.740
Price was in or a remix of Wild West.

54:47.740 --> 54:48.540
Yeah, exactly.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.260
Trying to think of more Will Smith movies.

54:52.300 --> 54:54.220
Men in Black 2.

54:54.220 --> 54:55.660
Here come the Men in Black.

54:55.660 --> 54:57.020
Galaxy Defenders.

54:57.020 --> 54:57.660
Absolutely.

54:57.660 --> 54:59.020
So no, it's none of those.

54:59.020 --> 54:59.660
It's Avatar.

55:01.180 --> 55:01.420
Great.

55:01.420 --> 55:02.860
Run your phone calls here in just a moment.

55:02.860 --> 55:06.620
But I first wanted to play a clip that is a great example

55:06.620 --> 55:08.940
of predictive programming.

55:08.940 --> 55:10.300
Is it from Pocahontas?

55:10.300 --> 55:14.220
The 2009 James Cameron film, Avatar.

55:14.220 --> 55:15.180
Oh, so it is.

55:15.180 --> 55:18.380
That shows the planet Earth in 100 years or so.

55:19.660 --> 55:22.540
And where the atmosphere is so toxic, we've all got to wear

55:22.540 --> 55:23.900
these face masks.

55:23.900 --> 55:26.940
Now, if you go back and you see the film Blade Runner that

55:26.940 --> 55:33.420
came out in the early 1980s, same motif, dark skies, always

55:33.420 --> 55:39.580
raining, flooded cities, dystopic by the year 2017.

55:39.580 --> 55:40.620
And of course, it didn't happen.

55:40.620 --> 55:43.020
But that was what Al Gore said was going to happen while he

55:43.020 --> 55:45.100
bought oceanfront property 20 years ago.

55:45.100 --> 55:47.660
And while Bill Clinton bought oceanfront property 30 years

55:47.660 --> 55:51.100
ago and while Obama bought oceanfront property 10 years

55:51.100 --> 55:54.460
ago. And of course, the seas aren't going up.

55:54.460 --> 55:55.660
It's all lies.

55:55.660 --> 55:58.700
But they show you a polar bear with its cub on an ice flow

55:58.700 --> 55:59.900
and go, look, they're dying.

55:59.900 --> 56:00.700
They can't swim.

56:00.700 --> 56:03.500
They can swim 300 miles.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.540
They hunt whale and seal on those.

56:06.540 --> 56:09.020
Anybody can go read the Wikipedia entry on them.

56:09.020 --> 56:09.580
Wow.

56:09.580 --> 56:12.700
It is pathetic and on brand that Alex would point to a Wikipedia

56:12.700 --> 56:15.260
page on polar bears to prove some kind of dumb point about

56:15.260 --> 56:15.820
climate change.

56:15.820 --> 56:16.860
That's all you need to know.

56:16.860 --> 56:19.180
The illustration that that classic picture of a polar bear

56:19.180 --> 56:22.300
and cub on an ice flow is not so much that they can't swim.

56:22.300 --> 56:25.580
It's that when the ice recedes, the polar bear loses its

56:25.580 --> 56:26.860
ability to hunt.

56:26.860 --> 56:29.340
Polar bears don't just hunt swimming around in the water.

56:29.340 --> 56:32.220
They hunt from the edge of ice protruding into water where

56:32.220 --> 56:33.660
they can catch fish.

56:33.660 --> 56:37.100
As ice disappears or becomes less stable, they have to cross

56:37.100 --> 56:39.980
longer distances or be left to try and fish on the shore,

56:39.980 --> 56:42.860
which is a less fish plentiful area.

56:42.860 --> 56:45.580
The result of this is that we're likely to see collapsing

56:45.580 --> 56:48.700
polar bear populations in the not too distant future if ice

56:48.700 --> 56:49.740
continues to disappear.

56:50.300 --> 56:52.700
Alex has one image that he thinks he can mock that's a

56:52.700 --> 56:55.420
counterpoint to all climate change arguments, but in reality

56:55.420 --> 56:57.900
it's a straw man he's built so he can win a fake argument.

56:57.900 --> 57:01.580
As for people buying oceanfront property, I don't know if they

57:01.580 --> 57:04.940
did or did not do that, but if they did, who cares?

57:04.940 --> 57:07.660
Not all property near the ocean is intrinsically at high

57:07.660 --> 57:09.900
risk due to rising sea levels.

57:09.900 --> 57:11.180
None of this means anything.

57:11.180 --> 57:12.140
It's nonsense.

57:12.860 --> 57:16.060
Also, one big problem with Alex's idea about Avatar being

57:16.060 --> 57:17.580
pre-programming to wear masks.

57:18.220 --> 57:20.620
Humans don't have to wear masks on Earth in that movie.

57:20.620 --> 57:22.940
They wear masks on Pandora because they can't breathe the

57:22.940 --> 57:23.660
air on that planet.

57:23.660 --> 57:25.660
I thought that's what happened.

57:25.660 --> 57:29.180
I don't remember Earth being very important in that movie.

57:30.620 --> 57:33.420
There is at the beginning a little bit on Earth and people

57:33.420 --> 57:36.620
some people do wear masks and it appears to be like because

57:36.620 --> 57:39.340
of pollution, but not everybody is wearing masks.

57:40.380 --> 57:43.340
Only some people and in the scenes where they're inside

57:43.340 --> 57:45.100
a place, everyone doesn't have masks on.

57:45.100 --> 57:46.460
So it has nothing to do.

57:46.460 --> 57:48.780
Really, it's all just sloppy ass work.

57:48.780 --> 57:54.460
But also that's just like Asian cultures have had a mask

57:54.460 --> 57:58.540
wearing as more acceptable or not more acceptable as a

57:58.540 --> 58:00.140
totally normal thing.

58:00.140 --> 58:00.620
Right.

58:00.620 --> 58:04.780
And for a long time, what is it probably?

58:04.780 --> 58:06.700
No, before Avatar.

58:06.700 --> 58:08.060
So fuck off.

58:08.060 --> 58:09.420
I don't need this shit.

58:09.420 --> 58:14.300
Yeah, and I think it's a little silly, but the image that

58:14.300 --> 58:17.820
you remember of people wearing masks and Avatar is on Pandora.

58:17.820 --> 58:19.580
Yeah, because they can't breathe on Pandora.

58:19.580 --> 58:25.740
Yeah, also, are we going to, like, remote into genetically

58:25.740 --> 58:26.780
modified and created monsters?

58:26.780 --> 58:30.140
That's the other question is like, what is not predictive

58:30.140 --> 58:31.660
programming about that movie and what is?

58:31.660 --> 58:33.020
Do you get to pick and choose?

58:33.020 --> 58:34.380
Yeah, how does that work?

58:34.380 --> 58:35.100
How does that work?

58:35.100 --> 58:37.660
Do we get to join the noble Na'vi?

58:37.660 --> 58:42.300
I think that movie has an uplifting message of abandoning

58:42.300 --> 58:43.900
human life entirely.

58:44.700 --> 58:49.500
Yeah, I think this might be convenience for Alex that he

58:49.500 --> 58:53.340
found a scene in a movie where some people had face masks

58:53.340 --> 58:55.980
on and he just decided this is predictive programming and

58:55.980 --> 58:57.340
decided to ignore the rest of it.

58:57.340 --> 58:59.500
And it's always fun to talk about Blade Runner.

58:59.500 --> 59:00.140
Sure.

59:00.140 --> 59:03.260
So Alex gets to taking some calls here at the end of this

59:03.260 --> 59:05.020
episode here on the 15th.

59:05.020 --> 59:07.900
And this one caller that he takes, he talks to him for a

59:07.900 --> 59:10.940
very long time, and there's some very serious problems with

59:10.940 --> 59:12.060
what he's bringing to the table.

59:12.860 --> 59:16.540
Patriot doctor in Missouri works at nursing home and wants

59:16.540 --> 59:17.980
to comment on COVID vaccines.

59:17.980 --> 59:18.780
Thanks for calling.

59:18.780 --> 59:20.780
Thanks for holding Patriot doctor from Missouri.

59:22.060 --> 59:22.300
Yeah.

59:22.300 --> 59:22.940
Hi, Alex.

59:24.940 --> 59:27.980
So I'm a geriatrician.

59:27.980 --> 59:29.260
I'm family medicine trained.

59:29.260 --> 59:31.180
I'm a geriatrician.

59:31.180 --> 59:32.220
I work in nursing homes.

59:33.580 --> 59:39.900
I have had 21 patients that I've identified that have died

59:39.900 --> 59:44.060
within 48 hours of getting either the first or second vaccine

59:44.060 --> 59:45.180
from AstraZeneca.

59:46.060 --> 59:47.420
I'm a geriatrician.

59:47.420 --> 59:51.500
They are not calling it a vaccine related incident because

59:52.300 --> 59:56.620
CVS is the ones that are administering the vaccine.

59:56.620 --> 59:58.060
CVS has the contract.

59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.740
There's one giant hole in this guy's story.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.860
There's no way that his patients could be dying after

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.500
getting the AstraZeneca vaccine, because that vaccine is

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.420
not approved for use in the United States.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.980
It's still in phase three clinical trials.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.100
And though the US has purchased a lot of doses of the vaccine,

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.700
it's not looking like they're going to be able to get

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.780
approval to begin using them until spring.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.660
It's pretty embarrassing for Alex to not even know what

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.740
vaccines are approved for use in the United States.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.940
But for this alleged doctor to get that very critical detail

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.940
wrong, that's fucking disqualifying.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.180
Yeah.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:32.620
Like this guy, I don't think that he's actually a doctor.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.300
No, absolutely not.

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.740
He starts talking and he just gets into, like, Infowars

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.300
talking points about the dangers of vaccines.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:40.620
Yeah.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.740
And it's like, I'm not going to take you seriously.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.700
Or I mean, I don't know.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:48.380
I guess I'll take you as seriously as you're taking claims

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.420
that your patients are on the AstraZeneca vaccine, which

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:52.380
is not seriously at all.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.340
You go fuck yourself.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:53.820
Yeah.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.500
You know, sometimes, you know, with these callers, I halfway

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.820
think that some of these guys are just role playing.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.940
Yeah, no, totally.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.780
This is what I should say, because people need to get this

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.860
information, but I'm not actually a geriatrician, but it's

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.620
the radio on Infowars.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.100
So fuck it.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.300
I'll just say that I'm way in on medicine.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.500
Yeah, and 48 of my patients have died from taking a vaccine

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.100
that you can't take in the United States.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:19.740
Exactly.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.940
Go fuck yourself, man.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.980
Patriot doctor.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:22.620
Fuck off.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.260
Patriot.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:30.140
Anyway, so we get to the 16th now, and Alex, interestingly,

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.740
he doesn't talk anymore about how he is now the leader,

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.660
the anointed leader of the Patriots.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.420
You don't need to worry about that too much.

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.940
That storyline drops out.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:40.540
You know?

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.260
Yeah.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.580
But look, man, the globalists are going to kill everyone.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.540
They want to kill everybody, but they want to kill you in

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.300
a year, 6 years, 10 years.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.580
Every person is different.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.140
And then they'll just claim it's something else causing it.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.540
It's called a soft kill weapon.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.460
Silent weapons for quiet wars.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.820
There's Pentagon papers on that.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.500
If you'd like to go look that up.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.980
But here's the Wall Street Journal last year, looking

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:07.500
forward to the end of humanity, saying humanity will be

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.220
exterminated.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.260
It is a wonderful, good, loving thing.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.980
Silent weapons for quiet wars is a completely fraudulent

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.140
document that was pushed by Bill Cooper in his book,

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.500
Behold a Pale Horse.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.940
We covered it in great detail on episode 381 of our show.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.420
So if you'd like to hear more about why that's bullshit and

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.900
why it's embarrassing for Alex to be referencing it as a

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:28.380
real Pentagon document, then go ahead.

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.420
Give that episode a spin.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.620
The article that Alex is referring to, the looking forward

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.940
to the end of humanity, that doesn't discuss how great it

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.700
will be when humanity isn't around.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.580
It's an easy misrepresentation to make of the headline,

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:42.140
but the text of the editorial article doesn't say what Alex

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.100
is telling his audience.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:43.600
It does.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:47.100
The essential game that Alex plays is to make really scary

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.900
claims that attempt to defend them by pointing to evidence

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.940
that might appear to support the argument, but is actually

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.740
misrepresented or a completely fake thing.

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.620
You could sum up most of his career just with that one

01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:59.180
sentence.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.460
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:07.980
You know, is it possible for things to be great after the

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.420
only people to invent the word great are gone?

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.180
I'm not sure I'm following you, but you're still doing

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:17.820
hand gestures.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.620
Humanity.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:25.260
If humanity has gone extinct, there's no consciousness to

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.700
reflect upon the quality of things.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.380
The concept of great would be gone.

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:32.940
Counterpoint.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.260
What's that?

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.340
What about that octopus who predicts soccer games?

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.420
Ah, yeah, but I bet the octopus feels in a different,

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.700
you know, it's not great.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.420
The octopus is just like, it's really octopussy right now.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.740
He likes Bond movies.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.860
Yeah, I'm getting a real good vibe about it right now.

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.340
Yeah.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.060
All right, fine.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:50.620
Okay.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.540
I don't know what that octopus would think about this,

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:57.100
but I do think that Alex might be trying to launch a chain

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.900
email.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.860
I got really confused listening to this clip.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.740
Legitimately, I was sitting in my chair like,

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.500
what are you talking about?

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.380
What is this?

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.100
Okay, let me read you this first.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.580
I meant to cover this yesterday.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.500
And since I didn't cover it, I said, well, let me just send

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.260
it to a bunch of national talk show host.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:18.540
I like and I sent it off to some folks and I got some good

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.380
responses back and they said, yeah, we're going to, we're

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.900
going to definitely look into this and use this.

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.340
And so, uh, well, one great talk show said, I'm going to

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.300
steal this from you.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.940
And I said, I can't steal it from me because it's the truth.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.460
And I didn't write it.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:35.420
Irishman 1776 did in the video I did Sunday.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.300
Okay.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.300
I got to stop right there just because like, I'm listening

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.980
to this and I'm like, Irishman 1776 wrote this and you're

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.620
sending it to like your contacts in the media.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.020
Some commenter on your website wrote something.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:47.500
Yep.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:47.980
Okay.

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.020
That's the state of play.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.420
We're at about marvelous Marvin Hagler dying, his organs

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:59.100
liquefying sadly, one day after he took the MRNA vaccine.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.180
Similar to what happened to Hank Aaron.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.300
So if we can put up the live show feed name of the broadcast

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.540
today, we'll, we'll go to that in a moment.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.300
It's on info wars.com, the live show feed.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.180
There it is.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:16.140
Politico celebrates end of humanity, total sterilization

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.420
by 2045.

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:18.540
Wow.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.740
That's quite a headline.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.580
Top scientists directly link MRNA vaccines to infertility

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.220
and women.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.740
Of course we should add cancer.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:29.820
Also top scientists warns world to hold all COVID vaccines

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:33.980
immediately or uncontrollable monster quote will be unleashed.

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:39.420
Now let's go ahead and read what Irishman 1776 said.

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.220
And the reason I put the headline of the show up is we're

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:46.220
going to add what the Irishman 1776 said, and you can read

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.180
this, it's all true.

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.540
This is all public information.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.300
It's prima facia on its face.

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.940
And we're going to post what he said in the live show feed

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.980
of the broadcast today, where Politico is celebrating the

01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.860
end of humanity.

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.500
So you can share this because a lot of the crew saw this

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.660
this morning and said, you know, I'm going to give this

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.620
to my family.

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.260
What would happen if you went to info wars.com and copied

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:10.300
it, put it in email and told other people to share it and

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:10.940
pay it forward.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:14.540
We might actually turn around this globalist extermination

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.260
operation.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.060
We could win.

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.460
If you just take what the Irishman wrote, I, I refuse,

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.660
refuse.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.980
So listen to first-hand information from Irishman 1776.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.940
You're not.

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.740
And we'll get to that.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.380
Oh boy.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.700
But first, just long and short of this, Politico isn't

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.580
celebrating infertility in the end of people being able to

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:34.380
reproduce.

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:39.180
It's a, they had an interview with a doctor who is theorizing

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.100
that we are running into fertility problems in the next

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.140
couple of decades because of some chemicals.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.820
And the answer to that, I guess, would probably be

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:51.180
regulation of business or industry regulations.

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:55.580
Industry byproducts, you don't register, you don't regulate

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.340
murder.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.620
Sure.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.180
So the problem with assigning these kinds of things like

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.140
Alex is doing to anonymous screen names is I have no idea

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.300
who Irishman 1776 is.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.700
And I don't know if he's the same person who uses that

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.300
screen name on Reddit.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.180
If he is, then he posted this message two years ago in an

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.940
Oklahoma based Reddit board quote, I'm 22 and I'm trying to

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:17.980
lose my virginity.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.340
Ladies, hit me up.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.260
Obviously, you need to be 18 or older.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.100
Aside from that, I don't care about age.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.940
I don't care about race or looks.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.620
I don't care about your marital status.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.820
No idea if that's the same guy or if he ended up losing that

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:30.380
virginity.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.980
But you can see the problem here.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.380
It's kind of silly to base your reporting on anonymous

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.260
internet comments.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:35.760
Well.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.340
Also, this is really funny to see Alex trying to get this

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.900
comment on his website sent out to people like Tucker Carlson

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.060
and make it into a chain email that your grandparents could

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:49.340
send to you because the user, the 1776 Irishman, didn't write

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:49.900
it.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.780
If you Google the text of this post, you will find that

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.940
Irishman 1776 is just reposting a meme that I can find being

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.140
posted on Facebook as early as at least January 31st.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.580
I looked around a little more and I found the exact text of

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.980
the Irishman's comment being tweeted out by an Indian

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.900
actress named Pooja Bedi on January 15th.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.460
There's a number of responses to her tweet indicating that

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.860
this was a message that had been circulating previously on

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:18.060
WhatsApp and Pooja had just copied and pasted it from there.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.820
This is an old anti-vax meme that Alex didn't bother to look

01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.700
into and is pretending is the work of some sagely analysis

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.940
that one of his anonymous viewers conducted.

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.500
This is outrageously sad whether or not this is the same

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.260
guy trying to get laid on Reddit.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.500
Oh, also the claims in the meme aren't real.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.300
Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.060
It better not be David O'Doherty.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.940
If it's him, I'm disappointed.

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:46.300
That's Mr. Show showing up at the Capitol, David.

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.020
So if you're listening, it might be Patrick McMahon.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.660
So Alex reads the meme and it's basically just like,

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.660
if I get vaccinated, can I go in public?

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:56.700
The government says no.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.460
All this nonsense.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.100
Sure.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.300
Anyway, Alex is like, yeah, you got to fucking get this out

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.500
there because we're going to win.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.100
And there it is.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:08.540
We'll take this live segment later and add it to the page at

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.060
band.video and the live show feed so you can share this video

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:12.860
of the breakdown.

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.820
But I suggest you just share the text of it now at

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:20.060
infoawars.com and newswars.com in the live show feed with

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.660
everyone you know and this live link or roll over and die.

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.340
Separately.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.620
We only have two days left.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.380
It will end on Thursday.

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.020
Separately?

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.700
Free shipping store wide will end.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.620
Or perhaps synergistically.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.340
Oh, God.

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:37.420
Separately.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:41.660
The Irishman1776 posted a dumb meme in my comment section.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.500
We're going to start a chain email about it.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.060
Yeah.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.580
Send it along or die.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:45.740
Yeah.

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.780
Which is actually something I remember seeing in dumb chain

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.260
emails.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.380
It does seem to, I do seem to recall if I don't send this

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.060
to 10 people, I will die.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:54.940
You just sleep.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.060
I do recall that.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.580
He's a chain email now.

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.420
Yes, it has become a chain email.

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:03.340
Yeah, he's reached his final Pokemon evolution.

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:07.180
Yeah, I think I want to reach back to something he said on

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:11.660
the previous episode, which is that many people on the left

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.540
are just useful idiots who are destroying their lives.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:22.620
And I feel like I'm more looking to apply that to Alex himself.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.780
Yeah, I think about something he said on the previous episode,

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:29.100
and that is that all the big wigs and the higher ups and

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.300
the anti globalist world are like, Alex, you're such a genius.

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:37.100
I can't believe that you're in communication with Irishman 1776.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:37.740
Where?

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.140
How do you know so much?

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:40.940
Can you imagine?

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.020
How are you right about everything?

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.380
Well, I read about Irishman 1776.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:49.180
World leaders listen to Alex's show and hear him talk about

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:50.060
dumb bullshit.

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.260
People posted his comments.

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.740
That's because what?

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:56.700
Putin doesn't have the time to go through Info Wars comments.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.660
No, certainly not.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.300
So he's got to let Alex filter that shit for him.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.820
And to be honest, I know that a lot of people, they say that

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.940
it's tough to listen to Info Wars without our filter.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.460
And I totally understand that.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.660
I get it.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.060
And I think Alex could actually be a filter for his own

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:15.020
comments, because even I don't think I could handle his

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:15.660
comment section.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.700
No, no, no, no.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.220
I think even that would be too toxic.

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.620
Alex should do a show where he takes all the Nazi comments

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.260
out and there wouldn't be much.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:29.100
There would be one comment from Irishman 1776.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.940
There'd be a bunch of people that would just be, like,

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.140
reposting of memes.

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:32.780
Yeah.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:38.540
Anyway, Alex has found a new operation that proves something.

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.780
You think Joe Biden is even in on this?

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:42.540
No, Joe Biden does what he's told.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.900
It's the Rockefellers.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.020
It's the Rothschilds.

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:45.900
It's the Globalist.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.020
And Bill Gates works directly under the Rockefeller Brothers

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:49.820
Foundation.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.500
I thought he was on the council now.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:57.980
Was Event 201, was Operation Crimson Contagion, which I will

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.500
cover tomorrow.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.100
It's just so complex and so important.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.980
I procrastinated on it because I wanted to read hundreds

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.300
of pages of stuff on it, and I've gone over it.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.700
But guys, give me the folder on Crimson Contagion.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.100
I want to make sure that we hit that tomorrow, because that's

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.060
so critical.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.220
One of my favorite things in the world is things that are

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:16.460
so important that Alex will reference them, but have to

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.380
resist to getting into them until tomorrow.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:18.860
Oh, yeah.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.540
Seems like you should really take this seriously.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.260
You might.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.220
So in fairness, Crimson Contagion was a real thing.

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.620
It was a series of exercises undertaken by the Trump

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.180
Department of Health and Human Services, which took place

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.820
between January and August 2019.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:35.260
The New York Times reported on the exercises last March in

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.740
a conversation about how dreadfully Trump and his

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.980
administration dropped the ball in terms of dealing with

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.260
the novel coronavirus.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:45.180
There was a report that was completed in October 2019, and

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.340
reading it is really depressing today.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.780
This report, based on an exercise testing response to a

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.900
novel influenza outbreak, is full of lessons we learned

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.340
after the coronavirus outbreak.

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:58.620
Things like, quote, currently there are insufficient funding

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.860
sources designated for the federal government to use in

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:04.460
response to severe influenza pandemic, or, quote, state and

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.940
federal entities identified challenges in implementing

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.220
remote work telework policies as a workforce protection

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.420
measure, or, quote, the current medical countermeasure supply

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:16.540
chain and production capacity cannot meet the demands imposed

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.100
by nations during global influenza pandemic.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.420
Yeah, they knew all that stuff before.

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:27.100
Yeah, this is the result of living in both a we can develop

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:31.100
a vaccine in six months and a we believe witches are causing

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.460
our problems circumstance.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:32.940
Yeah.

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:35.740
Yeah, all of our scientists and professional people were

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.140
like, here are the problems we'll face in a pandemic.

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:38.540
Yes.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.180
And they were like, what if instead we do nothing?

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.940
What if we get rid of all the witches?

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.140
Yeah, what if you take zinc?

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:44.540
Yeah.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.420
So this report also highlighted that exercise participants

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:50.540
were confused about which organizations, local or federal,

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.620
took the lead in the case of an outbreak, which is.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.540
Oh, boy.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.140
So sure fucking was everybody whenever the federal government

01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.580
decided to kill us all.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:03.260
This document is a really huge problem for someone like Alex,

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.340
because it basically demonstrates that the Trump Health

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.820
and Human Services Department was asleep at the wheel when

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.380
it came to implementing the changes recommended by this

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.420
exercise.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:14.060
They did this study that revealed things that were clearly

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:14.700
a problem.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.660
Then Trump did nothing and the public paid for it.

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:18.060
Yep.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.020
It's basically it.

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:19.500
Yep.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.460
This exercise is a strong indicator that had Trump run

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:25.340
an efficient, effective and competent government, we could

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.740
have avoided so much of the pain and misery that's come from

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.020
COVID-19.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.500
This is something that was reported on over a year ago in

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.380
the mainstream media, but I guess Alex just heard about it.

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:37.740
So he's got to come out and do some spin because it so clearly

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.780
shows that Trump's government had every reason to be aware

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.460
of where some of the difficulties would be.

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.420
In the case of a pandemic, Alex has to make this exercise

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.060
itself part of the globalist conspiracy in the plot.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:48.700
Totally.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.260
Alex claims to be tomorrow's news today, but in reality,

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:54.060
he's last year's spin being half-assed tomorrow.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:54.560
Yeah.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.540
I was really proud of that line.

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.980
Yeah, I know you delivered it with a plum, Dan.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.260
I could have hit it a little bit harder, but you know, we

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:04.540
can we can do two takes.

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.420
No, we can't.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.300
Okay.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.460
Yeah, it's just it's a bummer.

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:15.100
I mean, I remember when that report was first out last year.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.380
I remember reading about it.

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:20.220
I didn't remember that name, although quite catchy, and I'm

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:25.740
sure we'll be hearing Crimson Contagion quite a bit from Alex.

01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.820
But yeah, I'd kind of forgotten about some of the findings

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:33.820
of it and how like a year ago, I think a lot of it would

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.460
have felt different than it does now.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:36.940
Totally.

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:39.340
Because I don't think that we would have realized how we

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.940
relearned all those things back in March 2020.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:46.780
Like one thing that is a little bit fucking me up about

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:53.580
how we deal with this is we do talk a lot about, rightfully,

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:58.060
all of the people that the Trump administration has sentenced

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.980
to death, all of the people that have been crippled by the

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:07.260
response. And at the same time, we don't talk about it.

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.900
It's also their fault that we were trapped inside for a

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:16.380
fucking year. A year of everyone's life was taken around

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:20.700
the fucking world because nobody could fucking respond to

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.220
this like a goddamn adult.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.380
And it's very frustrating.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.460
Yeah, it's very frustrating.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.180
It is.

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.140
Yeah, I'm with you.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.660
Anyway, because it's such a damning piece of evidence

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:37.740
against the effectiveness and the proper response by his

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.980
God King. It's part of the conspiracy.

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:40.700
Yeah, it has to be.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.700
It's them revealing their plans.

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:47.580
So Alex gets to talking about Zbigniew Brzezinski a little

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:47.980
bit.

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.380
Sure.

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.180
Now is a good time.

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:53.660
I didn't know this, but apparently Zbigniew Brzezinski gave

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.380
a speech one time and he's like, kill everyone.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.620
That would be an interesting thing for Brzezinski to do.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:16:59.340
I was surprised.

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.140
That's a new one.

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.340
I was surprised to hear that.

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:02.220
That was a new one.

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.940
And so there's the Rockefellers in the 60s going, we need

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:09.180
to sterilize people. That's actually just talking about,

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:09.980
like, birth control.

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.860
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.420
Well, now they've learned fertility is so strong.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.860
Unless you remove the sexual organs, it's best just to kill

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.660
people. That's why Brzezinski, before he died, gave that

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:24.460
speech to CFR in Canada, their CFR, and said, their CFR?

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:28.060
It is now much easier instead of propagandizing a million

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.660
people to kill a million people.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.780
We have passed the point of being able to convince them.

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.020
Now it is time to kill them.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.620
His daughter is married to Psycho Joe.

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.820
And he's not being found with dead interns, their brains

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:42.780
bashed out.

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:45.180
He's up there calling for forced inoculations.

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.580
Know your enemy.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.500
You know, I just quoted Zbigniew Brzezinski.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.060
Go look it up.

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.740
It is time to move forward against them.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.180
There is no convincing them now.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.260
It is easier to kill them.

01:17:59.180 --> 01:17:59.900
Odd choice.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:00.540
And he goes on.

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.300
It would be good to convince them.

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.580
You will not win this fight.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.940
Only killing them will work now.

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.700
And we're just supposed to go, oh, okay.

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.380
We're supposed to go, oh, okay.

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:20.300
So if I'm to understand, a man famous for really good

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:25.660
writing, speaking, and diplomatic language just went to

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.940
Canada one time and was like, look, we got to kill everybody.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.060
First of all, it wasn't in Canada.

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.940
Second, yeah, this is silly.

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:34.460
Although it is fun.

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.420
And one of the things I think is most revealing about a

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:38.940
clip like that is, like, know your enemy.

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.300
Like, no, know your fake enemy.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:42.780
Yeah, this is not real.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:45.020
I'm not here to go to bed for Zbigniew Brzezinski or any

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.460
of, like, I'm not defending any specifics about his foreign

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:51.420
policy, but I'm looking at this claim that Alex is making.

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.740
And the quote is real.

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.260
I mean, part of the quote is real.

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:58.620
There's a short clip of him that gets passed around a lot

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:01.340
where he says, quote, in earlier times, it was easier to

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.700
control a million people.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.100
Literally, it was easier to control a million people than

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.020
physically to kill a million people.

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.820
Today, it's infinitely easier to kill a million people than

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.100
to control a million people.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.940
Oh, so you mean he's describing perhaps humanity's ability

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.580
to drop a giant bomb on one another.

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.220
It was hard to find a full transcript of the speech or any

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.620
concrete citations of what else was said.

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:26.700
And I'm certain from the jump that Alex is making all this

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.420
shit up.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.620
What Brzezinski is saying here is kind of just true, like

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:33.020
weapons development have been such over the past hundred

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:35.260
years that it's technically easier to kill a million people

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.620
than it is to control them.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.380
That's descriptively accurate.

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.780
I can see no indication from that clip that gets passed

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.660
around that he's saying that it's good to control or kill

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.300
people.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.220
That's where the disagreement with Alex comes in.

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:49.740
It doesn't seem like this has any moral indications.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:50.540
Right, right, right, right.

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:53.740
So this quote comes from a November 17th, 2008 speech at

01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.020
the Chatham House.

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.740
The rest of the clip that goes around that you can find has

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.740
to do with the fact that there was a political awakening

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.780
happening around the world.

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:03.820
So I found it interesting that when I was looking around, the

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:07.660
next thing I found was a December 16th, 2008 op-ed that

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:10.620
Brzezinski had published in the New York Times titled, quote,

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:12.540
the Global Political Awakening.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.340
Sure.

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:15.980
The article is basically making the argument that the US's

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:18.300
leadership role in the world was severely tarnished by

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.260
things like the Iraq War, and Obama was coming into office

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:24.380
with a very serious need to recover international legitimacy.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:29.500
It sure seems to happen after a lot of presidents, doesn't

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:29.900
it, Dan?

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.660
Certainly, certainly.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:31.980
Yeah.

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.860
The issue that compounded things was that countries like

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.580
China, Japan, and India were taking a more prominent role

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.100
in the global stage.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:42.460
Brzezinski had this to say, quote, in this dynamically

01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.020
changing world, the crisis of American leadership could

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:47.500
become the crisis of global stability.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.380
Yet in the foreseeable future, no state or combination of

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.420
states can replace the linchpin role America plays in the

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.700
international system.

01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.900
Without US recovery, there will be no global recovery.

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.780
The only alternative to a constructive American role is

01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:01.660
global chaos.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.180
The New York Times op-ed was an incomplete text of the

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:07.740
speech, but the full version was published in the January

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:11.580
2009 edition of the journal International Affairs.

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.620
If you read the quote in its full context in the actual

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.340
article, what Brzezinski is talking about is the ending of

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.420
American colonialism, which the need for which is demonstrated

01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.020
by the Iraq War.

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:23.340
Right.

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.060
Right, right.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.220
Again, another one of those lessons that we knew before we

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:29.100
did the thing.

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:29.820
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:33.100
Quote, these major world powers, new and old, also face

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.460
a novel reality.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:37.100
While the lethality of their military might is greater than

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.980
ever, their capacity to impose control over the politically

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.020
awakened masses of the world is at a historic low.

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.820
To put it bluntly, in earlier times, it was easier to control

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.060
one million people than to physically kill one million

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.620
people.

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:51.100
Today, it's infinitely easier to kill one million people

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.100
than to control one million people.

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.460
That insight bears directly on the use of force, particularly

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.620
by societies that are culturally alien, even if technically

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.660
superior.

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.940
As a result, in the current post-colonial era, it is too

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:07.420
costly to undertake colonial wars.

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.540
That is a reality some recent American policymakers failed

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:13.100
to assimilate to America's detriment.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.700
It's very clear that the context of what he's saying has

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:23.660
to do with the gaffes, let's say, of Bush war policy.

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:24.300
Yeah.

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:25.580
And to pretend...

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:29.820
The genocidal tendencies of the far right in all countries.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.940
To pretend that Zbigniew Brzezinski, in that article, or

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.420
in that speech, which is just a transcript of the article.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:35.900
Yeah.

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.900
I'm sorry, a transcript of the speech.

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:41.340
To pretend that what he's saying is, it used to be easier

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.420
to control a million people than it was to kill them.

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.940
Now it's easier to kill them, so we should just kill them.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:45.820
So we should just kill them.

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.020
That's fucking bullshit.

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:47.740
That's insane.

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.940
Yeah, that's outrageous.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.860
I mean, Alex is just making shit up.

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.780
And know your enemy.

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.180
Yeah.

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.700
The fake one that I'm going to tell you.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:55.420
The fake one that I have to tell you.

01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.620
Because I want to scare you.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:00.380
Because if you knew the real one, you would be like, oh, no,

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.980
I think Alex might be my enemy.

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:05.020
Yeah, Alex is your enemy, and also Zbigniew Brzezinski had

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.740
some ideas that you should take issue with it, but it's going

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.860
to be difficult for you to wrestle with some of the

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.580
interconnected realities that Zbigniew Brzezinski, who's

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.140
dealing with, that Alex is pretending don't exist.

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:19.900
Someone might say that if you were above the two party system

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.620
and famously opposed to the Iraq war, if I remember correctly,

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.340
right, Alex was opposed to the Iraq war?

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.180
Yeah.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:29.900
Yeah.

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:34.700
So it seems like you would be like, yeah, I'm glad that even

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:40.460
people on the left paradigm are like, the Iraq war is bad.

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:42.300
If you were above the two party system.

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.500
Well, he's not, it's all an act, and I don't think he's ever

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.180
actually even read that full speech.

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.060
Oh, why would he?

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:48.860
He got what he needed.

01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:51.580
He's seen the memes and that little clip that went around,

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.220
and then he wrote a story about the rest of the context,

01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.940
and the rest of the context for Alex is a dumb impression.

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.700
And, oh, so we must kill them.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.700
It's time to move and kill people.

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:01.180
Yep.

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.620
So it's so stupid.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.020
And then claiming that's a direct quote.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.060
Like, fuck off.

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:06.700
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.540
It's abusive to the audience.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:13.180
I mean, it doesn't give them the ability to actually choose

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:15.660
who they like and dislike in the world.

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:19.260
When you create completely false portraits of your enemies

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:22.700
because you want to scare them and keep them in your side.

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.620
Yeah, that's why you start a cult.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:28.940
I don't want these people to have a choice of their own.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:29.660
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.420
So Jordan, we got a guest.

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:33.260
This is a guy that I haven't heard of before.

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:33.820
I haven't seen.

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:35.820
Guy named Stu Peters.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:36.540
Stu Peters.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:41.020
And so I looked him up and I thought his name was spelled S-T-U Peters.

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:41.660
Uh-huh.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.060
And so I looked that guy up and apparently there's, like,

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.420
a broadcaster in the UK who got in trouble for, like,

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.740
making some offensive comments about Black Lives Matter.

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:50.300
That sounds right.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.660
I was like, that's an Infowars guest.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.580
That's probably an Infowars guest.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.220
There you go.

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.580
Different Stu Peters.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.980
So if I understand correctly now,

01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.060
I know it requires three to have a pattern,

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:03.980
but I am beginning to suspect that all Stu Peters are bad.

01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.540
I mean, I know of two.

01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.420
I am sorry if there's any Stu Peters in our audience,

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.140
but these two are not, they're not helping your team.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:16.300
If there are, I need to know now you need to break the pattern of threes.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:16.700
Yeah.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:21.580
Because once we get to three, I'm going to then assume all Stu Peters from now on.

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.460
Evil people.

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:24.220
So Stu Peters is not stupendous.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:26.300
Shut up.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.380
That wasn't my problem.

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.140
I like how I told you to shut up when you said nothing.

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:34.640
Yeah.

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:40.460
So Stu Peters is on and I just, this guy's a shithead,

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:44.540
but like, I found this clip really interesting because he is like,

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:47.820
if he's auditioning for a job with Infowars, he nailed it.

01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:48.380
Okay.

01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:49.580
So many buzzwords.

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:52.060
And we ran out of time when I was preparing this episode,

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:55.020
but I was legit going to make bingo cards.

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:55.340
Oh, okay.

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.580
Because it's just like, I got bingo.

01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:58.380
He's hitting them all?

01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:01.820
I legitimately said in the middle of this clip, when I was listening to the episode,

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:02.460
I got bingo.

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.820
Did you need to use the free space or did you get...

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:06.220
No.

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:06.540
No.

01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:06.780
Okay.

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.980
Actually, I got a blackout.

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:09.100
You got a blackout?

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:09.600
Yeah.

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:15.740
So due process here is not something that we deal with in the new woke states of America.

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:20.300
This is a condemnation, a demasculisation, a feminization, the neutering,

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.580
the castration of law enforcement officers everywhere, all over the place.

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.740
The rank and file is no longer effective.

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.500
Policing is a hundred percent dead.

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.060
Let's get rid of them then.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:33.260
It's been overtaken by this liberal, woke, leftist, swamp, communist, radical,

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:36.220
totalitarian, fascist leadership style.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:36.780
Lionel!

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.420
That basically...

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.700
Where'd you come from?

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:41.180
Is the new Nazi style brown shirts.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:44.780
Oh God, I got exhausted.

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.580
That's all I hear.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.740
All I hear is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.780
But I was also listening to that.

01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.860
I'm like, Alex is going to want to hire this fucking dude.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:51.820
This guy is...

01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:53.820
He's got info written all over him.

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:54.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:57.980
And then it turns out that he got into a little bit of white victimhood.

01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.300
And I'm like, Alex is writing a contract right now.

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.300
During his other interviews, Alex is eating a cheeseburger.

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:05.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.820
On the edge of his seat saying buzzwords.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:08.460
That's all Alex needs to hear.

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.780
This guy's calling a lawyer to get a contract drawn up.

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:11.580
Oh boy.

01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:16.380
Okay, we are legalizing crime in the United States of America and villainizing anybody

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:20.860
who expects the protection of the police, anybody who backs or supports law enforcement,

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.300
and anybody who just wants to get up every day and enjoy the sanctity of a nice quiet

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.900
neighborhood and go to work.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:30.540
If you are a white, God-fearing, patriotic Christian conservative specifically, you are

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.060
destined for the gulags.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.500
You're going to hell, period.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:37.260
You're the criminal and you should watch your six because there is not anybody at the

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:40.700
higher ranks of law enforcement or the government that truly has your back.

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:43.980
All these institutions that we were raised, Alex, trying to be taught, these are the

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:47.100
people that we can trust, are exactly the ones that are coming after you.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.620
They don't like whites anymore.

01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:55.180
Oh, we used to own everything, but now we don't.

01:27:55.180 --> 01:28:04.700
Yeah, I think that typically when I hear someone who's got this verbal pattern, this guy

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:09.020
who throws around buzzwords like he does, this guy who's...

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:15.260
I mean, the whole reason he's on is to talk about the Floyd trial, the Derek Chauvin trial,

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:20.460
and that's what is the neutering of the police and what have you.

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:26.300
And so when I hear him bring up something like straight, God-fearing, white conservatives

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:29.020
are heading for a gulag, I'm like, I gotta go, man.

01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:37.340
I can't stand these people because this is the type of shit where you're like, one, in

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:42.460
a certain sense, this is a benchmark of the progress of the conservative right because

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:48.780
you could grab that exact dude, put him in the 60s and he'd say the exact same shit,

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:50.460
but it'd be more explicit.

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.620
Take him, put him in the 30s.

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:57.500
He'd be saying the exact same shit, but even more explicit than the 60s.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.340
And then put him in the 1890s.

01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:01.020
You go far enough back, he's a Democrat.

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.420
Motherfucker wants slaves and he's a Democrat.

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:03.980
Yeah.

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:05.980
You know, like, that's what this guy is.

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:10.140
I know this guy from every period of American history.

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:10.860
Go away.

01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:16.140
We're leaving you behind, just get up to speed, man.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:18.220
I'm not a fan of what he brings to the table.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:23.660
And I actually had a really complicated sort of experience with trying to figure out, like,

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:24.540
what's this guy's deal?

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:24.940
Yeah.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:27.500
Turns out, like, he used to be a bounty hunter.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.820
And so I was like, man, you should have just stayed a bounty hunter.

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.420
But then I'm like, I don't want you to be a bounty hunter.

01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.940
No, absolutely not.

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.220
I don't want you to do either of the jobs you're doing.

01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:35.580
This is an evil person.

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.060
Yeah.

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:36.540
Yeah.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.580
I don't want you to be a pundit nor bounty hunter.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.100
Uh-uh.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:44.540
So it turns out just two weeks ago, he was a bounty hunter.

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.180
Great.

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.460
You should try data entry as a medium ground.

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.020
No, no, no.

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:52.140
It turns out if you listen to this clip carefully, he doesn't know much about data.

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:52.780
That's fair.

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:57.260
The level of gaslighting has reached Mad Hatter levels here.

01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.260
And so lay out some of those numbers.

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:04.140
Well, you know, I don't have exact up-to-date numbers.

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.060
Here's what I do have.

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:11.340
And I only stopped chasing fugitives just weeks ago after 18 years of doing this.

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:17.180
And so it was my job in writing and staying proficient in these numbers to understand

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.620
what's really going on in every single community that we serve.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:24.220
Because regardless of whether or not we're cops, we're doing a job where we're arresting

01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.420
people, taking people to jail.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.980
And it's a very real probability I've been shot at.

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:32.140
I mainly deal with people of color, with black folks.

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:35.020
And I don't know why that is.

01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:37.580
But that's what the facts are.

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:41.900
And the facts are that last year, when we look at the cops and the black people and

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:47.580
this big theory of systemic racism, and I'm looking at it right here, nine unarmed black

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:49.420
people were killed by cops last year.

01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:49.740
Nine.

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:55.500
19 white unarmed people were killed by cops last year.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:59.820
More officers are killed every single year than unarmed blacks.

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:02.140
So the question is, when does the blue lives matter?

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:05.980
So I can sort this out for Stu really fast if he's actually interested.

01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:09.420
The reason more cops are shot each year than unarmed black people is because they're

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.860
cops, and the job comes with a heightened likelihood of encountering criminals with

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:13.660
guns.

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:17.420
It's not good that cops are shot, but it's also an understandable aspect of that line

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:22.300
of work, an element that they don't share with people who happen to be black and unarmed.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:27.580
As for the discrepancy between nine unarmed black people and 19 unarmed white people

01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:32.300
being killed by cops last year, this is another one that's really super easy to sort out.

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:36.220
I have no idea if his numbers are even accurate, but let's assume for the sake of argument

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:38.220
that they are, because that's what he's bringing to the table.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:43.180
According to the US Census data, in 2019, the most recent numbers that he could find,

01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:48.780
the US population is 60.1% white and 12.5% black.

01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:53.100
Assuming Stu's numbers are correct, even though there are more total white people who

01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:58.620
are shot by cops, it's still wildly disproportionate when viewed in terms of the population sizes.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:03.100
If the country were 50% white and 50% black, then his numbers might mean something, but

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:07.180
the demographics don't look like that, and his numbers are nothing more than props that

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.220
he's using to mask the underlying racism of his actual argument.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:15.180
The thrust of this, and the main point, is that we shouldn't be concerned about police

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:18.620
killing unarmed black people, and I find that offensive.

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:22.460
We should care about police killing people, regardless of other variables involved, but

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:27.260
even Stu's own numbers illustrate that there's a much higher likelihood of an unarmed black

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.820
person being killed by police than an unarmed white person.

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:34.620
Basically, this clip is a perfect encapsulation about how I feel about Stu Peters.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:38.700
He's either too stupid to know that the stats he's using are meaningless, or he understands

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:43.020
exactly what he's doing, and he's trying to minimize issues related to race and policing.

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:47.660
If he's this sloppy with something like that, that in theory has something to do with his

01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:52.780
primary field of expertise since he was a bounty hunter, if he's that sloppy there, I'm not

01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:57.340
going to listen to him on any topic that he's not conceivably an expert in.

01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:59.500
I don't want to know what this guy thinks about COVID-19.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:00.300
Who cares?

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:05.980
Yeah, you know, I've never wondered why it is bounty hunters aren't in charge of things,

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.700
but I think there's a good reason.

01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:11.100
You don't support the reign of King Dog?

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:15.020
I just don't think that bounty hunters should really be in charge of things.

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.740
I mean, now look, I love Cowboy Bebop.

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.580
I think bounty hunting is great.

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:20.540
Yeah, that's great.

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:21.500
Fantastic.

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.460
Mandalorian.

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.180
All of it.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:23.660
Great.

01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.700
Good stuff.

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:26.780
They don't run things, though.

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:31.980
I'm aware of, since I listened to this interview, this guy, I'm aware of two bounty hunters,

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:33.260
him and Dog.

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:36.460
Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.980
I don't know any of these people.

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:39.820
Radical Edward and Ein.

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.660
I'm talking about real life.

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.380
Oh, okay.

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:49.260
Um, so there's Dog and this guy, and both of them have stories about crossing the border

01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.860
and trying to kidnap somebody.

01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:51.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:56.620
Dog did that, and then this guy was telling a story on Alex's show about how he got in

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.700
trouble for going to Mexico to try to extradite somebody.

01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:59.740
It's like, you can't do that!

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:01.180
I'm a bounty hunter!

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.700
Why do I have to pay attention to international law?

01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:06.220
Look, I am Batman.

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:10.540
I go wherever I want to solve crimes.

01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:13.100
Yeah, slash just grab, grab people.

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:13.820
Fuck this guy.

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.980
I skipped most of his interview.

01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:16.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:22.460
When you got this annoying of a voice, you disqualify yourself that hard on stats?

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:23.580
I don't even really care.

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.080
Yeah.

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.180
And...

01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:28.620
And literally everything you say is just a giant racist dog whistle.

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:29.100
Yes.

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:29.580
Yeah.

01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:33.180
And we have a return on the podcast.

01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:35.900
We have a return of somebody we haven't seen in a little bit while.

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:36.140
Okay.

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:36.940
A little bit while.

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:37.980
A little bit while.

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.820
We got the Health Ranger, Mike Adams.

01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:40.380
Who?

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:47.580
He has a story about a guy who has an interesting perspective.

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:52.300
I don't fully understand it myself, and it would be kind of silly for me to try to pontificate

01:34:52.300 --> 01:35:00.380
about it, but he's a guy who's trying to make an argument that a vaccine, it works on individual

01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:06.460
levels, but there may be some negative consequences from applying them broadly across the population

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.060
when there's already an outbreak.

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:08.560
Sure.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.000
As I understand, that's the argument that he's putting forth.

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.920
Mike Adams takes that and now is on a new tip.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.320
Okay.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.200
He's on a new tip.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.520
Is it under for humanity?

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.720
No, it's really, really over for humanity.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.800
So what can we do?

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.240
Of course, all the things that you've been talking about and your guess, Alex, which

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.920
is boost your immune function, make sure you have good nutrition, get plenty of rest and

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:39.040
avoid vaccinated people because they are the virus shedders.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.200
They are the mutant factories.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.000
And then get educated and try to educate the people around you so that they learn before

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.160
they run over and try to get vaccinated.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:53.760
Because if you vaccinate yourself as an ignorant, uninformed person, you are sacrificing your

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.000
life.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.920
I call it vaccine suicide.

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:57.520
Wow.

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.880
That's something.

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.120
I mean, you could have called it vaccine aside.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:01.840
You could.

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.320
Yeah.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.120
I think it rolls off the tongue a lot better.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.640
And Mike thinks he's a rapper.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.600
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.960
Get the fuck out of here.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:13.200
Even Alex can invent words that already existed.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:13.440
Yeah.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.680
This is kind of interesting to me because it's like, okay, this has evolved now.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.880
And now Mike Adams is saying, avoid anyone who's been vaccinated.

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.120
How do you get away with it?

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.200
You said it's over for humanity.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.240
Now you're gone.

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:32.960
I think the idea that he's trying to put forth is that people who get vaccinated will end

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.440
up causing mutations of the virus.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:41.120
And then they will give you the incubators for a whole new generation of murder.

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:41.360
Right.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.400
So you got to avoid them.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.000
This is going to turn into, like, I don't know.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.400
Obviously, I don't know how many people take any of this seriously.

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:55.360
But assuming that there are, you've got to think that this would lead to communes.

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:55.600
Yeah.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.360
You have to isolate yourself from all other people.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.480
Only trust what Alex Jones and Mike Adams say.

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:09.760
And I don't know, they're really mad about the idea that international travel countries

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:12.160
might require proof of vaccination to get in.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:15.840
They're going to have to create communities where proof of non-vaccination is the only

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:16.560
way you can get in.

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.440
It seems so.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.840
And if they have an outbreak in those communities, they're wiped out almost immediately.

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:22.080
Right.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:29.120
Yeah, this is just dumb.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:29.680
I don't know.

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.960
Anyway, I like how these guys have bad solutions to imaginary problems they made up.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.360
Right.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.800
But I think that the function of this narrative in terms of the larger sphere of Infowars

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:47.440
talking points is I think that they recognize that, historically, we've seen outbreaks

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.880
of vaccine preventable conditions in non-vaccinated communities.

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.760
A lot of times anti-vax clusters end up having a resurgence of things that are preventable.

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:02.560
Yeah, that's why measles became a problem again.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.960
And I think that they recognize that there is a decent chance that should COVID stop

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:15.680
being a problem due to widespread vaccination, that they'll end up being blamed because they

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.880
don't want to get vaccinated.

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:19.680
And so they have to create a new explanation for it.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:25.280
And it's vaccinated people have created mutant things within their body.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.440
And then guess what happens?

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:27.680
What?

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.680
Then people are going to come to your house and vaccinate you at gunpoint.

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.040
And not only that, a panic.

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:34.240
I want Daleks to do it.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.520
Hey, race war.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.320
Oh, no.

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.280
Yes.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.000
Damn it.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:38.640
Yep.

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:39.360
I got bingo.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.160
I was so close.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.960
Once the next big wave breaks out from this, could be months, could be a year, according

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:47.840
to medical doctors and scientists, they're going to blame us.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.640
There already are.

01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.960
Even though in the literature, it admits it's not us.

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.520
It doesn't matter.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.800
They're still getting ready to blame us.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.840
This is so dangerous.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.120
You can see the whole plan right now.

01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:02.880
They're going to push the mass panic in the second wave and then say that this justifies

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.400
gunpoint vaccinations.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.360
So at that point, they will be able to have the political power to unleash now the woke

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.720
military to go door to door in cities across America, confiscating your guns and

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:20.880
vaccinating you at gunpoint assault with a race war with gun confiscation.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.200
A medical tyranny civil war is the amended plan.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.280
You see it all being set up now in a minute and a half.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.480
How do we stop it?

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:29.280
Um, 90 seconds.

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.640
I got 90 seconds to tell you how to have to stop a race war, civil war, medical tyranny.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.520
How do we stop it?

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.400
90 seconds.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:37.600
Sound bites only.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.960
No complicated plans.

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.640
Definitely not anything with nuance.

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.200
World debt.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:43.600
Yeah.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.160
Oh shit.

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.040
It's over for humanity.

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:45.540
Yeah.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:46.480
Yeah.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.680
I don't know why the race war got thrown in there except for it's preoccupation.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.360
Just toss a race war in there.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:51.600
Yeah.

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:52.480
Yeah.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:58.000
I mean, this is, this just feels like preemptive narrative building for the possibility of

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.080
resurgences in non-vaccinated communities.

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:00.640
Right.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:07.040
So if I understand correctly so far, what we're dealing with is Alex Jones is the only

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.080
person you can trust.

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.200
You need to avoid all vaccinated people, which probably means you guys need to get together

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:13.920
in a commune.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:14.420
Right.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.280
And a race war is obviously coming.

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:17.840
Uh huh.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.480
So explain to me how different Alex is from Charles Manson.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.080
I think...

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.840
Well, Charles Manson never inspired people to storm the Capitol.

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:30.640
No, that's true.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.840
So there's that.

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:32.640
Yeah.

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.080
I don't, I don't know.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.480
Well, I mean, I guess they are both friends with musicians.

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.800
Billy Corgan's been on Info Wars.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.600
Totally.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:39.920
Huh.

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.960
Uh, Alex hasn't carved a swastika in his head yet.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:45.840
That's true.

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.600
That is true.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:52.560
Now we haven't seen him with his, uh, I wouldn't say, look, I haven't seen him naked.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:55.280
I'm not saying he hasn't carved a swastika somewhere.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.320
It's interesting.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.440
Um, proof, evidence of...

01:40:59.440 --> 01:40:59.680
Wait.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.680
Absence is not absence of evidence.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.200
Or absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:05.920
Something like that.

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:06.560
Yeah.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.760
So, uh, Mike Adams now is predicting that hundreds of millions will be dead because

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.080
of the vaccine though, not because of COVID.

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.360
And you got to just...

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.160
You lose.

01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.600
You don't get to say that.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.920
You just got to say goodbye to your family.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:20.160
All right.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:20.960
Say goodbye.

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.360
Okay.

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:22.320
Wave goodbye.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.080
All the things we just mentioned, take care of your immune system, take care of your health,

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.080
avoid the vaccine at all costs and avoid other people who are vaccinated.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.560
Secondly, we've got to continue to build out our independent platforms like you have done,

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.920
like I'm doing, we've got to continue to expand our reach.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:42.800
You know, the mainstream media is collapsing in terms of its viewership and yet more and

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.960
more people are viewing independent truth media, even though the censorship is, has

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.080
never been worse.

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:52.080
But we are winning to those people who are willing to live.

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.400
Those who want to commit suicide and die, we can't help them any longer.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:01.040
Pray for them, wish them the best, but wave goodbye to those people because many of those

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.680
people, millions or even hundreds of millions may die.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:06.880
But for the survivors, educate, inform, and connect.

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:12.240
And that's how we can rebuild society after this vaccine Holocaust is unleashed upon our

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:12.480
world.

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.120
And that's what it is.

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.760
Alex, it's a vaccine Holocaust.

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.320
Absolutely.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.280
Maybe a thousand times more people than the Holocaust of World War II.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:21.760
We don't know.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:26.240
Everything I got level intellectually tells me this is just incredibly dangerous and we've

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.320
got to warn people now while we still can.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.920
Thousands of times, the people that died in the Holocaust is in the billions.

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.240
Yeah.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:37.360
Well, I mean, unless you believe the Holocaust didn't happen.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.600
Yeah, I guess we got to take Mike's temperature on that.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.600
I'm not sure I've ever actually heard him talk about that.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.200
I'm going to need more specifics on what he thinks the numbers from the Holocaust are.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.160
Holy shit.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.840
This is, this is dramatic.

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.440
It is, it is what though?

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:52.720
It's almost to the one year anniversary of it's over for humanity.

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.200
So it's, you know.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.560
It might be past, might be past.

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.320
So every year we get an it's over for humanity around March.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.760
Beware the Ides of March.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.880
And then in a couple of months, Alex and Michael have a fight about something and it'll disappear

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.800
for a few months and it'll show back up.

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.080
Et tu, Adams?

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.160
Yeah, as dramatic as ever.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.080
God, it's just, he seems like, like a, like a teenager.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:16.480
Yeah.

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:20.240
It really seems like somebody going through puberty.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.200
Like he feels like he's out of control with his own feelings or something.

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:29.280
I don't know how to describe it, but it just feels childish the way that he communicates.

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.960
Yeah, no, it's insane.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:36.000
It's insane and it's insane that people allow this, like people listen to this and don't

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.760
go like, you said it was going to be over for humanity last year.

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:40.960
This is reruns, man.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.640
Well, but also the narrative has shifted so many times since then that it's almost even

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:47.120
impossible to keep track of what it is that's going to kill you.

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.080
Yeah, exactly.

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.680
Or, or how it's going to play out.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.360
But don't forget that they've been consistent the whole time and they're right about everything.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.320
One hundred percent.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.600
It's important that we build our immune systems separately.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.320
The Infowars store, as well as Mac Adams, the health ranger, sell things that can boost

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.680
your immune system.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:04.800
Quote unquote.

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.280
Wasn't he selling like horse dewormer or wasn't he trying to push horse dewormer?

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:09.760
Something.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.560
A while back.

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.280
Motherfucker was a bleach dude, right?

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.800
Or no, he was the Ebola.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.240
The cured Ebola.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.280
The cured Ebola.

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:17.520
Yes.

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.160
With more Ebola.

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.040
Alcohol and Ebola.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.080
Yeah, with more Ebola.

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.160
So what you want to do is you want to take a glass, put some whiskey in it.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.240
Put some whiskey and a little Ebola.

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:27.600
Have yourself a fun time.

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.640
So we have one last guest before we get out of here.

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:33.280
And it's Stuart Rhodes.

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.560
Cool.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.680
And I got to say.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.480
Stews are becoming universally bad.

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.320
Yeah, it's a bad day for stews.

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:41.840
Stews are not having a good day.

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.340
No.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:46.640
I'm going to have to get rid of that dish from my, from my diet.

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.520
It's so bad.

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:48.020
Yeah.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.200
I would say that Stuart's interview is largely the same as the stuff that we talked about

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:54.640
when he was on with Harrison Smith.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:54.960
Sure.

01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.720
So there's not really all that much to go over, but I do think that it's really interesting

01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.480
this way that Alex is trying to engage with him where he simultaneously wants to like

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:10.400
really talk about how we should have a revolutionary war, but he also doesn't really want the responsibility

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:11.600
of having said those things.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:16.320
Well, look, I don't want to get into a gate of gates circumstance all over again.

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:22.080
And like, hey Stuart, you're like one degree away from the people who are in the Capitol.

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.800
I kind of am too, but maybe I wasn't in a group chat with them.

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:28.880
And if a RICO case was brought against you, guess who's getting convicted.

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.800
And so Stuart, I get it.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.720
America's being taken over by Chinese.

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.800
They're butchering the bill of rights and constitution.

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.320
They're purging the military.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.320
Biden says he's going to confiscate the guns.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.320
They're coming out with forced inoculations.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.840
The borders are wide open.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.160
Yes.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:47.680
By any historical yardstick, we have every right to declare 1776 part two.

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:53.120
I just instinctively look at that and realize how they've set this up politically and how

01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:55.360
they want a civil war so China can take over.

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:59.040
And I'm really trying to get the governors and the political system moving to stop this.

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:03.680
You may be right that there's no way to fix it, or is there a way to fix it?

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.360
Because, you know, they're claiming you want violence.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.960
They're claiming you want offensive stuff.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.040
That's not the man I know.

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.640
But at the same time, if we're attacked, we have a right and a duty to protect ourselves.

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.120
So we far past the declaration of independence point.

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.240
Nobody can deny that.

01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.840
There's plenty of cowards in the government.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.680
They're going to keep appeasing the system forever.

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.280
But there is a point at which the globalists are going to push where there is a breaking

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:23.680
point.

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.680
I don't want that breaking point, but it is approaching.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.680
Well, we're now on the same path the founders walked, and we need to look at their wisdom

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.360
and do the same thing they did.

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.600
How do you even respond to that non-question ramble?

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.760
Hey, so it's cool that we kill everybody.

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.560
I'm not saying we should kill everybody, but it's cool that we kill everybody, right?

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:48.960
Well, I mean, like that clip of Alex was just multiple times saying we have every

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:51.920
justification for starting a revolutionary war.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:53.280
But I like talking to governors.

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.200
What the fuck governors are you talking to?

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.800
Talk to DeSantis down in Florida?

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:57.280
Yeah, no kidding.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.560
Well, he would be a top anti-globalist.

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.480
He would be someone who, if any governor would talk to Alex, I would suspect it might

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.480
be he's on the short list.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:07.120
Yeah, that's true.

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.720
But yeah, it's just justifications for why a revolutionary war and offensive violence

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.720
could be set off, which isn't actually offensive.

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:15.520
It's defensive.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.280
But if you're Stuart Rhodes, how the fuck do we even respond to that?

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.760
There's no like, yes.

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:22.320
Yeah, bro.

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.040
No.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:23.760
Super, bro.

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:24.160
Right.

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:24.640
Yeah.

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:28.480
Anyway, he's just like, hey, as far as I'm concerned, all the Oath Keepers did is walk

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.520
in and take selfies to the Capitol on the 6th.

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.160
I'm not going to let them hang out to dry.

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:45.280
I just, it's so weird to broadcast your, you know, extemporaneous fantasies about murdering

01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:46.480
everybody.

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.080
That's a strange, I would hope that you would keep that one quiet.

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:56.160
If you were like, I fantasize about murdering people all the time, so much so that I cannot

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.240
go several hours without talking about it.

01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:58.740
Yeah.

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.720
You can keep those hours off air.

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.040
Well, see, this is where we get back to what I was saying at the beginning, like that tone

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.320
that Alex has where he's like coming back from like a week being gone and he's sleepy

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.080
and kind of like, uh, I'm going to go to a special report. That's weird.

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:16.320
Yeah.

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.760
But it's not weird for Alex.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.260
No.

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:23.680
Being so obsessed with wanting to talk about your murder fantasies on a radio show is weird,

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.960
but it's not weird for Alex.

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.460
Yeah.

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.160
His show is so stupid and like, that's just what this is.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:30.560
Yeah.

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:37.520
It's really, it's really fucked up that their murder fantasies have gone so far from the

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.920
original ones that we used to listen to where they're like, if somebody tried to kill my

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:45.920
family, I'd get to shoot them a bunch of times, which I don't want to do.

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.760
I talk about doing it all the time.

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.000
Right.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.200
If they come for the guns, we'll rise up or whatever.

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:54.160
If they do this, we'll kill people and that's what we have to do.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:54.320
Yeah.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.040
And now it's transitioning to-

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.520
And now it's like, let's kill all the left.

01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.120
We're so far past the point of justification for all of this.

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.880
They're attacking us with bioweapons.

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.440
Yeah.

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:03.940
Yeah.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:04.880
I don't know.

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:05.840
It's irresponsible.

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:06.340
Yeah.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.840
So yeah, I mean, I guess I feel good that Alex is back where he belongs and that

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:12.400
chair.

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:12.900
Yeah.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:19.360
He doesn't belong in a grocery store unless it was locked from the outside.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:19.680
Yeah.

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:20.180
Yeah.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.800
Unless he's waiting out a zombie apocalypse.

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.240
He would be the guy who would lie about being bit.

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.280
Oh, totally.

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.040
Absolutely.

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:34.480
And he'd enjoy eating you while he was still not a zombie and be like, I'm just practicing.

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:36.000
I'm gonna eat your ass.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.040
Yeah, I'm gonna eat your ass.

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:37.520
It's a joke.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:38.160
It's Swift.

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:39.120
Jonathan Swiftian.

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:43.680
So we come to the end of this, and I don't think a whole lot happened.

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:52.160
Alex is back, but he's, I guess, is upset about Marvin Hagler and stories that he's

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.200
making up about him.

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:53.680
Yeah.

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.840
He's mad about a bunch of other stuff he's making up.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:56.640
Yeah.

01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:57.120
You know what?

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.840
Let's go through the important work topics real quick.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:00.160
I'm not...

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.520
Let's just keep count.

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.040
You want to get a percentage?

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:03.520
Sure.

01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.240
Okay.

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.840
We got Marvelous Marvin.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.080
Nope.

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:06.720
Not important.

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.080
Mysterious Trip.

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:09.040
Definitely not important.

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:09.600
Grammys.

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:10.000
Nope.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:10.560
Earpiece.

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:10.960
Nope.

01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:11.680
I'm great.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:11.920
Nope.

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.160
I suppose climate change would be important, but it is punishment from God.

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:17.040
So that's a nope.

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:17.520
Yeah.

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.640
Drugs at the border.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:19.600
That's important.

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.200
Sure, but not the way he's covering it.

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:21.680
Definitely not.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.800
So let's cut that one out.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.000
The left is evil.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.200
Yeah, we're probably evil.

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:25.840
That's a push.

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.080
Yeah, I'll give that one a circle.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.120
I made up a word.

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:29.680
Nope.

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.400
Avatar.

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:30.960
Blade Runner.

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:31.680
Definitely not.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:32.080
No.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.840
Silence weapons for quiet wars.

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:34.480
Supernot.

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.240
Irishman 1776.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:37.360
Get the fuck out of here.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.600
That might undo the circle.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.920
Yeah, I think that one takes the left as evil.

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:43.440
Operation Crimson Contagion.

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:44.880
Real, but he's lying about it.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.120
Right.

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.880
Forced inoculations.

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.680
Not going to happen.

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.720
Why don't we have bounty hunters run things?

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:51.520
Very obvious.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:52.320
Not important.

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.040
Right.

01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:54.560
Gunpoint vaccinations.

01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.240
Same thing as forced inoculation.

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:59.680
And it's the one year anniversary of It's Over for Humanity.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:01.440
There will only be lone survivors.

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.200
At best, we've got 0.5%.

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.340
Sure.

01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:06.660
Uh, 1 out of 20.

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.820
You know, it's like Meatloaf says.

01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:09.940
1 out of 20 ain't bad.

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:10.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:12.420
2 out of 3 ain't bad.

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:13.380
1 out of 20.

01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:13.780
Very bad.

01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:14.900
That's good stuff.

01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:15.460
Uh, yeah.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.380
Jordan will be back on Friday.

01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:18.420
Uh, check back in.

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.580
See if Alex can start cooking with some gas.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:22.020
I hope so.

01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:24.260
This is kind of fun, though.

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:24.580
Yeah.

01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:25.620
I mean.

01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:28.340
It's good to be back in the saddle.

01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:28.580
Yeah.

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.220
You know, I do mean that.

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:33.380
But then as soon as I have to say why,

01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:34.420
I can't tell you.

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.140
No, no, no.

01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.180
Absolutely not.

01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:36.820
No, no, no.

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:40.420
If I try to rationalize or justify or explain why,

01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:42.500
it's like, it was still fun to go over this,

01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:43.940
even though it's all incredibly stupid.

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:45.140
I can't.

01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:46.740
I think it's because you like the work.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.300
I think it was just because I got,

01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:51.380
you know, I got to read that Zbigniew Brzezinski article.

01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:52.180
Yeah, that's good.

01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.100
I found a primary source we could talk about.

01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:55.780
Tracking that down was probably very enjoyable.

01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:56.820
Yeah, that was probably it.

01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:57.320
Yeah.

01:51:57.780 --> 01:51:58.820
Anyway, we'll do that.

01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.100
But until then, we have a website.

01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:00.900
Indeed we do, Dan.

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:01.940
It's KnowledgeFight.com.

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:03.780
Well, we also are on Twitter.

01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:04.420
We are on Twitter.

01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:13.200
It's at Knowledge

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:16.740
Fight and I go to bed Jordan.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:16.740
I'm Leo.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:17.780
I'm DZX Clark.

01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:18.980
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:22.820
I am the goblin of monthly birthday shout outs.

01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:25.220
Andy in Kansas.

01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:25.700
You're on the air.

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:26.340
Thanks for holding.

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:28.980
Hello, Alex.

01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:29.940
I'm a first time caller.

01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:30.740
I'm a huge fan.

01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:31.540
I love your work.

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:32.420
I love you.
