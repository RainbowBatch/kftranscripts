Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

I'm Jordan.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
We're a couple dudes.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Let's sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Jordan.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Dan!

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Jordan.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Quick question for you.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
What's up?

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
What's your bright spot today?

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I got an anti-bright spot.

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh, you got an anti-bright spot?

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Yes.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Okay.

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Sort of a dark spot, or at least, like, you know, in the cheers and jeers parlance.

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
All right, all right.

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
This is a jeer.

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
This is a jeer.

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
But it's also kind of a bright spot because it's me expressing some of my drives towards

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
me.

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm Dan.

37
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm Jordan.

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
We're a couple dudes.

39
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:26,400
What's your bright spot today?

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,400
I had to make a run over to the, uh, the CVS, and I went inside and, uh...

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Whoa, is this buzz marketing for CVS?

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
It's not.

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Okay, good.

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Remember, this is jeers.

45
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,400
I saw a new beverage product there.

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Uh-huh.

47
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
It was Coca-Cola with coffee.

48
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
No.

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Uh-uh.

50
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
No.

51
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
It was my first instinct.

52
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Nope.

53
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Here's my second instinct.

54
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Double no.

55
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Yeah.

56
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I doubled down, and I got it.

57
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Yes, of course you did.

58
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I was very excited.

59
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Of course you did.

60
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
It is repulsive.

61
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
How could you possibly think that's a good idea?

62
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
I don't know.

63
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,900
I've been surprised by things in the past.

64
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,900
Sure, sure.

65
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,200
You know, that black cherry coffee seltzer is really good.

66
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Yeah, that is really good.

67
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Yeah, this one is not.

68
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
No.

69
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
This Coke is, uh, disgusting.

70
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
No, yeah, that's, that's the worst thing I've ever heard anyone do to coffee.

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Yep.

72
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Bad.

73
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Yeah.

74
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I thought you were putting some cream in there.

75
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
I was thinking about it.

76
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,400
No, and actually, I should be perfectly honest, I bought three varieties of it.

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Because they had single cans.

78
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Sure, sure.

79
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,400
So I bought the regular, the caramel, and the vanilla.

80
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Oh, boy.

81
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I haven't tried the other two.

82
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Wait, they were all three coffee, though.

83
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

84
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Coffee with...

85
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
It's a new line of Coke things.

86
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Oh, my God, these monsters.

87
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I got all three.

88
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Have we not enough problems already, Dan?

89
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
I got all three because I was like, what if they're amazing?

90
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,400
And now I've tried one, and I just, I'm gonna stare at the other two for a while.

91
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
No, I'm not gonna, I'm not excited to drink those.

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Uh, yeah, well, that could be a bonus episode.

93
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Yeah, maybe.

94
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Eh, we could do that.

95
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You hear me be miserable drinking Coke?

96
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
That wouldn't bother me too much.

97
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
What's your bright spot?

98
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:07,400
My bright spot, Dan, is that on Saturday, I will be finishing my Final Fantasy VII riff

99
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
make project.

100
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Fun!

101
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
It will be done.

102
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I couldn't do it last night, or Wednesday night, so I'm gonna do a marathon on Saturday.

103
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm almost at the end of the game.

104
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I don't know how long it's gonna take.

105
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Sure.

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
But it's gonna start at 11, and it's just gonna go until I finish the game.

107
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
And the Wonks can join you over on your Twitch channel?

108
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
You betcha.

109
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
You bet.

110
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
You can.

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
JB, home, something or other.

112
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
3209.

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
You betcha.

114
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Yep.

115
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
You got it.

116
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Uh, yeah, that should be fun.

117
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Yeah.

118
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm not gonna stop by.

119
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
You're not gonna stop by.

120
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
No, no, no.

121
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Please, please, let's not get any...

122
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Wait, what time are you...

123
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
No, like, maybe they're special guests.

124
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
No.

125
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
What time are you gonna start?

126
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Probably 11.

127
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Okay.

128
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Yeah.

129
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
If you hear a rapping on your window at about 1130, that's me.

130
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
We'll see.

131
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
We'll see what happens.

132
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
It's me, and I'm day drunk.

133
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Okay.

134
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Now that might be fun.

135
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Crashing in through your window.

136
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I'd be fine with that.

137
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Um, so Jordan, today we got an interesting episode.

138
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,400
We're gonna be talking about Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

139
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
That is March 17th and 18th, 20...

140
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,400
No, no, no!

141
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Damn it!

142
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Damn it!

143
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
This was a terrible idea that is only gotten worse.

144
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
I think it's over.

145
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I think it's over because you technically won.

146
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Now I'm too aware.

147
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Yeah.

148
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
But you also won.

149
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Yeah.

150
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
The whole thing was you weren't winning.

151
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
I would never win.

152
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Yeah, the game got busted by you winning.

153
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Yeah, well, naturally.

154
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Hold on, what's that?

155
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Is somebody at the door?

156
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Oh, no.

157
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Wait, how does this bit go?

158
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
I don't know.

159
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
This is how most bits...

160
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
That bit is now that we don't know how that bit works.

161
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, that's fair.

162
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Um, so it's an interesting little bit of time.

163
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I think there's a couple of very important things that come up.

164
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,400
But actually, I'm kind of shocked by what doesn't come up.

165
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,400
And then we have one of Alex Jones' most spectacular flare-ups.

166
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Okay.

167
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Blow-ups on air in recent memory.

168
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Okay.

169
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,400
But before we get to today's episode, let's take a little moment and say hello and thank

170
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
you to some wonks.

171
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Oh, that's nice.

172
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
So first, hi in Seattle.

173
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Thank you so much.

174
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
You are now a policy wonk.

175
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I'm a policy wonk.

176
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Hello, hi in Seattle.

177
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Thank you very much.

178
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
H-I-G-H.

179
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
H-I-G-O.

180
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Oh, I was going to say.

181
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Well, then get some sleep.

182
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Yeah.

183
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Or if it was H-I in Seattle, that could be like Frasier.

184
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Yeah.

185
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Hello, Seattle.

186
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Hello, Seattle.

187
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Next, Big Robbie D. Thank you so much.

188
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
You are now a policy wonk.

189
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I'm a policy wonk.

190
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Thank you very much, Big Rob.

191
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Thank you.

192
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Next, Paul Joseph Fartson.

193
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Thank you so much.

194
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
You are now a policy wonk.

195
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm a policy wonk.

196
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Thank you very much, PJ Fs.

197
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
And Cassie, thank you so much.

198
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
You are now a policy wonk.

199
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm a policy wonk.

200
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Thanks, Cassie.

201
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,400
And I'd like to give a happy birthday shout out, because fucking on the last episode,

202
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I said we're going to do this monthly, and then I get a fucking email from somebody who's

203
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
asking to be a March birthday shout out.

204
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
I was saying at the end of March, we'd do April.

205
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Oh, my God.

206
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Oh, man.

207
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
We're not going to be able to do this.

208
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
No.

209
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
We'll never keep track of this properly.

210
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Now, the bit of this is being unable to do the-

211
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Let's try and give everybody birthday shout outs, but never actually get to the names.

213
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
This isn't their fault.

214
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Of course it's not.

215
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I've got no problem with this person, and I hope they have a happy birthday.

216
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Of course.

217
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
But clearly-

218
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,400
For your birthday, we get an existential crisis.

219
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Clearly, I'm not meant to have an email address.

220
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Anyway, happy birthday, and congratulations on becoming a technocrat to our beloved trans-dimensional

221
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,400
chocolate male vitality raptor out in Michigan.

222
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Thank you so much, Dell.

223
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm a policy wonk.

224
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Crikey, mate.

225
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
That's fantastic.

226
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Have yourself a brew.

227
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
How's your 401k doing, bro?

228
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

229
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Let's just get down to business.

230
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

231
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Why are you pimps so good?

232
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
My neck is freakishly large.

233
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
I declare info war on you.

234
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Thank you so much, Dell.

235
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Yes, thank you very much, Dell.

236
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Beloved trans-dimensional chocolate male vitality rapper and a funky homo sapien.

237
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
How could you not enjoy both of those people?

238
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah, totally.

239
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,400
So, Jordan, Wednesday and Thursday of this week, I was dreading this.

240
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,400
I was dreading doing the show because I had a sense that possibly Alex would talk about

241
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
the Atlanta shootings.

242
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Yes.

243
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
At the spas in Atlanta, left eight dead.

244
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
No interest in doing that.

245
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
No, and I thought that would be really complicated because there's a lot of issues to unpack,

246
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:35,400
you know, both about the anti-sex worker ideas that are possibly motivating of the shooter

247
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
and also certainly the violence towards Asian Americans.

248
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Anyone who created Fentanyl the Magic Dragon or whatever can shut the fuck up.

249
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,400
And I thought it would be really difficult with the information that we have available,

250
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,400
but both of those things are things that intersect with Alex's world in a kind of scary way.

251
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Insofar as he is misogynist and anti-Asian.

252
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Yes.

253
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
And I didn't want to deal with it.

254
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,400
And so I was worried and I get into it and he doesn't bring it up at all on Wednesday.

255
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Not a surprise.

256
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Not a surprise.

257
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,400
He makes a passing reference to being an incel on Thursday, but he doesn't really talk about

258
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
this incident at all.

259
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
And so if he does in the future, we'll talk about it.

260
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,400
But for now, I mean, my feeling is I'm looking to get more information as it becomes available

261
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
and I think it's a horrible tragedy.

262
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Yeah.

263
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,400
And this is how Alex started his show on Wednesday.

264
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:50,400
So I think that might be a little bit tasteless.

265
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Somebody, somebody tell me that there is, oh, racism against Asians is not high.

266
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Go ahead and tell me that whenever this is just fucking available.

267
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Nobody's stopping this.

268
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Right.

269
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
You know?

270
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:11,400
And even if like, you know, even if anti-Asian sentiment wasn't what predominantly motivated

271
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
this shooter, even if that is the case, which I'm not saying is necessarily the case, but

272
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,400
even if that were the case, if you're Alex Jones doing Info Wars, I would think, hey,

273
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
why don't we put this off?

274
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
The next day you're starting your show with a fentanyl, the Chinese dragon, racist ass

275
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
character.

276
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
What are you going to say?

277
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,400
He's going to be like, oh, see, the shooter was motivated by misogyny.

278
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,400
So it's totally fine for me to disrespect the victims by being racist.

279
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Yeah, it's, it's weird.

280
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Yeah.

281
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,400
So Alex starts the show in earnest and he comes in and he's got, he's got some, some

282
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
big news.

283
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I do not say this on air for dramatic effect.

284
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I say it because it's the truth.

285
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
We've absolutely gone into the zeitgeist.

286
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,400
We are in, for lack of a better word, revelations.

287
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,400
And this morning I was out for a hike and at the blood pump within my brain and I just

288
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
had 30 minutes of complete and total clarity.

289
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Is this going to be about wet ass pussy?

290
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,400
And then driving into the office, I recorded about a 20 minute breakdown of what I'm about

291
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,400
to lay out again, but it was very calm how I did it and very cogent.

292
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,400
And so I am going to have that put down to a video file with a few documents and a few

293
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
video clips, but I'm going to air it.

294
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm going to air it at the bottom of the next hour in about an hour and 25 minutes.

295
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
It'll take two segments to air.

296
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,400
And I'm going to talk about it ahead of time, but everything I'm about to say is documented.

297
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,400
So, if you don't catch what he's saying, here's what's going on.

298
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Okay.

299
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
He took a, he took a hike that morning.

300
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Yes.

301
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
And he got some clarity up in his head.

302
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Right.

303
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Then driving to the studio on his phone, he recorded a 20 minute breakdown of whatever

304
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
vision he got while he was hiking.

305
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Yeah, that sounded like what I was hearing and that made me deeply uncomfortable.

306
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Now he's going to talk about this stuff and then play the report that is the recording

307
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
of him on his phone.

308
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Right.

309
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Oh God.

310
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,400
So he's got like a 30 minute conference call that he needs to get to.

311
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
So he recorded a nice little break for people.

312
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Yeah, that might be.

313
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400
That sounds like the most reasonable explanation for this.

314
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Yeah, or he didn't have a guest to eat while that person was on air.

315
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

316
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I need a snack about two hours in.

317
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
I'll play this 20 minute clip.

318
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah.

319
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Um, so anyway, the, the long and short of this, I don't want to, I don't want to spoil

320
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:46,400
anything for you, but it turns out the globalists are planning, um, a false extinction in 2030,

321
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I think.

322
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Did you need to go on a hike to get there?

323
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't know.

324
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I honestly was looking at it and I'm like, that's kind of cute.

325
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Like it's nine years away.

326
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Sure.

327
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
That kind of implies to me that Alex wants to live.

328
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah, that does sound right.

329
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,400
He's putting it off pretty far into the future before it's like, Alex, come on, man.

330
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
He's protecting the game.

331
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Yeah.

332
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
For nine years.

333
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Yeah.

334
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
It's not next month.

335
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
It's not 2022.

336
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Yeah.

337
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
It's 2030, man.

338
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Yeah.

339
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,400
He'll be, he'll be probably retired by then.

340
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Well, somebody will hopefully have forced him to retire by then at least.

341
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
That's kind of aspirational.

342
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,400
It's, it's really frustrating to me because he's in a sweet position as far as doomsday

343
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,400
cult leaders go, doomsday cult leaders go, you know, like other doomsday cult leaders,

344
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,400
you can only predict the end of the world a few times and be wrong before people kind

345
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
of get the gist here.

346
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,400
We're on, the world is going to end on this date, 2000?

347
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
It's happened a lot.

348
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
It happens all the time.

349
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
But get this.

350
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
What?

351
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
It's going to be fake.

352
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
It's going to be a false flag extinction.

353
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I guess that's also comforting?

354
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I guess.

355
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Okay.

356
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Yeah.

357
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,400
So anyway, that's what the, that's what Alex was calling on his phone to talk about.

358
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Does it matter if the extinction is successful?

359
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
You really don't even need a false flag for it, right?

360
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Right.

361
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Yep.

362
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Yeah.

363
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Anyway, we'll get to that when we get to it.

364
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,400
The 50 people left are going to be like, yeah, that was definitely the alt-right guys.

365
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
We got him.

366
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,400
So Alex is going to get to that when he gets to it and we'll get to it when he gets to

367
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
it.

368
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
So he has to talk about that. He has to talk about how he's got high level sources.

369
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Sure.

370
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
That give him really in depth, cool.

371
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Are they at the top of a mountain?

372
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Oh my God.

373
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Yes.

374
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
And that's why.

375
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
That's why he took the hike.

376
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,400
And that's why they have access to such like current important information.

377
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Naturally.

378
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Because they're radiating at that high, high level frequency.

379
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
We just got to go up.

380
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
We're now entering the time.

381
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,400
In fact, we have entered the time where everything is just going to be out in the open now.

382
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I have an article right here that a national talk show host sent me minutes before I went

383
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
live.

384
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Tucker.

385
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
And the reason I mentioned that is not name dropping.

386
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
It's to point out that God has put me in the zeitgeist.

387
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
It's insane.

388
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I can pick the phone up and call Trump.

389
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I can pick the phone up and call Tucker Carlson.

390
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I can pick the phone up and call General Flynn.

391
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I can pick the phone up and call Joe Rogan.

392
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,400
I can pick the phone up and call basically anybody that's on the good guy side.

393
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
It's just an incredible responsibility.

394
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Real quick, just a point of fact.

395
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,400
That podcast that he did, that flagrant two or whatever the fuck, the one in Miami where

396
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
they're fucking wasted.

397
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
That is actually video evidence that he can't just call Joe Rogan.

398
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
He tries multiple times, but Joe does not pick up.

399
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,400
It feels a little bit like how I can say, you know, I can pick up my phone and tweet

400
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,400
it anybody I want to right now.

401
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Like that's the same level of, sure you have their number, but nobody's responding.

402
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,400
I remember back when I used to produce a comedy show, like we'd have people like Hannibal

403
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Burress or Nick Thune would come through town and I would have their phone numbers because

404
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I booked them on the show and like coordinating when they were going to arrive.

405
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Yeah.

406
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
And I would sometimes be drunk and be like, I have Hannibal's number.

407
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I'm never going to fucking call this guy.

408
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Rude.

409
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
I have Dave Attell in my phone from when we worked together.

410
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm never ever in a million years going to pretend that I can just call Dave Attell.

411
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
That's how it feels with Trump.

412
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Yeah, exactly.

413
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Yes.

414
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
I was just sent this before I went live.

415
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Transgender activists makes argument for all children to be put on puberty blockers until

416
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
they can determine the identity.

417
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Puberty blockers are toxic.

418
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
They kill a lot of people.

419
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
They cause massive depression.

420
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,400
So imagine we're going to put you into this system that basically sterilizes you if you're

421
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
a boy.

422
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,160
It makes you closer to a girl.

423
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,600
That's what these monsters are.

424
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
That's their end game.

425
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
That's their goal.

426
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,040
And no one's allowed to criticize them because it's a scientific takeover.

427
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,400
So leaving aside a lot of the finer points there.

428
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,220
This was a story from December.

429
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,880
So whoever Alex's cool media source is contacting him right before he got on air might be a

430
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,160
little bit behind the times.

431
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Or maybe they don't exist.

432
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,360
And Alex just recently heard about this this morning, maybe one of his staffers found it.

433
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,400
The headline Alex is reading is word for word.

434
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,880
The headline from an article in the Washington Examiner from December 14th, 2020.

435
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,040
It has to do with something that was tweeted by a YouTuber named Zinnia Jones.

436
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,320
Zinnia was making what essentially amounts to a reducto ad absurdiam argument against

437
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,680
the notion that trans youth were incapable of giving informed consent to take puberty

438
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,880
blockers.

439
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,080
The tweet read, quote, if children cannot consent to puberty blockers, which pause any

440
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,360
permanent changes, even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent

441
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,840
to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional

442
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,760
evaluation whatsoever?

443
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,680
This was followed up with another tweet, quote, an inability to offer informed consent or

444
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,400
understand the long term consequences is actually an argument for putting every single cis and

445
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,000
trans person on puberty blockers until they acquire that ability.

446
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Sure.

447
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,080
What this person was suggesting is pretty clear.

448
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,120
And Zinnia explained this when they were reached for comment by the Washington Examiner, quote,

449
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,200
I was not making an argument that all youth should be given puberty blockers.

450
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,160
This was not an actual proposal, and it's not something I advocate or endorse.

451
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,380
This was an argument that claims of trans youth's unreadiness to give consent to puberty

452
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,360
blockers, if followed consistently, lead to the conclusion that all youth are likewise

453
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,380
not ready for the experience of puberty itself.

454
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,160
Because that conclusion is absurd, again, that was not something that I advocated or

455
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
endorsed.

456
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,880
The argument that trans youth can't consent to puberty blockers is faulty.

457
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,240
That makes total sense, and the argument that's being made here is structurally fine.

458
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,960
But the argument isn't advancing that it's good to put all youth on puberty blockers,

459
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,520
as clearly stated in the article that Alex is citing.

460
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,740
It's an argument specifically designed to illustrate a counterexample that shows the

461
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,440
flaw in an already existing argument.

462
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,060
Zinnia's tweets were in response to the United Kingdom Supreme Court decision that, quote,

463
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,080
there will be enormous difficulties in a child under 16 understanding and weighing up this

464
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,920
information and deciding whether to consent to use of puberty blocking medication.

465
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,700
And the tweets really only make sense in light of that context, of that decision.

466
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,840
These tweets put forth what Zinnia, I believe in good faith, contends is an absurd implication

467
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,440
of the logic being used by the UK court.

468
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,020
Unfortunately from a purely logical standpoint, the argument put forth isn't super effective

469
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,360
in this case.

470
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,740
For Zinnia's argument to hold water, it would need to somehow illustrate how the proceeding

471
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,360
of a naturally occurring process and the intervention in that naturally occurring process require

472
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,920
the same level of consent, which is going to be difficult.

473
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Yeah.

474
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Yeah, yeah.

475
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,360
They did, though, I do recall Zinnia saying that she wanted to eat the Irish and that

476
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,600
she did, or they did stand by that.

477
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,080
I know Alex is an expert in Swiftian satire.

478
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,400
They were like, we gotta just eat the fucking Irish, so.

480
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,940
And just to be totally clear, I support trans youth having access to puberty blockers.

481
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,680
The logic of Zinnia's argument just has a hole that could be easily exploited by people

482
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
arguing against it.

483
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Of course.

484
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Uh, but otherwise it's alright.

485
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,260
Anyway, Alex is mad about this three months later, and he's opening his show bragging

486
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,120
about how one of his super cool media friends brought it to his attention.

487
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,520
It's tomorrow's news today.

488
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,560
Yeah, I do like hearing about tweets from three months ago.

489
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Yeah.

490
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,400
Those are my favorite news stories.

491
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,280
Also the whole thing there where Alex is saying that puberty blockers were linked to lots

492
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,160
of deaths, that seemed weird to me since that's not my understanding of it at all.

493
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,400
I looked into it and it turns out Alex is passing along, dun dun dun, fake news.

494
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,940
Oh no!

495
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,880
In September 2019, a bunch of right wing Christian sites began posting articles about how a drug

496
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,880
used as a puberty blocker for trans youth called Lupron had been linked to over 6,000

497
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
deaths.

498
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,520
This headline was flashy and it led to articles all over right wing media in places like Life

499
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,640
Site News and Daily Wire.

500
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,200
Ben Shapiro retweeted it and the claim went viral all over social media.

501
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Of course.

502
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,760
The drug had been linked to over 6,000 deaths, but the problem is that Lupron is not just

503
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,040
a drug that's given to trans youth.

504
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,880
According to NBC News, quote, the thousands of people who die while taking these drugs

505
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,440
are likely the terminally ill cancer patients who receive hormone blockers to fight hormone

506
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,520
sensitive cancers, like prostate cancer, according to experts.

507
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh, well that's hardly fair.

508
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Right.

509
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,920
The underlying FDA data that was used by these blogs to show that there had been 6,370 deaths

510
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,400
over the past 40 years that were patients who were on Lupron.

511
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,960
That's all they were using.

512
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,820
From there, they just assumed that all these patients were trans youth as opposed to terminally

513
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,120
ill cancer patients and decided to create a duplicitous fraudulent anti-trans narrative

514
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
out of it.

515
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,240
I would bet anything that Alex just saw this headline back when it was being posted on

516
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,960
social media, he never thought to look into it or understand the matter further because

517
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
he's dumb and lazy.

518
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,760
You know, 50 years from now, I bet the Japanese will improve upon it and call it Lupron the

519
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
Third.

520
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Come on.

521
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,040
Oh, you don't even get that reference at all, do you?

522
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,160
I don't know if I should pretend I get it or just like...

523
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay, Lupron the Third.

524
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,080
So it's based off of ArsÃ¨ne Lupron, the famous French cat burglar.

525
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,840
There was an anime 50 years later in Japan called Lupron the Third.

526
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Forgive me for not knowing my anime and famous French cat burglar history.

527
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,920
Why wouldn't you know that?

528
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,960
Then Miyazaki did Lupron the Third and it was incredible.

529
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm sure it is.

530
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,160
It's a hole in my cultural awareness.

531
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,520
Well, don't worry about it.

532
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,420
A few people will get it and they will fucking shit.

533
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,160
The intensity of that look you gave me was really scary.

534
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,680
I knew you weren't going to get it.

535
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,180
I was so mad.

536
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Very scary.

537
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Oh well.

538
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,720
Anyway, Alex is just full of bad information already.

539
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,700
And so, you know, this clip like this kind of is a little funny.

540
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,800
The average Westerner has less attention span than a goldfish.

541
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,400
So they may have a native intelligence, but their subconscious brain and their conscious

542
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,880
brain have basically been merged where they're like jellyfish.

543
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,000
They're in a trance and the sleeper must awaken.

544
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,500
That's why when you tune into NPR or you listen to Politician, they talk very, very slowly

545
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:19,980
and they talk very, very softly and they don't want anyone on NPR that talks in an excited

546
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,520
voice because what does an excited voice do?

547
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
What does that do?

548
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,840
It wakes people up!

549
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,640
I would say that an excited voice like that actually distracts from the glaring holes

550
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,120
and the information being yelled.

551
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,920
Okay, there might be that.

552
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,680
So wait, if NPR gives me a show, I will immediately become the greatest left-wing commentator

553
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,520
there is in Alex's eyes.

554
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I guess.

555
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,720
I mean, I think that there is a, you know, if you go back to stand up, there's a lot

556
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
of people who make up for like kind of iffy writing with overperforming.

557
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,680
Yeah, that would be me, Dan.

558
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,800
Literally word for word me.

559
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Yeah.

560
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:04,580
I think that Alex's performance and his showmanship or whatever is designed in order to make up

561
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,800
for and distract people from the fact that he doesn't know anything.

562
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,360
He's just making all this shit up.

563
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,800
One could argue most people who scream are often doing that.

564
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Yeah.

565
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Yeah.

566
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Yeah.

567
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Lupron.

568
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Lupon the third.

569
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,640
Anyway, this next clip, this is great, man.

570
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
This is where I live.

571
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
I like people who are happy.

572
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,160
I like it when people are happy.

573
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,880
Even people I dislike, like Alex, I'd rather everyone be happy because then positive vibes

574
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,920
are emanating out into the universe, right?

575
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
That's good.

576
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Yeah.

577
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,400
That's a good mood because magic happened in his life.

578
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Okay.

579
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Did he take another hike?

580
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
He went on that hike.

581
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes.

582
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
And he had an idea.

583
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Right.

584
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
And then listen to what happened.

585
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
The staff, the crew, they're amazing.

586
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
All right.

587
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,720
We've all had dreams that come true.

588
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
We've all had nightmares that come true.

589
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,520
We've all had predictions and they come true.

590
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,760
We've all said, hey, let's visit grandma.

591
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
None of this is true.

592
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Phone rings, grandma just died.

593
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,440
That actually happened with me.

594
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,720
This morning I cut an audio recording dealing with the globalist plan to have a staged end

595
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,280
of the world event on or around 2030.

596
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
And I'm totally sure of it.

597
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
I have the proof.

598
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
I'll show you coming up.

599
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
He doesn't.

600
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,800
And when I thought about it, I thought, I'll just put the graphic of the satellite footage

601
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,760
of the earth from orbit over that.

602
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,120
And I said, I'm going to have them do that as the background today.

603
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,280
And I swear on everything I am on my heart, on my soul, that when I walked into this building

604
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,560
this morning, I looked up and they were punching up this background of the satellite of the

605
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
earth.

606
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,040
We probably do this twice a year.

607
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:51,000
And I walked in here intending to do the headline globalist plan, the controlled end of the

608
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
world by 2030.

609
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,960
And I told my wife, as I walked out of the house, I said, I have just received the biggest

610
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,840
download I've ever gotten on the hike I had just done.

611
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
She said, what do you mean?

612
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,800
And I said, they're going to stage the end of the world in 2030.

613
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
And she didn't think I was crazy because she's seen me do this all the time.

614
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Okay.

615
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
That's why, that's why.

616
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,400
Honey, I took a hike and it turns out that God downloaded into my brain that they're

617
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
going to fake the end of the world in 2030.

618
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,800
All right.

619
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,640
Could you pick up something to eat on the way home?

620
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,020
Would you like a little road sake?

621
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,720
You want to stop by Costco?

622
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,060
We're out of cereal.

623
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Come on, Alex.

624
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Yeah.

625
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
That's a little bit silly.

626
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,640
I want to hear him read the pale blue dot speech over that graphic.

627
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,840
Actually, that's what it is.

628
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,320
Everyone you've ever known lived on that pale blue dot.

629
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,200
And the globalist got a fake on extinction in 2030.

630
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Exactly.

631
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Yeah.

632
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Okay.

633
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
That's how he was hiking.

634
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,000
And now he's decided this is the greatest thing in the world.

635
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
He figured out how he wanted to visualize it.

636
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,680
He comes into the studio, staff is already fucking with that image.

637
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Oh man.

638
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
How is this?

639
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Is synchronicity.

640
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Blows your mind.

641
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
This is magic.

642
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
This is the universe, man.

643
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Blows your mind.

644
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,840
Holy shit.

645
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,280
I don't care.

646
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Wow.

647
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
You're cold hearted, man.

648
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
I am cold hearted.

649
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Wow.

650
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
I am cold hearted.

651
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Sometimes.

652
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,680
To coincidences of all kinds.

653
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,920
You know, they say that, you know, you can never really know the people around you.

654
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
And I feel that now.

655
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
Yeah, clearly.

656
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,560
I cannot believe this has not penetrated your stone heart.

657
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Dark.

658
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Dark.

659
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,160
I don't think ghosts are real.

660
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
What else do you got?

661
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,280
What else do you got, Alex?

662
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
I'm not doing dreams.

663
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
All right.

664
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
Well, put a pin in that for a little bit later.

665
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,600
Oh, we're going to keep doing dreams.

666
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,480
So in this next clip, we get to Alex responding to some big news.

667
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,440
And that is that Trump has come out in favor of vaccines for COVID-19.

668
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Yes.

669
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Yeah.

670
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
This has got to be a false flag.

671
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Oh boy.

672
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,680
So maybe a breaking point.

673
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,980
But I knew Trump had globalist enemies and I knew that they hated him and I wanted to

674
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,520
fix things and I wanted to believe in it.

675
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,680
And I don't think Trump himself is a bad person.

676
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,280
I don't know people that know him very well, but he's limited and he's not this big giant

677
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
40 chess guy that everybody says he is.

678
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,320
He just goes with what he thinks is right and also is way too optimistic and buys too

679
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,800
much into science when it's globalist science and you know, all the stuff they gave him

680
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,480
the Randezevir and the rest of it and the gene therapies made him feel so great.

681
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,380
He's now on board with everything they did.

682
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:31,640
He has come out and gone on Fox News and endorsed these killer vaccines.

683
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,080
And after you've seen 25 countries in Europe ban it now and hundreds around the world and

684
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,280
all the deaths and all the problems that the only way to get through to Trump is to get

685
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
in his face about this.

686
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,560
I'm going to reach out to Trump.

687
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm going to get a hold of him if I need to.

688
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,520
And I'm going to communicate with him here on air and I'm going to call the sun up.

689
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah, this sounds like you have a lot of access.

690
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Yeah.

691
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,600
So Alex has been mad.

692
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,160
Trump just got all these drugs from people that made him feel good.

693
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Yeah.

694
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
He's like vaccines man.

695
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Come on.

696
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,800
I have a hard time believing that this conversation didn't happen where somebody is like, Trump,

697
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,500
we need you to endorse the vaccine.

698
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,560
It can save lives.

699
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
You have a lot of influence over people.

700
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:16,140
A lot of Republican men, almost half of them refuse to get vaccinated and him saying, I

701
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
can't do that.

702
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm going to piss off my followers who want to kill people.

703
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,320
And then the other person coming back, here's a hundred grand and I'm saying deal.

704
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Of course.

705
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Yeah.

706
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
So he was on Fox.

707
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
I am for sale.

708
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,840
He was on Fox and Friends and he said, yeah, people should get the vaccines, your choice.

709
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
He got it.

710
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Yeah.

711
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,720
And whatever, too little, too late.

712
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,020
But what I think is going on more is that I think Alex might realize that like Trump's

713
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:46,920
a dead end at this point and this would be a really good time to just be like, all right,

714
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
I don't care anymore.

715
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Bail.

716
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Bail.

717
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
And so Alex has decided-

718
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
This is free money.

719
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,920
He's decided that unless Trump cuts it out with his vaccine stuff, that it's over.

720
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Okay.

721
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,520
And I'm going to communicate with him here on air and I'm going to call his son up and

722
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,500
I'm just going to say, here's the evidence.

723
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,120
And if you continue to say, this is wonderful and this is good and there's quote, no problems,

724
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,420
you're a bad guy and I'm going to be against you.

725
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
So that's that.

726
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,720
I understand he wanted to reopen the economy.

727
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,280
He thought, okay, if it's just a vaccine, you know, you shouldn't be made to take any

728
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,440
dead, but if you want to get it, I'm like, well, that's still bad, but I understand what

729
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
he's doing.

730
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,360
I don't agree with it, but I see his perspective.

731
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,720
Now he's like, everybody needs to get it.

732
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Uh oh.

733
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,600
So yeah, I think he sees an off ramp.

734
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,800
There's no hope of Trump really ever becoming president again.

735
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,200
There's no power there really.

736
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,480
The movement or whatever is so like splintered-

737
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,400
Fractured and hates each other.

738
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Yeah.

739
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Yeah.

740
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,800
There is a possibility of coalescing again, but it's not going to be around Trump.

741
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,400
And Trump Jr. is a fucking, uh, not option.

742
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,360
He's a non-runner, non-candidate.

743
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,840
I think they're running into the problem that a lot of would be monarchs run into, which

744
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,640
is that their children are stupid.

745
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
Incredibly so.

746
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Right.

747
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,920
And that's why, that's okay if you're already a monarch.

748
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Exactly.

749
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,280
Because then you can't stop the power going down.

750
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,320
You gotta go straight Caesar on this guy.

751
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Yeah.

752
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,200
And so, you know, I think that Trump or Alex realizes that there's not a whole lot of value

753
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,840
in maintaining Trump.

754
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,620
There's value in maintaining like, I didn't make a huge mistake for the last two years,

755
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,760
but this is a line too far.

756
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
You know?

757
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
I think we may see that.

758
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Yeah.

759
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,540
And he can carve out a- unfortunately I wouldn't be surprised if he could carve out a better

760
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:41,540
space for him moving forward by being the, oh, it's the crazy guy who's also anti-Trump

761
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
now.

762
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Like, yeah.

763
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,320
I mean, he could have this whole time, probably.

764
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,760
But also, like, one of the things I think is interesting is he takes calls eventually

765
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,300
on this show and the next show, and like, no one cares.

766
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,000
No one is like, hey, what, what, uh, how you're talking bad about Trump.

767
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah.

768
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
They've all moved on too.

769
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

770
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,520
He was just an avatar for their hatred and desire to kill, and that apparently can exist

771
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
without him.

772
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,960
So they realize they don't need him.

773
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Yep.

774
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
They'll create another.

775
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Yep.

776
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,240
Anyway, Alex doesn't care that Trump patted him on the head.

777
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,440
Come back to the Alex Jones show.

778
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
All right.

779
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm going to talk about Trump and really for me, what will become the last straw.

780
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,160
It doesn't mean that I won't say he's good on topics.

781
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,920
We should take over the Republican party, uh, and we need his energy.

782
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,680
And boy, he called up and congratulated my wife and we got married and all that great

783
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
stuff.

784
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,640
And boy, patted me on the head and told me I'm the greatest broadcaster and I'm going

785
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,960
to take over for rush Limbaugh and how wonderful.

786
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,360
I don't care about all that.

787
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,280
I only kept that clip because Alex, uh, is definitely not mad that Dan Bongino took over.

788
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,000
Not at all mad about that very insulting thing to him specifically.

789
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,080
Not even a little bit mad at all about Dan Bongino taking the spot that he considers

790
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
rightfully is.

791
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I think it's great.

792
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Yeah.

793
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
I think, you know what?

794
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,360
All these radio stations played me instead of rush anyway.

795
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Yeah.

796
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,120
He's definitely not mad.

797
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
Yeah.

798
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,320
Um, so, uh, Alex has been, you know how like his media contacts reach out to him and told

799
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,280
them about this three month old tweet.

800
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Yes.

801
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,040
Alex also has some information he's been trying to get out to his media contacts and what

802
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
do you know?

803
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,240
It's over a year old.

804
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,080
And I'm going to just tell you something here that when I say I don't feel worthy to cover

805
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,000
this, we cover so much huge news continually.

806
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,200
That's just critical for me and you and all of us to continually constantly realize how

807
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,880
huge this is huge because it's easy to get live on air and cover a lot of stuff cause

808
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
it's live.

809
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,840
But if I produce slick reports on this, it would get 10 times the views online would

810
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,320
actually change the world.

811
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
And an example is this.

812
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,000
I was given this over a month ago.

813
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I didn't know about this.

814
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,280
I learned stuff all the time.

815
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,360
I finally have read, cause it took me a month off and on spending 30 minutes here, 20 minutes

816
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,680
there, 10 minutes here to read this entire folder.

817
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,880
And I've asked, uh, Greg Reese, one of our best researchers to do a report on this.

818
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,640
I've asked everybody else that has time, you know, stay up here late, whatever everyone

819
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,680
should do different reports on this because every time I read this, cause I probably read

820
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,160
this whole stack three times.

821
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,360
I probably looked at it 20 times, but just scanned through it.

822
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,760
Every time I look at this, I find new stuff because you know, you get mentally exhausted

823
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,880
when you're reading scientific documents and this is a small portion.

824
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,720
This is probably 150 pages or more on Crimson Contagion.

825
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,000
If you get mentally exhausted reading scientific papers, maybe you shouldn't be reading scientific

826
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
papers.

827
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,760
I don't, I don't know, um, Crimson Contagion we talked about in the last episode was covered

828
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,480
in a New York times, uh, article a year ago, quite old, Alex found out about a month ago

829
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,240
and has leisurely read through some stuff and now he's ready to, he doesn't actually

830
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
really get down into it.

831
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,080
He just complains, uh, about how his media friends don't want to cover it on Crimson

832
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Contagion.

833
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,840
I did 10 minutes with Owen Schroyer yesterday.

834
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,920
That's in the Owen Schroyer section of Bandau video.

835
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,800
Um, and that's the first boil down I've done, but it is to say bombshell, we ought to call

836
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,680
this show bombshell because mainstream media is always bombshell, this bombshell, that

837
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,680
global exclusive, this global system that I don't want to be the global exclusive.

838
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
You're not.

839
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,120
I've actually sent this to the main talk show hosts in the country.

840
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,120
All of them.

841
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Tucker.

842
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
I guess one of them is dead now.

843
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,200
Can't do that, but I've sent it to the other two guys and they're sending me stuff.

844
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
They're like, I'm busy.

845
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,960
You, you cover it and I, and I get it.

846
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,360
This is unbelievable.

847
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,000
I think that they're saying I'm busy.

848
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,600
You cover it because they know it came out a year ago.

849
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
So funny.

850
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Right?

851
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
I mean, that has to be the explanation.

852
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,040
They know like this isn't news.

853
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
This is nothing.

854
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
No, you've got nothing.

855
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,400
We should call our show bombshell as we report after the New York Times.

856
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Wow.

857
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,780
And you know, what's interesting too is I would bet that Tucker would have enough sense

858
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,080
to realize that like, you shouldn't be talking about this.

859
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,760
This looks bad for Trump.

860
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Yeah.

861
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
This looks real bad.

862
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,040
And in order to spin it, you kind of need to exist within like a fully realized conspiracy

863
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
world.

864
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,840
You can't have a foot in reality.

865
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:38,560
You have to create a complete, uh, isolated space where you can pull off a, actually it

866
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,080
was the globalist plan.

867
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Yeah.

868
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,240
And, and Tucker is trying to pretend he still lives in the shared reality we all live in.

869
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Exactly.

870
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,280
Whereas Alex just like, he gave up on that illusion a long time ago.

871
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,720
Um, so yeah, we got to agenda 21.

872
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,000
You remember that?

873
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Sure.

874
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Agenda 2030 maybe.

875
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yeah.

876
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Now there's agenda 2035.

877
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Ooh, I like that.

878
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,320
And so there are servants of Satan and there are servants of the living God that built

879
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,720
this planet and gave us life.

880
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
And then there's the rest.

881
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,520
Next hour, I'm going to expose the next level of the enemy operation.

882
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,880
We were amongst the first to expose agenda 20, 21.

883
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
Whoops.

884
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,720
And now we're exposing agenda 2030.

885
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,240
But what comes after agenda 2030?

886
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Deltron 3030.

887
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,080
For the first time ever, you're going to hear next hour about agenda 2035.

888
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Featuring Dan the automator.

889
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Yeah.

890
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
I was going to say.

891
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:45,040
If they have their way, there will be no humans as we are known today, left on earth in 14

892
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
years.

893
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
No more humans.

894
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
No more humans?

895
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Nope.

896
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Dan?

897
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
Yep.

898
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,760
Um, it's, it's complete nonsense.

899
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,600
And he just like, I love how he just makes up a new agenda name.

900
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Yeah, sure.

901
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Why not?

902
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Agenda 2030.

903
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Agenda 2035.

904
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,400
I think agenda 2030 is actually real.

905
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,440
I think that is the name of like a summit that they had.

906
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
Yeah, sure.

907
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Fine.

908
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,440
But agenda 2035 I think is entirely Alex's own creation.

909
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
I like that.

910
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,560
He can create words and he can create agendas.

911
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:22,400
So one of his agendas is, um, you know, I've never watched any of the Freddy Krueger movies.

912
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Sure.

913
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Have you watched those movies?

914
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
Uh, I watched A Nightmare on Elm Street or two.

915
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,380
I know that they take place in the realm of dreams.

916
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,140
They do and you shouldn't fuck.

917
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,520
If you fuck in a nightmare, Freddy going to get you?

918
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Freddy's going to get you.

919
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,120
So that's kind of, you know, it's in the, it's in the realm of dreams and nightmares

920
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,360
and Alex lives in that space too a lot.

921
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,920
You know, he has these visions when he's on hikes, um, and apparently I would think that

922
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,300
a lot of the stuff that he does, whether for good or bad, may be driven by subconscious

923
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,720
things that he might not understand.

924
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,380
Oh, I would argue that all subconscious things he does not understand.

925
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,600
So listen to this clip with that context in mind.

926
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Okay.

927
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,480
This is about how if you get an abortion, uh, then you'll be fine with killing old people

928
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
and stuff.

929
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
Sure.

930
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Sure.

931
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,560
And then Alex starts talking about his own history of paying for abortions and he says

932
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,420
some stuff that makes me really uncomfortable.

933
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,660
And so Trump coming out and doing this for me is him crossing the Rubicon because this

934
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,480
is 2021 and there's a major pushback against this, but see, I predicted this.

935
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
It wasn't hard to predict.

936
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,680
It's how they work.

937
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,120
They say it's not a baby.

938
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,480
It's not a human Roe v Wade, 1973, tens of millions of women get an abortion.

939
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,760
Now they're going to defend it because they never want to admit they killed their baby.

940
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,560
They never want to admit it doubles or chances of uterine cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian

941
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,520
cancer, or more, more than double.

942
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,160
And some of the studies, they just know it's good.

943
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,200
And because they commit the crime against God, instead of repenting, you harden your

944
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,620
heart, you double down.

945
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,920
You don't get God to forgive you.

946
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,480
And now you're a servant of evil.

947
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,920
And now you're going to support euthanizing old people.

948
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,760
Now you're going to support keeping babies alive and sell their organs because once you're

949
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,440
on that track, you never look, look, folks, I'm not a hypocrite.

950
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,640
Why in God's name would you admit you paid for abortion?

951
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,040
That's horrible because I did it and I repented and I swore to God when I was like 17 years

952
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,440
old and refound God, that I would not do that again.

953
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,000
And I went years without even dating because man, I can look at a woman getting pregnant

954
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
back then.

955
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm still fertile.

956
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,520
And, and, and then I got a pregnant, married her, hadn't had three children with her.

957
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,320
And then that's the way, you know, I will never do that again.

958
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,040
And I repented and I had that God forgave me.

959
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,520
And I, it's like King David did all these horrible things, but he didn't mean it.

960
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,600
He, his heart was real.

961
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
God judge his heart.

962
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
He was forgiven.

963
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
And it was so good.

964
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
You've had an abortion.

965
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
He wrote the book.

966
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Repent.

967
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,040
Kind of painted himself in a positive light.

968
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
I still have nightmares seeing the children though.

969
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,760
God still shows me the children as they grow up and how beautiful they were.

970
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,920
And I had a big nightmare the other night.

971
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,520
Like I was holding this little baby in my hand.

972
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
I was like about an inch big.

973
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
It was my son.

974
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
It was this incredible son.

975
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,880
And this demonic wolf just came and said, you killed your child.

976
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Just ate it right in front of me.

977
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
And I couldn't do anything.

978
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,640
And Satan looked right at me with those red eyes and said, I got your ass, but you don't

979
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,280
because Christ has delivered me and cleansed me of what I did.

980
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,160
And as long as I don't back down now, I will be with Christ forever.

981
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,400
And so Satan get behind me.

982
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,160
I don't listen to a damn thing you say, but that's what this comes down to.

983
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Ladies and gentlemen, that is what this comes down to.

984
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:40,000
So he was holding his tadpole of a fetus, not even that, still borderline and ovum in

985
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
and of itself.

986
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,200
And then the devil ate it.

987
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,760
And the devil ate it in front of him.

988
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,000
And Alex said he has nightmares that God shows him these kids.

989
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,600
So apparently God is sending these nightmares where the devil eats his child in front of

990
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
him.

991
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,080
And somehow Alex is like, yeah, God's forgiven me, I've repented, everything's fine.

992
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,040
But God's torturing me in my dreams.

993
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,920
That's how you keep Alex in line, okay?

994
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,680
If you're God, you've chosen Alex to defeat the devil and you can't let the chosen one

995
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
stray from the path.

996
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,660
So you got to send him constant, terrifying, threatening nightmares to make sure he knows

997
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,720
you love him.

998
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,400
I look at this from a more, I don't know, materialist perspective, or like reality based.

999
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,720
Al, I can see your stone heart right now.

1000
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:33,420
I kind of see this as a thing where Alex may feel tremendous amounts of guilt about things

1001
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,520
that he, and his opposition to abortion and the demonicness of it, maybe a lot of it might

1002
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,680
be a byproduct of how terrible he feels about himself.

1003
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,420
Sure, sure.

1004
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,220
More importantly, this is what I want to say.

1005
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,640
This doesn't belong on air.

1006
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
No.

1007
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
This is not cool.

1008
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
No.

1009
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
This isn't cool.

1010
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
This is bad.

1011
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,640
This isn't good for a news show.

1012
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,160
This isn't good for an editorial show.

1013
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,920
This isn't good as analysis of anything.

1014
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Real bad.

1015
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,600
It maybe has a place as like mid-range televangelist.

1016
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
I could see that.

1017
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah.

1018
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,080
I could see like local televangelist, not like one of the all national ones.

1019
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,800
He doesn't have a private jet, but he can afford a tour bus.

1020
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,360
Somewhere under the Jack Van Impe level.

1021
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Exactly.

1022
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Yeah.

1023
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,200
I find this to be really bizarre that anybody would listen to this and just be like, man,

1024
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,440
this guy gets it.

1025
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,440
He's talking on air, rambling about how he has visions at night of his babies that he

1026
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,320
paid for abortions, and then the devil eats them.

1027
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,120
And Alex gets mad, and ugh, God.

1028
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,840
It's hard to take a man seriously who says we've got big news to get into, and then later

1029
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,520
on goes to be like, I had a dream, and let me tell it to you in exhausting detail.

1030
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,280
Yeah, it was the devil eating my unborn child to punish me or taunt me, and God welcomed

1031
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,200
that dream into my head as some kind of a...

1032
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Okay.

1033
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Yeah.

1034
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
All right.

1035
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Yeah.

1036
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Oh boy.

1037
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,280
So I really got this fucking weird sense about him.

1038
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
That is nuts.

1039
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
And this is nuts.

1040
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Back home, Alex Jones, your host.

1041
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Coming up in the next two segments.

1042
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:18,920
That key report on the globalist plan for a controlled end of the world in or around

1043
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,360
the year 2030.

1044
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,640
Learn what agenda 2035 is exclusively.

1045
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,640
And I'm as serious as a heart attack.

1046
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
People figure that out now.

1047
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,320
People used to hear me say this stuff 25 years ago.

1048
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
It's all come true.

1049
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,960
I've studied their documents, all their information, fused it together.

1050
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,140
I have a lot of contacts, a lot of sources, but I'm now above basically any of those sources

1051
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,200
except for a few of the top globalist.

1052
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,840
I'm one of the only people outside the top globalist leadership that actually have all

1053
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,740
the contacts and all the info to see their complete master plan.

1054
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,120
And again, I'm not bragging.

1055
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,140
It's true.

1056
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,720
And I literally cannot tell you more at that point.

1057
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Okay.

1058
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Okay.

1059
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,680
So only Alex and like King globalists actually know what's going on.

1060
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,200
Nobody else in the world could even see through.

1061
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm listening to this.

1062
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,080
I'm like, this is rank narcissism.

1063
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
Oh yeah.

1064
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
No.

1065
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,360
This is a display of somebody having a breakdown of some kind.

1066
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,320
This is not a well person existing in space.

1067
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
No.

1068
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,320
No.

1069
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:27,880
Generally speaking as a bipolar one, delusions of grandeur are usually a big sign that stuff

1070
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,520
is going off.

1071
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,320
He has delusions of grandeur on a semi-regular basis.

1072
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,320
I don't even know if I would categorize it as like feeling manic because like there's

1073
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,280
also this, this like, no, it'd be malignant narcissism.

1074
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
Yeah.

1075
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,080
It's a flare up though.

1076
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
It's bad.

1077
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
Yeah.

1078
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:52,220
And truly, if I'm the globalist and I know this, you got to kill him.

1079
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,300
I mean, there's no big deal.

1080
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,880
It's not like whatever backlash you might get from killing him is going to be worse

1081
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,720
than having him know your entire plan.

1082
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,720
Yeah.

1083
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,720
Yeah.

1084
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,440
I mean like everybody, I mean the backlash isn't going to be worse.

1085
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Yeah.

1086
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Yeah.

1087
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
Well, I mean like think about it.

1088
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,920
The conspiracy world still believes that like the man killed Bill Cooper and it didn't unravel

1089
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,920
any globalist plot.

1090
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,800
Didn't even really bother anybody that much at all.

1091
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
No.

1092
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,280
They just say, hey, Bill Cooper was right and you know that because they killed him.

1093
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Yeah, exactly.

1094
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,800
That is just what would happen if the globalist killed Alex and if he's the only person who

1095
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,560
can see through everything and understand everything, it's not like anybody else.

1096
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
Yeah.

1097
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,320
And if I'm a globalist, even if I'm a pacifist globalist, you know, like I don't want to

1098
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,200
solve my problems via murder.

1099
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,040
This is a special circumstance.

1100
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,240
You just got to do it.

1101
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Yeah.

1102
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,240
I think that what you've done is provide a pretty decent argument for why there are no

1103
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,840
globalists because if they were as demonic and as cutthroat and have been working on

1104
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,920
a thousand year plan, like Alex seems to think, yeah, they would have literally no reason

1105
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
to hold back.

1106
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Totally.

1107
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,040
And even if you have the protection of God, the God you've got protection from is the

1108
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,800
one sending you weird demon nightmares.

1109
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,800
Yeah.

1110
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,800
That's a weird kid.

1111
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
No big deal.

1112
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Yeah.

1113
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,800
Yeah.

1114
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,120
So Alex gets down to business doing what he does best, which is reading headlines and

1115
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,640
just saying, whoa, gotcha.

1116
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,640
About them.

1117
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
Yeah.

1118
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
No analysis at all.

1119
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
Okay.

1120
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,440
Where should I start this segment ahead of this big report?

1121
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,700
Let's do this.

1122
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,080
Let's go ahead and just read headlines in the vaccine stack from today.

1123
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
Overhead shot, please.

1124
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,560
The crew found another article I didn't know of the New York times, right when they were

1125
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,280
launching the COVID attack a year and three months ago, it's the end of humanity.

1126
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,240
And maybe it's for the best New York times says, get rid of humans.

1127
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,240
They're evil.

1128
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
That's their religion.

1129
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,880
This headline that Alex is reading on air is real, but it's in the New York times book

1130
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,600
review section.

1131
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:58,080
It's the title of a review of a novel novel by Guido Marcelli titled Despatio HG, which

1132
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,440
was published in 1977.

1133
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,360
The plot has to do with a suicidal man realizing that all the rest of the humanity has disappeared

1134
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,280
and he's the last human around.

1135
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,380
In humanity's absence, he waxes philosophical and also notices that nature is taking over

1136
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,420
what was previously cities.

1137
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:18,040
From the review quote, beneath the philosophical welter, a new world glitters with pre-lapsarian

1138
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,880
strangeness, gangs of plump cats raid administrative lobbies, chamois goats prance along train

1139
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,360
tracks, ibixes graze hotel lawns, a sort of one man utopia seems possible.

1140
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,460
The phonies and strivers are gone.

1141
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,400
The city's churches, banks, and military installations lie abandoned, an index of empire's ruin.

1142
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,480
This is a work of fiction that was reviewed in the New York times book section and Alex

1143
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,220
is trying to pass it off as some kind of news article or opinion piece.

1144
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,680
This is beyond the kind of sloppiness that would get anyone fired anywhere else than

1145
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,800
Infowars.

1146
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,520
What the fuck is wrong with this shit?

1147
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,080
Man, I've got a breaking news story for him.

1148
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,600
This comes from the 90s and there was a piece published where a guy specifically said that

1149
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,760
it was the end of the world as he knew it.

1150
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
He felt fine.

1151
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
And he felt fine.

1152
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,760
I remember that.

1153
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Which is fucked up.

1154
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,580
You know, when you think about it, it's the end of the world and this guy feels fine.

1155
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,960
Do you know what that means?

1156
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,680
Top globalist, Dan.

1157
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,680
Undoubtedly.

1158
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
Yeah.

1159
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,980
I think he also predicted like, uh, uh, uh, there was like an eye of a hurricane and then

1160
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,680
he listened to himself churn.

1161
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,320
I can't remember the lyrics to that song.

1162
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Don't even worry.

1163
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,320
It's been a long time.

1164
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,320
It's been a long time.

1165
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:34,640
So Jordan, uh, he's been teasing this, this, uh, report, uh, that he recorded in his car

1166
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,520
on the way to the studio, which you were so shallow about his, his vision while he was

1167
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,520
hiking.

1168
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
Yes.

1169
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,400
Um, so he's been teasing it a lot.

1170
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,400
We keep hearing it.

1171
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Right.

1172
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,180
And so after this, after reading a slew of headlines, he goes to break.

1173
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,880
How far into the episode are we?

1174
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,680
Mm, I'm not sure.

1175
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,680
Maybe two hours.

1176
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,680
Couple hours?

1177
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,680
Yeah.

1178
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,680
About halfway through?

1179
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
About lunchtime.

1180
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,680
So he's getting about hungry.

1181
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,680
Yeah.

1182
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Okay.

1183
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Oh, so he goes to eat lunch and I actually do know that he does that because he says

1184
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,680
that.

1185
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,680
Okay, good.

1186
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,280
So he goes and they play a special report and as they're playing it, I'm listening to

1187
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,280
it.

1188
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,640
I'm like, this doesn't sound like what he was describing about, uh, agenda 2035 or any

1189
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
of that stuff.

1190
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
Is it quiet and cogent?

1191
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,760
No, it's just an info or a special report.

1192
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,720
So it, like it goes to commercial and then it comes back, mic down for this.

1193
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,720
Okay.

1194
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,520
This is a amazing freak out.

1195
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,520
Okay.

1196
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,240
That I will actually tell you is edited out of the version of this that appears on band.video.

1197
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
They cut this out.

1198
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,240
All right.

1199
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,320
There's a lot going on around here at the office and I know you as a listener are focused.

1200
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,320
That's fine.

1201
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
I appreciate that.

1202
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,440
You heard me say we're going to air this 2035 report when we come back and I just went off

1203
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,120
and had lunch, was getting ready for the report to come on and I saw something else come on

1204
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
while I was eating lunch.

1205
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,480
I was like, holy hell, what's that?

1206
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,560
And so I ran back in there and they're like, oh, we didn't know you want to air this report.

1207
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,600
So, so that was not a tactic to say coming back 2035.

1208
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,220
And so you, the whole show, I'm like saying, it's coming up, it's coming up.

1209
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:06,640
That wasn't a tactic to then, you know, leave you there in the lurch with what we just aired.

1210
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
It's great.

1211
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,180
Everything I do, I shoot in writing from now on, I should have a little computer that puts

1212
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,200
a print out for the military does that.

1213
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,500
And then it's like a buzz and I can just, cause Cruz, great Cruz, great.

1214
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,600
Maybe I should just quit.

1215
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,480
Maybe that seriously, I'm thinking about, I've kind of done my mission, haven't I?

1216
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,280
Maybe I should just walk out of here and they do a better job and never see me again because

1217
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,320
I can either cancel Dr. Francis Boyle coming on to talk about how this is a massive crime

1218
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,840
against humanity, a biological weapons attack on humanity and the master plan and what they're

1219
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
planning and what they're doing.

1220
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,600
I had him for an hour, but I also said, I'm going to air this report because I came in

1221
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,460
this morning and I said, you got till 1230 to get this report ready and add graphics

1222
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,880
to it because we're going to air this.

1223
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,360
And then I said, here's the articles I want at 1230 to put over this, this thing we're

1224
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,360
going to air.

1225
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,920
And then I promoted it and I promoted it and I promoted it and I promoted it and I'm not

1226
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,920
even bitching.

1227
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,240
I'm trying to understand why I'm the worst communicator.

1228
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,680
Worse, do a better job.

1229
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:14,240
Get your ass together now.

1230
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
I'm serious.

1231
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
I suck.

1232
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:27,200
I can't get shit in the fricking killing everybody and everybody's in a trance.

1233
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,720
All right, let's go to rebroadcast for a while.

1234
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,760
We'll see if I can boil on.

1235
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,760
I'm serious, man.

1236
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,200
I'm two inches from walking out here forever.

1237
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
Can't do this anymore, man.

1238
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
We're in a damn war.

1239
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
They're murdering everybody.

1240
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
It's funny.

1241
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:51,560
Well, I don't think it's funny here.

1242
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,880
Let's hear governor Newsome.

1243
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Let's hear Trump one more time.

1244
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,320
Tell us how great the vaccines are.

1245
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,720
Oh boy, man.

1246
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,440
So that sound you heard was him slapping himself.

1247
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,440
Yeah.

1248
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
Yeah.

1249
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,040
I just like, this is at a certain point, this isn't a show anymore.

1250
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,680
This is a guy breaking down.

1251
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,680
Yeah.

1252
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,720
I feel bad laughing about it, but I hate him.

1253
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,800
And it's kind of funny.

1254
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
It's hilarious.

1255
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,800
Yeah.

1256
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:23,160
Also, did it just occur to you to write out a fucking script or something, an outline?

1257
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,160
Right.

1258
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,960
Oh, that's what the military, no, that's what all good shows do.

1259
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
Yeah.

1260
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
Yeah.

1261
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
That's called like producing.

1262
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
Yeah.

1263
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,960
It's called producing a show.

1264
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Yeah.

1265
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,400
And so he has to give a little bit of an apology, obviously.

1266
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Obviously.

1267
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,560
And he explains that, you know, maybe this is on him.

1268
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,040
And yes, that was a real freak out on air earlier because it's normal when world government

1269
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,320
is coming in and setting up global passports and basically forced inoculations and doing

1270
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,400
it to newborn homeless babies.

1271
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,400
And I'm not mad at the crew.

1272
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,280
I wasn't clear about airing that report, I guess, to them.

1273
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,480
And I want to boil for a whole hour, but I will air that report because it only fits

1274
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
the fifth, fourth of this segment.

1275
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,040
And then you've got John Rappaport coming on and that'll be really memed earlier of

1276
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,040
me slapped myself in the face.

1277
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
But I am mad at myself.

1278
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,040
I wish I did a better job.

1279
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,040
Yeah, me too.

1280
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:18,280
I, man, I just love this as a bookend because the episode begins with him talking about

1281
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,280
how great it was that the crew psychically knew the video that he wanted to play.

1282
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
Yep.

1283
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Very beautiful.

1284
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,000
He didn't even tell them he wanted to play.

1285
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
You know what, Dan?

1286
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,240
I'm going to tell you this right now.

1287
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,120
I'm going to tell you this right now.

1288
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,000
My stone cold heart.

1289
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yep.

1290
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Not wrong.

1291
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,560
He said it on the show that we're premiering this report at a certain time.

1292
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,560
Right.

1293
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,640
And I guess the producers aren't listening to the show to get that report ready.

1294
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,760
I suppose maybe we should have talked about this before the show started.

1295
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:52,760
It's pretty remarkable.

1296
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,760
Yeah.

1297
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
I love it though.

1298
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,760
Bananas.

1299
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Yep.

1300
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,120
So he has Francis Boyle on and I don't care anymore about that guy.

1301
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,120
Yeah.

1302
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,120
Because, you know, you have this whole thing where it's like, okay, for months we're talking

1303
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,960
about how the coronavirus itself is a bioweapon that Fauci made in this lab and now we're

1304
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,640
going to be doing the vaccine as a bioweapon that Fauci made.

1305
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,640
Yeah.

1306
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,640
I'm tired.

1307
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
Yeah.

1308
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,640
This is boring.

1309
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,640
Francis Doyle frustrates me.

1310
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,640
Boyle.

1311
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Boyle.

1312
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,640
Apologies.

1313
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,320
Frustrates me because if you are named Francis Boyle, I assume you have been knighted.

1314
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,880
I don't know why, but if your name is Francis Boyle, it better be Sir Francis Boyle.

1315
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,400
Probably because Arthur Conan Doyle?

1316
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
Probably.

1317
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,400
Yeah.

1318
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,400
Probably.

1319
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,400
But it does sound right.

1320
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
It kind of does.

1321
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,400
It does sound right.

1322
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
Yeah.

1323
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,560
So he makes the, what I'm going to call the Larry Nichols mistake and that is that he

1324
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:51,280
gives Alex permission to give out his phone number on the website to help info warriors

1325
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:59,600
with legal advice or to assist their lawyers because he's not licensed to practice in one

1326
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
state.

1327
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,560
But he'll advise their lawyers on how to help them not get vaccinated.

1328
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
Good work.

1329
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
I don't care.

1330
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,560
Good work.

1331
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,560
Stupid Francis Boyle.

1332
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
Yup.

1333
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,600
Anyway, we jump to the 18th now because that interview goes and I thought it would be funny

1334
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:17,160
not to cover his report that he had from his car because it's a zero.

1335
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
Yeah.

1336
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
That sounds right.

1337
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,820
And there are honestly more pressing issues like this that Alex gets into at the beginning

1338
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,000
of his March 18th show.

1339
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,080
And all over the place, the leaders of the LGBT movements keep getting arrested for having

1340
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:36,840
sex with 10 year olds and 11 year olds because the truth is it wasn't about gay marriage.

1341
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:42,200
It was always about sex with your children because it's a satanic ritual to drain off

1342
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:47,120
their energy, to drain off their innocence and drain off their future.

1343
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,680
The only thing they like better is chopping your children up with a meat cleaver while

1344
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,680
they rape them.

1345
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,160
And I'm sorry to have to tell you that, but that's what the big boys do.

1346
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,520
So this is a kind of moment that you might describe as a mask off a situation.

1347
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,520
Yeah.

1348
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,660
He doesn't pretend all that he wants that he's a libertarian and that he doesn't care

1349
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,080
what people do in their bedroom.

1350
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,240
But underneath all that belief is this, which is the classical trope of homophobic rhetoric.

1351
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Yep.

1352
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,400
To put this in context, Alex has found a story about a judge in Wisconsin named Brett Blom,

1353
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,420
who was arrested on suspicion of uploading child pornography to websites.

1354
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,620
He apparently was a family court judge and had formerly been the president of an organization

1355
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,080
called Cream City Foundation, which is a philanthropic organization advocating for members of the

1356
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,480
LGBTQ plus community.

1357
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,960
And in the past, that foundation had sponsored some drag queen story hour events.

1358
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,120
So naturally this is being presented in right wing media as this guy being the head of drag

1359
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,720
queen story hour.

1360
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,660
What Alex is doing is engaging in selective coverage.

1361
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,460
He makes a big deal out of every time that someone in a group of people he wants to attack

1362
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,700
gets arrested for a horrible crime and he ignores the other instances where the perpetrator

1363
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,560
is someone who's a member of a group that he doesn't want to portray as evil.

1364
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,640
When there's a school shooting, it's just an individual doing a terrible thing.

1365
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,880
And in those cases, Alex fully understands how bad it can be to engage in collective

1366
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,440
blame for individual actions.

1367
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,820
Most of his career is based on yelling about how gun owners will be blamed for things like

1368
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,680
Sandy Hook or the Las Vegas shooting.

1369
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,840
You have to resist that or else you get guns taken.

1370
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,720
But when you get right down to it, Alex does the far worse version of ascribing collective

1371
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,440
blame for the actions of individuals because he's doing it to malign and attack historically

1372
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,720
marginalized groups of people.

1373
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,680
Any immigrant committing a crime becomes proof that immigrants are all criminals and killers.

1374
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,440
The crimes of any gay person becomes proof that the LGBTQ rights movement is secretly

1375
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,800
about trying to have sex with kids.

1376
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,080
I'm certain most of the listeners don't need this spelled out, but this is profoundly dangerous

1377
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,460
because what it achieves is coupling the perception of criminality with an entire group of people

1378
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,880
based on the actions of an individual who's a member of that group.

1379
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,560
And this is just unacceptable.

1380
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,040
No, that's, that's just so fucked.

1381
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
Yeah.

1382
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,400
It's just so fucked.

1383
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,320
Ah, God.

1384
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,720
It just doesn't end.

1385
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,920
It just never ends.

1386
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,780
No matter how much fucking violence we see on a daily basis, it is still a man out there

1387
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,620
trying to get people attacked.

1388
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,480
And it's just so fucked.

1389
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,480
Yep.

1390
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,480
Ugh.

1391
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,700
So, um, we're not going to dwell too much on that, uh, because like a lot of that does

1392
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:24,660
surround like a lot of the sort of gross stuff that Alex, uh, I don't, I don't, uh, respect

1393
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:29,220
him to handle and I don't want to replay on our show, but I felt that that rose to a level

1394
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:35,780
of like, okay, Alex is saying that the sort of LGBTQ rights movement and the push for

1395
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:39,940
gay marriage was actually secretly about trying to have sex with kids.

1396
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:45,760
And I think a moment like that does deserve a place on our show because it reveals something

1397
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,100
that's under the surface of his, his, his, his worldview, his, his beliefs, and that's

1398
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,100
fucked up.

1399
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,600
It's a, he's, that's, that's where he's at.

1400
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,600
Yep.

1401
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,600
Yep.

1402
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:02,600
And it's a, it's even more explicit than whenever he was like LGBTQP or whatever it was where

1403
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,480
he was trying to add that in there.

1404
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,600
And it's just, it's just, yep.

1405
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,600
Hate him.

1406
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,600
Yep.

1407
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
I hate him.

1408
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,600
Yeah.

1409
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,920
Alex is mad that, uh, Biden has said some tough words about Putin.

1410
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
Sure.

1411
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,280
Sure, sure, sure.

1412
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,080
And I get the sense from listening to this episode, March 18th, that there's a, there's

1413
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,640
a sense that Alex loves Putin.

1414
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,320
Real pro the Monarch that he wishes would take over the United States.

1415
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:38,440
I think he wishes Trump was more like Bolsonaro or Putin, quite frankly.

1416
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,400
And I think he would rather one of them invade the United States.

1417
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,320
He wanted a God King strong man and instead he got a God King grifter.

1418
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,760
He got a front man for the mob.

1419
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
Yeah, exactly.

1420
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,260
And so now he's like, Oh, look at what could have been, we could have had a 30 year monstrosity

1421
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,800
of a Russian rule.

1422
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,800
Great.

1423
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,120
And so I think he's going back to that.

1424
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Cool.

1425
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:04,680
And so there he is up there not knowing what planet he's on and he's on national TV saying

1426
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:12,840
that Russia is going to pay soon and that they're going to be coming after him and that

1427
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,920
we're going to kill her with no soul.

1428
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,720
And that's why Putin then said, you actually need to look in the mirror, but let's talk

1429
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,080
about what Putin has done.

1430
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:28,180
What Putin's really up to Putin slashed the Russian defense budget in the last eight years

1431
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:32,160
over and over again, he pulled troops out of all these different places.

1432
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,160
He launched a national organic drives and they want to supply the world organic food

1433
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,960
and with cleaner fossil fuels, they have a program to promote marriage and Christianity

1434
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,200
and they are decrying the Carnegie foundation, the Ford foundation, Rockefeller foundation,

1435
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,520
the Soros foundations, and are saying they want to post human world and that Russia is

1436
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,120
not for it.

1437
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,280
And so the globalists are very, very upset because they had Russia for 80 plus years

1438
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,880
in their demonic clutches.

1439
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,960
It's so funny to me because like last weekend I was watching Alex's documentaries for some

1440
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,960
prep on some stuff and I watched terror storm, I believe it was in terror storm.

1441
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:12,720
They kind of blend together cause they're very repetitive, but he was talking about

1442
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,440
how he had proven that Putin bombed those apartment buildings.

1443
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,440
Yeah.

1444
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,440
Yeah.

1445
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,440
Well, I mean it's not hard.

1446
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,440
I know.

1447
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,540
But then like on the, on the Y2K episode that he did, he was talking about how Putin looks

1448
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,540
like a demon.

1449
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:31,720
He's going to seize power or I just, I don't know.

1450
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,720
It's weird.

1451
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,720
It's weird.

1452
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,200
That doesn't, it doesn't mean anything.

1453
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,720
It's just wherever the wind blows with my prejudices today.

1454
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,720
Yep.

1455
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:45,440
And then so long as you stick within the relative boundaries of those prejudices, I'll support

1456
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,520
you forever.

1457
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:51,320
But if you break away, like say you support vaccines, then you're fucking done.

1458
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,320
Yeah.

1459
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,600
And I think that he recognizes that Putin is a leader that would protect the things

1460
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:03,520
that are important to him, which is sort of heteronormative, white, masculine-based society.

1461
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,080
I mean, consider the treatment of the LGBTQ people in fucking Russia.

1462
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,760
Yeah, of course.

1463
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,360
So Alex, I like it when he gets a little heady.

1464
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,360
But I like this even more.

1465
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:25,440
If you read the Sumerian text, or the Egyptian hieroglyphs, or the Aztec hieroglyphs, or

1466
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:32,280
the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, it's a bunch of translations from 2000 plus years ago from

1467
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,720
things 4,000, 5,000 years old.

1468
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,560
It tells the same story.

1469
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:41,920
We go to India, they have 6,000 year old hieroglyphs.

1470
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:49,320
China, 6,000 year old stone carvings that tell the same story.

1471
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:54,640
A story we'll talk about here in just one moment.

1472
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,520
The story of Jesus.

1473
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,280
But first, let's talk about keeping the broadcast on the air.

1474
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,640
I want to thank you all for your support.

1475
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,640
It's a symbiotic relationship.

1476
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,560
You get great products at the same time, but it takes a lot of money to run this operation.

1477
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,640
We have to have our own infrastructure, our own crews.

1478
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,640
I love it.

1479
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,000
I feel like he slapped me in the face three times.

1480
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,160
All societies over the course of all history have told the same story, and I will explain

1481
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,160
it to you after.

1482
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,680
Let's talk about money real quick, because I need it.

1483
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,480
That's the real story that's been told over and over again throughout history.

1484
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,080
So Alex does a really, really long plug.

1485
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,480
Fairly long plug.

1486
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,200
I don't even know what's long anymore.

1487
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,120
Listening to his show, my radar is skewed.

1488
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,320
Time is meaningless.

1489
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,240
But he has a bit of a plug, and then he gets into what I think maybe is what the Mesopotamians

1490
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,240
were all about.

1491
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,240
Okay.

1492
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,800
All right, let me do this, because I can't in five minutes or six minutes do it justice

1493
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,800
in this segment.

1494
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:59,080
But when I start the next hour, I'm going to get into humanoid and what that means and

1495
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:03,880
how many times I've told you about this, and I want to be very, very clear.

1496
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,380
I didn't predict this.

1497
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:12,060
They admitted to producing humanoids 50 years ago, 50 years ago.

1498
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,560
Right about 50 years ago, humanoids were already created, and by the way, humanoids were taken

1499
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,560
to term.

1500
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,560
50 years ago?

1501
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,300
There are humanoids, quite a few of them.

1502
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,280
We don't know the actual numbers, but a lot of governments worked on them.

1503
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,600
So when you see movies in the 80s about replicants, they already have them, but they're not supermen.

1504
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,940
Most of them are mentally retarded, have horrible genetic disorders, and are just in hellish

1505
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,940
situations.

1506
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:38,920
Yeah, so we already, of course, know about the fish people with sad human eyes.

1507
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,360
Yes, naturally.

1508
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,400
And then now we have tons of replicants walking around.

1509
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,040
Uh, yeah.

1510
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,040
Apparently.

1511
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,040
Why?

1512
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,440
I don't know.

1513
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,980
I was going to take this seriously.

1514
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:58,960
This has to do with more stories about advancements that are being made in replacement organ kind

1515
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,960
of technologies.

1516
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,960
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1517
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,480
Uh, I was going to take it seriously, but then he said this, and I'm like, I'm out.

1518
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,520
And here's the promise that Joe Biden and Ted Turner and Bill Gates have been given

1519
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,000
by the little nasty dudes giving them this technology.

1520
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You might have heard of them.

1521
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,240
The Bible calls them demons, not of this world, not very friendly.

1522
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,520
They're being promised life extension, but they first got to kill us and test on us.

1523
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:33,280
And the truth is these torture us and mutate us and do horrible things to us because they

1524
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,200
know what we grow into and what we do.

1525
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,640
We're kept pure and come together as a species.

1526
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,280
But that is not the case.

1527
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:45,620
This is actually a giant genetic war on the planet and we've been set up for this.

1528
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,240
So I just think you should get ready for that.

1529
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:54,440
If there's a story about some scientific breakthrough or some kind of scientific story, just some

1530
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,880
story that's going on, I find that interesting.

1531
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:02,640
But I don't care to talk about it realistically when it's being presented to me as part of

1532
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,320
a plot where Joe Biden is going to get life extension technology, which was promised by

1533
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,320
a demon.

1534
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,320
Right.

1535
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:16,320
Well, they're nasty dudes, called demons in the Bible, but they're otherworldly.

1536
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,060
They're just nasty dudes.

1537
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:24,320
Are you a nasty enough dude to extend the president's life is a question that I believe

1538
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,320
video games asked.

1539
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,680
I certainly am not.

1540
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,960
Yeah, I just don't...

1541
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:36,040
Once this is the realm we're in, any real conversation doesn't matter.

1542
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:43,280
Once it's aliens or demons, nah buddy, I'm out.

1543
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:49,480
Also anytime he says pure, I don't want him to expand upon that.

1544
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,480
We all know.

1545
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,160
It's better if he leaves it alone.

1546
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,720
Stay away from the...

1547
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,760
He shouldn't be allowed to say the word pure.

1548
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,880
It comes off his lips poorly.

1549
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1550
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,880
It doesn't sound good.

1551
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,880
No.

1552
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,880
This is pure OJ.

1553
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,880
What does that mean?

1554
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,880
Is it white inside?

1555
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,880
What do you want?

1556
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,960
But in terms of the purity that he's talking about, I think he means fully human.

1557
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,960
I think he does.

1558
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,960
Although I don't disagree with you.

1559
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,960
No, he does.

1560
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,960
He does.

1561
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,960
I believe so.

1562
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
Yeah.

1563
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,680
People in his community have an unhealthy relationship with the term pure.

1564
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,680
Yes.

1565
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,680
But I think he's talking about all humans, not humanoids.

1566
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,680
Right.

1567
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:29,680
So at this point in the show, Alex goes to calls, and this is one of the more uncomfortable

1568
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,320
and unpleasant set of calls that he's taken, because it has to do with the vaccine.

1569
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,280
It's all Harrison Smith calling in?

1570
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,280
Oh, no.

1571
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,680
That would at least...

1572
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,640
At least that wouldn't be this...

1573
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,640
This is depressing.

1574
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,640
I think this could get people killed.

1575
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,880
Oh, that's not good.

1576
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,880
Yeah.

1577
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,840
Because they're talking about the vaccine stuff.

1578
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,920
And Alex has some bad medical advice, and then he also just is acting weird with these

1579
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,920
people.

1580
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,920
He's one caller.

1581
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:57,680
He calls in, and he's talking about how his dad got the vaccine and then died.

1582
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,360
And Alex's response is a little weird.

1583
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:07,120
He was in and out, and he knew that's what did it.

1584
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Yeah.

1585
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,880
God almighty, Ralph, who do you blame?

1586
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,760
I would blame Bill Gates and the media.

1587
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,520
People say, oh, all these famous sports stars that died, they deserved it.

1588
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,680
No, they did it.

1589
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,680
They said, I want to protect people.

1590
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,080
They were tough guys.

1591
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,640
They did it because they were lied to.

1592
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,740
They were actually heroes.

1593
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:28,000
Your dad, I believe, meant well and was a hero at the end of the day.

1594
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,720
But what about the people that did this on purpose, brother?

1595
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,720
Yeah.

1596
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,720
Bill Gates and the globalists.

1597
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,600
And I would love to meet Bill Gates.

1598
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,160
I'll tell you that.

1599
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,160
That's weird.

1600
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,840
That's a weird response to have when someone's telling you this story about their dad passing

1601
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,920
away fairly recently for you to ask, who do you blame?

1602
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,440
We have a term, literally very, very old term.

1603
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,440
Yeah.

1604
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,560
For the thing that he is asking the man to do, and we say it in a bad context.

1605
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,560
What's that?

1606
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,680
It's called a scapegoat, Dan.

1607
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,160
Who do you blame is not a good question ever.

1608
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,280
No, it's definitely not.

1609
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,280
It's rude too.

1610
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,280
Yeah.

1611
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,720
I don't think that caller took it as rude, but it is.

1612
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:14,160
Who do you want me to kill is another answer for it.

1613
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,920
Your dad was murdered.

1614
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,920
Who do you blame?

1615
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:22,360
Well, the thing is, it's bizarre and it's pointless to any real conversation that you

1616
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,240
want to have that would have public value, but it's important to understand this element

1617
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,760
of why this is exactly what Alex would ask, because this is an intensely painful story

1618
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,760
if it's true.

1619
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,880
I'm not sure it's just somebody calling into Alex's show, but assuming that it is real,

1620
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,640
that's fucking super hard.

1621
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,280
Dude lost his dad recently, and even if the guy's in poor health, that's still really

1622
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,280
hard.

1623
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,280
Yeah.

1624
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,840
The idea is to take feelings like the one this caller is experiencing and translate

1625
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:54,160
them into feelings of anger and hate directed at the people Alex has decided are his enemies.

1626
01:09:54,160 --> 01:10:01,960
Now, he's talking specifically about Bill Gates and what have you, but make no mistake,

1627
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:09,800
this exact sort of transmutation of pain into hate and anger is exactly what happens towards

1628
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,720
the marginalized communities that Alex attacks and demonizes.

1629
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,600
It's exactly the same.

1630
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,600
It's witch shit.

1631
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,600
Yeah.

1632
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,600
It is witch shit.

1633
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,600
Do you blame the witches?

1634
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,600
Of course it's the witches.

1635
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,600
It stopped raining.

1636
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,600
Do you blame the witch?

1637
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,840
No, that's God.

1638
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,760
The demons make it rain and God makes it sunny.

1639
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,760
Duh.

1640
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,760
Okay.

1641
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,760
God, I hate people.

1642
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,760
Yeah.

1643
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:38,920
Alex gets another call, and this guy was saying that his dad got a shot and then maybe had

1644
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:43,920
some indications that he might have prostate cancer.

1645
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,920
Here's how this goes.

1646
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:52,560
So my dad is a medical doctor and he had the second round of the vaccine and now he just

1647
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,360
received word that his PSA levels and his prostate are high, which obviously are an

1648
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:03,920
indication of potential cancer, so now he has to have a biopsy on his prostate.

1649
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,960
Well, they actually said that, sir.

1650
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:06,960
They said when you...

1651
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,440
So did he take the Pfizer or Moderna?

1652
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:12,400
I want to say Pfizer, but I'm not 100% sure on that.

1653
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,680
Yeah, it's the mRNA that anything that's already precancerous makes it basically go cancerous.

1654
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
They admit that.

1655
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,680
Wow.

1656
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,680
So now they want a biopsy of his prostate.

1657
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:27,880
Can he show them the literature saying that it makes hormone-based tissues swell up and

1658
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,160
that they should not do any biopsies for six months?

1659
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,800
Oh, I guess I was not aware of that.

1660
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,640
I mean, I've tried to send him videos and stuff.

1661
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,640
He just...

1662
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:45,760
Yeah, guys, type in, doctors say don't be alarmed after mRNA vaccine if your glands,

1663
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,080
uterus, prostate swell up.

1664
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,440
Yeah, that's what it does, sir.

1665
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,440
Okay.

1666
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,760
Whether or not COVID-19 vaccines can cause the side effect of gland swelling, this is

1667
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,080
so irresponsible of Alex.

1668
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,480
If this caller's dad, who is a doctor, has reason to suspect he may have prostate cancer,

1669
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,320
he needs to take appropriate steps to make sure one way or another, because the key to

1670
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,640
treatment is early detection.

1671
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,500
Alex's advice for him to avoid getting a biopsy and just assume it's probably a side effect

1672
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,560
of the vaccine, even though the caller can't even remember which vaccine his dad got, that

1673
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,780
could get people hurt.

1674
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:24,280
Alex is misrepresenting a recent article from the Cleveland Clinic titled, quote, don't

1675
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:29,240
be alarmed by this COVID-19 vaccine side effect that could be confused with breast cancer.

1676
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:33,280
This deals with possible swelling of the lymph nodes under your arm as a side effect of the

1677
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,400
COVID-19 vaccine, which is relevant because that's also a sign of breast cancer.

1678
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,560
This has nothing to do with prostate swelling and Alex should be immediately taken off air

1679
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,240
for offering this reckless medical advice to his audience and to his caller.

1680
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,440
To be clear, this caller is probably going to be fine.

1681
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,060
His dad seems to not believe this bullshit and he's a doctor, so I would imagine he's

1682
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,720
taking appropriate actions to protect his own health.

1683
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,480
My son sent me YouTube videos and I'm a doctor.

1684
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,100
I think I'm gonna get a biopsy.

1685
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:05,560
The problem is with listeners who hear this and think Alex knows anything, what if one

1686
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,520
of them has a possible cancer symptom that they decide to overlook because Alex told

1687
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,600
them it's just a vaccine side effect?

1688
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,320
Legitimately, that has the potential to get people hurt.

1689
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:22,600
If you have, God forbid, some kind of swelling or some kind of a symptom of cancer outside

1690
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,240
of, even if it is the lymph nodes in your arm, you should probably make sure and go

1691
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,480
talk to a doctor.

1692
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,340
But if it's in some other area and you hear Alex being like, oh, we got all the literature,

1693
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,760
you shouldn't get a biopsy for six months, that six months could be critical.

1694
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,160
It's fucked up.

1695
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,880
This is one of the instances of me being like very much, there should be a consequence for

1696
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
this.

1697
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:45,880
Yeah.

1698
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,040
If there's a consequence for telling people to drink bleach, there should be a consequence

1699
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:56,720
for telling people not to get a medical treatment or not to do, yeah, no, that's...

1700
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,720
It's outrageous.

1701
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,720
Yeah.

1702
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:03,600
That is, it is just as bad to say like, hey, here's a cure for your problem as it is to

1703
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,160
say, don't seek out medical attention because you should listen to me.

1704
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,560
Yeah, you're fine.

1705
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,560
Exactly.

1706
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,560
Yeah, that's fucked.

1707
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,560
Yeah.

1708
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,560
Yeah.

1709
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,440
So this next caller, this person actually kind of tickled me with their voice.

1710
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,000
I enjoy this guy's voice.

1711
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Okay.

1712
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,080
Hey Alex, what's up man?

1713
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,480
Man, I'm just watching the new Holocaust, brother.

1714
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,480
I hear you, man.

1715
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,600
Hey man, I can't believe I'm talking to you.

1716
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,600
Hold on.

1717
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,360
I've been listening to you since I was six.

1718
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,360
That depressed me.

1719
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,360
Oh boy.

1720
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,920
I like him calling him man over and over again.

1721
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,920
Yeah, that is nice.

1722
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,920
That's kind of...

1723
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,920
Hey man.

1724
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,920
I like his little twang.

1725
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:41,920
He's doing all right.

1726
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,920
Hey man, what's going on Alex?

1727
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:43,920
Hey buddy.

1728
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Yeah.

1729
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,920
I like it.

1730
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:46,920
Listening since he was six.

1731
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,920
No, that's not good.

1732
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,240
You can't understand things at six.

1733
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:57,080
The kind of topics that Alex is covering, you have no ability to gauge or to measure

1734
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,000
... holy shit.

1735
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,840
At a time whenever everyone is telling you that your dreams are not real, you are listening

1736
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,200
to a man tell you about how his dreams are real.

1737
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,200
That's not good.

1738
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,840
And that's how you get political awareness.

1739
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,440
Yeah, that's definitely not good.

1740
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,440
No.

1741
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,440
Oh boy.

1742
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,440
Yeah, I mean, what is six?

1743
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,940
Like, or yeah, what is... second grade?

1744
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,940
What is that?

1745
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,940
First grade, I think.

1746
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,940
Yeah, that's not good.

1747
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:29,440
I was playing, I remember I would finish my work early so I could play with dinosaurs.

1748
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,720
And I remember nobody telling me that dinosaurs were actually put there by, oh wait, no, I

1749
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,720
disagree.

1750
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,620
I was told that dinosaurs were put there by God to test our faith when I was six.

1751
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:44,760
So well, that didn't have any negative effects on me, Dan.

1752
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,280
Six was the first year that I lived in Hawaii.

1753
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:54,160
Like I was, the first grade, holy shit, I look, I think back on like, I didn't know

1754
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,160
anything.

1755
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,160
Nothing.

1756
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,720
I imagine listening to Alex from that age.

1757
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:05,040
I am going to, I'm going to listen to Alex while I work on my multiplication tables real

1758
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,040
quick.

1759
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:12,880
So I, okay, so three times four is 12 and 12 is the number of the Illuminati trying

1760
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,880
to kill me.

1761
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,880
This has meaning.

1762
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,880
Yep.

1763
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,880
Oh boy.

1764
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,880
The teacher might be the devil.

1765
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:18,880
She doesn't know shit.

1766
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:19,880
She's the devil.

1767
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,880
Yeah.

1768
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,520
I think it would be tough to live that way.

1769
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,760
And I mean like I would come home from school and I would do homework sometimes watching

1770
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,760
TRL.

1771
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,760
Yeah.

1772
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:31,760
Yeah.

1773
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,480
This guy's listening to Alex yell about the devil.

1774
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:39,840
Also, he seems positively cheerful for someone who has absorbed all of Alex's bullshit.

1775
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,840
Man.

1776
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,760
And once you hear about what's happened in his life recently, you'll be even more surprised

1777
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,760
that he's that chipper.

1778
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,760
Oh wow.

1779
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,280
I don't know, man.

1780
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,960
And then, you know, just like this whole COVID, they're such liars, man, and my wife lost

1781
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,640
my wife last year because I couldn't really get her proper medical attention genetic.

1782
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:04,040
She had a genetic condition and had, and she had real bad CLPD and she would, you would

1783
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,100
not go to the hospital because they wouldn't let me stay with her.

1784
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,100
She wouldn't.

1785
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,100
She would not stay.

1786
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,100
Oh yeah.

1787
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,100
That's the whole thing.

1788
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,960
Not letting you go in cause the COVID so they can run a dictatorship inside there.

1789
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:13,960
That's right.

1790
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:18,360
And I wasn't going to let her stay without me because I knew if they got her in there

1791
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,840
with her condition, she was probably done for.

1792
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,760
Well, they would have got a fake PCR test and then innovated her for the money.

1793
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,360
Yeah, I know it.

1794
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:31,080
And so anyway, basically we just sit at home till she died.

1795
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,080
Jesus.

1796
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:37,500
I mean, that's so sad.

1797
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,240
That's a person who...

1798
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,760
Alex killed his wife.

1799
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:46,440
I mean, not individually, but like that information's fear of like insisting that they're going

1800
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:53,000
to kill you for the COVID money made it so she didn't get appropriate care and sat at

1801
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,640
home and died.

1802
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,640
If true.

1803
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,440
Again, this is just somebody calling into Alex's show.

1804
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,440
Yeah.

1805
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:06,000
And he's calling and complimenting the guy who he's been listening to since he was six,

1806
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,680
who got it deep into his head that you can't let your wife go without, wow.

1807
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,280
This episode has a body count.

1808
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,400
This is a, this is a body count.

1809
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,400
Yeah.

1810
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,400
It really is.

1811
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,800
Hypothetical future and like- That's just so fucked up.

1812
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,840
It is like, that's how fucked up your brain gets.

1813
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,020
I would rather blame, I would rather lose my wife.

1814
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:37,960
I would rather lose my wife and still believe that I am following the correct path than

1815
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:47,120
I would confront reality and save my wife's life or whatever, you know, improve her life

1816
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,120
materially.

1817
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:53,720
I mean, the alternative was you think you have this paranoid delusion about this conspiracy

1818
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,400
that she's going to die if she goes to the hospital while she did die by not going to

1819
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,400
the hospital.

1820
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,400
Yep.

1821
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,060
I don't understand how this is a win.

1822
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,480
It's not, it's so fucking sad.

1823
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,480
Wow.

1824
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,040
That is just so fucking sad.

1825
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,040
Yep.

1826
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,580
And it's so awful when these like human stories, if true, penetrate through Alex's show and

1827
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,120
they aren't taken as seriously as they really are.

1828
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,460
Like that's, that's profoundly messed up.

1829
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:22,500
And you have this and it's like, okay, these are glimpses into some of these people's lives

1830
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,200
who have been affected by Alex's content, presumably since they were six.

1831
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,200
Yeah.

1832
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,200
Yeah.

1833
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:35,640
And, and at the same time, the show, the day prior was a complete freak out of him just

1834
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:40,680
being emotionally unhinged, yelling about how he needs to quit because the staff won't

1835
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,320
get his video out on time and how he has nightmares of the devil eating his unborn children.

1836
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,320
Yeah.

1837
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:55,320
Like it's, that's the same person who is being looked at as an expert by this guy who let

1838
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,620
his wife die at home.

1839
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:02,680
Here's what you get empathetically from him, a quieter, sorry, and then continuing to yell

1840
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:08,260
as if, and as if you weren't listening to somebody tell you, Hey, you're responsible

1841
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,260
for my wife's death.

1842
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:12,400
Well, and what you're going to get is that sort of, Hey, sorry about that, but then you're

1843
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:18,860
also going to get a doubling down and a reinforcing and a validating of the exact conspiracy nonsense

1844
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:23,080
that led you and your wife to not getting appropriate care.

1845
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,420
It's, it's terrifying.

1846
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,860
This is straight up real cult leadership.

1847
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:35,400
This is 100% a your wife died and it's because of everybody but the cult leader.

1848
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,540
That's just so fucked.

1849
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,000
She would have lived if they wouldn't have killed her at the hospital.

1850
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,440
Okay.

1851
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,600
You know what happened in my cult?

1852
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:50,440
The cult leader was responsible for the death of a child as was his parents and everything

1853
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:51,920
that they believed in.

1854
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:57,880
And whenever that child died due to their lack of care, their denial of care and their

1855
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:06,940
belief that caring for the child at a hospital or even considering medicine would be a sin.

1856
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:08,840
That guy went to jail.

1857
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:09,920
Yeah.

1858
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,960
Everybody has the right to accept or refuse medical care.

1859
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,560
And so like, I am not going to do that.

1860
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,160
I'm not going to play that game.

1861
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,160
Sure.

1862
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:27,880
But when you are responding to misinformation or cult leadership and that is what is motivating

1863
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,880
you.

1864
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,880
Yeah.

1865
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,880
It's a completely different thing.

1866
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,880
No.

1867
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,880
That is, that is a crime.

1868
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,880
Yeah.

1869
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,880
Yeah.

1870
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,880
Yep.

1871
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,880
No question in my mind.

1872
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:42,840
So that's just, I feel like when I, this is the complicated, like difficult push and

1873
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,640
pull of listening to this show.

1874
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:51,480
It's like, I kind of feel bad about myself because I'll laugh at what's clearly a guy

1875
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:57,240
freaking out and having an emotionally unbalanced day on the 17th and I'll feel bad.

1876
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,240
Yeah.

1877
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,920
And then I'll get to this and I'll be like, I don't feel bad.

1878
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,040
How can, how can he, how can he deserve any consideration?

1879
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,040
No.

1880
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,040
None.

1881
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,120
I, it's just a...

1882
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:16,040
It's difficult to preserve your humanity when faced with such inhumanity.

1883
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:24,920
Like just true psychopathy of, I just, I'm such a narcissist that I can hear this story

1884
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:30,720
that I bear responsibility, at least partially, for the death of this man's wife.

1885
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,200
And I'm just going to tell him that he was so great.

1886
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,280
I have a strong sense that Alex would not have kept his wife at home.

1887
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,360
No, his wife would be in a hospital immediately.

1888
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,360
Very expensive one.

1889
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,360
Oh yeah.

1890
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,360
Yeah.

1891
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,600
No, it's, it's so, it's just such what you see.

1892
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:53,280
And I, you know, you want to provide empathy for this because you are a human being and

1893
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,800
you can't allow yourself to let empathy die.

1894
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,620
It challenges me.

1895
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,620
It's tough.

1896
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:02,600
But when you get past a certain point, it's just like, fuck you.

1897
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,600
It's hard.

1898
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,600
It's hard.

1899
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,600
It's hard.

1900
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,600
Anyway, let's get that...

1901
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,600
For good and forever.

1902
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,640
Let's put that behind us and listen to Alex.

1903
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:18,480
This is not, you belong to the city, but it is Alex doing some bumper music and rambling

1904
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:25,040
about nonsense just to sort of cleanse our palette on the way out of this episode.

1905
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:30,760
This is a little Daft Punk track from the Tron Legacy soundtrack.

1906
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,560
All right, okay.

1907
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:40,600
The grid, a digital frontier.

1908
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:47,640
I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer.

1909
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,320
What did they look like?

1910
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,320
Ships, motorcycles.

1911
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,320
Were the circuits like freeways?

1912
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,320
And then one day I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see.

1913
01:23:53,320 --> 01:24:14,040
And then one day, one day, I got in and you found out it was a off-world demonic inter-spatial

1914
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,040
attack.

1915
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:21,440
Bring down the species and the collaborators were working with Satan against God's plan

1916
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,760
to bring us down.

1917
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:30,720
One day, I got in and when you come at it from that perspective, it all makes sense

1918
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:38,160
and you understand it all and the enemy finally respects you.

1919
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,160
I'm sorry?

1920
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,160
She sees you as an enemy soldier.

1921
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,160
What?

1922
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,640
They don't laugh when we talk about that.

1923
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,360
They look back at us and say, that's right.

1924
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,760
We chose the winner.

1925
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,160
We're going to lose.

1926
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,280
We both laughed.

1927
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,600
I laughed significantly.

1928
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,640
I would argue that I did not just laugh.

1929
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,080
I went for it, buddy.

1930
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,000
Yeah, I guess the enemy respects you once you...

1931
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,840
I really don't think they do.

1932
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,800
I really don't think they do.

1933
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,880
Those three imaginary king globalists that have the same understanding of the plan as

1934
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,680
Alex, they have a lot of respect for him though.

1935
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,920
That's probably true.

1936
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,600
That sounds right.

1937
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,080
Like Achilles and Hector eventually had a respect for each other, although I believe

1938
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,800
that was after Hector was dead.

1939
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,960
But you know, it's just like that.

1940
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:35,040
Yeah, so Ezra Levant comes on the show towards the end of this episode and he's just complaining

1941
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,960
that the US Navy hired researchers at the University of Arkansas to spy on him and his

1942
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,240
website and then somehow somebody sold that report to Justin Trudeau.

1943
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,240
I can't find...

1944
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,240
I'm sorry, what?

1945
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,240
I don't know.

1946
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,240
Okay.

1947
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:51,400
Well, this is more than an article on Rebel Media where the report is referred to as Canada

1948
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,720
Election Cyber Forensics Analysis at the date October 10th, 2019.

1949
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,400
The actual report isn't linked there, and I have no idea if it's real, so I was trying

1950
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,880
to get to the bottom of it and I Googled it, and guess what the first thing that comes

1951
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,720
up if you Google those words is?

1952
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,720
Bullshit?

1953
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:11,160
Is a page where Rebel Media is doing a donor drive called Cyber Intelligence Operation

1954
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,680
Donation using this alleged report as the bait on the hook of a pledge drive.

1955
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:20,000
Quote, unlike the CBC, we don't get a billion dollars a year, so if you can chip in to help

1956
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,040
cover our costs and fight back against the lies, we would appreciate it.

1957
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,840
I don't know if this is real or not, and Ezra Levant is a bigot and a career liar, so I'm

1958
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,840
not even going to pretend to take him seriously until he produces the report.

1959
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:31,840
Yeah.

1960
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,840
I don't care.

1961
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,840
Oh, man.

1962
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,840
But he does say something kind of funny.

1963
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,160
Well, you know what?

1964
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,080
Where's the ACLU?

1965
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:46,600
If it was the Young Turks or Jim Acosta or MSNBC or even Ellen or some of the leftists

1966
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,380
on The View who were spied on, it would be top news.

1967
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,380
You're Canadian.

1968
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,380
Wait.

1969
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:56,240
If it were Ellen, you're Canadian.

1970
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,240
It's the ACLU.

1971
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,720
Where's the ACLU?

1972
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,320
Dan, where is the ACLU?

1973
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,740
I mean that seriously.

1974
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:09,580
Is there a physical location for the ACLU?

1975
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:12,000
He was asking an honest question, Dan.

1976
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,680
I don't know if the ACLU does work with people who aren't protected by American civil liberties.

1977
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:22,680
It's the First Amendment rights of...

1978
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,840
The ACLU isn't in Canada, are they?

1979
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,680
They may, but I just do think that's funny.

1980
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,680
That is very funny.

1981
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,680
Putting them on blast.

1982
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,320
Where is the ACLU?

1983
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:38,600
If Ellen was spied upon to help her get elected Canada's Prime Minister, oh, she'd be pissed.

1984
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:44,800
Probably a coincidence that right now Ezra Levant is in the middle of a defamation trial

1985
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,040
for saying that somebody was involved in a terrorist attack if they weren't involved

1986
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,040
in it.

1987
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,040
Probably a coincidence.

1988
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,040
It doesn't come up.

1989
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,040
I'm surprised by that.

1990
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,040
On Alex's interview.

1991
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,040
Yeah, it doesn't come up.

1992
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,040
It seems like that would be the first thing I would want to talk about.

1993
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,040
Yeah.

1994
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,040
Yeah.

1995
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,040
Get out in front of that thing.

1996
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,040
Yeah.

1997
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,040
Nope.

1998
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,040
He gets for $200,000.

1999
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,000
I think that's a couple of new donors.

2000
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
That'll do it.

2001
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,760
Yeah, he's going to need a lot of new donors.

2002
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,760
Yeah.

2003
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:08,760
Let's see.

2004
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,080
He's being sued.

2005
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,600
According to Chalk's statement in the claim, that's the person who's suing him.

2006
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,600
Sure.

2007
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,960
Levant alleged during his February 25th, 2014 broadcast that Chalk was involved in a shooting

2008
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,080
at an Edmonton nightclub in 1993 when Chalk was 19.

2009
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,600
Chalk was acquitted of the 1993 charges in what he called a case of mistaken identity.

2010
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,640
He vehemently denied any involvement in the shooting, saying he was at his parents' house

2011
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,400
with friends and had absolutely no knowledge of what transpired.

2012
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,920
Yeah, so I don't know.

2013
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,360
I don't know how that trial's going to go.

2014
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,320
I think he's going to win that lawsuit, buddy.

2015
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:46,320
I think there's a reason that legitimate news outlets don't just print the first name they

2016
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,320
can find.

2017
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:51,500
I don't know how that's going to play out, but I do think it's a little bit of maybe

2018
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:57,080
an Alex Jones money bomb type situation that's being... I don't know.

2019
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,960
It'd be funny if he was like, where's the ACLU and they're representing the other guy.

2020
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,040
That would be quite funny.

2021
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,880
I would enjoy that an immense amount.

2022
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,600
That dude's not an... I don't know if he's an American either.

2023
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:14,080
Anyway, this episode's been a little bit of a bummer for me, T to B, top to bottom, but

2024
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,080
it is over now.

2025
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,720
Is that the new way we sign off?

2026
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,720
Yes.

2027
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,720
The episode is over now.

2028
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:26,320
Well, I mean, such high highs of the freak out that got edited out of Alex's own show.

2029
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,320
That's a bad one.

2030
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,240
Again, try an outline.

2031
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,240
One time.

2032
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,360
Quite an amazing thing, too, to see.

2033
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:38,040
There's a point when Alex says shit and I was like, wow, I've got to go find this on

2034
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,040
the...

2035
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,040
Of course.

2036
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,040
It's gone.

2037
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,040
Just gone.

2038
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,040
From the banned on video version.

2039
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,040
Oh, man.

2040
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,040
So he's censoring himself, if you will.

2041
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,040
It got banned from banned.

2042
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:51,240
They cut that whole thing out and put the right video in where the wrong video was put.

2043
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,240
What a bunch of liars.

2044
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,440
Those motherfuckers.

2045
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,440
That's bullshit.

2046
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,440
Did it in post.

2047
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:57,440
I'm furious.

2048
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,440
Yeah.

2049
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,600
So that was the fun.

2050
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,280
And then 18th is so depressing.

2051
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,640
And the other thing is the guests, I just don't care.

2052
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,800
You had Francis Boyle on the first one.

2053
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,800
Sir Francis Boyle.

2054
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,800
Excuse me.

2055
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:18,160
And then you had Duke, Ezra Levant on the other one, and neither of them were people

2056
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,600
I care about much at all.

2057
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,560
I mean, if they're going to bring something to the table that was interesting, maybe,

2058
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,560
but they didn't.

2059
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,560
Yeah.

2060
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,560
And yeah.

2061
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,560
I don't know.

2062
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:34,640
I may, now that we've had two episodes back in the present, I grow weary of it.

2063
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,280
May try and time travel for Monday.

2064
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2065
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,280
There is a little bit of that.

2066
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,280
Yeah, we'll see what happens.

2067
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,280
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back.

2068
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,280
But until then, we have a website.

2069
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,280
We do have a website.

2070
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,280
It's knowledgefight.com.

2071
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,280
Yep.

2072
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,280
We're also on Twitter.

2073
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,280
We are on Twitter.

2074
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,280
It's at knowledge underscore fight and I go to bed Jordan.

2075
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,280
We're also on Facebook.

2076
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,280
We are on Facebook.

2077
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,280
Will you tell us, right?

2078
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,920
If you could, please find a local charity or a bail fund in your area to help out people

2079
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:54,920
doing God's work.

2080
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,920
Yep.

2081
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,920
We'll be back.

2082
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,920
But until then, I'm Neo.

2083
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,920
I'm Leo.

2084
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,920
I'm DZX Clark.

2085
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,920
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2086
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,600
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

2087
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,600
Andy in Kansas.

2088
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,600
You're on the air.

2089
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,600
Thanks for holding.

2090
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,600
Hello, Alex.

2091
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,600
I'm a first time caller.

2092
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,600
I'm a huge fan.

2093
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,600
I love your work.

2094
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:24,280
I love you.
