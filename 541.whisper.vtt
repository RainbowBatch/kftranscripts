00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

I'm Dan.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
I'm Jordan.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
We're a couple dudes.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.400
Let's sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.400
Jordan.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.400
Dan!

01:00.400 --> 01:01.400
Jordan.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.400
Quick question for you.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.400
What's up?

01:03.400 --> 01:04.400
What's your bright spot today?

01:04.400 --> 01:05.400
I got an anti-bright spot.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
Oh, you got an anti-bright spot?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
Yes.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Okay.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Sort of a dark spot, or at least, like, you know, in the cheers and jeers parlance.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
All right, all right.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
This is a jeer.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
This is a jeer.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
But it's also kind of a bright spot because it's me expressing some of my drives towards

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
me.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
I'm Dan.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
I'm Jordan.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.400
We're a couple dudes.

01:17.400 --> 01:26.400
What's your bright spot today?

01:26.400 --> 01:31.400
I had to make a run over to the, uh, the CVS, and I went inside and, uh...

01:31.400 --> 01:33.400
Whoa, is this buzz marketing for CVS?

01:33.400 --> 01:34.400
It's not.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
Okay, good.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.400
Remember, this is jeers.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.400
I saw a new beverage product there.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
Uh-huh.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.400
It was Coca-Cola with coffee.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
No.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Uh-uh.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
No.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
It was my first instinct.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
Nope.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Here's my second instinct.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
Double no.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
Yeah.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.400
I doubled down, and I got it.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
Yes, of course you did.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
I was very excited.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
Of course you did.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.400
It is repulsive.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.400
How could you possibly think that's a good idea?

01:58.400 --> 01:59.400
I don't know.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.900
I've been surprised by things in the past.

02:00.900 --> 02:01.900
Sure, sure.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.200
You know, that black cherry coffee seltzer is really good.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.400
Yeah, that is really good.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.400
Yeah, this one is not.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
No.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.400
This Coke is, uh, disgusting.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.400
No, yeah, that's, that's the worst thing I've ever heard anyone do to coffee.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.400
Yep.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
Bad.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.400
Yeah.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
I thought you were putting some cream in there.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.400
I was thinking about it.

02:17.400 --> 02:22.400
No, and actually, I should be perfectly honest, I bought three varieties of it.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.400
Because they had single cans.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.400
Sure, sure.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.400
So I bought the regular, the caramel, and the vanilla.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.400
Oh, boy.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.400
I haven't tried the other two.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.400
Wait, they were all three coffee, though.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
Coffee with...

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
It's a new line of Coke things.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.400
Oh, my God, these monsters.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
I got all three.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.400
Have we not enough problems already, Dan?

02:39.400 --> 02:41.400
I got all three because I was like, what if they're amazing?

02:41.400 --> 02:45.400
And now I've tried one, and I just, I'm gonna stare at the other two for a while.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.400
No, I'm not gonna, I'm not excited to drink those.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.400
Uh, yeah, well, that could be a bonus episode.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
Yeah, maybe.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.400
Eh, we could do that.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
You hear me be miserable drinking Coke?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.400
That wouldn't bother me too much.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.400
What's your bright spot?

02:57.400 --> 03:07.400
My bright spot, Dan, is that on Saturday, I will be finishing my Final Fantasy VII riff

03:07.400 --> 03:08.400
make project.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.400
Fun!

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
It will be done.

03:10.400 --> 03:16.400
I couldn't do it last night, or Wednesday night, so I'm gonna do a marathon on Saturday.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
I'm almost at the end of the game.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.400
I don't know how long it's gonna take.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
Sure.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.400
But it's gonna start at 11, and it's just gonna go until I finish the game.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.400
And the Wonks can join you over on your Twitch channel?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.400
You betcha.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
You bet.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
You can.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
JB, home, something or other.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
3209.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
You betcha.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.400
Yep.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.400
You got it.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
Uh, yeah, that should be fun.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
Yeah.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
I'm not gonna stop by.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
You're not gonna stop by.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
No, no, no.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
Please, please, let's not get any...

03:39.400 --> 03:40.400
Wait, what time are you...

03:40.400 --> 03:42.400
No, like, maybe they're special guests.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.400
No.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
What time are you gonna start?

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
Probably 11.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
Okay.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Yeah.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.400
If you hear a rapping on your window at about 1130, that's me.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
We'll see.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.400
We'll see what happens.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
It's me, and I'm day drunk.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
Okay.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
Now that might be fun.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
Crashing in through your window.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
I'd be fine with that.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.400
Um, so Jordan, today we got an interesting episode.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.400
We're gonna be talking about Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.400
That is March 17th and 18th, 20...

04:06.400 --> 04:09.400
No, no, no!

04:09.400 --> 04:11.400
Damn it!

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
Damn it!

04:12.400 --> 04:15.400
This was a terrible idea that is only gotten worse.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
I think it's over.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
I think it's over because you technically won.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400
Now I'm too aware.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.400
Yeah.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.400
But you also won.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.400
Yeah.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
The whole thing was you weren't winning.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.400
I would never win.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.400
Yeah, the game got busted by you winning.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.400
Yeah, well, naturally.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
Hold on, what's that?

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
Is somebody at the door?

04:28.400 --> 04:29.400
Oh, no.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.400
Wait, how does this bit go?

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400
I don't know.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
This is how most bits...

04:33.400 --> 04:35.400
That bit is now that we don't know how that bit works.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.400
Yeah, that's fair.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.400
Um, so it's an interesting little bit of time.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
I think there's a couple of very important things that come up.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.400
But actually, I'm kind of shocked by what doesn't come up.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.400
And then we have one of Alex Jones' most spectacular flare-ups.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
Okay.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.400
Blow-ups on air in recent memory.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.400
Okay.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.400
But before we get to today's episode, let's take a little moment and say hello and thank

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
you to some wonks.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
Oh, that's nice.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.400
So first, hi in Seattle.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.400
Thank you so much.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
You are now a policy wonk.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
I'm a policy wonk.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.400
Hello, hi in Seattle.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
Thank you very much.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
H-I-G-H.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.400
H-I-G-O.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
Oh, I was going to say.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
Well, then get some sleep.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
Yeah.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.400
Or if it was H-I in Seattle, that could be like Frasier.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
Yeah.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
Hello, Seattle.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
Hello, Seattle.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
Next, Big Robbie D. Thank you so much.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.400
You are now a policy wonk.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.400
I'm a policy wonk.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.400
Thank you very much, Big Rob.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
Thank you.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.400
Next, Paul Joseph Fartson.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.400
Thank you so much.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
You are now a policy wonk.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
I'm a policy wonk.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.400
Thank you very much, PJ Fs.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.400
And Cassie, thank you so much.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
You are now a policy wonk.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
I'm a policy wonk.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
Thanks, Cassie.

05:36.400 --> 05:41.400
And I'd like to give a happy birthday shout out, because fucking on the last episode,

05:41.400 --> 05:46.400
I said we're going to do this monthly, and then I get a fucking email from somebody who's

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
asking to be a March birthday shout out.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
I was saying at the end of March, we'd do April.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
Oh, my God.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Oh, man.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
We're not going to be able to do this.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.400
No.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
We'll never keep track of this properly.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.400
Now, the bit of this is being unable to do the-

05:59.400 --> 06:01.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:01.400 --> 06:05.400
Let's try and give everybody birthday shout outs, but never actually get to the names.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
This isn't their fault.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
Of course it's not.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.400
I've got no problem with this person, and I hope they have a happy birthday.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.400
Of course.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
But clearly-

06:14.400 --> 06:18.400
For your birthday, we get an existential crisis.

06:18.400 --> 06:22.400
Clearly, I'm not meant to have an email address.

06:22.400 --> 06:29.400
Anyway, happy birthday, and congratulations on becoming a technocrat to our beloved trans-dimensional

06:29.400 --> 06:32.400
chocolate male vitality raptor out in Michigan.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.400
Thank you so much, Dell.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
I'm a policy wonk.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
Crikey, mate.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
That's fantastic.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Have yourself a brew.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
How's your 401k doing, bro?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
Let's just get down to business.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
Why are you pimps so good?

06:48.400 --> 06:50.400
My neck is freakishly large.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
I declare info war on you.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
Thank you so much, Dell.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.400
Yes, thank you very much, Dell.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.400
Beloved trans-dimensional chocolate male vitality rapper and a funky homo sapien.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
How could you not enjoy both of those people?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
Yeah, totally.

07:02.400 --> 07:08.400
So, Jordan, Wednesday and Thursday of this week, I was dreading this.

07:08.400 --> 07:15.400
I was dreading doing the show because I had a sense that possibly Alex would talk about

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
the Atlanta shootings.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.400
Yes.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.400
At the spas in Atlanta, left eight dead.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.400
No interest in doing that.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.400
No, and I thought that would be really complicated because there's a lot of issues to unpack,

07:26.400 --> 07:35.400
you know, both about the anti-sex worker ideas that are possibly motivating of the shooter

07:35.400 --> 07:38.400
and also certainly the violence towards Asian Americans.

07:38.400 --> 07:43.400
Anyone who created Fentanyl the Magic Dragon or whatever can shut the fuck up.

07:43.400 --> 07:48.400
And I thought it would be really difficult with the information that we have available,

07:48.400 --> 07:53.400
but both of those things are things that intersect with Alex's world in a kind of scary way.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.400
Insofar as he is misogynist and anti-Asian.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.400
Yes.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
And I didn't want to deal with it.

07:59.400 --> 08:05.400
And so I was worried and I get into it and he doesn't bring it up at all on Wednesday.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
Not a surprise.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.400
Not a surprise.

08:07.400 --> 08:12.400
He makes a passing reference to being an incel on Thursday, but he doesn't really talk about

08:12.400 --> 08:14.400
this incident at all.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.400
And so if he does in the future, we'll talk about it.

08:17.400 --> 08:23.400
But for now, I mean, my feeling is I'm looking to get more information as it becomes available

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
and I think it's a horrible tragedy.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
Yeah.

08:25.400 --> 08:29.400
And this is how Alex started his show on Wednesday.

08:29.400 --> 08:50.400
So I think that might be a little bit tasteless.

08:50.400 --> 08:56.400
Somebody, somebody tell me that there is, oh, racism against Asians is not high.

08:56.400 --> 09:00.400
Go ahead and tell me that whenever this is just fucking available.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.400
Nobody's stopping this.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.400
Right.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.400
You know?

09:04.400 --> 09:11.400
And even if like, you know, even if anti-Asian sentiment wasn't what predominantly motivated

09:11.400 --> 09:15.400
this shooter, even if that is the case, which I'm not saying is necessarily the case, but

09:15.400 --> 09:20.400
even if that were the case, if you're Alex Jones doing Info Wars, I would think, hey,

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
why don't we put this off?

09:22.400 --> 09:26.400
The next day you're starting your show with a fentanyl, the Chinese dragon, racist ass

09:26.400 --> 09:27.400
character.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
What are you going to say?

09:28.400 --> 09:33.400
He's going to be like, oh, see, the shooter was motivated by misogyny.

09:33.400 --> 09:38.400
So it's totally fine for me to disrespect the victims by being racist.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
Yeah, it's, it's weird.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.400
Yeah.

09:41.400 --> 09:46.400
So Alex starts the show in earnest and he comes in and he's got, he's got some, some

09:46.400 --> 09:47.400
big news.

09:47.400 --> 09:52.400
I do not say this on air for dramatic effect.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.400
I say it because it's the truth.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.400
We've absolutely gone into the zeitgeist.

09:58.400 --> 10:04.400
We are in, for lack of a better word, revelations.

10:04.400 --> 10:10.400
And this morning I was out for a hike and at the blood pump within my brain and I just

10:10.400 --> 10:13.400
had 30 minutes of complete and total clarity.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.400
Is this going to be about wet ass pussy?

10:14.400 --> 10:20.400
And then driving into the office, I recorded about a 20 minute breakdown of what I'm about

10:20.400 --> 10:25.400
to lay out again, but it was very calm how I did it and very cogent.

10:25.400 --> 10:31.400
And so I am going to have that put down to a video file with a few documents and a few

10:31.400 --> 10:33.400
video clips, but I'm going to air it.

10:33.400 --> 10:39.400
I'm going to air it at the bottom of the next hour in about an hour and 25 minutes.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.400
It'll take two segments to air.

10:41.400 --> 10:47.400
And I'm going to talk about it ahead of time, but everything I'm about to say is documented.

10:47.400 --> 10:53.400
So, if you don't catch what he's saying, here's what's going on.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.400
Okay.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
He took a, he took a hike that morning.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.400
Yes.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.400
And he got some clarity up in his head.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.400
Right.

10:58.400 --> 11:03.400
Then driving to the studio on his phone, he recorded a 20 minute breakdown of whatever

11:03.400 --> 11:05.400
vision he got while he was hiking.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.400
Yeah, that sounded like what I was hearing and that made me deeply uncomfortable.

11:08.400 --> 11:13.400
Now he's going to talk about this stuff and then play the report that is the recording

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
of him on his phone.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.400
Right.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.400
Oh God.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.400
So he's got like a 30 minute conference call that he needs to get to.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.400
So he recorded a nice little break for people.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
Yeah, that might be.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.400
That sounds like the most reasonable explanation for this.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.400
Yeah, or he didn't have a guest to eat while that person was on air.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
I need a snack about two hours in.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
I'll play this 20 minute clip.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.400
Yeah.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.400
Um, so anyway, the, the long and short of this, I don't want to, I don't want to spoil

11:39.400 --> 11:46.400
anything for you, but it turns out the globalists are planning, um, a false extinction in 2030,

11:46.400 --> 11:47.400
I think.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.400
Did you need to go on a hike to get there?

11:50.400 --> 11:53.400
I don't know.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.400
I honestly was looking at it and I'm like, that's kind of cute.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.400
Like it's nine years away.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
Sure.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.400
That kind of implies to me that Alex wants to live.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
Yeah, that does sound right.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.400
He's putting it off pretty far into the future before it's like, Alex, come on, man.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.400
He's protecting the game.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.400
Yeah.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.400
For nine years.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
Yeah.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.400
It's not next month.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.400
It's not 2022.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.400
Yeah.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
It's 2030, man.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
Yeah.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.400
He'll be, he'll be probably retired by then.

12:22.400 --> 12:27.400
Well, somebody will hopefully have forced him to retire by then at least.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
That's kind of aspirational.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.400
It's, it's really frustrating to me because he's in a sweet position as far as doomsday

12:33.400 --> 12:37.400
cult leaders go, doomsday cult leaders go, you know, like other doomsday cult leaders,

12:37.400 --> 12:42.400
you can only predict the end of the world a few times and be wrong before people kind

12:42.400 --> 12:44.400
of get the gist here.

12:44.400 --> 12:49.400
We're on, the world is going to end on this date, 2000?

12:49.400 --> 12:50.400
It's happened a lot.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.400
It happens all the time.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.400
But get this.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
What?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.400
It's going to be fake.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
It's going to be a false flag extinction.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.400
I guess that's also comforting?

12:58.400 --> 12:59.400
I guess.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
Okay.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.400
Yeah.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.400
So anyway, that's what the, that's what Alex was calling on his phone to talk about.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.400
Does it matter if the extinction is successful?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.400
You really don't even need a false flag for it, right?

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
Right.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.400
Yep.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.400
Yeah.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.400
Anyway, we'll get to that when we get to it.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.400
The 50 people left are going to be like, yeah, that was definitely the alt-right guys.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
We got him.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.400
So Alex is going to get to that when he gets to it and we'll get to it when he gets to

13:23.400 --> 13:24.400
it.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.400
So he has to talk about that. He has to talk about how he's got high level sources.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.400
Sure.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.400
That give him really in depth, cool.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
Are they at the top of a mountain?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
Oh my God.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
Yes.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.400
And that's why.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.400
That's why he took the hike.

13:34.400 --> 13:39.400
And that's why they have access to such like current important information.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
Naturally.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.400
Because they're radiating at that high, high level frequency.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.400
We just got to go up.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.400
We're now entering the time.

13:47.400 --> 13:52.400
In fact, we have entered the time where everything is just going to be out in the open now.

13:52.400 --> 14:00.400
I have an article right here that a national talk show host sent me minutes before I went

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
live.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
Tucker.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.400
And the reason I mentioned that is not name dropping.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.400
It's to point out that God has put me in the zeitgeist.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.400
It's insane.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.400
I can pick the phone up and call Trump.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
I can pick the phone up and call Tucker Carlson.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.400
I can pick the phone up and call General Flynn.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.400
I can pick the phone up and call Joe Rogan.

14:16.400 --> 14:21.400
I can pick the phone up and call basically anybody that's on the good guy side.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.400
It's just an incredible responsibility.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.400
Real quick, just a point of fact.

14:26.400 --> 14:32.400
That podcast that he did, that flagrant two or whatever the fuck, the one in Miami where

14:32.400 --> 14:33.400
they're fucking wasted.

14:33.400 --> 14:37.400
That is actually video evidence that he can't just call Joe Rogan.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.400
He tries multiple times, but Joe does not pick up.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.400
It feels a little bit like how I can say, you know, I can pick up my phone and tweet

14:44.400 --> 14:47.400
it anybody I want to right now.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.400
Like that's the same level of, sure you have their number, but nobody's responding.

14:51.400 --> 14:56.400
I remember back when I used to produce a comedy show, like we'd have people like Hannibal

14:56.400 --> 15:00.400
Burress or Nick Thune would come through town and I would have their phone numbers because

15:00.400 --> 15:03.400
I booked them on the show and like coordinating when they were going to arrive.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
Yeah.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.400
And I would sometimes be drunk and be like, I have Hannibal's number.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.400
I'm never going to fucking call this guy.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.400
Rude.

15:11.400 --> 15:15.400
I have Dave Attell in my phone from when we worked together.

15:15.400 --> 15:20.400
I'm never ever in a million years going to pretend that I can just call Dave Attell.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.400
That's how it feels with Trump.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
Yeah, exactly.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
Yes.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.400
I was just sent this before I went live.

15:27.400 --> 15:33.400
Transgender activists makes argument for all children to be put on puberty blockers until

15:33.400 --> 15:36.400
they can determine the identity.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
Puberty blockers are toxic.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
They kill a lot of people.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
They cause massive depression.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.400
So imagine we're going to put you into this system that basically sterilizes you if you're

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
a boy.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.160
It makes you closer to a girl.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.600
That's what these monsters are.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
That's their end game.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.600
That's their goal.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.040
And no one's allowed to criticize them because it's a scientific takeover.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.400
So leaving aside a lot of the finer points there.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.220
This was a story from December.

15:57.220 --> 16:01.880
So whoever Alex's cool media source is contacting him right before he got on air might be a

16:01.880 --> 16:03.160
little bit behind the times.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.160
Or maybe they don't exist.

16:04.160 --> 16:09.360
And Alex just recently heard about this this morning, maybe one of his staffers found it.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.400
The headline Alex is reading is word for word.

16:11.400 --> 16:15.880
The headline from an article in the Washington Examiner from December 14th, 2020.

16:15.880 --> 16:20.040
It has to do with something that was tweeted by a YouTuber named Zinnia Jones.

16:20.040 --> 16:24.320
Zinnia was making what essentially amounts to a reducto ad absurdiam argument against

16:24.320 --> 16:28.680
the notion that trans youth were incapable of giving informed consent to take puberty

16:28.680 --> 16:29.880
blockers.

16:29.880 --> 16:34.080
The tweet read, quote, if children cannot consent to puberty blockers, which pause any

16:34.080 --> 16:38.360
permanent changes, even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent

16:38.360 --> 16:42.840
to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional

16:42.840 --> 16:44.760
evaluation whatsoever?

16:44.760 --> 16:48.680
This was followed up with another tweet, quote, an inability to offer informed consent or

16:48.680 --> 16:53.400
understand the long term consequences is actually an argument for putting every single cis and

16:53.400 --> 16:57.000
trans person on puberty blockers until they acquire that ability.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Sure.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.080
What this person was suggesting is pretty clear.

17:00.080 --> 17:05.120
And Zinnia explained this when they were reached for comment by the Washington Examiner, quote,

17:05.120 --> 17:09.200
I was not making an argument that all youth should be given puberty blockers.

17:09.200 --> 17:13.160
This was not an actual proposal, and it's not something I advocate or endorse.

17:13.160 --> 17:17.380
This was an argument that claims of trans youth's unreadiness to give consent to puberty

17:17.380 --> 17:21.360
blockers, if followed consistently, lead to the conclusion that all youth are likewise

17:21.360 --> 17:24.380
not ready for the experience of puberty itself.

17:24.380 --> 17:28.160
Because that conclusion is absurd, again, that was not something that I advocated or

17:28.160 --> 17:29.160
endorsed.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.880
The argument that trans youth can't consent to puberty blockers is faulty.

17:32.880 --> 17:37.240
That makes total sense, and the argument that's being made here is structurally fine.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.960
But the argument isn't advancing that it's good to put all youth on puberty blockers,

17:41.960 --> 17:45.520
as clearly stated in the article that Alex is citing.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.740
It's an argument specifically designed to illustrate a counterexample that shows the

17:48.740 --> 17:51.440
flaw in an already existing argument.

17:51.440 --> 17:56.060
Zinnia's tweets were in response to the United Kingdom Supreme Court decision that, quote,

17:56.060 --> 18:00.080
there will be enormous difficulties in a child under 16 understanding and weighing up this

18:00.080 --> 18:04.920
information and deciding whether to consent to use of puberty blocking medication.

18:04.920 --> 18:09.700
And the tweets really only make sense in light of that context, of that decision.

18:09.700 --> 18:14.840
These tweets put forth what Zinnia, I believe in good faith, contends is an absurd implication

18:14.840 --> 18:17.440
of the logic being used by the UK court.

18:17.440 --> 18:22.020
Unfortunately from a purely logical standpoint, the argument put forth isn't super effective

18:22.020 --> 18:23.360
in this case.

18:23.360 --> 18:27.740
For Zinnia's argument to hold water, it would need to somehow illustrate how the proceeding

18:27.740 --> 18:32.360
of a naturally occurring process and the intervention in that naturally occurring process require

18:32.360 --> 18:34.920
the same level of consent, which is going to be difficult.

18:34.920 --> 18:35.920
Yeah.

18:35.920 --> 18:36.920
Yeah, yeah.

18:36.920 --> 18:42.360
They did, though, I do recall Zinnia saying that she wanted to eat the Irish and that

18:42.360 --> 18:44.600
she did, or they did stand by that.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.080
I know Alex is an expert in Swiftian satire.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.400
They were like, we gotta just eat the fucking Irish, so.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.940
And just to be totally clear, I support trans youth having access to puberty blockers.

18:54.940 --> 18:58.680
The logic of Zinnia's argument just has a hole that could be easily exploited by people

18:58.680 --> 18:59.680
arguing against it.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.680
Of course.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.520
Uh, but otherwise it's alright.

19:02.520 --> 19:07.260
Anyway, Alex is mad about this three months later, and he's opening his show bragging

19:07.260 --> 19:11.120
about how one of his super cool media friends brought it to his attention.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.520
It's tomorrow's news today.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.560
Yeah, I do like hearing about tweets from three months ago.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.560
Yeah.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.400
Those are my favorite news stories.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.280
Also the whole thing there where Alex is saying that puberty blockers were linked to lots

19:22.280 --> 19:26.160
of deaths, that seemed weird to me since that's not my understanding of it at all.

19:26.160 --> 19:30.400
I looked into it and it turns out Alex is passing along, dun dun dun, fake news.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.940
Oh no!

19:31.940 --> 19:36.880
In September 2019, a bunch of right wing Christian sites began posting articles about how a drug

19:36.880 --> 19:41.880
used as a puberty blocker for trans youth called Lupron had been linked to over 6,000

19:41.880 --> 19:42.880
deaths.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.520
This headline was flashy and it led to articles all over right wing media in places like Life

19:46.520 --> 19:48.640
Site News and Daily Wire.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.200
Ben Shapiro retweeted it and the claim went viral all over social media.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.200
Of course.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.760
The drug had been linked to over 6,000 deaths, but the problem is that Lupron is not just

19:57.760 --> 20:00.040
a drug that's given to trans youth.

20:00.040 --> 20:03.880
According to NBC News, quote, the thousands of people who die while taking these drugs

20:03.880 --> 20:08.440
are likely the terminally ill cancer patients who receive hormone blockers to fight hormone

20:08.440 --> 20:11.520
sensitive cancers, like prostate cancer, according to experts.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.000
Oh, well that's hardly fair.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Right.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.920
The underlying FDA data that was used by these blogs to show that there had been 6,370 deaths

20:19.920 --> 20:23.400
over the past 40 years that were patients who were on Lupron.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.960
That's all they were using.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.820
From there, they just assumed that all these patients were trans youth as opposed to terminally

20:28.820 --> 20:33.120
ill cancer patients and decided to create a duplicitous fraudulent anti-trans narrative

20:33.120 --> 20:34.120
out of it.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.240
I would bet anything that Alex just saw this headline back when it was being posted on

20:37.240 --> 20:40.960
social media, he never thought to look into it or understand the matter further because

20:40.960 --> 20:42.240
he's dumb and lazy.

20:42.240 --> 20:47.760
You know, 50 years from now, I bet the Japanese will improve upon it and call it Lupron the

20:47.760 --> 20:50.480
Third.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.480
Come on.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.040
Oh, you don't even get that reference at all, do you?

20:54.040 --> 20:57.160
I don't know if I should pretend I get it or just like...

20:57.160 --> 20:59.000
Okay, Lupron the Third.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.080
So it's based off of ArsÃ¨ne Lupron, the famous French cat burglar.

21:04.080 --> 21:09.840
There was an anime 50 years later in Japan called Lupron the Third.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.840
Forgive me for not knowing my anime and famous French cat burglar history.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.920
Why wouldn't you know that?

21:15.920 --> 21:19.960
Then Miyazaki did Lupron the Third and it was incredible.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.600
I'm sure it is.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.160
It's a hole in my cultural awareness.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.520
Well, don't worry about it.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.420
A few people will get it and they will fucking shit.

21:29.420 --> 21:32.160
The intensity of that look you gave me was really scary.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.680
I knew you weren't going to get it.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.180
I was so mad.

21:35.180 --> 21:36.180
Very scary.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.180
Oh well.

21:37.180 --> 21:41.720
Anyway, Alex is just full of bad information already.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.700
And so, you know, this clip like this kind of is a little funny.

21:45.700 --> 21:49.800
The average Westerner has less attention span than a goldfish.

21:49.800 --> 21:54.400
So they may have a native intelligence, but their subconscious brain and their conscious

21:54.400 --> 21:59.880
brain have basically been merged where they're like jellyfish.

21:59.880 --> 22:05.000
They're in a trance and the sleeper must awaken.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.500
That's why when you tune into NPR or you listen to Politician, they talk very, very slowly

22:12.500 --> 22:19.980
and they talk very, very softly and they don't want anyone on NPR that talks in an excited

22:19.980 --> 22:23.520
voice because what does an excited voice do?

22:23.520 --> 22:24.960
What does that do?

22:24.960 --> 22:26.840
It wakes people up!

22:26.840 --> 22:31.640
I would say that an excited voice like that actually distracts from the glaring holes

22:31.640 --> 22:33.120
and the information being yelled.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.920
Okay, there might be that.

22:34.920 --> 22:41.680
So wait, if NPR gives me a show, I will immediately become the greatest left-wing commentator

22:41.680 --> 22:43.520
there is in Alex's eyes.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.520
I guess.

22:44.520 --> 22:48.720
I mean, I think that there is a, you know, if you go back to stand up, there's a lot

22:48.720 --> 22:52.720
of people who make up for like kind of iffy writing with overperforming.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.680
Yeah, that would be me, Dan.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.800
Literally word for word me.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.800
Yeah.

22:57.800 --> 23:04.580
I think that Alex's performance and his showmanship or whatever is designed in order to make up

23:04.580 --> 23:06.800
for and distract people from the fact that he doesn't know anything.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.360
He's just making all this shit up.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.800
One could argue most people who scream are often doing that.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.800
Yeah.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.800
Yeah.

23:13.800 --> 23:14.800
Yeah.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.800
Lupron.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.800
Lupon the third.

23:17.800 --> 23:21.640
Anyway, this next clip, this is great, man.

23:21.640 --> 23:22.640
This is where I live.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.640
I like people who are happy.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.160
I like it when people are happy.

23:26.160 --> 23:31.880
Even people I dislike, like Alex, I'd rather everyone be happy because then positive vibes

23:31.880 --> 23:33.920
are emanating out into the universe, right?

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
That's good.

23:34.920 --> 23:35.920
Yeah.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.400
That's a good mood because magic happened in his life.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
Okay.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.400
Did he take another hike?

23:40.400 --> 23:41.400
He went on that hike.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.400
Yes.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.400
And he had an idea.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
Right.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
And then listen to what happened.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.400
The staff, the crew, they're amazing.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.400
All right.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.720
We've all had dreams that come true.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.200
We've all had nightmares that come true.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.520
We've all had predictions and they come true.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.760
We've all said, hey, let's visit grandma.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.760
None of this is true.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.760
Phone rings, grandma just died.

23:56.760 --> 24:01.440
That actually happened with me.

24:01.440 --> 24:06.720
This morning I cut an audio recording dealing with the globalist plan to have a staged end

24:06.720 --> 24:09.280
of the world event on or around 2030.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.280
And I'm totally sure of it.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.280
I have the proof.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.280
I'll show you coming up.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.280
He doesn't.

24:13.280 --> 24:18.800
And when I thought about it, I thought, I'll just put the graphic of the satellite footage

24:18.800 --> 24:21.760
of the earth from orbit over that.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.120
And I said, I'm going to have them do that as the background today.

24:25.120 --> 24:32.280
And I swear on everything I am on my heart, on my soul, that when I walked into this building

24:32.280 --> 24:38.560
this morning, I looked up and they were punching up this background of the satellite of the

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
earth.

24:39.560 --> 24:43.040
We probably do this twice a year.

24:43.040 --> 24:51.000
And I walked in here intending to do the headline globalist plan, the controlled end of the

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
world by 2030.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.960
And I told my wife, as I walked out of the house, I said, I have just received the biggest

24:56.960 --> 24:59.840
download I've ever gotten on the hike I had just done.

24:59.840 --> 25:00.840
She said, what do you mean?

25:00.840 --> 25:07.800
And I said, they're going to stage the end of the world in 2030.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.800
And she didn't think I was crazy because she's seen me do this all the time.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.800
Okay.

25:11.800 --> 25:12.800
That's why, that's why.

25:12.800 --> 25:18.400
Honey, I took a hike and it turns out that God downloaded into my brain that they're

25:18.400 --> 25:21.400
going to fake the end of the world in 2030.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.800
All right.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.640
Could you pick up something to eat on the way home?

25:25.640 --> 25:27.020
Would you like a little road sake?

25:27.020 --> 25:28.720
You want to stop by Costco?

25:28.720 --> 25:30.060
We're out of cereal.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.060
Come on, Alex.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.060
Yeah.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.060
That's a little bit silly.

25:33.060 --> 25:36.640
I want to hear him read the pale blue dot speech over that graphic.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.840
Actually, that's what it is.

25:40.840 --> 25:45.320
Everyone you've ever known lived on that pale blue dot.

25:45.320 --> 25:48.200
And the globalist got a fake on extinction in 2030.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.200
Exactly.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.200
Yeah.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.200
Okay.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.200
That's how he was hiking.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.000
And now he's decided this is the greatest thing in the world.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
He figured out how he wanted to visualize it.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.680
He comes into the studio, staff is already fucking with that image.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.680
Oh man.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.680
How is this?

26:01.680 --> 26:02.680
Is synchronicity.

26:02.680 --> 26:03.680
Blows your mind.

26:03.680 --> 26:04.680
This is magic.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.680
This is the universe, man.

26:05.680 --> 26:06.680
Blows your mind.

26:06.680 --> 26:07.840
Holy shit.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.280
I don't care.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.280
Wow.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.280
You're cold hearted, man.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.280
I am cold hearted.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.280
Wow.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.280
I am cold hearted.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.280
Sometimes.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.680
To coincidences of all kinds.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.920
You know, they say that, you know, you can never really know the people around you.

26:19.920 --> 26:20.920
And I feel that now.

26:20.920 --> 26:21.920
Yeah, clearly.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.560
I cannot believe this has not penetrated your stone heart.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.560
Dark.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.560
Dark.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.160
I don't think ghosts are real.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.160
What else do you got?

26:29.160 --> 26:30.280
What else do you got, Alex?

26:30.280 --> 26:31.640
I'm not doing dreams.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.640
All right.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.720
Well, put a pin in that for a little bit later.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.600
Oh, we're going to keep doing dreams.

26:36.600 --> 26:41.480
So in this next clip, we get to Alex responding to some big news.

26:41.480 --> 26:46.440
And that is that Trump has come out in favor of vaccines for COVID-19.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.440
Yes.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
Yeah.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.440
This has got to be a false flag.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.440
Oh boy.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.680
So maybe a breaking point.

26:52.680 --> 26:57.980
But I knew Trump had globalist enemies and I knew that they hated him and I wanted to

26:57.980 --> 26:59.520
fix things and I wanted to believe in it.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.680
And I don't think Trump himself is a bad person.

27:01.680 --> 27:07.280
I don't know people that know him very well, but he's limited and he's not this big giant

27:07.280 --> 27:09.280
40 chess guy that everybody says he is.

27:09.280 --> 27:14.320
He just goes with what he thinks is right and also is way too optimistic and buys too

27:14.320 --> 27:18.800
much into science when it's globalist science and you know, all the stuff they gave him

27:18.800 --> 27:23.480
the Randezevir and the rest of it and the gene therapies made him feel so great.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.380
He's now on board with everything they did.

27:25.380 --> 27:31.640
He has come out and gone on Fox News and endorsed these killer vaccines.

27:31.640 --> 27:38.080
And after you've seen 25 countries in Europe ban it now and hundreds around the world and

27:38.080 --> 27:42.280
all the deaths and all the problems that the only way to get through to Trump is to get

27:42.280 --> 27:43.280
in his face about this.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.560
I'm going to reach out to Trump.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.200
I'm going to get a hold of him if I need to.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.520
And I'm going to communicate with him here on air and I'm going to call the sun up.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.960
Yeah, this sounds like you have a lot of access.

27:52.960 --> 27:53.960
Yeah.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.600
So Alex has been mad.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.160
Trump just got all these drugs from people that made him feel good.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.160
Yeah.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.160
He's like vaccines man.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.160
Come on.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.800
I have a hard time believing that this conversation didn't happen where somebody is like, Trump,

28:05.800 --> 28:07.500
we need you to endorse the vaccine.

28:07.500 --> 28:08.560
It can save lives.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.560
You have a lot of influence over people.

28:10.560 --> 28:16.140
A lot of Republican men, almost half of them refuse to get vaccinated and him saying, I

28:16.140 --> 28:17.140
can't do that.

28:17.140 --> 28:19.480
I'm going to piss off my followers who want to kill people.

28:19.480 --> 28:23.320
And then the other person coming back, here's a hundred grand and I'm saying deal.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.320
Of course.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.320
Yeah.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.320
So he was on Fox.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.320
I am for sale.

28:27.320 --> 28:31.840
He was on Fox and Friends and he said, yeah, people should get the vaccines, your choice.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
He got it.

28:32.840 --> 28:33.840
Yeah.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.720
And whatever, too little, too late.

28:35.720 --> 28:40.020
But what I think is going on more is that I think Alex might realize that like Trump's

28:40.020 --> 28:46.920
a dead end at this point and this would be a really good time to just be like, all right,

28:46.920 --> 28:47.920
I don't care anymore.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.920
Bail.

28:48.920 --> 28:49.920
Bail.

28:49.920 --> 28:50.920
And so Alex has decided-

28:50.920 --> 28:51.920
This is free money.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.920
He's decided that unless Trump cuts it out with his vaccine stuff, that it's over.

28:54.920 --> 28:55.920
Okay.

28:55.920 --> 28:59.520
And I'm going to communicate with him here on air and I'm going to call his son up and

28:59.520 --> 29:02.500
I'm just going to say, here's the evidence.

29:02.500 --> 29:07.120
And if you continue to say, this is wonderful and this is good and there's quote, no problems,

29:07.120 --> 29:09.420
you're a bad guy and I'm going to be against you.

29:09.420 --> 29:10.420
So that's that.

29:10.420 --> 29:12.720
I understand he wanted to reopen the economy.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.280
He thought, okay, if it's just a vaccine, you know, you shouldn't be made to take any

29:16.280 --> 29:20.440
dead, but if you want to get it, I'm like, well, that's still bad, but I understand what

29:20.440 --> 29:21.440
he's doing.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.360
I don't agree with it, but I see his perspective.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.720
Now he's like, everybody needs to get it.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.720
Uh oh.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.600
So yeah, I think he sees an off ramp.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.800
There's no hope of Trump really ever becoming president again.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.200
There's no power there really.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.480
The movement or whatever is so like splintered-

29:38.480 --> 29:40.400
Fractured and hates each other.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.400
Yeah.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.400
Yeah.

29:42.400 --> 29:46.800
There is a possibility of coalescing again, but it's not going to be around Trump.

29:46.800 --> 29:51.400
And Trump Jr. is a fucking, uh, not option.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.360
He's a non-runner, non-candidate.

29:53.360 --> 29:57.840
I think they're running into the problem that a lot of would be monarchs run into, which

29:57.840 --> 30:00.640
is that their children are stupid.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.840
Incredibly so.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.840
Right.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.920
And that's why, that's okay if you're already a monarch.

30:04.920 --> 30:05.920
Exactly.

30:05.920 --> 30:10.280
Because then you can't stop the power going down.

30:10.280 --> 30:13.320
You gotta go straight Caesar on this guy.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.320
Yeah.

30:14.320 --> 30:19.200
And so, you know, I think that Trump or Alex realizes that there's not a whole lot of value

30:19.200 --> 30:20.840
in maintaining Trump.

30:20.840 --> 30:26.620
There's value in maintaining like, I didn't make a huge mistake for the last two years,

30:26.620 --> 30:28.760
but this is a line too far.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
You know?

30:29.760 --> 30:30.760
I think we may see that.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
Yeah.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.540
And he can carve out a- unfortunately I wouldn't be surprised if he could carve out a better

30:35.540 --> 30:41.540
space for him moving forward by being the, oh, it's the crazy guy who's also anti-Trump

30:41.540 --> 30:42.540
now.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.540
Like, yeah.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.320
I mean, he could have this whole time, probably.

30:45.320 --> 30:49.760
But also, like, one of the things I think is interesting is he takes calls eventually

30:49.760 --> 30:53.300
on this show and the next show, and like, no one cares.

30:53.300 --> 30:58.000
No one is like, hey, what, what, uh, how you're talking bad about Trump.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Yeah.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
They've all moved on too.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.520
He was just an avatar for their hatred and desire to kill, and that apparently can exist

31:05.520 --> 31:06.520
without him.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.960
So they realize they don't need him.

31:07.960 --> 31:08.960
Yep.

31:08.960 --> 31:09.960
They'll create another.

31:09.960 --> 31:10.960
Yep.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.240
Anyway, Alex doesn't care that Trump patted him on the head.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.440
Come back to the Alex Jones show.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.440
All right.

31:16.440 --> 31:21.920
I'm going to talk about Trump and really for me, what will become the last straw.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.160
It doesn't mean that I won't say he's good on topics.

31:24.160 --> 31:28.920
We should take over the Republican party, uh, and we need his energy.

31:28.920 --> 31:33.680
And boy, he called up and congratulated my wife and we got married and all that great

31:33.680 --> 31:34.680
stuff.

31:34.680 --> 31:39.640
And boy, patted me on the head and told me I'm the greatest broadcaster and I'm going

31:39.640 --> 31:41.960
to take over for rush Limbaugh and how wonderful.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.360
I don't care about all that.

31:43.360 --> 31:49.280
I only kept that clip because Alex, uh, is definitely not mad that Dan Bongino took over.

31:49.280 --> 31:54.000
Not at all mad about that very insulting thing to him specifically.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.080
Not even a little bit mad at all about Dan Bongino taking the spot that he considers

32:00.080 --> 32:01.080
rightfully is.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.080
I think it's great.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.080
Yeah.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.080
I think, you know what?

32:04.080 --> 32:07.360
All these radio stations played me instead of rush anyway.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.360
Yeah.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.120
He's definitely not mad.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.120
Yeah.

32:12.120 --> 32:16.320
Um, so, uh, Alex has been, you know how like his media contacts reach out to him and told

32:16.320 --> 32:18.280
them about this three month old tweet.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.280
Yes.

32:19.280 --> 32:24.040
Alex also has some information he's been trying to get out to his media contacts and what

32:24.040 --> 32:25.040
do you know?

32:25.040 --> 32:27.240
It's over a year old.

32:27.240 --> 32:32.080
And I'm going to just tell you something here that when I say I don't feel worthy to cover

32:32.080 --> 32:36.000
this, we cover so much huge news continually.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.200
That's just critical for me and you and all of us to continually constantly realize how

32:40.200 --> 32:44.880
huge this is huge because it's easy to get live on air and cover a lot of stuff cause

32:44.880 --> 32:46.120
it's live.

32:46.120 --> 32:51.840
But if I produce slick reports on this, it would get 10 times the views online would

32:51.840 --> 32:55.320
actually change the world.

32:55.320 --> 32:56.360
And an example is this.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.000
I was given this over a month ago.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
I didn't know about this.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.280
I learned stuff all the time.

33:01.280 --> 33:08.360
I finally have read, cause it took me a month off and on spending 30 minutes here, 20 minutes

33:08.360 --> 33:13.680
there, 10 minutes here to read this entire folder.

33:13.680 --> 33:18.880
And I've asked, uh, Greg Reese, one of our best researchers to do a report on this.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.640
I've asked everybody else that has time, you know, stay up here late, whatever everyone

33:22.640 --> 33:27.680
should do different reports on this because every time I read this, cause I probably read

33:27.680 --> 33:29.160
this whole stack three times.

33:29.160 --> 33:33.360
I probably looked at it 20 times, but just scanned through it.

33:33.360 --> 33:39.760
Every time I look at this, I find new stuff because you know, you get mentally exhausted

33:39.760 --> 33:42.880
when you're reading scientific documents and this is a small portion.

33:42.880 --> 33:48.720
This is probably 150 pages or more on Crimson Contagion.

33:48.720 --> 33:56.000
If you get mentally exhausted reading scientific papers, maybe you shouldn't be reading scientific

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
papers.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.760
I don't, I don't know, um, Crimson Contagion we talked about in the last episode was covered

34:01.760 --> 34:07.480
in a New York times, uh, article a year ago, quite old, Alex found out about a month ago

34:07.480 --> 34:12.240
and has leisurely read through some stuff and now he's ready to, he doesn't actually

34:12.240 --> 34:13.240
really get down into it.

34:13.240 --> 34:18.080
He just complains, uh, about how his media friends don't want to cover it on Crimson

34:18.080 --> 34:19.080
Contagion.

34:19.080 --> 34:22.840
I did 10 minutes with Owen Schroyer yesterday.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.920
That's in the Owen Schroyer section of Bandau video.

34:24.920 --> 34:29.800
Um, and that's the first boil down I've done, but it is to say bombshell, we ought to call

34:29.800 --> 34:33.680
this show bombshell because mainstream media is always bombshell, this bombshell, that

34:33.680 --> 34:37.680
global exclusive, this global system that I don't want to be the global exclusive.

34:37.680 --> 34:38.680
You're not.

34:38.680 --> 34:43.120
I've actually sent this to the main talk show hosts in the country.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
All of them.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.120
Tucker.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.120
I guess one of them is dead now.

34:46.120 --> 34:50.200
Can't do that, but I've sent it to the other two guys and they're sending me stuff.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.200
They're like, I'm busy.

34:51.200 --> 34:53.960
You, you cover it and I, and I get it.

34:53.960 --> 34:57.360
This is unbelievable.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.000
I think that they're saying I'm busy.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.600
You cover it because they know it came out a year ago.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.600
So funny.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.600
Right?

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
I mean, that has to be the explanation.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.040
They know like this isn't news.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.040
This is nothing.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.040
No, you've got nothing.

35:08.040 --> 35:12.400
We should call our show bombshell as we report after the New York Times.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.400
Wow.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.780
And you know, what's interesting too is I would bet that Tucker would have enough sense

35:16.780 --> 35:21.080
to realize that like, you shouldn't be talking about this.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.760
This looks bad for Trump.

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
Yeah.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.760
This looks real bad.

35:24.760 --> 35:29.040
And in order to spin it, you kind of need to exist within like a fully realized conspiracy

35:29.040 --> 35:30.040
world.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.840
You can't have a foot in reality.

35:31.840 --> 35:38.560
You have to create a complete, uh, isolated space where you can pull off a, actually it

35:38.560 --> 35:40.080
was the globalist plan.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.080
Yeah.

35:41.080 --> 35:45.240
And, and Tucker is trying to pretend he still lives in the shared reality we all live in.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.240
Exactly.

35:46.240 --> 35:49.280
Whereas Alex just like, he gave up on that illusion a long time ago.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.720
Um, so yeah, we got to agenda 21.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.000
You remember that?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Sure.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Agenda 2030 maybe.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Yeah.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Now there's agenda 2035.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Ooh, I like that.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.320
And so there are servants of Satan and there are servants of the living God that built

36:03.320 --> 36:05.720
this planet and gave us life.

36:05.720 --> 36:06.720
And then there's the rest.

36:06.720 --> 36:10.520
Next hour, I'm going to expose the next level of the enemy operation.

36:10.520 --> 36:16.880
We were amongst the first to expose agenda 20, 21.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.000
Whoops.

36:20.000 --> 36:26.720
And now we're exposing agenda 2030.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.240
But what comes after agenda 2030?

36:29.240 --> 36:30.240
Deltron 3030.

36:30.240 --> 36:36.080
For the first time ever, you're going to hear next hour about agenda 2035.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.080
Featuring Dan the automator.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.080
Yeah.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.080
I was going to say.

36:39.080 --> 36:45.040
If they have their way, there will be no humans as we are known today, left on earth in 14

36:45.040 --> 36:46.040
years.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.040
No more humans.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.040
No more humans?

36:48.040 --> 36:49.040
Nope.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.040
Dan?

36:50.040 --> 36:51.040
Yep.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.760
Um, it's, it's complete nonsense.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.600
And he just like, I love how he just makes up a new agenda name.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.600
Yeah, sure.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
Why not?

36:57.600 --> 36:58.600
Agenda 2030.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.600
Agenda 2035.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.400
I think agenda 2030 is actually real.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.440
I think that is the name of like a summit that they had.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.440
Yeah, sure.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
Fine.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.440
But agenda 2035 I think is entirely Alex's own creation.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.440
I like that.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.560
He can create words and he can create agendas.

37:13.560 --> 37:22.400
So one of his agendas is, um, you know, I've never watched any of the Freddy Krueger movies.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
Sure.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
Have you watched those movies?

37:24.400 --> 37:26.800
Uh, I watched A Nightmare on Elm Street or two.

37:26.800 --> 37:29.380
I know that they take place in the realm of dreams.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.140
They do and you shouldn't fuck.

37:32.140 --> 37:34.520
If you fuck in a nightmare, Freddy going to get you?

37:34.520 --> 37:35.520
Freddy's going to get you.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.120
So that's kind of, you know, it's in the, it's in the realm of dreams and nightmares

37:38.120 --> 37:40.360
and Alex lives in that space too a lot.

37:40.360 --> 37:45.920
You know, he has these visions when he's on hikes, um, and apparently I would think that

37:45.920 --> 37:52.300
a lot of the stuff that he does, whether for good or bad, may be driven by subconscious

37:52.300 --> 37:54.720
things that he might not understand.

37:54.720 --> 37:58.380
Oh, I would argue that all subconscious things he does not understand.

37:58.380 --> 38:01.600
So listen to this clip with that context in mind.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
Okay.

38:02.600 --> 38:07.480
This is about how if you get an abortion, uh, then you'll be fine with killing old people

38:07.480 --> 38:08.480
and stuff.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.480
Sure.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.480
Sure.

38:10.480 --> 38:14.560
And then Alex starts talking about his own history of paying for abortions and he says

38:14.560 --> 38:17.420
some stuff that makes me really uncomfortable.

38:17.420 --> 38:22.660
And so Trump coming out and doing this for me is him crossing the Rubicon because this

38:22.660 --> 38:27.480
is 2021 and there's a major pushback against this, but see, I predicted this.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.480
It wasn't hard to predict.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.680
It's how they work.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.120
They say it's not a baby.

38:33.120 --> 38:37.480
It's not a human Roe v Wade, 1973, tens of millions of women get an abortion.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.760
Now they're going to defend it because they never want to admit they killed their baby.

38:39.760 --> 38:44.560
They never want to admit it doubles or chances of uterine cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian

38:44.560 --> 38:46.520
cancer, or more, more than double.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.160
And some of the studies, they just know it's good.

38:49.160 --> 38:53.200
And because they commit the crime against God, instead of repenting, you harden your

38:53.200 --> 38:55.620
heart, you double down.

38:55.620 --> 38:56.920
You don't get God to forgive you.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.480
And now you're a servant of evil.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.920
And now you're going to support euthanizing old people.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.760
Now you're going to support keeping babies alive and sell their organs because once you're

39:02.760 --> 39:07.440
on that track, you never look, look, folks, I'm not a hypocrite.

39:07.440 --> 39:12.640
Why in God's name would you admit you paid for abortion?

39:12.640 --> 39:19.040
That's horrible because I did it and I repented and I swore to God when I was like 17 years

39:19.040 --> 39:23.440
old and refound God, that I would not do that again.

39:23.440 --> 39:27.000
And I went years without even dating because man, I can look at a woman getting pregnant

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
back then.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
I'm still fertile.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.520
And, and, and then I got a pregnant, married her, hadn't had three children with her.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.320
And then that's the way, you know, I will never do that again.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.040
And I repented and I had that God forgave me.

39:39.040 --> 39:42.520
And I, it's like King David did all these horrible things, but he didn't mean it.

39:42.520 --> 39:43.600
He, his heart was real.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.600
God judge his heart.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.600
He was forgiven.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.600
And it was so good.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.600
You've had an abortion.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.600
He wrote the book.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.600
Repent.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.040
Kind of painted himself in a positive light.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.040
I still have nightmares seeing the children though.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.760
God still shows me the children as they grow up and how beautiful they were.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.920
And I had a big nightmare the other night.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.520
Like I was holding this little baby in my hand.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.520
I was like about an inch big.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
It was my son.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
It was this incredible son.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.880
And this demonic wolf just came and said, you killed your child.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.880
Just ate it right in front of me.

40:07.880 --> 40:08.880
And I couldn't do anything.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.640
And Satan looked right at me with those red eyes and said, I got your ass, but you don't

40:12.640 --> 40:16.280
because Christ has delivered me and cleansed me of what I did.

40:16.280 --> 40:21.160
And as long as I don't back down now, I will be with Christ forever.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.400
And so Satan get behind me.

40:22.400 --> 40:27.160
I don't listen to a damn thing you say, but that's what this comes down to.

40:27.160 --> 40:30.160
Ladies and gentlemen, that is what this comes down to.

40:30.160 --> 40:40.000
So he was holding his tadpole of a fetus, not even that, still borderline and ovum in

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
and of itself.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.200
And then the devil ate it.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.760
And the devil ate it in front of him.

40:45.760 --> 40:50.000
And Alex said he has nightmares that God shows him these kids.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.600
So apparently God is sending these nightmares where the devil eats his child in front of

40:54.600 --> 40:55.600
him.

40:55.600 --> 40:59.080
And somehow Alex is like, yeah, God's forgiven me, I've repented, everything's fine.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.040
But God's torturing me in my dreams.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.920
That's how you keep Alex in line, okay?

41:03.920 --> 41:09.680
If you're God, you've chosen Alex to defeat the devil and you can't let the chosen one

41:09.680 --> 41:10.960
stray from the path.

41:10.960 --> 41:16.660
So you got to send him constant, terrifying, threatening nightmares to make sure he knows

41:16.660 --> 41:17.720
you love him.

41:17.720 --> 41:23.400
I look at this from a more, I don't know, materialist perspective, or like reality based.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.720
Al, I can see your stone heart right now.

41:25.720 --> 41:33.420
I kind of see this as a thing where Alex may feel tremendous amounts of guilt about things

41:33.420 --> 41:39.520
that he, and his opposition to abortion and the demonicness of it, maybe a lot of it might

41:39.520 --> 41:42.680
be a byproduct of how terrible he feels about himself.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.420
Sure, sure.

41:44.420 --> 41:48.220
More importantly, this is what I want to say.

41:48.220 --> 41:49.640
This doesn't belong on air.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.640
No.

41:50.640 --> 41:51.640
This is not cool.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.640
No.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.640
This isn't cool.

41:53.640 --> 41:54.640
This is bad.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.640
This isn't good for a news show.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.160
This isn't good for an editorial show.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.920
This isn't good as analysis of anything.

41:59.920 --> 42:00.920
Real bad.

42:00.920 --> 42:05.600
It maybe has a place as like mid-range televangelist.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.600
I could see that.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.600
Yeah.

42:07.600 --> 42:13.080
I could see like local televangelist, not like one of the all national ones.

42:13.080 --> 42:16.800
He doesn't have a private jet, but he can afford a tour bus.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.360
Somewhere under the Jack Van Impe level.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.360
Exactly.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.360
Yeah.

42:21.360 --> 42:26.200
I find this to be really bizarre that anybody would listen to this and just be like, man,

42:26.200 --> 42:27.440
this guy gets it.

42:27.440 --> 42:32.440
He's talking on air, rambling about how he has visions at night of his babies that he

42:32.440 --> 42:35.320
paid for abortions, and then the devil eats them.

42:35.320 --> 42:39.120
And Alex gets mad, and ugh, God.

42:39.120 --> 42:43.840
It's hard to take a man seriously who says we've got big news to get into, and then later

42:43.840 --> 42:48.520
on goes to be like, I had a dream, and let me tell it to you in exhausting detail.

42:48.520 --> 42:53.280
Yeah, it was the devil eating my unborn child to punish me or taunt me, and God welcomed

42:53.280 --> 42:56.200
that dream into my head as some kind of a...

42:56.200 --> 42:57.200
Okay.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.200
Yeah.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.200
All right.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.200
Yeah.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.200
Oh boy.

43:01.200 --> 43:05.280
So I really got this fucking weird sense about him.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.280
That is nuts.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.280
And this is nuts.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.280
Back home, Alex Jones, your host.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.280
Coming up in the next two segments.

43:10.280 --> 43:18.920
That key report on the globalist plan for a controlled end of the world in or around

43:18.920 --> 43:20.360
the year 2030.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.640
Learn what agenda 2035 is exclusively.

43:22.640 --> 43:25.640
And I'm as serious as a heart attack.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.640
People figure that out now.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.320
People used to hear me say this stuff 25 years ago.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.320
It's all come true.

43:29.320 --> 43:32.960
I've studied their documents, all their information, fused it together.

43:32.960 --> 43:39.140
I have a lot of contacts, a lot of sources, but I'm now above basically any of those sources

43:39.140 --> 43:41.200
except for a few of the top globalist.

43:41.200 --> 43:45.840
I'm one of the only people outside the top globalist leadership that actually have all

43:45.840 --> 43:49.740
the contacts and all the info to see their complete master plan.

43:49.740 --> 43:51.120
And again, I'm not bragging.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.140
It's true.

43:52.140 --> 43:55.720
And I literally cannot tell you more at that point.

43:55.720 --> 43:56.720
Okay.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.720
Okay.

43:57.720 --> 44:02.680
So only Alex and like King globalists actually know what's going on.

44:02.680 --> 44:05.200
Nobody else in the world could even see through.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.200
I'm listening to this.

44:06.200 --> 44:08.080
I'm like, this is rank narcissism.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.080
Oh yeah.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.080
No.

44:10.080 --> 44:13.360
This is a display of somebody having a breakdown of some kind.

44:13.360 --> 44:17.320
This is not a well person existing in space.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.320
No.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.320
No.

44:19.320 --> 44:27.880
Generally speaking as a bipolar one, delusions of grandeur are usually a big sign that stuff

44:27.880 --> 44:29.520
is going off.

44:29.520 --> 44:33.320
He has delusions of grandeur on a semi-regular basis.

44:33.320 --> 44:37.320
I don't even know if I would categorize it as like feeling manic because like there's

44:37.320 --> 44:42.280
also this, this like, no, it'd be malignant narcissism.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.280
Yeah.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.080
It's a flare up though.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.080
It's bad.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.080
Yeah.

44:47.080 --> 44:52.220
And truly, if I'm the globalist and I know this, you got to kill him.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.300
I mean, there's no big deal.

44:54.300 --> 44:58.880
It's not like whatever backlash you might get from killing him is going to be worse

44:58.880 --> 45:01.720
than having him know your entire plan.

45:01.720 --> 45:02.720
Yeah.

45:02.720 --> 45:03.720
Yeah.

45:03.720 --> 45:06.440
I mean like everybody, I mean the backlash isn't going to be worse.

45:06.440 --> 45:07.440
Yeah.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.440
Yeah.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.440
Well, I mean like think about it.

45:09.440 --> 45:14.920
The conspiracy world still believes that like the man killed Bill Cooper and it didn't unravel

45:14.920 --> 45:15.920
any globalist plot.

45:15.920 --> 45:17.800
Didn't even really bother anybody that much at all.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.800
No.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.280
They just say, hey, Bill Cooper was right and you know that because they killed him.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.280
Yeah, exactly.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.800
That is just what would happen if the globalist killed Alex and if he's the only person who

45:25.800 --> 45:30.560
can see through everything and understand everything, it's not like anybody else.

45:30.560 --> 45:31.560
Yeah.

45:31.560 --> 45:36.320
And if I'm a globalist, even if I'm a pacifist globalist, you know, like I don't want to

45:36.320 --> 45:39.200
solve my problems via murder.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.040
This is a special circumstance.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.240
You just got to do it.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.240
Yeah.

45:43.240 --> 45:48.240
I think that what you've done is provide a pretty decent argument for why there are no

45:48.240 --> 45:52.840
globalists because if they were as demonic and as cutthroat and have been working on

45:52.840 --> 45:57.920
a thousand year plan, like Alex seems to think, yeah, they would have literally no reason

45:57.920 --> 45:58.920
to hold back.

45:58.920 --> 45:59.920
Totally.

45:59.920 --> 46:03.040
And even if you have the protection of God, the God you've got protection from is the

46:03.040 --> 46:04.800
one sending you weird demon nightmares.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.800
Yeah.

46:05.800 --> 46:06.800
That's a weird kid.

46:06.800 --> 46:07.800
No big deal.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.800
Yeah.

46:08.800 --> 46:09.800
Yeah.

46:09.800 --> 46:13.120
So Alex gets down to business doing what he does best, which is reading headlines and

46:13.120 --> 46:15.640
just saying, whoa, gotcha.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.640
About them.

46:16.640 --> 46:17.640
Yeah.

46:17.640 --> 46:18.640
No analysis at all.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.640
Okay.

46:19.640 --> 46:25.440
Where should I start this segment ahead of this big report?

46:25.440 --> 46:26.700
Let's do this.

46:26.700 --> 46:31.080
Let's go ahead and just read headlines in the vaccine stack from today.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.080
Overhead shot, please.

46:33.080 --> 46:36.560
The crew found another article I didn't know of the New York times, right when they were

46:36.560 --> 46:41.280
launching the COVID attack a year and three months ago, it's the end of humanity.

46:41.280 --> 46:45.240
And maybe it's for the best New York times says, get rid of humans.

46:45.240 --> 46:46.240
They're evil.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.240
That's their religion.

46:47.240 --> 46:50.880
This headline that Alex is reading on air is real, but it's in the New York times book

46:50.880 --> 46:52.600
review section.

46:52.600 --> 46:58.080
It's the title of a review of a novel novel by Guido Marcelli titled Despatio HG, which

46:58.080 --> 47:00.440
was published in 1977.

47:00.440 --> 47:04.360
The plot has to do with a suicidal man realizing that all the rest of the humanity has disappeared

47:04.360 --> 47:06.280
and he's the last human around.

47:06.280 --> 47:10.380
In humanity's absence, he waxes philosophical and also notices that nature is taking over

47:10.380 --> 47:12.420
what was previously cities.

47:12.420 --> 47:18.040
From the review quote, beneath the philosophical welter, a new world glitters with pre-lapsarian

47:18.040 --> 47:23.880
strangeness, gangs of plump cats raid administrative lobbies, chamois goats prance along train

47:23.880 --> 47:29.360
tracks, ibixes graze hotel lawns, a sort of one man utopia seems possible.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.460
The phonies and strivers are gone.

47:31.460 --> 47:36.400
The city's churches, banks, and military installations lie abandoned, an index of empire's ruin.

47:36.400 --> 47:40.480
This is a work of fiction that was reviewed in the New York times book section and Alex

47:40.480 --> 47:44.220
is trying to pass it off as some kind of news article or opinion piece.

47:44.220 --> 47:47.680
This is beyond the kind of sloppiness that would get anyone fired anywhere else than

47:47.680 --> 47:48.800
Infowars.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.520
What the fuck is wrong with this shit?

47:50.520 --> 47:54.080
Man, I've got a breaking news story for him.

47:54.080 --> 48:01.600
This comes from the 90s and there was a piece published where a guy specifically said that

48:01.600 --> 48:04.760
it was the end of the world as he knew it.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.760
He felt fine.

48:05.760 --> 48:06.760
And he felt fine.

48:06.760 --> 48:07.760
I remember that.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.760
Which is fucked up.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.580
You know, when you think about it, it's the end of the world and this guy feels fine.

48:11.580 --> 48:12.960
Do you know what that means?

48:12.960 --> 48:14.680
Top globalist, Dan.

48:14.680 --> 48:15.680
Undoubtedly.

48:15.680 --> 48:16.680
Yeah.

48:16.680 --> 48:20.980
I think he also predicted like, uh, uh, uh, there was like an eye of a hurricane and then

48:20.980 --> 48:24.680
he listened to himself churn.

48:24.680 --> 48:26.320
I can't remember the lyrics to that song.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.320
Don't even worry.

48:27.320 --> 48:28.320
It's been a long time.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.320
It's been a long time.

48:29.320 --> 48:34.640
So Jordan, uh, he's been teasing this, this, uh, report, uh, that he recorded in his car

48:34.640 --> 48:40.520
on the way to the studio, which you were so shallow about his, his vision while he was

48:40.520 --> 48:41.520
hiking.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.520
Yes.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.400
Um, so he's been teasing it a lot.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.400
We keep hearing it.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.400
Right.

48:46.400 --> 48:50.180
And so after this, after reading a slew of headlines, he goes to break.

48:50.180 --> 48:51.880
How far into the episode are we?

48:51.880 --> 48:53.680
Mm, I'm not sure.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.680
Maybe two hours.

48:54.680 --> 48:55.680
Couple hours?

48:55.680 --> 48:56.680
Yeah.

48:56.680 --> 48:57.680
About halfway through?

48:57.680 --> 48:58.680
About lunchtime.

48:58.680 --> 48:59.680
So he's getting about hungry.

48:59.680 --> 49:00.680
Yeah.

49:00.680 --> 49:01.680
Okay.

49:01.680 --> 49:02.680
Oh, so he goes to eat lunch and I actually do know that he does that because he says

49:02.680 --> 49:03.680
that.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.680
Okay, good.

49:04.680 --> 49:08.280
So he goes and they play a special report and as they're playing it, I'm listening to

49:08.280 --> 49:09.280
it.

49:09.280 --> 49:14.640
I'm like, this doesn't sound like what he was describing about, uh, agenda 2035 or any

49:14.640 --> 49:15.640
of that stuff.

49:15.640 --> 49:16.640
Is it quiet and cogent?

49:16.640 --> 49:19.760
No, it's just an info or a special report.

49:19.760 --> 49:23.720
So it, like it goes to commercial and then it comes back, mic down for this.

49:23.720 --> 49:24.720
Okay.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.520
This is a amazing freak out.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.520
Okay.

49:27.520 --> 49:32.240
That I will actually tell you is edited out of the version of this that appears on band.video.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.240
They cut this out.

49:33.240 --> 49:34.240
All right.

49:34.240 --> 49:39.320
There's a lot going on around here at the office and I know you as a listener are focused.

49:39.320 --> 49:40.320
That's fine.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.320
I appreciate that.

49:41.320 --> 49:45.440
You heard me say we're going to air this 2035 report when we come back and I just went off

49:45.440 --> 49:49.120
and had lunch, was getting ready for the report to come on and I saw something else come on

49:49.120 --> 49:50.120
while I was eating lunch.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.480
I was like, holy hell, what's that?

49:51.480 --> 49:54.560
And so I ran back in there and they're like, oh, we didn't know you want to air this report.

49:54.560 --> 49:58.600
So, so that was not a tactic to say coming back 2035.

49:58.600 --> 50:02.220
And so you, the whole show, I'm like saying, it's coming up, it's coming up.

50:02.220 --> 50:06.640
That wasn't a tactic to then, you know, leave you there in the lurch with what we just aired.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.640
It's great.

50:07.640 --> 50:11.180
Everything I do, I shoot in writing from now on, I should have a little computer that puts

50:11.180 --> 50:14.200
a print out for the military does that.

50:14.200 --> 50:17.500
And then it's like a buzz and I can just, cause Cruz, great Cruz, great.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.600
Maybe I should just quit.

50:18.600 --> 50:22.480
Maybe that seriously, I'm thinking about, I've kind of done my mission, haven't I?

50:22.480 --> 50:28.280
Maybe I should just walk out of here and they do a better job and never see me again because

50:28.280 --> 50:33.320
I can either cancel Dr. Francis Boyle coming on to talk about how this is a massive crime

50:33.320 --> 50:37.840
against humanity, a biological weapons attack on humanity and the master plan and what they're

50:37.840 --> 50:38.840
planning and what they're doing.

50:38.840 --> 50:43.600
I had him for an hour, but I also said, I'm going to air this report because I came in

50:43.600 --> 50:47.460
this morning and I said, you got till 1230 to get this report ready and add graphics

50:47.460 --> 50:48.880
to it because we're going to air this.

50:48.880 --> 50:52.360
And then I said, here's the articles I want at 1230 to put over this, this thing we're

50:52.360 --> 50:53.360
going to air.

50:53.360 --> 50:57.920
And then I promoted it and I promoted it and I promoted it and I promoted it and I'm not

50:57.920 --> 50:58.920
even bitching.

50:58.920 --> 51:02.240
I'm trying to understand why I'm the worst communicator.

51:02.240 --> 51:06.680
Worse, do a better job.

51:06.680 --> 51:14.240
Get your ass together now.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.240
I'm serious.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.240
I suck.

51:16.240 --> 51:27.200
I can't get shit in the fricking killing everybody and everybody's in a trance.

51:27.200 --> 51:32.720
All right, let's go to rebroadcast for a while.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.760
We'll see if I can boil on.

51:34.760 --> 51:35.760
I'm serious, man.

51:35.760 --> 51:39.200
I'm two inches from walking out here forever.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.200
Can't do this anymore, man.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.200
We're in a damn war.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.200
They're murdering everybody.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.200
It's funny.

51:43.200 --> 51:51.560
Well, I don't think it's funny here.

51:51.560 --> 51:53.880
Let's hear governor Newsome.

51:53.880 --> 51:54.880
Let's hear Trump one more time.

51:54.880 --> 51:56.320
Tell us how great the vaccines are.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.720
Oh boy, man.

51:57.720 --> 52:00.440
So that sound you heard was him slapping himself.

52:00.440 --> 52:01.440
Yeah.

52:01.440 --> 52:02.440
Yeah.

52:02.440 --> 52:08.040
I just like, this is at a certain point, this isn't a show anymore.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.680
This is a guy breaking down.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.680
Yeah.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.720
I feel bad laughing about it, but I hate him.

52:12.720 --> 52:13.800
And it's kind of funny.

52:13.800 --> 52:14.800
It's hilarious.

52:14.800 --> 52:15.800
Yeah.

52:15.800 --> 52:23.160
Also, did it just occur to you to write out a fucking script or something, an outline?

52:23.160 --> 52:24.160
Right.

52:24.160 --> 52:27.960
Oh, that's what the military, no, that's what all good shows do.

52:27.960 --> 52:28.960
Yeah.

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
Yeah.

52:29.960 --> 52:30.960
That's called like producing.

52:30.960 --> 52:31.960
Yeah.

52:31.960 --> 52:32.960
It's called producing a show.

52:32.960 --> 52:33.960
Yeah.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.400
And so he has to give a little bit of an apology, obviously.

52:35.400 --> 52:36.400
Obviously.

52:36.400 --> 52:39.560
And he explains that, you know, maybe this is on him.

52:39.560 --> 52:44.040
And yes, that was a real freak out on air earlier because it's normal when world government

52:44.040 --> 52:48.320
is coming in and setting up global passports and basically forced inoculations and doing

52:48.320 --> 52:51.400
it to newborn homeless babies.

52:51.400 --> 52:53.400
And I'm not mad at the crew.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.280
I wasn't clear about airing that report, I guess, to them.

52:56.280 --> 53:00.480
And I want to boil for a whole hour, but I will air that report because it only fits

53:00.480 --> 53:02.480
the fifth, fourth of this segment.

53:02.480 --> 53:07.040
And then you've got John Rappaport coming on and that'll be really memed earlier of

53:07.040 --> 53:09.040
me slapped myself in the face.

53:09.040 --> 53:10.040
But I am mad at myself.

53:10.040 --> 53:11.040
I wish I did a better job.

53:11.040 --> 53:12.040
Yeah, me too.

53:12.040 --> 53:18.280
I, man, I just love this as a bookend because the episode begins with him talking about

53:18.280 --> 53:22.280
how great it was that the crew psychically knew the video that he wanted to play.

53:22.280 --> 53:23.280
Yep.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.280
Very beautiful.

53:24.280 --> 53:27.000
He didn't even tell them he wanted to play.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
You know what, Dan?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.240
I'm going to tell you this right now.

53:30.240 --> 53:33.120
I'm going to tell you this right now.

53:33.120 --> 53:35.000
My stone cold heart.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Yep.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Not wrong.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.560
He said it on the show that we're premiering this report at a certain time.

53:40.560 --> 53:41.560
Right.

53:41.560 --> 53:45.640
And I guess the producers aren't listening to the show to get that report ready.

53:45.640 --> 53:51.760
I suppose maybe we should have talked about this before the show started.

53:51.760 --> 53:52.760
It's pretty remarkable.

53:52.760 --> 53:53.760
Yeah.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.760
I love it though.

53:54.760 --> 53:55.760
Bananas.

53:55.760 --> 53:56.760
Yep.

53:56.760 --> 54:01.120
So he has Francis Boyle on and I don't care anymore about that guy.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.120
Yeah.

54:02.120 --> 54:05.120
Because, you know, you have this whole thing where it's like, okay, for months we're talking

54:05.120 --> 54:10.960
about how the coronavirus itself is a bioweapon that Fauci made in this lab and now we're

54:10.960 --> 54:14.640
going to be doing the vaccine as a bioweapon that Fauci made.

54:14.640 --> 54:15.640
Yeah.

54:15.640 --> 54:16.640
I'm tired.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.640
Yeah.

54:17.640 --> 54:18.640
This is boring.

54:18.640 --> 54:19.640
Francis Doyle frustrates me.

54:19.640 --> 54:20.640
Boyle.

54:20.640 --> 54:21.640
Boyle.

54:21.640 --> 54:22.640
Apologies.

54:22.640 --> 54:28.320
Frustrates me because if you are named Francis Boyle, I assume you have been knighted.

54:28.320 --> 54:32.880
I don't know why, but if your name is Francis Boyle, it better be Sir Francis Boyle.

54:32.880 --> 54:34.400
Probably because Arthur Conan Doyle?

54:34.400 --> 54:35.400
Probably.

54:35.400 --> 54:36.400
Yeah.

54:36.400 --> 54:37.400
Probably.

54:37.400 --> 54:38.400
But it does sound right.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.400
It kind of does.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.400
It does sound right.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.400
Yeah.

54:41.400 --> 54:45.560
So he makes the, what I'm going to call the Larry Nichols mistake and that is that he

54:45.560 --> 54:51.280
gives Alex permission to give out his phone number on the website to help info warriors

54:51.280 --> 54:59.600
with legal advice or to assist their lawyers because he's not licensed to practice in one

54:59.600 --> 55:00.600
state.

55:00.600 --> 55:03.560
But he'll advise their lawyers on how to help them not get vaccinated.

55:03.560 --> 55:04.560
Good work.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.560
I don't care.

55:05.560 --> 55:06.560
Good work.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.560
Stupid Francis Boyle.

55:07.560 --> 55:08.560
Yup.

55:08.560 --> 55:11.600
Anyway, we jump to the 18th now because that interview goes and I thought it would be funny

55:11.600 --> 55:17.160
not to cover his report that he had from his car because it's a zero.

55:17.160 --> 55:18.160
Yeah.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
That sounds right.

55:19.160 --> 55:23.820
And there are honestly more pressing issues like this that Alex gets into at the beginning

55:23.820 --> 55:26.000
of his March 18th show.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.080
And all over the place, the leaders of the LGBT movements keep getting arrested for having

55:31.080 --> 55:36.840
sex with 10 year olds and 11 year olds because the truth is it wasn't about gay marriage.

55:36.840 --> 55:42.200
It was always about sex with your children because it's a satanic ritual to drain off

55:42.200 --> 55:47.120
their energy, to drain off their innocence and drain off their future.

55:47.120 --> 55:50.680
The only thing they like better is chopping your children up with a meat cleaver while

55:50.680 --> 55:51.680
they rape them.

55:51.680 --> 55:55.160
And I'm sorry to have to tell you that, but that's what the big boys do.

55:55.160 --> 55:59.520
So this is a kind of moment that you might describe as a mask off a situation.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.520
Yeah.

56:00.520 --> 56:03.660
He doesn't pretend all that he wants that he's a libertarian and that he doesn't care

56:03.660 --> 56:05.080
what people do in their bedroom.

56:05.080 --> 56:10.240
But underneath all that belief is this, which is the classical trope of homophobic rhetoric.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
Yep.

56:11.240 --> 56:15.400
To put this in context, Alex has found a story about a judge in Wisconsin named Brett Blom,

56:15.400 --> 56:19.420
who was arrested on suspicion of uploading child pornography to websites.

56:19.420 --> 56:23.620
He apparently was a family court judge and had formerly been the president of an organization

56:23.620 --> 56:28.080
called Cream City Foundation, which is a philanthropic organization advocating for members of the

56:28.080 --> 56:30.480
LGBTQ plus community.

56:30.480 --> 56:33.960
And in the past, that foundation had sponsored some drag queen story hour events.

56:33.960 --> 56:38.120
So naturally this is being presented in right wing media as this guy being the head of drag

56:38.120 --> 56:39.720
queen story hour.

56:39.720 --> 56:42.660
What Alex is doing is engaging in selective coverage.

56:42.660 --> 56:46.460
He makes a big deal out of every time that someone in a group of people he wants to attack

56:46.460 --> 56:50.700
gets arrested for a horrible crime and he ignores the other instances where the perpetrator

56:50.700 --> 56:54.560
is someone who's a member of a group that he doesn't want to portray as evil.

56:54.560 --> 56:57.640
When there's a school shooting, it's just an individual doing a terrible thing.

56:57.640 --> 57:01.880
And in those cases, Alex fully understands how bad it can be to engage in collective

57:01.880 --> 57:04.440
blame for individual actions.

57:04.440 --> 57:07.820
Most of his career is based on yelling about how gun owners will be blamed for things like

57:07.820 --> 57:09.680
Sandy Hook or the Las Vegas shooting.

57:09.680 --> 57:12.840
You have to resist that or else you get guns taken.

57:12.840 --> 57:16.720
But when you get right down to it, Alex does the far worse version of ascribing collective

57:16.720 --> 57:21.440
blame for the actions of individuals because he's doing it to malign and attack historically

57:21.440 --> 57:23.720
marginalized groups of people.

57:23.720 --> 57:27.680
Any immigrant committing a crime becomes proof that immigrants are all criminals and killers.

57:27.680 --> 57:32.440
The crimes of any gay person becomes proof that the LGBTQ rights movement is secretly

57:32.440 --> 57:34.800
about trying to have sex with kids.

57:34.800 --> 57:39.080
I'm certain most of the listeners don't need this spelled out, but this is profoundly dangerous

57:39.080 --> 57:43.460
because what it achieves is coupling the perception of criminality with an entire group of people

57:43.460 --> 57:46.880
based on the actions of an individual who's a member of that group.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.560
And this is just unacceptable.

57:48.560 --> 57:51.040
No, that's, that's just so fucked.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.040
Yeah.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.400
It's just so fucked.

57:54.400 --> 57:57.320
Ah, God.

57:57.320 --> 57:58.720
It just doesn't end.

57:58.720 --> 57:59.920
It just never ends.

57:59.920 --> 58:06.780
No matter how much fucking violence we see on a daily basis, it is still a man out there

58:06.780 --> 58:10.620
trying to get people attacked.

58:10.620 --> 58:12.480
And it's just so fucked.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.480
Yep.

58:13.480 --> 58:14.480
Ugh.

58:14.480 --> 58:18.700
So, um, we're not going to dwell too much on that, uh, because like a lot of that does

58:18.700 --> 58:24.660
surround like a lot of the sort of gross stuff that Alex, uh, I don't, I don't, uh, respect

58:24.660 --> 58:29.220
him to handle and I don't want to replay on our show, but I felt that that rose to a level

58:29.220 --> 58:35.780
of like, okay, Alex is saying that the sort of LGBTQ rights movement and the push for

58:35.780 --> 58:39.940
gay marriage was actually secretly about trying to have sex with kids.

58:39.940 --> 58:45.760
And I think a moment like that does deserve a place on our show because it reveals something

58:45.760 --> 58:51.100
that's under the surface of his, his, his, his worldview, his, his beliefs, and that's

58:51.100 --> 58:52.100
fucked up.

58:52.100 --> 58:54.600
It's a, he's, that's, that's where he's at.

58:54.600 --> 58:55.600
Yep.

58:55.600 --> 58:56.600
Yep.

58:56.600 --> 59:02.600
And it's a, it's even more explicit than whenever he was like LGBTQP or whatever it was where

59:02.600 --> 59:04.480
he was trying to add that in there.

59:04.480 --> 59:08.600
And it's just, it's just, yep.

59:08.600 --> 59:09.600
Hate him.

59:09.600 --> 59:10.600
Yep.

59:10.600 --> 59:11.600
I hate him.

59:11.600 --> 59:12.600
Yeah.

59:12.600 --> 59:17.920
Alex is mad that, uh, Biden has said some tough words about Putin.

59:17.920 --> 59:18.920
Sure.

59:18.920 --> 59:20.280
Sure, sure, sure.

59:20.280 --> 59:25.080
And I get the sense from listening to this episode, March 18th, that there's a, there's

59:25.080 --> 59:28.640
a sense that Alex loves Putin.

59:28.640 --> 59:33.320
Real pro the Monarch that he wishes would take over the United States.

59:33.320 --> 59:38.440
I think he wishes Trump was more like Bolsonaro or Putin, quite frankly.

59:38.440 --> 59:41.400
And I think he would rather one of them invade the United States.

59:41.400 --> 59:46.320
He wanted a God King strong man and instead he got a God King grifter.

59:46.320 --> 59:47.760
He got a front man for the mob.

59:47.760 --> 59:48.760
Yeah, exactly.

59:48.760 --> 59:54.260
And so now he's like, Oh, look at what could have been, we could have had a 30 year monstrosity

59:54.260 --> 59:55.800
of a Russian rule.

59:55.800 --> 59:56.800
Great.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.120
And so I think he's going back to that.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.120
Cool.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:04.680
And so there he is up there not knowing what planet he's on and he's on national TV saying

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:12.840
that Russia is going to pay soon and that they're going to be coming after him and that

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.920
we're going to kill her with no soul.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:20.720
And that's why Putin then said, you actually need to look in the mirror, but let's talk

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.080
about what Putin has done.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:28.180
What Putin's really up to Putin slashed the Russian defense budget in the last eight years

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:32.160
over and over again, he pulled troops out of all these different places.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.160
He launched a national organic drives and they want to supply the world organic food

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:42.960
and with cleaner fossil fuels, they have a program to promote marriage and Christianity

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.200
and they are decrying the Carnegie foundation, the Ford foundation, Rockefeller foundation,

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.520
the Soros foundations, and are saying they want to post human world and that Russia is

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.120
not for it.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.280
And so the globalists are very, very upset because they had Russia for 80 plus years

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.880
in their demonic clutches.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.960
It's so funny to me because like last weekend I was watching Alex's documentaries for some

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.960
prep on some stuff and I watched terror storm, I believe it was in terror storm.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.720
They kind of blend together cause they're very repetitive, but he was talking about

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.440
how he had proven that Putin bombed those apartment buildings.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.440
Yeah.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.440
Yeah.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440
Well, I mean it's not hard.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440
I know.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.540
But then like on the, on the Y2K episode that he did, he was talking about how Putin looks

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.540
like a demon.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.720
He's going to seize power or I just, I don't know.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720
It's weird.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.720
It's weird.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.200
That doesn't, it doesn't mean anything.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.720
It's just wherever the wind blows with my prejudices today.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.720
Yep.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:45.440
And then so long as you stick within the relative boundaries of those prejudices, I'll support

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.520
you forever.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:51.320
But if you break away, like say you support vaccines, then you're fucking done.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320
Yeah.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.600
And I think that he recognizes that Putin is a leader that would protect the things

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.520
that are important to him, which is sort of heteronormative, white, masculine-based society.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.080
I mean, consider the treatment of the LGBTQ people in fucking Russia.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.760
Yeah, of course.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:15.360
So Alex, I like it when he gets a little heady.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360
But I like this even more.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:25.440
If you read the Sumerian text, or the Egyptian hieroglyphs, or the Aztec hieroglyphs, or

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:32.280
the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, it's a bunch of translations from 2000 plus years ago from

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.720
things 4,000, 5,000 years old.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.560
It tells the same story.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.920
We go to India, they have 6,000 year old hieroglyphs.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:49.320
China, 6,000 year old stone carvings that tell the same story.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:54.640
A story we'll talk about here in just one moment.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.520
The story of Jesus.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.280
But first, let's talk about keeping the broadcast on the air.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.640
I want to thank you all for your support.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.640
It's a symbiotic relationship.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.560
You get great products at the same time, but it takes a lot of money to run this operation.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.640
We have to have our own infrastructure, our own crews.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.640
I love it.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.000
I feel like he slapped me in the face three times.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.160
All societies over the course of all history have told the same story, and I will explain

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.160
it to you after.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.680
Let's talk about money real quick, because I need it.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.480
That's the real story that's been told over and over again throughout history.

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.080
So Alex does a really, really long plug.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.480
Fairly long plug.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.200
I don't even know what's long anymore.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.120
Listening to his show, my radar is skewed.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.320
Time is meaningless.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:44.240
But he has a bit of a plug, and then he gets into what I think maybe is what the Mesopotamians

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240
were all about.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240
Okay.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.800
All right, let me do this, because I can't in five minutes or six minutes do it justice

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.800
in this segment.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:59.080
But when I start the next hour, I'm going to get into humanoid and what that means and

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:03.880
how many times I've told you about this, and I want to be very, very clear.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.380
I didn't predict this.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:12.060
They admitted to producing humanoids 50 years ago, 50 years ago.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.560
Right about 50 years ago, humanoids were already created, and by the way, humanoids were taken

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.560
to term.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.560
50 years ago?

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.300
There are humanoids, quite a few of them.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.280
We don't know the actual numbers, but a lot of governments worked on them.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.600
So when you see movies in the 80s about replicants, they already have them, but they're not supermen.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.940
Most of them are mentally retarded, have horrible genetic disorders, and are just in hellish

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.940
situations.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.920
Yeah, so we already, of course, know about the fish people with sad human eyes.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.360
Yes, naturally.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.400
And then now we have tons of replicants walking around.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.040
Uh, yeah.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.040
Apparently.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.040
Why?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.440
I don't know.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.980
I was going to take this seriously.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:58.960
This has to do with more stories about advancements that are being made in replacement organ kind

01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960
of technologies.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.960
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.480
Uh, I was going to take it seriously, but then he said this, and I'm like, I'm out.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:10.520
And here's the promise that Joe Biden and Ted Turner and Bill Gates have been given

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.000
by the little nasty dudes giving them this technology.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
You might have heard of them.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.240
The Bible calls them demons, not of this world, not very friendly.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:26.520
They're being promised life extension, but they first got to kill us and test on us.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:33.280
And the truth is these torture us and mutate us and do horrible things to us because they

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.200
know what we grow into and what we do.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.640
We're kept pure and come together as a species.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.280
But that is not the case.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:45.620
This is actually a giant genetic war on the planet and we've been set up for this.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:48.240
So I just think you should get ready for that.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:54.440
If there's a story about some scientific breakthrough or some kind of scientific story, just some

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.880
story that's going on, I find that interesting.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:02.640
But I don't care to talk about it realistically when it's being presented to me as part of

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.320
a plot where Joe Biden is going to get life extension technology, which was promised by

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320
a demon.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320
Right.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:16.320
Well, they're nasty dudes, called demons in the Bible, but they're otherworldly.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.060
They're just nasty dudes.

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:24.320
Are you a nasty enough dude to extend the president's life is a question that I believe

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.320
video games asked.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.680
I certainly am not.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.960
Yeah, I just don't...

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:36.040
Once this is the realm we're in, any real conversation doesn't matter.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:43.280
Once it's aliens or demons, nah buddy, I'm out.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:49.480
Also anytime he says pure, I don't want him to expand upon that.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480
We all know.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.160
It's better if he leaves it alone.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.720
Stay away from the...

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.760
He shouldn't be allowed to say the word pure.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.880
It comes off his lips poorly.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.880
It doesn't sound good.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.880
No.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.880
This is pure OJ.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.880
What does that mean?

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.880
Is it white inside?

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.880
What do you want?

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.960
But in terms of the purity that he's talking about, I think he means fully human.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960
I think he does.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.960
Although I don't disagree with you.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.960
No, he does.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.960
He does.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.960
I believe so.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960
Yeah.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.680
People in his community have an unhealthy relationship with the term pure.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680
Yes.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.680
But I think he's talking about all humans, not humanoids.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.680
Right.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:29.680
So at this point in the show, Alex goes to calls, and this is one of the more uncomfortable

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.320
and unpleasant set of calls that he's taken, because it has to do with the vaccine.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.280
It's all Harrison Smith calling in?

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.280
Oh, no.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.680
That would at least...

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.640
At least that wouldn't be this...

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.640
This is depressing.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.640
I think this could get people killed.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.880
Oh, that's not good.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880
Yeah.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.840
Because they're talking about the vaccine stuff.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.920
And Alex has some bad medical advice, and then he also just is acting weird with these

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920
people.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920
He's one caller.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:57.680
He calls in, and he's talking about how his dad got the vaccine and then died.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.360
And Alex's response is a little weird.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:07.120
He was in and out, and he knew that's what did it.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.120
Yeah.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.880
God almighty, Ralph, who do you blame?

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.760
I would blame Bill Gates and the media.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.520
People say, oh, all these famous sports stars that died, they deserved it.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.680
No, they did it.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.680
They said, I want to protect people.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.080
They were tough guys.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.640
They did it because they were lied to.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.740
They were actually heroes.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:28.000
Your dad, I believe, meant well and was a hero at the end of the day.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.720
But what about the people that did this on purpose, brother?

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.720
Yeah.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.720
Bill Gates and the globalists.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.600
And I would love to meet Bill Gates.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.160
I'll tell you that.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160
That's weird.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.840
That's a weird response to have when someone's telling you this story about their dad passing

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.920
away fairly recently for you to ask, who do you blame?

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:50.440
We have a term, literally very, very old term.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440
Yeah.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.560
For the thing that he is asking the man to do, and we say it in a bad context.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.560
What's that?

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.680
It's called a scapegoat, Dan.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.160
Who do you blame is not a good question ever.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.280
No, it's definitely not.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280
It's rude too.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280
Yeah.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.720
I don't think that caller took it as rude, but it is.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.160
Who do you want me to kill is another answer for it.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.920
Your dad was murdered.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920
Who do you blame?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:22.360
Well, the thing is, it's bizarre and it's pointless to any real conversation that you

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.240
want to have that would have public value, but it's important to understand this element

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.760
of why this is exactly what Alex would ask, because this is an intensely painful story

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.760
if it's true.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.880
I'm not sure it's just somebody calling into Alex's show, but assuming that it is real,

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.640
that's fucking super hard.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.280
Dude lost his dad recently, and even if the guy's in poor health, that's still really

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280
hard.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280
Yeah.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.840
The idea is to take feelings like the one this caller is experiencing and translate

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:54.160
them into feelings of anger and hate directed at the people Alex has decided are his enemies.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:01.960
Now, he's talking specifically about Bill Gates and what have you, but make no mistake,

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:09.800
this exact sort of transmutation of pain into hate and anger is exactly what happens towards

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.720
the marginalized communities that Alex attacks and demonizes.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.600
It's exactly the same.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.600
It's witch shit.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600
Yeah.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.600
It is witch shit.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600
Do you blame the witches?

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.600
Of course it's the witches.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.600
It stopped raining.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.600
Do you blame the witch?

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.840
No, that's God.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.760
The demons make it rain and God makes it sunny.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760
Duh.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760
Okay.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760
God, I hate people.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.760
Yeah.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:38.920
Alex gets another call, and this guy was saying that his dad got a shot and then maybe had

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.920
some indications that he might have prostate cancer.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.920
Here's how this goes.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:52.560
So my dad is a medical doctor and he had the second round of the vaccine and now he just

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.360
received word that his PSA levels and his prostate are high, which obviously are an

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.920
indication of potential cancer, so now he has to have a biopsy on his prostate.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.960
Well, they actually said that, sir.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.960
They said when you...

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.440
So did he take the Pfizer or Moderna?

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.400
I want to say Pfizer, but I'm not 100% sure on that.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.680
Yeah, it's the mRNA that anything that's already precancerous makes it basically go cancerous.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680
They admit that.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680
Wow.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.680
So now they want a biopsy of his prostate.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.880
Can he show them the literature saying that it makes hormone-based tissues swell up and

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.160
that they should not do any biopsies for six months?

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.800
Oh, I guess I was not aware of that.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.640
I mean, I've tried to send him videos and stuff.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.640
He just...

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:45.760
Yeah, guys, type in, doctors say don't be alarmed after mRNA vaccine if your glands,

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.080
uterus, prostate swell up.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.440
Yeah, that's what it does, sir.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440
Okay.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.760
Whether or not COVID-19 vaccines can cause the side effect of gland swelling, this is

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.080
so irresponsible of Alex.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.480
If this caller's dad, who is a doctor, has reason to suspect he may have prostate cancer,

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.320
he needs to take appropriate steps to make sure one way or another, because the key to

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.640
treatment is early detection.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.500
Alex's advice for him to avoid getting a biopsy and just assume it's probably a side effect

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:17.560
of the vaccine, even though the caller can't even remember which vaccine his dad got, that

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.780
could get people hurt.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:24.280
Alex is misrepresenting a recent article from the Cleveland Clinic titled, quote, don't

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.240
be alarmed by this COVID-19 vaccine side effect that could be confused with breast cancer.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:33.280
This deals with possible swelling of the lymph nodes under your arm as a side effect of the

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.400
COVID-19 vaccine, which is relevant because that's also a sign of breast cancer.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.560
This has nothing to do with prostate swelling and Alex should be immediately taken off air

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.240
for offering this reckless medical advice to his audience and to his caller.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.440
To be clear, this caller is probably going to be fine.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.060
His dad seems to not believe this bullshit and he's a doctor, so I would imagine he's

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.720
taking appropriate actions to protect his own health.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.480
My son sent me YouTube videos and I'm a doctor.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.100
I think I'm gonna get a biopsy.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:05.560
The problem is with listeners who hear this and think Alex knows anything, what if one

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.520
of them has a possible cancer symptom that they decide to overlook because Alex told

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.600
them it's just a vaccine side effect?

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.320
Legitimately, that has the potential to get people hurt.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:22.600
If you have, God forbid, some kind of swelling or some kind of a symptom of cancer outside

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.240
of, even if it is the lymph nodes in your arm, you should probably make sure and go

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.480
talk to a doctor.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.340
But if it's in some other area and you hear Alex being like, oh, we got all the literature,

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:36.760
you shouldn't get a biopsy for six months, that six months could be critical.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.160
It's fucked up.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.880
This is one of the instances of me being like very much, there should be a consequence for

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.880
this.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.880
Yeah.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.040
If there's a consequence for telling people to drink bleach, there should be a consequence

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:56.720
for telling people not to get a medical treatment or not to do, yeah, no, that's...

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:57.720
It's outrageous.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.720
Yeah.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.600
That is, it is just as bad to say like, hey, here's a cure for your problem as it is to

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.160
say, don't seek out medical attention because you should listen to me.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.560
Yeah, you're fine.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.560
Exactly.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.560
Yeah, that's fucked.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.560
Yeah.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.560
Yeah.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.440
So this next caller, this person actually kind of tickled me with their voice.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.000
I enjoy this guy's voice.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Okay.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.080
Hey Alex, what's up man?

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.480
Man, I'm just watching the new Holocaust, brother.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480
I hear you, man.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.600
Hey man, I can't believe I'm talking to you.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.600
Hold on.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.360
I've been listening to you since I was six.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.360
That depressed me.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.360
Oh boy.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.920
I like him calling him man over and over again.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:37.920
Yeah, that is nice.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920
That's kind of...

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.920
Hey man.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.920
I like his little twang.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.920
He's doing all right.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.920
Hey man, what's going on Alex?

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.920
Hey buddy.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.920
Yeah.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:45.920
I like it.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.920
Listening since he was six.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:47.920
No, that's not good.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.240
You can't understand things at six.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:57.080
The kind of topics that Alex is covering, you have no ability to gauge or to measure

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.000
... holy shit.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.840
At a time whenever everyone is telling you that your dreams are not real, you are listening

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.200
to a man tell you about how his dreams are real.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200
That's not good.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.840
And that's how you get political awareness.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.440
Yeah, that's definitely not good.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.440
No.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.440
Oh boy.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.440
Yeah, I mean, what is six?

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.940
Like, or yeah, what is... second grade?

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:18.940
What is that?

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.940
First grade, I think.

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.940
Yeah, that's not good.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:29.440
I was playing, I remember I would finish my work early so I could play with dinosaurs.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.720
And I remember nobody telling me that dinosaurs were actually put there by, oh wait, no, I

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720
disagree.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.620
I was told that dinosaurs were put there by God to test our faith when I was six.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:44.760
So well, that didn't have any negative effects on me, Dan.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.280
Six was the first year that I lived in Hawaii.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:54.160
Like I was, the first grade, holy shit, I look, I think back on like, I didn't know

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.160
anything.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160
Nothing.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.720
I imagine listening to Alex from that age.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.040
I am going to, I'm going to listen to Alex while I work on my multiplication tables real

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040
quick.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:12.880
So I, okay, so three times four is 12 and 12 is the number of the Illuminati trying

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880
to kill me.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880
This has meaning.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.880
Yep.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880
Oh boy.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.880
The teacher might be the devil.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:18.880
She doesn't know shit.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.880
She's the devil.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:20.880
Yeah.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.520
I think it would be tough to live that way.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:28.760
And I mean like I would come home from school and I would do homework sometimes watching

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760
TRL.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760
Yeah.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760
Yeah.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.480
This guy's listening to Alex yell about the devil.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.840
Also, he seems positively cheerful for someone who has absorbed all of Alex's bullshit.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Man.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.760
And once you hear about what's happened in his life recently, you'll be even more surprised

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.760
that he's that chipper.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.760
Oh wow.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.280
I don't know, man.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.960
And then, you know, just like this whole COVID, they're such liars, man, and my wife lost

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.640
my wife last year because I couldn't really get her proper medical attention genetic.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:04.040
She had a genetic condition and had, and she had real bad CLPD and she would, you would

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.100
not go to the hospital because they wouldn't let me stay with her.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.100
She wouldn't.

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.100
She would not stay.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.100
Oh yeah.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.100
That's the whole thing.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.960
Not letting you go in cause the COVID so they can run a dictatorship inside there.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.960
That's right.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.360
And I wasn't going to let her stay without me because I knew if they got her in there

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.840
with her condition, she was probably done for.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:24.760
Well, they would have got a fake PCR test and then innovated her for the money.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.360
Yeah, I know it.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.080
And so anyway, basically we just sit at home till she died.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.080
Jesus.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.500
I mean, that's so sad.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.240
That's a person who...

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.760
Alex killed his wife.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.440
I mean, not individually, but like that information's fear of like insisting that they're going

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:53.000
to kill you for the COVID money made it so she didn't get appropriate care and sat at

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.640
home and died.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.640
If true.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.440
Again, this is just somebody calling into Alex's show.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.440
Yeah.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:06.000
And he's calling and complimenting the guy who he's been listening to since he was six,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.680
who got it deep into his head that you can't let your wife go without, wow.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.280
This episode has a body count.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.400
This is a, this is a body count.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.400
Yeah.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.400
It really is.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.800
Hypothetical future and like- That's just so fucked up.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.840
It is like, that's how fucked up your brain gets.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:31.020
I would rather blame, I would rather lose my wife.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:37.960
I would rather lose my wife and still believe that I am following the correct path than

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:47.120
I would confront reality and save my wife's life or whatever, you know, improve her life

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.120
materially.

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:53.720
I mean, the alternative was you think you have this paranoid delusion about this conspiracy

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.400
that she's going to die if she goes to the hospital while she did die by not going to

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.400
the hospital.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.400
Yep.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.060
I don't understand how this is a win.

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.480
It's not, it's so fucking sad.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.480
Wow.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.040
That is just so fucking sad.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040
Yep.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.580
And it's so awful when these like human stories, if true, penetrate through Alex's show and

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.120
they aren't taken as seriously as they really are.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.460
Like that's, that's profoundly messed up.

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:22.500
And you have this and it's like, okay, these are glimpses into some of these people's lives

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:27.200
who have been affected by Alex's content, presumably since they were six.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200
Yeah.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.200
Yeah.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:35.640
And, and at the same time, the show, the day prior was a complete freak out of him just

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.680
being emotionally unhinged, yelling about how he needs to quit because the staff won't

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.320
get his video out on time and how he has nightmares of the devil eating his unborn children.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.320
Yeah.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:55.320
Like it's, that's the same person who is being looked at as an expert by this guy who let

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.620
his wife die at home.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:02.680
Here's what you get empathetically from him, a quieter, sorry, and then continuing to yell

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:08.260
as if, and as if you weren't listening to somebody tell you, Hey, you're responsible

01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.260
for my wife's death.

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:12.400
Well, and what you're going to get is that sort of, Hey, sorry about that, but then you're

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:18.860
also going to get a doubling down and a reinforcing and a validating of the exact conspiracy nonsense

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:23.080
that led you and your wife to not getting appropriate care.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.420
It's, it's terrifying.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.860
This is straight up real cult leadership.

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:35.400
This is 100% a your wife died and it's because of everybody but the cult leader.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.540
That's just so fucked.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.000
She would have lived if they wouldn't have killed her at the hospital.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.440
Okay.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.600
You know what happened in my cult?

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:50.440
The cult leader was responsible for the death of a child as was his parents and everything

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.920
that they believed in.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:57.880
And whenever that child died due to their lack of care, their denial of care and their

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:06.940
belief that caring for the child at a hospital or even considering medicine would be a sin.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.840
That guy went to jail.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.920
Yeah.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.960
Everybody has the right to accept or refuse medical care.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.560
And so like, I am not going to do that.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.160
I'm not going to play that game.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.160
Sure.

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:27.880
But when you are responding to misinformation or cult leadership and that is what is motivating

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880
you.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.880
Yeah.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.880
It's a completely different thing.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:31.880
No.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.880
That is, that is a crime.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.880
Yeah.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880
Yeah.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880
Yep.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880
No question in my mind.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:42.840
So that's just, I feel like when I, this is the complicated, like difficult push and

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.640
pull of listening to this show.

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:51.480
It's like, I kind of feel bad about myself because I'll laugh at what's clearly a guy

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:57.240
freaking out and having an emotionally unbalanced day on the 17th and I'll feel bad.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.240
Yeah.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.920
And then I'll get to this and I'll be like, I don't feel bad.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:05.040
How can, how can he, how can he deserve any consideration?

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.040
No.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.040
None.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.120
I, it's just a...

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:16.040
It's difficult to preserve your humanity when faced with such inhumanity.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:24.920
Like just true psychopathy of, I just, I'm such a narcissist that I can hear this story

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:30.720
that I bear responsibility, at least partially, for the death of this man's wife.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.200
And I'm just going to tell him that he was so great.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.280
I have a strong sense that Alex would not have kept his wife at home.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.360
No, his wife would be in a hospital immediately.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.360
Very expensive one.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.360
Oh yeah.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360
Yeah.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.600
No, it's, it's so, it's just such what you see.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:53.280
And I, you know, you want to provide empathy for this because you are a human being and

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.800
you can't allow yourself to let empathy die.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.620
It challenges me.

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.620
It's tough.

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:02.600
But when you get past a certain point, it's just like, fuck you.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.600
It's hard.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.600
It's hard.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.600
It's hard.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600
Anyway, let's get that...

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.600
For good and forever.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.640
Let's put that behind us and listen to Alex.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:18.480
This is not, you belong to the city, but it is Alex doing some bumper music and rambling

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:25.040
about nonsense just to sort of cleanse our palette on the way out of this episode.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:30.760
This is a little Daft Punk track from the Tron Legacy soundtrack.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.560
All right, okay.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:40.600
The grid, a digital frontier.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:47.640
I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:50.320
What did they look like?

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320
Ships, motorcycles.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.320
Were the circuits like freeways?

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320
And then one day I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:24:14.040
And then one day, one day, I got in and you found out it was a off-world demonic inter-spatial

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.040
attack.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:21.440
Bring down the species and the collaborators were working with Satan against God's plan

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.760
to bring us down.

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.720
One day, I got in and when you come at it from that perspective, it all makes sense

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:38.160
and you understand it all and the enemy finally respects you.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160
I'm sorry?

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.160
She sees you as an enemy soldier.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160
What?

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.640
They don't laugh when we talk about that.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.360
They look back at us and say, that's right.

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.760
We chose the winner.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.160
We're going to lose.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.280
We both laughed.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.600
I laughed significantly.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.640
I would argue that I did not just laugh.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.080
I went for it, buddy.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.000
Yeah, I guess the enemy respects you once you...

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.840
I really don't think they do.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.800
I really don't think they do.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.880
Those three imaginary king globalists that have the same understanding of the plan as

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.680
Alex, they have a lot of respect for him though.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:14.920
That's probably true.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.600
That sounds right.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.080
Like Achilles and Hector eventually had a respect for each other, although I believe

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.800
that was after Hector was dead.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.960
But you know, it's just like that.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:35.040
Yeah, so Ezra Levant comes on the show towards the end of this episode and he's just complaining

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.960
that the US Navy hired researchers at the University of Arkansas to spy on him and his

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.240
website and then somehow somebody sold that report to Justin Trudeau.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.240
I can't find...

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.240
I'm sorry, what?

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.240
I don't know.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240
Okay.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:51.400
Well, this is more than an article on Rebel Media where the report is referred to as Canada

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.720
Election Cyber Forensics Analysis at the date October 10th, 2019.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:00.400
The actual report isn't linked there, and I have no idea if it's real, so I was trying

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.880
to get to the bottom of it and I Googled it, and guess what the first thing that comes

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.720
up if you Google those words is?

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.720
Bullshit?

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:11.160
Is a page where Rebel Media is doing a donor drive called Cyber Intelligence Operation

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.680
Donation using this alleged report as the bait on the hook of a pledge drive.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:20.000
Quote, unlike the CBC, we don't get a billion dollars a year, so if you can chip in to help

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.040
cover our costs and fight back against the lies, we would appreciate it.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.840
I don't know if this is real or not, and Ezra Levant is a bigot and a career liar, so I'm

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.840
not even going to pretend to take him seriously until he produces the report.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.840
Yeah.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.840
I don't care.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.840
Oh, man.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:34.840
But he does say something kind of funny.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.160
Well, you know what?

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.080
Where's the ACLU?

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:46.600
If it was the Young Turks or Jim Acosta or MSNBC or even Ellen or some of the leftists

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.380
on The View who were spied on, it would be top news.

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:51.380
You're Canadian.

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.380
Wait.

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:56.240
If it were Ellen, you're Canadian.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.240
It's the ACLU.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:59.720
Where's the ACLU?

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:03.320
Dan, where is the ACLU?

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.740
I mean that seriously.

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:09.580
Is there a physical location for the ACLU?

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:12.000
He was asking an honest question, Dan.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.680
I don't know if the ACLU does work with people who aren't protected by American civil liberties.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.680
It's the First Amendment rights of...

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.840
The ACLU isn't in Canada, are they?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.680
They may, but I just do think that's funny.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.680
That is very funny.

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:28.680
Putting them on blast.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.320
Where is the ACLU?

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:38.600
If Ellen was spied upon to help her get elected Canada's Prime Minister, oh, she'd be pissed.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.800
Probably a coincidence that right now Ezra Levant is in the middle of a defamation trial

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.040
for saying that somebody was involved in a terrorist attack if they weren't involved

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:49.040
in it.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040
Probably a coincidence.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.040
It doesn't come up.

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.040
I'm surprised by that.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.040
On Alex's interview.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.040
Yeah, it doesn't come up.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.040
It seems like that would be the first thing I would want to talk about.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040
Yeah.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.040
Yeah.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.040
Get out in front of that thing.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.040
Yeah.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.040
Nope.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040
He gets for $200,000.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.000
I think that's a couple of new donors.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
That'll do it.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.760
Yeah, he's going to need a lot of new donors.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760
Yeah.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.760
Let's see.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.080
He's being sued.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:14.600
According to Chalk's statement in the claim, that's the person who's suing him.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.600
Sure.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.960
Levant alleged during his February 25th, 2014 broadcast that Chalk was involved in a shooting

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.080
at an Edmonton nightclub in 1993 when Chalk was 19.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.600
Chalk was acquitted of the 1993 charges in what he called a case of mistaken identity.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.640
He vehemently denied any involvement in the shooting, saying he was at his parents' house

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.400
with friends and had absolutely no knowledge of what transpired.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.920
Yeah, so I don't know.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.360
I don't know how that trial's going to go.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.320
I think he's going to win that lawsuit, buddy.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.320
I think there's a reason that legitimate news outlets don't just print the first name they

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.320
can find.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.500
I don't know how that's going to play out, but I do think it's a little bit of maybe

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:57.080
an Alex Jones money bomb type situation that's being... I don't know.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.960
It'd be funny if he was like, where's the ACLU and they're representing the other guy.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.040
That would be quite funny.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.880
I would enjoy that an immense amount.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.600
That dude's not an... I don't know if he's an American either.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:14.080
Anyway, this episode's been a little bit of a bummer for me, T to B, top to bottom, but

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.080
it is over now.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.720
Is that the new way we sign off?

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.720
Yes.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.720
The episode is over now.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:26.320
Well, I mean, such high highs of the freak out that got edited out of Alex's own show.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.320
That's a bad one.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.240
Again, try an outline.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.240
One time.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.360
Quite an amazing thing, too, to see.

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:38.040
There's a point when Alex says shit and I was like, wow, I've got to go find this on

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.040
the...

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.040
Of course.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.040
It's gone.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.040
Just gone.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.040
From the banned on video version.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.040
Oh, man.

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.040
So he's censoring himself, if you will.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040
It got banned from banned.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.240
They cut that whole thing out and put the right video in where the wrong video was put.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.240
What a bunch of liars.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.440
Those motherfuckers.

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.440
That's bullshit.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.440
Did it in post.

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.440
I'm furious.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.440
Yeah.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.600
So that was the fun.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.280
And then 18th is so depressing.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.640
And the other thing is the guests, I just don't care.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.800
You had Francis Boyle on the first one.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.800
Sir Francis Boyle.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.800
Excuse me.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:18.160
And then you had Duke, Ezra Levant on the other one, and neither of them were people

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.600
I care about much at all.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.560
I mean, if they're going to bring something to the table that was interesting, maybe,

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.560
but they didn't.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.560
Yeah.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.560
And yeah.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.560
I don't know.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:34.640
I may, now that we've had two episodes back in the present, I grow weary of it.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:36.280
May try and time travel for Monday.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.280
There is a little bit of that.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.280
Yeah, we'll see what happens.

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.280
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.280
But until then, we have a website.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.280
We do have a website.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.280
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.280
Yep.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.280
We're also on Twitter.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.280
We are on Twitter.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.280
It's at knowledge underscore fight and I go to bed Jordan.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.280
We're also on Facebook.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280
We are on Facebook.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.280
Will you tell us, right?

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.920
If you could, please find a local charity or a bail fund in your area to help out people

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:54.920
doing God's work.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.920
Yep.

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:56.920
We'll be back.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:57.920
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:58.920
I'm Leo.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.920
I'm DZX Clark.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.920
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.600
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.600
Andy in Kansas.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.600
You're on the air.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.600
Thanks for holding.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.600
Hello, Alex.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.600
I'm a first time caller.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.600
I'm a huge fan.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.600
I love your work.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:24.280
I love you.
