N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Dan and Jordan.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Knowledgefight.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Riddle her.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Riddle her.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Riddle her.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,360
I need money.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Riddle her.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Riddle her.

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Riddle her.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Andy and Kansas.

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Andy and Kansas.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Stop it.

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
Andy and Kansas.

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
Andy and Kansas.

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
It's time to pray.

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Andy and Kansas.

24
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
You're on the air.

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Thanks for holding.

26
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Hello Alex, I'm a fish and color.

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
I'm a huge fan.

28
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
I love your room.

29
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Knowledgefight.

30
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Knowledgefight.com.

31
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
I love you.

32
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I love you.

33
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
I love you.

34
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

35
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
I'm Dan.

36
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm Jordan.

37
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,120
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk just a little

38
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
bit about Alex Jones.

39
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Oh indeed we are Dan.

40
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Jordan.

41
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan.

42
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
I have a quick question for you.

43
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
What's up?

44
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
What's your bright spot today?

45
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
My bright spot today is another counter shout out.

46
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Another counter shout out.

47
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Counter bright spot.

48
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
A counter bright spot.

49
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Aha.

50
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,600
An anti bright spot.

51
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,720
I could not resist the urge while I was sitting around in the house.

52
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,600
I saw those Coca Cola with coffee staring at me.

53
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
You did it again.

54
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,840
Then I tried the vanilla one.

55
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,320
I swear you learn better than anyone else in certain areas and in others you're simply

56
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
impossible.

57
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
I'm a glutton for punishment.

58
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
You are.

59
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,000
When it comes to weird packaged goods.

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,160
I've never had it before, it's like your guiding light whenever you're at a store.

61
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,920
Yeah but it also, it's a pretty specific space.

62
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
That's true.

63
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,160
Because if it was like Coca Cola now with octopus.

64
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,760
Right, right, right.

65
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,480
That's not going to do it.

66
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,960
It has to also intrigue you.

67
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
I get ya.

69
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,360
And kind of a really like 13 year old kid might get excited by this kind of way.

70
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,280
Ooh it's a new type of Nerds.

71
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
That's my sweet spot.

72
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Speaking of which they have those Nerds clusters.

73
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
They got the Nerds Ropes?

74
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
They got Nerds clusters.

75
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,040
No, Nerds Ropes came out like 15, 20 years ago.

76
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,220
Okay fine, fine.

77
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,280
We sold those at the movie theater I used to work out when I was like 17.

78
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,040
I'm sorry I'm not a snack nerd if you will Dan.

79
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,880
So I tried the vanilla one and I gotta say it was better.

80
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Okay.

81
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Still really bad.

82
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
All right, all right.

83
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Still disgusting.

84
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Okay.

85
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,080
But it was kind of like you know the vanilla masked some of the problems of the coffee.

86
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Sure.

87
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Let's add a fourth flavor in here.

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,280
Let's throw, yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,900
Let's just keep tossing stuff in there.

91
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,120
Cherry vanilla coffee coke, let's see if we can fucking make this taste not atrocious.

92
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,420
It's like when somebody describes wine tea and they're like it's got an oaky finish and

93
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,080
there's hints of fruit in there and somebody's like well what if we just added all those

94
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
flavors into coke?

95
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,760
It'd be like a regular drink.

96
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,120
I say sommelier, I say nay.

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Samala nay.

99
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm gonna try the caramel one at some point.

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, of course.

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Naturally.

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,960
You're already a pot committed here.

103
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
This is-

104
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
That's in the fridge.

105
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Yeah, it's there.

106
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
I'm gonna drink it at some point.

107
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,400
It's just a matter of how long and how many times will I stare at it before I try.

108
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Yeah.

109
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
What's your Bright Spot?

110
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
My Bright Spot, Dan, is it happens to be a very beautiful day in Chicago and my partner

111
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,080
and I went and played tennis and wow, the outside is nice, Dan.

112
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
You remember the outside?

113
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,880
I've heard a, I've heard tale of it.

114
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
You remember the outside?

115
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
What were you doing?

116
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,160
You were doing it, you were, what do you do on the show again?

117
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
Uh, the work.

118
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
You were working on the-

119
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,320
Yeah, I was doing that part of it while you were enjoying the outdoors.

120
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
There is that.

121
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,640
It's great that you get to do that.

122
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Wow, we also frequently have conversations about how much I love nature and how you think

123
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,200
it sucks to go away.

124
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
There is that, yes.

125
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,520
I'm a man of many contradictions, Dan.

126
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,200
Well, I'm glad you had fun playing big time ping pong.

127
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,440
Uh, yeah, it was great.

128
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Big old ping pong?

129
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,960
Yeah, it's real big.

130
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,440
That was the original name.

131
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,220
Originally ping pong was called whiff waff in the United States, but before that tennis

132
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,920
was called great big whiff waff.

133
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
What's pickleball?

134
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,560
Uh, pickleball is-

135
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,400
Is that related to tennis?

136
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,480
Isn't it the one where it's got the whiffleball and there's holes in it and you do the thing

137
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
with the pickles?

138
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I don't know.

139
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
I don't think pickles are actually involved.

140
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm not sure that they're not.

141
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
I've heard that word said a lot and I don't know what it is.

142
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
I have heard pickleball as well.

143
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,880
Please don't send me messages about it, I'm going to look into it as soon as we stop recording.

144
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
We're going to need 3,000 messages.

145
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,160
So, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

146
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,200
We're going to be doing a little bit of a time travel adventure.

147
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,560
Come back in time or forward?

148
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,480
You ask that every time and we can't go forward, I've tried.

149
00:04:52,480 --> 00:05:00,280
We are going back to 2010, the magical 11 year old time of 2010.

150
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Sure, sure.

151
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Things were so different.

152
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,360
Yeah, it's like the turn of the millennium, but instead of the Iraq war, we had more of

153
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
the Iraq war.

154
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Sure, sure.

155
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,200
We had the midterms coming up.

156
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,920
We had the Mayan apocalypse on the horizon.

157
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,400
Sure, that's still to come.

158
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Certainly.

159
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
A lot of interesting stuff happening.

161
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,280
So, I'm excited to dabble in on this, but before we get into that, let's take a little

162
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,040
moment to say thank you to some folks who have joined up and are now policy wonks.

163
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
That's a great idea.

164
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,760
So first, Dr. Yummy Feet, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

165
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm a policy wonk.

166
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,800
Thank you, Dr. Yummy Feet.

167
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Thank you.

168
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Next, Brendan, the policy wonk.

169
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

170
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,700
I'm a policy wonk.

171
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,760
Thank you, Brendan, the policy wonk, policy wonk.

172
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Thank you.

173
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,120
Kranthulus the 12th, conqueror of five empires, lord of the blood pits of Fentha, Fathna,

174
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
excuse me.

175
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,440
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

176
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,640
I'm a policy wonk.

177
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Thank you very much.

178
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,120
Yeah, Fathna gets really pissed if you don't pronounce their name properly.

179
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
It's true.

180
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
It's true.

181
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Yeah, it's a brutal, brutal feeling.

182
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,000
But I'm known for my mispronunciations of locations.

183
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's true.

184
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sure the Fathnians will.

185
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So it's on, hashtag, on brand.

186
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

187
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,520
Next, Paranoid Lemming, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

188
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,820
I'm a policy wonk.

189
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,240
Thank you, Paranoid Lemming.

190
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Thank you.

191
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,440
Thanks for the brain worms, Jon, much love from E, thank you so much, you are now a policy

192
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
wonk.

193
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm a policy wonk.

194
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Thank you very much.

195
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
This might be connected.

196
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
What's that?

197
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
I do believe that these are both about the same person.

198
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,480
Okay, we have a policy wonk pile on.

199
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,600
So the next one is, Jon, I blame you for getting jokerfied, love rex, thank you so much, you

200
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
are now a policy wonk.

201
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm a policy wonk.

202
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,240
Thank you very much to all of you.

203
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,800
I think Jon is maybe getting some people into the show.

204
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Jon, you gotta get to, damn.

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,600
So thanks, Jon.

206
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,720
So Jordan, like I said, we're going back in time, and I've made this call on the show

207
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,800
before, and I think I did it at a time when we had a smaller audience than we do now,

208
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
and maybe this will have a little bit more reach, and so if anybody out there listening

209
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,560
has access to really old Alex Jones episodes, like late 90s, early 2000s, please reach out.

210
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,840
I would like to try and find a way to get my hands on stuff from like 95, 96, 97, and

211
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,640
if anybody has a line on those, I've tried a number of avenues and they all kind of reach

212
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
dead ends.

213
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,920
A lot of people have some tips.

214
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
Did you text him?

215
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
No.

216
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Oh.

217
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,480
I have not, I've considered that a last option.

218
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
That assumes that you already have his number.

219
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Alex, you up?

220
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Hey, Alex, what up?

221
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,520
You got those old episodes for me.

222
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,640
There are a number of paths that I've gone down that seemed like, oh, this'll work out.

223
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
It's kind of difficult.

224
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,080
I think there's some, the episodes exist somewhere.

225
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,480
I know that for sure, but it's very, very difficult to find them in any meaningful way.

226
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,160
You think the Smithsonian has them?

227
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Got to.

228
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Library of Congress?

229
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Of course.

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Yeah, absolutely.

231
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Yeah, somebody's got to.

232
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,960
So today, Jordan, I was trying to find a fun time travel thing to do and you know, it's

233
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
tough.

234
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
It's a challenge.

235
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Yeah.

236
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
And you're a witch, so you have high standards.

237
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah.

238
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
My standards for witchcraft are real.

239
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Yeah, exactly.

240
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,520
I got a message from a guy by the name of Kirby Ferguson, who does some videos on YouTube

241
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,960
and Kirby had just finished up a duo of videos about Joe Rogan and Alex's last interview

242
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,960
and sort of the, some of the techniques and the styles that are used in the conversation.

243
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Sure.

244
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
And I really enjoyed watching that.

245
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,880
It was really a nice thing.

246
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,480
And so I started thinking like, let's find some Rogan.

247
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh no.

248
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,480
So I went back to September 15th, 2010 and found.

249
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,840
Welcome ladies and gentlemen.

250
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,120
Welcome and thank you for joining us.

251
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,320
It's September 15th on this Wednesday, 2010 transmission.

252
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:04,080
I got a call last night, Joe Rogan host of Ultimate Fighting is in town and he was inviting

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,840
me tonight to see the UFC and I said, Hey, why don't you come in the studio and get his

254
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,240
view on politics and quote conspiracies.

255
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,080
So that is good, but that wouldn't be enough.

256
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,160
No, no, no, no, no.

257
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
That's not enough.

258
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,560
This is before the Joe Rogan experience, right?

259
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,480
Or like at the very beginning of it, maybe.

260
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
I would have a hard time knowing exactly when it started.

261
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,800
I know that he promotes Joe Rogan.net, which is his website.

262
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,640
That's where the Rogan experience was initially.

263
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,520
So I could see it maybe being in like its earliest stages.

264
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,520
At the very least, we know he does not have $100 million yet.

265
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,140
He certainly doesn't, but he does have a friend.

266
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,080
And Eddie Bravo is a jiu-jitsu master.

267
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,280
He's also going to be in studio with Joe today.

268
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,680
So we got an episode from 2010 with Alex, Eddie, and Joe Rogan in Alex's studio.

269
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,000
I thought this would be a fun little thing to glimpse back on scene.

270
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,480
Take a little bit of a load off from the present day nonsense, maybe be a little bit lighter.

271
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,560
This was back when Eddie Bravo was still a practicing doctor, I believe, right?

272
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Doctor jiu-jitsu.

273
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Yeah.

274
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,480
He is licensed.

275
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,840
He's a, boy, he's not made for FCC controlled things.

276
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Oh yeah?

277
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,560
Why do you say that?

278
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,720
We'll get to it when we get to it.

279
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,500
So Alex is going to talk to them at the end of the show.

280
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
That's third hour business.

281
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Sure, sure, sure.

282
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,140
So I was like, I wonder what's going on beforehand and what sort of show they're, you know, by

283
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,240
appearing on it and being advertised as guests on the show.

284
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
What are they basically endorsing?

285
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
What are they elevating?

286
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
What's going on?

288
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Yeah.

289
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,560
And so we get to Alex talking about how back when his grandmas was around, you know, in

290
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,080
grandma's time it was offensive to see a belly button in I Dream of Jeannie, but now society

291
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
is collapsing.

292
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh boy.

293
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,000
In fact, last night I was talking to my mom and she was discussing her grandmother back

294
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,680
in the sixties was over at their house and she saw I Dream of Jeannie and she was just

295
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,000
shocked by the fact that the woman's navel was visible.

296
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,720
And now, you know, you can make fun of people who are shocked by things like that, but civilizations

297
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,400
have been wild and decadent and crazy before and people figure out, hey, we better control

298
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
this to some level.

299
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Put away the belly button.

300
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Or it causes society to collapse because it's a slippery slope.

301
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
One belly button.

302
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Now look at the culture.

303
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,480
It's the end of days.

304
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,720
People see millions and millions over their lifetimes of simulated murders and deaths

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
and torture.

306
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,840
And every time I go to a movie to analyze it, I'm not really a fan of really violent

307
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
films.

308
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
What?

309
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,960
It's because I realized how serious it is unless it's in a serious context.

310
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,880
I would have liked to been in the theater when the road came out a few years ago.

311
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,640
I saw it on DVD and was profoundly affected by it because I've studied so much history.

312
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,920
I know how accurate it was dealing with cannibalism and deprivation.

313
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:20,000
I never put the pieces together until that clip that Alex's entire idea of like everyone

314
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,360
becomes a cannibal within 15 days is just from the road.

315
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,920
Just Cormac McCarthy.

316
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Straight up.

317
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Yeah.

318
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,840
I wouldn't rely on Cormac McCarthy for the betterment of mankind in terms of thematic

319
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
elements.

320
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,660
But Alex pretends that that's like stuff from studies and so everyone becomes a cannibal

321
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
within 15 days.

322
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Yeah.

323
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,560
No, I mean, that's just kind of like, yeah, there's a bunch of bad people who are cannibals

324
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
in the road.

325
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,360
I can see if they had made a movie of it, I could see Alex's Devil being based on the

326
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,320
Judge from Blood Meridian, but that was a book and it's hard to read even if you're

327
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
good at reading.

328
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
So, no.

329
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,400
It's just a post-apocalyptic fiction novel that's got turned into a movie that Alex is

330
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
pretending is real.

331
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Yeah.

332
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Viggo Mortensen, right?

333
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Yeah, I think so.

334
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Vigo.

336
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Yeah, it was a good Vigo film.

337
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,840
The historical examples of cannibalism have been in ritual context, which makes sense

338
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,060
because the amount of energy you'd need to exert to kill and eat a non-cooperative human

339
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,520
would not be worth whatever nutritional value you gain from it.

340
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,920
It would be smarter from a caloric perspective to eat just about anything else.

341
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,740
This is just another example of some supposedly researched position that Alex has got that

342
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,400
he's coming from a movie that he experienced as real.

343
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:36,200
I mean, you know, in many ways, I would argue that man is the most dangerous game.

344
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,680
Because it fights back and it's harder to trap.

345
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Exactly.

346
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,160
Yeah, so if there's easier game, go for the easier game.

347
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,400
And that includes leaves and shit, man.

348
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
It's not hard.

349
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
It's true.

350
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
It's not hard.

351
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
No.

352
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
No.

353
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,920
And the other thing, too, is you will find a number of examples over history, of course,

354
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,560
of people who are in desperate situations who resort to cannibalism.

355
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Of course, yes.

356
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,920
Honor party and such.

357
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Sure.

358
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Yeah.

359
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,000
A lot of those, what makes those sort of unique are isolation.

360
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,160
It's isolation that's really crucial for those, yeah.

361
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,000
It's a lack of other legitimate options.

362
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,720
Somebody who's lost at sea or something.

363
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Right, right, right.

364
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
You might eat somebody.

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Yeah.

366
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,320
If they were on, perhaps, a road, it would be far easier.

367
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,420
The problem for many of these people is that they are trapped in the middle of nowhere

368
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,160
with no hope of escape or anywhere.

369
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,040
If there's foliage and wildlife, it's substantially easier and better for everyone to not eat

370
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
people.

371
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Yeah.

372
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah.

373
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
So much better to not eat people.

374
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,440
And you don't need to wait 15 days to figure out that.

375
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Nope.

376
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Nope.

377
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
So dumb.

378
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Oh, what a dumb dumb.

379
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm not going to eat any of these goddamn fruits.

380
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,640
So Alex has this idea that, and he sort of touched on it in that last clip, and that

381
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:57,120
is this notion that fake violence on TV and seeing it makes you experience it the same

382
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,520
way you'd experience real violence.

383
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Sure.

384
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
And I have some thoughts about this.

385
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Oh, yeah.

386
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,880
As somebody who's shocked by images of violence and death, someone setting themselves on fire

387
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,000
or blowing their brains out, there's real footage of that out there on the web.

388
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Back in Vietnam, people were shocked by the image of children who'd been napalmed with

389
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,280
their skin burned off.

390
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:28,440
People were shocked by the image of Vietnamese police blowing a man's head off in the street.

391
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
That's shocking.

392
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,740
But now people are like, big deal.

393
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,160
They laugh about it.

394
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Not that...

395
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
And they think it's cute.

396
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
No.

397
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
No.

398
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
No.

399
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
No.

400
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
No.

401
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
And it's because A, they don't know history.

402
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
B, they don't have common sense.

403
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,200
And C, they haven't experienced trauma.

404
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Wild.

405
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,440
And this has all been done by design so that when your neighbors are being abused by the

406
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,740
jackbooted thugs or when the CPS is taking your kids, even your own family isn't going

407
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,620
to be shocked by it and just accept that bad things happen because the mind sees all this

408
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:09,040
simulated violence on television as real.

409
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,640
And so it can't differentiate between fact...

410
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Cut off at the break.

411
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,600
That clip is really key to me to the point where it's one of the only times I can remember

412
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,920
where I'm really disappointed he got cut off by the break.

413
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,600
He's kind of interested in where he was going.

414
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,260
Here Alex is lamenting how fake violence on TV is experienced by people as real violence

415
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,440
and that desensitizes them to seeing instances of real life violence.

416
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,200
I don't know how common that is necessarily as a phenomenon.

417
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,040
I bet there is some effect that it has.

418
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,280
But I know that I've seen plenty of horror movies in my life and I still pretty much

419
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,120
experience depiction of violence difference than I do actual violence.

420
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
Pro wrestling is a really good example of this.

421
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,680
I can watch people hit each other with chairs and send each other through tables but if

422
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,640
I were watching that being done for real I would not enjoy it.

423
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,540
Any time it appears that someone has actually hurt themselves in wrestling reality creeps

424
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,160
in and I become worried for the performer because it's possible to enjoy the narrative

425
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,440
depiction of combat and still remember that it's a performer performing.

426
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,160
Then there's stuff like the UFC where people are fighting for real and people are trying

427
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,680
to hurt each other.

428
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,440
This is still kind of ritualized violence where everyone watching understands that these

429
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,660
are two trained competitors who've agreed to fight each other under specific rules to

430
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,560
see who's better at the sport.

431
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,240
It's closer to real world violence but it's something that's formalized, professional,

432
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,680
and both parties have consented to what's going on in the contest.

433
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,200
And then there's movies.

434
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Right.

435
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Right.

436
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,520
Which are just totally fictional.

437
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,040
Those are fictional, yes.

438
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,480
Most people can tell the difference between these forms of displays of violence and experience

439
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,960
them differently, whether that different experience is conscious or subconscious.

440
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,540
It seems to me that Alex cannot, and he assumes that because that is his experience everyone

441
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,320
else must also not be able to differentiate between the two.

442
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,880
Now here's where this point gets important.

443
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,960
Because Alex can't tell the difference between fiction and reality, he can't also tell the

444
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,580
difference between reality and fiction.

445
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,440
In the same way that he thinks that a fictional movie like The Road depicts a legitimate realistic

446
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,360
cannibal future, he has a tendency to think very real things like the Sandy Hook shooting

447
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,280
were completely staged.

448
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,400
Alex pretends that exposure to fictitious violence has made everyone desensitized to

449
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
real world violence, and yet in my experience one of the major themes of his show is denying

450
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,240
the experiences of people who have experienced the effects of real world violence because

451
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,960
he thinks it's fake.

452
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Yes.

453
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,000
I think that's an important dynamic to recognize.

454
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,680
Yeah, I mean there's that extra level of not just because, you know, he can't tell the

455
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,320
difference between reality and fiction, and so he assumes everybody else can't tell the

456
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
difference.

457
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,840
Yes, I do think that is a part of the dynamic.

458
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,040
But that like second level of, of course he can't also not assume that of everyone else,

459
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,960
because if he were to realize that other people can easily tell the difference between reality

460
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,360
and fiction, that would be an attack upon him personally, or it would tell him that

461
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,520
it's possible to tell the difference between reality and fiction.

462
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Hmm.

463
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,920
You know, so the only way that he can maintain his psyche through this is by assuming that

464
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,540
not only can nobody else tell the difference between reality and fiction, but that he's

465
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,880
the only person who can tell you you can't tell the difference between reality and fiction.

466
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah, perhaps that is, that is true.

467
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,560
Yeah, he's a mess.

468
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,720
Yeah, he's a mess.

469
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Yep.

470
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
That's a real bummer.

471
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,240
You know, Alex has another story that's going around, and this is, this is interesting to

472
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,960
me because, you know, he's above the political divide, right?

473
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Sure.

474
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,720
The left-right paradigm is an illusion, and it's all meant to get us all mad at each other

475
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,840
and fighting for no reason.

476
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Yeah.

477
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,360
Democrat, left, right, conservative, Republican, meaningless words.

478
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,800
All just infighting for no reason.

479
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
This seems weird.

480
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
This is 2010.

481
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Mm-hmm.

482
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,880
Big story at Infowars.com by Kurt Nemo, Pennsylvania Homeland Security puts anti-tax protesters

483
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,360
on list of terror threats.

484
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,040
And we got same reports out of Texas six years ago, listing gun owners, veterans as the number

485
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,080
one threat.

486
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,640
But because it was Bush's administration doing it, conservative media wouldn't pick up on

487
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
it.

488
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,700
Now that it's Obama, meet the new boss, same as the old boss, like the Who song says.

489
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,560
It's like, oh my gosh, Obama wants to go after conservatives.

490
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,960
Folks, you've always been the enemy.

491
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,400
Again, I would watch conservative pundits on Fox and listen to them on the radio, read

492
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,720
from reports that I had.

493
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,160
They didn't tell you they were reading a report, but I'd read the reports.

494
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
We'd covered it here.

495
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,760
I knew they were reading federal demonization scripts.

496
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,640
Whoever's loading their teleprompter is a globalist.

497
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,200
I mean, they're getting a direct government propaganda feed.

498
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,760
We know they're bad.

499
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
It's open and shut.

500
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,660
So if you understand what he's saying, if you get to the root of what he's saying when

501
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,560
he's trying to make this argument that he's above this sort of left, right, new boss,

502
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:12,880
same as the old boss, he's saying that Obama is targeting conservatives in the same way

503
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,160
that the conservatives targeted conservatives.

504
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,000
The left isn't the target of any of this stuff.

505
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,120
It's they are always the victim of no matter what.

506
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
No matter what.

507
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:33,440
No matter who's in charge, the enemy of the globalists is these conservatives, like Alex's.

508
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,480
It's interesting.

509
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,940
It's only the far right white.

510
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:45,100
But it's interesting that he can articulate this idea of it doesn't matter who's in charge.

511
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,140
They're all the same.

512
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,160
But the thing that he's saying that they're all the same about is that they're all globalists

513
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,200
who hate super far right people like me.

514
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah.

515
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,160
I mean, essentially it's like, hey, we don't have any white nationalist candidates.

516
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,800
And then they got a white nationalist candidate and they were like, holy shit, this is what

517
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,200
we've been wanting the whole time.

518
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Yeah.

519
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,000
And here in 2010, you're starting to see a little bit of the beginning of that materializing

520
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,360
into a possibility with the Tea Party being on the rise.

521
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Yeah.

522
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
Again, because of whiteness.

523
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,680
It was a major driver.

524
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Yeah.

525
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Big deal.

526
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
And Coke money.

527
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah.

528
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Not Coke head money.

529
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Coke brother money.

530
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Yes.

531
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Yes.

532
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,220
So in terms of that, there is something that's going on at this point in September.

533
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:37,400
And that is that Christine O'Donnell was running for the seat in Delaware in the Senate.

534
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,880
And there had been a little bit of squabbling.

535
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,640
Karl Rove had come out and he'd had an interview that was a little bit critical of O'Donnell.

536
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,440
And Alex is not happy about this.

537
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,320
Here is the New York Times today.

538
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,080
GOP leaders say Delaware upset hurts Senate hopefuls.

539
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,040
Now they basically said the same thing about Rand Paul.

540
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,640
They sent in Cheney to campaign against him.

541
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,000
They put all their money behind the Republican establishment pro bailout candidate.

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,620
They demonized him, just like the Democrats are now doing.

543
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:22,560
And he's widened his lead against the Democrat in the last few months since he won the primary

544
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,080
against the Republican.

545
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,240
But they said the same thing.

546
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,880
Oh, people extreme like him.

547
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,720
And they lied about what he really stood for.

548
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,940
He can't win.

549
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,160
And so they create this self-fulfilling prophecy of, oh, you can't vote for that candidate

550
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,280
because they can't win.

551
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:42,960
And now the Republicans are creating the hoax with the Democrats that all these different

552
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,960
real Tea Party candidates who actually, you know, are against the out of control spending,

553
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,480
the banker bailouts and the rest of it, that that that they're bad and that they can't

554
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
win.

555
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,820
And you need to go for establishment Republicans, the same Republicans that are for.

556
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Banker bailouts, the same Republicans that under Bush four separate times tried to pass

557
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,700
amnesty, the same Republicans like Newt Gingrich, who want global carbon taxes and want world

558
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,320
government.

559
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,920
And the hoax intensifies.

560
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,200
I have the transcript here.

561
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,460
We're not going to play the entire clip, but it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet

562
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:30,320
dot com in an article that Paul Watson's written anti establishment fervor, a hammer blow to

563
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,000
the Washington elite.

564
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,520
But here's a transcript from Fox News from last night.

565
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,200
Karl Rove questions Christine O'Donnell's serious character problems.

566
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,840
And then I have the quotes here.

567
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,480
They're saying because it took 20 years for her to pay off her student loans, that that

568
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
is deceptive.

569
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,400
Again, the serious questions about how does she make her living?

570
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,460
Why did she mislead voters about her college education?

571
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,240
How come it took nearly two decades to pay her college bills?

572
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I've seen numbers of upwards of half of many college students now not paying their loans

573
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
because they can't cancel them.

574
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Right.

575
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,720
Yeah, that would make sense.

576
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
Yeah, you're on top of it, Alex.

577
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,280
You should absolutely cancel student loan debt.

578
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,860
I think that's Alex's position.

579
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,360
So first of all, fuck Karl Rove.

580
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Yeah.

581
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,280
That being said, Rove was just protecting his brand there and everybody's brand.

582
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,760
It's not really anything more interesting than seeing conventional Democrats be resistant

583
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,320
to embrace AOC in the present.

584
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
There's just that tension.

585
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Yeah.

586
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,880
Someone like O'Donnell in particular and the aesthetics of the Tea Party in general were

588
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,260
a vast departure from the type of politics that Rove excelled at for decades.

589
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,840
So that obviously would represent a threat to his position in the market, either as a

590
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,120
strategist or a commentator on Fox News.

591
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,920
Yeah, let's keep the depths of our evil quieter, guys.

592
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,480
That was Karl Rove's philosophy, I believe.

593
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,160
In the end, though, Rove was probably right.

594
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,300
Christine O'Donnell was unelectable.

595
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,640
She finished third in the GOP primary in 2006 after making some pretty offensive comments

596
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,580
about the LGBTQ community and lost the 2008 general election to Joe Biden, who was simultaneously

597
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,320
running for vice president.

598
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,120
She would follow this up by losing the 2010 general election after it came out that she

599
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,680
had, quote, dabbled in witchcraft in high school.

600
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,960
And then, more to the problem, released this ad.

601
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,080
I'm not a witch.

602
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm nothing you've heard.

603
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,320
I'm you.

604
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,720
None of us are perfect, but none of us can be happy with what we see all around us.

605
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,200
Politicians who think spending, trading favors, and backroom deals are the ways to stay in

606
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,000
office.

607
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,240
I'll go to Washington and do what you do.

608
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm Christine O'Donnell, and I approve this message.

609
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
I'm you.

610
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,680
I was really hoping she'd say I'm not a witch.

611
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,160
I wanted her to say I'm not a witch at the end.

612
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Just to reiterate.

613
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
As a reminder?

614
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm not a witch.

615
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,200
Just to double down on that?

616
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Not a witch here.

617
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,080
Obviously, I don't care if someone messed around with some witch shit.

618
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,800
Some of the coolest people I know have spent some time in that water.

619
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,280
I don't care, but man, Republican voters sure do.

620
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,960
It's one thing to have dabbled in witchcraft in your past when you're trying to run for

621
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,500
office, but it's another thing to cut an ad that starts by saying I'm not a witch.

622
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,120
That's so goofy and embarrassing from a political strategy perspective that anyone who would

623
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,120
do that is someone you shouldn't trust to make good decisions.

624
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,400
It's either an indication of them having bad instincts or being surrounded by people who

625
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,280
have bad instincts, and neither is a good option.

626
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,280
This 2010 midterm and the Tea Party candidates that came into office with it were a warning

627
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,240
of the future we were heading toward.

628
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,560
It's not surprising to look back at 2010 and see Alex supporting someone like Christine

629
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,160
O'Donnell and then flash forward to today to see him backing Marjorie Taylor Greene.

630
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Yeah.

631
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
This is what he does.

632
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Yep.

633
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,120
The issues about O'Donnell's college history and loans probably sound like petty issues,

634
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,080
but the point Karl Rove was making was more that the way that O'Donnell was addressing

635
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,480
these questions about her history didn't come off as convincing.

636
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,320
For instance, as early as 2006, she claimed to be a graduate of Fairleigh Dickinson University,

637
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,400
but actually didn't complete her degree until September 2010.

638
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,400
The reason for the delay had first been claimed to be a student loan-related issue, like a

639
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,700
delay because of that, but then the story became that she had to finish an outstanding

640
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,400
elective course before she could get her degree.

641
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,840
Rove was expressing on Fox News that if she was going to win, she would have to be more

642
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
forthright.

643
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,760
And she said exactly that, quote, she can't get away with simply saying my answer is on

644
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,160
my website or it's puzzling to me why the IRS would file a lien for me when I didn't

645
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,200
pay my taxes in 2005.

646
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,240
I mean, she's got to be more honest than that.

647
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,920
If she does, she's got a shot to win, but it's got to be passionate and factual and

648
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
hard hitting.

649
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Yeah.

650
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,920
You know, and I think the very, see, you should have somebody like me if you're going to cut

651
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:49,220
a political ad because if you open with I'm not a witch, the reasonable person's response

652
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,280
is that's just what a witch would say.

653
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Right.

654
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,640
I know witches aren't real, but my first thought when she said I'm not a witch is like, oh,

655
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,600
that's a witch talking right there.

656
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
That's a witch.

657
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,680
I haven't seen a witch before.

658
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,600
And I think anybody with like just a little bit of political instincts or any awareness

659
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,600
of how the media cycle works is like, you're going to get piled on for that.

660
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Yeah.

661
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Leave it alone.

662
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Don't say I'm not a witch.

663
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,440
Don't worry about it.

664
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
So easy to ignore.

665
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,320
Cut an ad about how compassionate you are and how you care about the needs of the people

666
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,520
of Delaware.

667
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,640
Don't open.

668
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,080
Don't get ahead of the witch story.

669
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,760
I got to get out in front of this witch thing.

670
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
If I don't do this, they'll think I'm a witch.

671
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
People think I'm still a witch.

672
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,260
I think that's, what's really funny about that is Christine O'Donnell's name immediately

673
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
popped up.

674
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,620
There was a space in my brain for it, but I wasn't 100% sure.

675
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,640
And then you said witch and I was like, oh yeah, I remember that.

676
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,400
I remember that witch doesn't really actually know all that much about her, but he's decided

677
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,000
to defend her just because he likes, who doesn't seem to like her.

678
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Now.

679
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't know this lady from the side of a barn, but the fact that the attacking her,

680
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,360
the fact that the system is demonizing her, the fact that they have the Republicans and

681
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,240
Democrats coming out against her, I mean, that tells you all you need to know.

682
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,680
So yeah, Alex is just like defiant basically, but you know what's funny is like, why isn't

683
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,320
Alex talking about how she's a witch?

684
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
He seems to hate witches.

685
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,360
He hates witches.

686
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,760
It's because that clip doesn't come out until two days after this episode.

687
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Oh boy.

688
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,160
Not the clip that we played, but the information about her babbling about her being a witch.

689
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,680
Bill Maher plays that two days later.

690
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Jesus.

691
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,200
It sets off the witch news cycle.

692
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
That's so funny.

693
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Yeah.

694
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,520
So Alex gets around to playing the clip of Rove talking on Fox news.

695
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,300
And I think this is really interesting because Alex sets it up pretty poorly.

696
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,200
And so let's go ahead and play a short clip of Karl Rove, you know, really demonizing

697
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,400
this poor lady and just repeating that talking point over and over again that she has serious

698
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,960
character problems and then when you actually go find out what those character problems

699
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,760
are, he just uses that term when you actually find out what they are.

700
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,000
It took her 20 years to pay off her student loans and she had an $11,000 lien on her from

701
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
the IRS.

702
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
No due process.

703
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
They just slapped it on her.

704
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Here it is.

705
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
You know what?

706
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,260
If you vote for cap and tax and you have an opponent that says they wouldn't, then they

707
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
have a choice.

708
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
They have an option.

709
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,440
So I think it was, it was very substantive, very based on issues, very based on the voting

710
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,120
record of one and the promise voting record of another.

711
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,160
You know, again, you're making my case.

712
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,640
This was about Mike Castle's bad votes.

713
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,360
It does conservatives little good to support candidates who at the end of the day, while

714
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,340
they may be conservative in their public statements, do not events, the characteristics of rectitude

715
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:03,280
and truthfulness and sincerity and character that the voters are looking for.

716
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,540
She doesn't show rectitude.

717
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,520
This was a guy up there high and mighty saying, I tell you who has rectitude.

718
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,480
I tell you who is morally good.

719
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,360
I tell you, you know, who you could vote for and who you can't.

720
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
I'm the grand Puba.

721
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,840
I'm the high priest.

722
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm going to tell you Republicans what you can and can't do your need to stay on the

723
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,400
Karl Rove reservation because I am morally of high rectitude.

724
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,700
This is the guy lying about WMDs.

725
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,240
So what you have is Alex introduces this clip in a way that the clip doesn't actually reflect

726
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
what he's saying.

727
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,980
And Karl Rove is actually making a fair point in terms of the context of this conversation.

728
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,160
That is there's some kind of non forthrightness that's going on and that is not great.

729
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Yeah.

730
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Yeah.

731
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,200
And so in order for Alex to deal with the clip that's played, he attacks the messenger.

732
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,040
He's just, and look, fuck Karl Rove.

733
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
I don't care.

734
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,320
But saying fuck him and saying he lied about weapons of mass destruction doesn't deal with

735
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,960
the issue that he brings up.

736
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Totally.

737
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Yeah.

738
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,960
That just point.

739
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Oh, Oh my God.

740
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
You're all liars.

741
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
What a shock.

742
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,520
If I were a snarky debate kid online, I would say that is a, uh, Ooh, this is a person of

743
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
the tech.

744
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
This is not.

745
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,840
We don't even bother.

746
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,920
And I have scored a point or whatever.

747
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,160
But that's, that's what you can do whenever, I mean it, the audience enjoys it.

748
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,480
I think you even kind of enjoy it.

749
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,720
Enjoy what?

750
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,240
Just piling on Karl Rove.

751
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,960
Oh, fuck that guy.

752
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Yeah.

753
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
All right.

754
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I don't know.

755
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
I don't have any skin in that game.

756
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,200
I just, I just like to see, uh, any, any shit piled on Karl Rove is a good day for me.

757
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Sure.

758
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Yeah.

759
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,720
So in this next clip, we see Alex doing something we saw recently on a, on another, I believe

760
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,320
time travel episode that we did, we saw him pretending to discover the strategy of Google

761
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
bombing.

762
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Oh yeah.

763
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Yeah.

764
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
Yeah.

765
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
And so he's going to start a Google bomb.

766
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Okay.

767
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Of course.

768
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
So we're going to have a new search term today.

769
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
We haven't done this in a week or so.

770
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
We're gonna have a new search term.

771
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
We're going to make number one today.

772
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,000
This is the first search search term we've done.

773
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,440
Every time it's become number one, Google search the term Gates, death panels, Gates,

774
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,640
death panels with an S Gates, death panels.

775
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,880
Just search those three words in Google, in Yahoo, in every major search engine, do it

776
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,000
over and over again and send the story out to everyone and click on the story and it's

777
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
already the number one link.

778
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,240
If you type in Bill Gates, death panels on Google news, it's our story is already number

779
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
one.

780
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,560
This is Paul Watson's article from yesterday.

781
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,680
And so, uh, we're going to push this out as the number one search term and then hundreds

782
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,920
of newspapers and blogs as you've seen, we'll then go click on our story to find out what

783
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
it's about.

784
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
They'll research it.

785
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
They'll write about it.

786
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,800
It'll cause another chain reaction.

787
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,240
So Bill Gates is who we're going after today.

788
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,000
And for the next 11 years.

789
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Wow.

790
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Wow.

791
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Oh boy.

792
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah.

793
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay.

794
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,320
It's interesting to think about like the 11 years intermediate, the like different

795
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
careers.

796
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Alex and Bill Gates have had.

797
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Yeah.

798
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
They've gone on separate paths.

799
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
Yeah.

800
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,760
There was, there was a moment where they could have come together, you know, things really

801
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
diverged.

802
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Yeah.

803
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Yeah.

804
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,960
You know, it's one of those, uh, uh, I took the path less trod, you know, that kind of

805
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
thing.

806
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
Yep.

807
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Yeah.

808
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
So Alex takes calls.

809
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Um, and a lot of it ends up being about vaccines.

810
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
Sure.

811
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
And a caller, right?

812
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,840
Of course it is because you're a witch, Dan.

813
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,240
So this caller is, uh, his kid is, uh, scheduled to be vaccinated.

814
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Sure.

815
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,480
And Alex has a, has a way to, is a, he has a bad metaphor.

816
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
That's kind of what I was thinking.

817
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,560
I just wanted to, to thank you for what you do.

818
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Uh, you're my hero.

819
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,640
Uh, first of all, I just want to say that I'm really nervous.

820
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
I apologize.

821
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,200
Um, I have a two month old son.

822
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,320
Uh, he's our, our first child and he's about to get his shots.

823
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,280
Uh, he's scheduled to get in this week, uh, for the vaccines and stuff like that.

824
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,400
Um, and I really,

825
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,960
You know, that's kind of like Jews were scheduled to get on trains and go to Dachau and Auschwitz.

826
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,000
And he's like, Oh, it's your scheduling.

827
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,160
It's your time to ride the carousel and Logan's run.

828
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,000
Um, uh, I mean, just cause they say it's scheduled.

829
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,040
I mean, did they take his blood at birth for the Pentagon database?

830
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,600
Uh, I think so.

831
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I'm not real sure.

832
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,040
I mean, if he was born in a hospital, they did, but I mean, so,

833
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,400
Oh boy.

834
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah.

835
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,840
So that's the tone that he's coming at this caller with.

836
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,120
The caller's just saying that, uh, the child is scheduled to have some vaccinations.

837
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:39,000
He's like, Oh, like, uh, like Jewish people in the world war II going on trains.

838
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
They were scheduled.

839
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,120
You know, I really like not having measles.

840
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,440
Uh, and I, I think I re my childhood was better from not having measles.

841
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,160
What about all the polio you had?

842
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,620
I, I, it felt great to not have polio.

843
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,080
And of course you died of the whooping cough.

844
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Right.

845
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Yeah.

846
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
It was a struggle.

847
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
That was tough.

848
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,800
We did make it through that as a, as a unit.

849
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,240
Uh, I think that's great.

850
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,120
But 17 of your siblings died of tetanus.

851
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,200
Doesn't it seem like that should be an easier sell?

852
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Yeah.

853
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,940
Like, Hey, you know how we don't have polio?

854
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,320
That's because of the vaccines.

855
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,880
So just think Alex thinks it's cause of hand washing or something.

856
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
That really bothers me.

857
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,320
It really bothers me because of fucking witches and people being good for a while or whatever.

858
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
It's more or less about witches.

859
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
Bums me out.

860
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Yep.

861
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,880
So, uh, but it's important to see the, the way this tone works.

862
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,080
So he starts out the call and the guy just says that his kid is scheduled and Alex immediately

863
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:41,640
compares it to trains and the Holocaust, then he, he, he tries to sort of play reasonable

864
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,760
a little bit, but going back to vaccines, uh, to decision you have to make, uh, the

865
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,520
Japanese, it's gotta be more than a decade ago, made a rule, no vaccination until age

866
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,560
two, because they found completely that this stuff causes neurological problems, autoimmune

867
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,600
problems, but it's much worse when a little bitty baby has all these shots going in them.

868
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,360
By the time they grow up and get bigger and get some cognitive development, it won't stunt

869
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,540
them as much.

870
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,220
So now Alex is trying to play that, Hey, everybody's got to make their own decision and then immediately

871
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,400
jumps to this story about Japan, which is a complete lie.

872
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Yeah.

873
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,880
In 1994, Japan amended a law that they had, uh, they had a law that made vaccines mandatory

874
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,440
and they amended this making instead quote, it was more of a civic duty than a strict

875
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,800
legal obligation.

876
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,500
According to the AFP, uh, the world health organization stats from 2018 reflect a vaccination

877
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:41,020
rate of 99% for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis in one year old Japanese children and 97%

878
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,000
for the same age group with the polio vaccine.

879
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,360
Alex is just making shit up to demonize vaccination, but it's important to pay attention to that

880
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,160
way that he's trying to frame things.

881
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Yeah.

882
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,360
You know, it's the, the, the caller brings this up, he compares it to the Holocaust.

883
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,560
Hey, everybody's got to make their own decision, but also here's a lie about Japanese people.

884
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Okay.

885
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,780
So if 99%, 97% of Japanese babies, then we can look back and see if his numbers make

886
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,200
sense 25 years later or whatever it is.

887
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,400
And uh, they don't.

888
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,040
So can't we be done then?

889
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,600
Well, we can't because Alex is now- But I want to be done with anti-vax.

890
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,240
No, because Alex has said that everybody needs to make up their own mind.

891
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,960
Oh, but what if we have the proof of concept from Japan?

892
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,580
Everybody's got to, well, look, everybody's got to make up their own mind with the caller.

893
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,440
And so this caller is still on the line.

894
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
This is fucked up.

895
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,760
This is not what you do when you want someone to make up their own mind.

896
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
Does that answer your question?

897
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah.

898
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,280
I really, really appreciate that.

899
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
I appreciate your time.

900
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,040
Uh, I guess I'm just not going to do it.

901
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,200
I mean, I mean, um, but when it becomes old enough to go to school, I mean, would that,

902
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
would that be a problem?

903
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Yes.

904
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Yes.

905
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
They are criminals.

906
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
They are hardcore criminals.

907
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Again, they lie to you and say, it's the law.

908
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
He must take the shots.

909
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,680
They lied to you and said, there wasn't mercury until we forced it out in the open.

910
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,100
And now they say, okay, mercury is there.

911
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,240
It's good for you.

912
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Then they're going to lie when he goes in school and say, it's the law.

913
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,320
Your child can't be in the school without shots.

914
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,400
And you say, I know you've got the waiver.

915
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,000
It's not even a law, but it's a waiver to a non-law.

916
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,480
I know you've got a waiver that I'm supposed to fill out.

917
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,320
So they make a list of you, but courts have even shown you can eat and not even do that.

918
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,240
And then they'll lie to you again, cause they're getting money.

919
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,220
When they hit your kid with a weapon from the feds, that that's tied to the federal

920
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
money they're given.

921
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,600
Uh, they have quotas.

922
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,360
They've got to get 97% or more vaccinated.

923
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,960
They don't get their money.

924
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,580
Then then the school nurse or the principal is going to lie and say, there's no such thing.

925
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,480
And then you can already have Googled your state.

926
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:41,160
You're calling from Tennessee, Tennessee vaccine waiver, conscientious objector, religious

927
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
objector.

928
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,840
So really principal or assistant principal, here's the waiver for Tennessee.

929
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,720
You lied to me and see, you'll know you're there with a hardcore liar.

930
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,200
Again, lying trash, an entire government and corporate system trained to lie.

931
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,620
And these teachers take their kids and inject them with the mercury too.

932
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,880
And they love the fact that in many schools, a third of the schools now special ed, and

933
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,840
there's just giant warehouses of children wearing football helmets, literally because

934
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,080
they bumped their heads on the walls and in wheelchairs and in diapers and they put taser,

935
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,000
taser, uh, belts around them in the public schools.

936
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,600
Now when they don't mind, they zap them and they love it.

937
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,900
They just love all of it.

938
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,280
And soon the whole school will be in the corner drooling.

939
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,840
And by that point they can just start euthanizing everyone.

940
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,440
They are just savagely chemically hurting us as bad as they can so they can submit,

941
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,560
make us submit and then just come in and have the helicopters fly over and spray the nerve

942
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,020
gas and kill everybody.

943
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,960
They're just getting everybody ready for that.

944
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Okay.

945
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
That's hardcore truth, buddy.

946
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,240
Listen, those are criminals when they lie to you and, and, and, and try to force those

947
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
vaccines.

948
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
You understand that?

949
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
Yeah, I do.

950
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Okay.

951
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
I appreciate your call.

952
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,320
I mean, it's hitting the game, ladies and gentlemen, everybody's got to make up their

953
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
own mind.

954
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
Everybody's got to make up your own mind.

955
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,440
I mean, they're trying to murder you in your fucking bed.

956
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,800
You coward.

957
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,000
They're trying to kill you in their life.

958
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,120
But everybody's got to make up their own mind about, look, everybody's got their own choice

959
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,940
to make between getting murdered in their own bed and being a heroic patriot who gives

960
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
me money.

961
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,940
It's a simple choice.

962
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,940
Yeah.

963
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,480
Joe Rogan's on this episode of this show.

964
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,120
Maybe we should never have expected all that much from him.

965
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,440
That would have made sense.

966
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,240
That would have made sense.

967
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,280
We get another caller and this is, this is just for good clean fun.

968
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
This is a little bit of parsley.

969
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Okay.

970
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,920
This dude's asking about a JFK documentary if Alex has seen it.

971
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,200
And then we find that Alex doesn't know a very important bit of trivia about JFK.

972
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,840
Now he fancies himself kind of like a, you know, a guy who knows a lot about the conspiracy.

973
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Sure.

974
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Sure.

975
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Sure.

976
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
He's a conspiracy guy.

977
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,280
It's kind of rough that he doesn't know this bit of, it's kind of a big one, right?

978
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Incredible.

979
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Deep, deep.

980
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
You should watch it.

981
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
It's revealing.

982
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,720
Even some of the attorneys that were defending, um, uh, the guy who took over JFK's position.

983
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,600
Now I can't remember his name, uh, when he, when they assassinated him.

984
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,640
Who is a, who is the next person, the vice president who took over, I can't remember

985
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
his name now.

986
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,920
Uh, well it was, uh, it was Robert Kennedy.

987
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
What?

988
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Yeah.

989
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,560
And well, of course he was the attorney general, um, who was JFK's vice president.

990
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,640
Um, boy, I'm having a moment here.

991
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
I should know that.

992
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
Yeah, you should.

993
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Yeah.

994
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,680
You should fucking know who LB goddamn Jay is.

995
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,680
This is a big part of the conspiracy.

996
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,680
He's the reason.

997
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,680
Oh my God.

998
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:35,500
He's LBJ is probably one of the biggest reasons that Alex hates the left anyways because of

999
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,680
LBJ that we got the civil rights act through there.

1000
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,640
So I mean, not because of him, he fought tooth and nail for a long time, but it was a part

1001
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,640
of the history.

1002
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
Yeah.

1003
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Yeah.

1004
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Yeah.

1005
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
That's weird.

1006
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,440
Alex does eventually remember LBJ and then he tries to pretend that he just couldn't

1007
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,760
come up with Humphrey who was LBJ's vice president.

1008
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
Wow.

1009
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Wow, buddy.

1010
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Wow, dude.

1011
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
That's brutal.

1012
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,880
I understand if you take like a little bit of a second, but like that's too long.

1013
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Yeah.

1014
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,280
Especially for LBJ, who's kind of a big figure in American history.

1015
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,320
And a big figure in JFK assassination conspiracy theories.

1016
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Totally.

1017
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Totally.

1018
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,600
In fact, one of the many people suspected of JFK's murder.

1019
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Yeah.

1020
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Yeah.

1021
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Definitely.

1022
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Yeah.

1023
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Weird.

1024
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,120
So now we get to the point of the episode where we get the introduction of Joseph Rogan

1025
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,800
and Edward Bravo.

1026
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Oh boy.

1027
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
It's interesting.

1028
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
They have a different vibe back then.

1029
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Oh yeah?

1030
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Yeah.

1031
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
Maybe not.

1032
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Joe's definitely high.

1033
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Wow.

1034
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
It's high as hell.

1035
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
That's nice.

1036
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,800
That's good to know.

1037
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,800
But this is really awkward.

1038
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
It's really, really awkward.

1039
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,240
Well, it's good having you here and it was good seeing you last night.

1040
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
There's so much to talk about.

1041
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,880
Obviously, Joe Rogan of NewsRadio, Fear Factor, The Man Show, the list goes on and on, UFC

1042
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Ultimate Fighting Championship.

1043
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,680
You've been doing that pretty much since the start, haven't you?

1044
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,280
I started working for the UFC in 1997.

1045
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,160
I was the post-fight interviewer.

1046
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,160
So 13 years.

1047
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
Yeah.

1048
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
It's been a long time.

1049
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,440
In fact, I remember like in 99 talking to you and you're like, man, this UFC is going

1050
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
to be huge.

1051
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,440
And I never even heard of it.

1052
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,840
It's going to be bigger than the NFL.

1053
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Yeah.

1054
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,120
Everybody was like, what are you talking about?

1055
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,120
You're crazy.

1056
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Yeah.

1057
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,120
It's now look at it's giant.

1058
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,240
And it's in Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1059
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Right here.

1060
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,980
You know, when I was with Ventura last week, one of the guys from the company that does

1061
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,560
stuff for UFC was there and he was going to interview Brock Lesnar right after that when

1062
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,400
he was on the shoot with us.

1063
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,440
And so old Brock's back bigger than ever, huh?

1064
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Yeah.

1065
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Yeah.

1066
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,440
Yeah.

1067
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,440
That was great.

1068
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,560
It's not as electric as some of this present day stuff.

1069
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,360
And I think it's because Alex is sober.

1070
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:49,240
I think there is a markedly different chemistry.

1071
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,000
They might need something to grease the wheels on this.

1072
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,240
There might need to be some grease on these wheels.

1073
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,240
That's possible.

1074
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,440
Holy shit.

1075
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,800
This is not what I expected because it's chemistry.

1076
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,680
There's a chemical missing, if you will.

1077
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
Yeah.

1078
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,680
Ethanol.

1079
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,680
Yeah.

1080
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,600
Alex is sitting here with Eddie and Joe.

1081
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:18,040
All of the human elements are there for the record setting most listened to podcast ever

1082
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,040
in human history.

1083
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,960
Hundreds of millions of people have listened to it.

1084
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,720
And then the sequel that set the world on fire.

1085
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,720
On fire.

1086
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,760
And it is just trash.

1087
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,760
You gotta be drunk.

1088
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,760
So bad.

1089
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,560
You gotta be in Rogan's house and you gotta be a half of a fifth through.

1090
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,560
Yeah.

1091
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,880
I think there's some funny stuff to get into.

1092
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,880
And I think one really gigantic lie that Alex tells that I think is interesting.

1093
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,400
But this is a case of me getting hoisted on my own petard.

1094
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,120
I legitimately thought it would be fun.

1095
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
Yep.

1096
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,120
And it's kind of...

1097
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,680
It's kind of a dud.

1098
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
Well, no.

1099
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
It's not.

1100
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,600
It's a fine interview for the most part.

1101
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Sure.

1102
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Like, Rogan's high.

1103
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
Well, yeah.

1104
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,160
Like, Alex is talking about, like, oh, we were talking last night.

1105
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,800
You told me something really interesting.

1106
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,000
And it's clearly that Rogan was, like, trying to spitball.

1107
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,400
Maybe he was working on a joke or something.

1108
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Sure.

1109
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
Sure.

1110
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Sure.

1111
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,400
Sure.

1112
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,400
And Alex takes it as, like, a real point.

1113
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Oh, no.

1114
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
Last night, you were really making a lot of points that I thought were right on.

1115
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,520
Let's get into the red button.

1116
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,520
The red button.

1117
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
You were talking about how if there's a red button, they're gonna hit it.

1118
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,880
Well, you know, what I was saying is that I believe that all human behavior is natural.

1119
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Just like I believe that all animal behavior is natural.

1120
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,160
Bees make beehives and ants make anthills.

1121
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,320
These are all natural things.

1122
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,000
Humans are far more complex, but we don't think of ourselves as being natural, that

1123
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,880
we're moving in a natural direction.

1124
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,880
And I think that human beings and human society, especially with technology, I think we create

1125
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,320
technology and innovation.

1126
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,420
That's what we're here for.

1127
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,400
And it's very possible that what human beings are here for is to make some new reality,

1128
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,200
make some new technological innovation that's gonna change the world.

1129
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,840
And it could be a big bang machine.

1130
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,160
It could be a time machine.

1131
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:08,760
It could be just some incredible discovery, something that they're going to invent eventually.

1132
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,880
I mean, if they keep going with things like the Large Hadron Collider, they're not gonna

1133
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,880
stop there.

1134
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,760
They're gonna use whatever findings that they get from the Large Hadron Collider if it doesn't

1135
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
blow up the world.

1136
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,280
And they're gonna try the next thing.

1137
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,280
Well, what happens now?

1138
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,280
The goal is blow up the world.

1139
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,920
Well, I don't know what the goal is.

1140
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,080
I mean, that's just the joke.

1141
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,660
The joke is that we're here to make the big bang machine and that there's a reset button

1142
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,800
that gets pressed every 15 billion years and that these intelligent monkeys get to a point

1143
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,160
where they break down matter and try to figure out what is at the center of the universe.

1144
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,040
And they press that button and it restarts all over again.

1145
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
I mean, who knows?

1146
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
Just speculation.

1147
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,400
Wow.

1148
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Wow.

1149
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
Heavy, man.

1150
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,400
Heavy.

1151
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,400
It's some good shit, man.

1152
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,740
It's some good shit.

1153
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,520
I think Douglas Adams put it better that if the question and the answer were ever known

1154
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,520
then the universe would be destroyed and replaced by something weirder.

1155
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,000
It was a lot simpler and a lot more quick.

1156
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,840
But I mean, that kind of a thing is like, yeah, I could imagine getting high with someone

1157
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,440
like a lot of the people I knew in college and having almost identical conversations

1158
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,440
to that.

1159
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
Yeah, 100%.

1160
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

1161
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
That's fine.

1162
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,440
No.

1163
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
We've moved on to simulation theory now.

1164
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
It's the same basic thing.

1165
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
But that's a fine place for Joe to exist.

1166
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Yeah.

1167
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,360
Because he's like, okay, he's the older brother who's into weed, but maybe you've only stolen

1168
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:30,680
a few beers at this point in your development down the opening your mind spectrum.

1169
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,720
And that can be useful in people's lives.

1170
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,800
That can open up your brain to new vistas.

1171
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800
Yeah, yeah.

1172
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
It's like Val Kilmer in Real Genius.

1173
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,760
It's just not that deep.

1174
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,560
And then it's also clearly, you can tell that Joe was talking about this as some kind of

1175
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:51,200
like an idea that has the structure of a Rogan bit.

1176
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,320
It has the structure of something you could see him doing on stage.

1177
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:00,200
And Alex is like, yeah, man, you know, it is an interesting idea that humans are trying

1178
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
to make open.

1179
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
They're trying to kill us all.

1180
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,240
That's just how we're supposed to do it.

1181
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,280
It's again, not being able to parse out the like reality and sort of.

1182
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Yeah.

1183
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,280
You can't have jokes if you don't realize the transgression over reality.

1184
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,320
That's why his humor is so terrible.

1185
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:19,840
So Alex now gets to trying to plug some Eddie Bravo's jujitsu business.

1186
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,080
Guys, both of you, fire out your websites.

1187
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:31,080
Joe Rogan dot net, 10th Planet JJ dot com, 10th Planet JJ jujitsu dot com.

1188
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,280
Man, I see your 10th Planet shirts and stuff everywhere.

1189
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,040
I mean, I'm really I'm all over the country.

1190
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,640
I'll see people wearing 10th Planet stuff or talking really incredible.

1191
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,680
Well, how many how many gems do you have?

1192
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,240
Twenty five, I think, you know, something like that.

1193
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,000
Well, aren't you one of the best known jujitsu teachers?

1194
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,920
He won't toot his own horn, so I'll say yes.

1195
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,200
He's one of the most innovative and important jujitsu instructors in the country.

1196
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,600
Sounds like B.S. because he's my best friend, but it really is true.

1197
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,960
He's one of the most important.

1198
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,560
He's just smokes a lot of weed and comes up with crazy jujitsu moves.

1199
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,280
And it turns out they work.

1200
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,320
And I'm I'm also known as a conspiracy theorist freak.

1201
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,880
So that's right. He and he's more of a conspiracy theorist freak than me.

1202
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,480
Eddie sounds like kind of fun.

1203
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,760
Yeah, I'm a freak.

1204
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,720
I'm a conspiracy freak, man.

1205
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,640
That's what I'm here.

1206
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,920
But he also has to introduce that, like to the proceeding as just the energy is off.

1207
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,600
Yeah, it seems like Eddie or Alex should have just been like, let's do some conspiracy theories.

1208
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,440
That's what we're here for. Well, Eddie tries.

1209
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,200
Yeah, Eddie tries to push in that direction.

1210
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,160
That's right. But Alex can't because Eddie is a no one to him,

1211
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,320
whereas he's got to talk to Joe, the the big star or whatever.

1212
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,680
It's less that. And I think it's more that like he's not fucked up and he doesn't want to.

1213
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,920
That's fair. I just think it's that he's not fucked up.

1214
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,160
It might get too weird.

1215
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah. Although I just looked it up.

1216
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,240
It turns out that Rogan's podcast has started by this point.

1217
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,840
OK. Started in December 2009.

1218
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,440
So he's almost a year in the Rogan experience at this point.

1219
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:17,240
Yeah. So Alex is they get to talking about Eddie wants to know about the troops

1220
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,880
and the like drug trade with opium in Afghanistan.

1221
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,560
All right. OK, OK, OK.

1222
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,600
One of his one of his like is like, how do they make money on that?

1223
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,680
How do they make money selling drugs?

1224
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,280
Sure. How does the actual process work?

1225
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,360
OK, OK, OK.

1226
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,320
And we never do get an answer on it.

1227
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,000
Well, naturally.

1228
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,800
But this next clip, I think, is fascinating because it is the behavior that you see on the Joe Rogan experience

1229
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,920
whenever Alex is a guest being, you know, carried out by Joe 11 years prior.

1230
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,320
It's flowing out and the U.S. troops protect the opium.

1231
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,960
They put this on the news because if they don't, Al Qaeda will get the money.

1232
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,440
And no, no, no, I'm serious.

1233
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,880
I mean, I played a clip of Fox News or all those things, how patriotic it is to grow opium.

1234
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,840
But you think I'm joking?

1235
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,200
Come on, guys, cue it up.

1236
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,800
Oh, let's see this.

1237
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,920
You're only here for an hour because you've got to go see it at the way ends at two thirty.

1238
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,560
Yes, but I have to see that.

1239
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,960
So he calls him on it.

1240
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,400
Yeah, he calls Alex on this.

1241
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,160
Show me this video then.

1242
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,560
So they start playing the clip.

1243
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,200
But Joe and Eddie don't have headphones.

1244
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,240
Alex, but how does how do the Americans get paid for the opium is what I'm saying?

1245
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,400
How does that work?

1246
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,480
It gets the OK.

1247
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
Nineteen ninety nine.

1248
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,480
Rivera. Yep.

1249
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,840
Can we hear him?

1250
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,400
Yeah, you guys would have to have headphones on.

1251
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,560
Look, I just played it yesterday during the break.

1252
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,560
I'll play it for you.

1253
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,560
How's that sound?

1254
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,560
Sounds OK.

1255
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,560
And listeners have seen it.

1256
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,560
Exactly.

1257
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,560
Word for word.

1258
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,560
Well, there's a shill.

1259
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,560
Is your show.

1260
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,560
I don't know.

1261
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:53,440
He was the guy who introduced the he was the one who had the Zapruder film first on television.

1262
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,640
The word is he knows all about this stuff.

1263
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,680
But yeah, at Fox News, he didn't really get into it.

1264
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,680
What did he say?

1265
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,400
He goes, I'm out here with the colonel and they're out here helping them grow the opium

1266
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,000
and the colonel's like, that's right.

1267
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,200
We're going the seeds and the fertilizer.

1268
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,440
What?

1269
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,320
Here's the actual clip that Alex is talking about.

1270
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,600
That is the principal crop that is being grown here.

1271
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,380
The Taliban lend the farmers the money.

1272
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,440
They are indebted to the Taliban.

1273
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,020
They have to grow the opium.

1274
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,600
Now the Marines in their success are, in a sense, a victim of their success, because

1275
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:30,460
now the population is you know, they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it.

1276
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,040
We are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy

1277
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,640
it now, the population would turn against the Marines and it would be a real security

1278
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,640
risk.

1279
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,880
Let me introduce Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas.

1280
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,560
He's the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 6 Marines.

1281
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,040
Really a wonderful group of Marines here.

1282
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,620
I know that you care deeply about this this contradiction, the fact that here you have

1283
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,180
one of the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted.

1284
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,600
And in a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.

1285
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,200
I know it grinds at your gut.

1286
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,320
How do you deal with it?

1287
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
What are you doing about it?

1288
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,680
Well, frankly, this is a part of the culture.

1289
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,960
So while it might grind in my gut, it's what they do.

1290
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,160
We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.

1291
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,600
The alternatives are different crops to grow.

1292
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,780
They're getting the seed and the fertilizer to do it.

1293
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,680
So when Alex says the guy is talking about giving them seed and fertilizer, he's talking

1294
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:30,640
about alternative crops that they can grow instead of poppy, but that just taking all

1295
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,640
of their poppy or destroying the fields wouldn't be productive to the mission that he's trying

1296
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,720
to undertake.

1297
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,560
So Alex goes to commercial and he shows Joe this clip.

1298
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:48,400
Presumably Joe's seen it, and he's either too dumb or Alex showed him a completely edited

1299
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
version of it.

1300
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,520
Well, that is a fascinating piece of video footage with Geraldo Rivera in the poppy for

1301
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,560
with the soldiers talking about the poppy fields and how they're protecting them and

1302
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,480
providing them fertilizer and helping them grow it.

1303
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Yeah.

1304
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,480
I mean, that's incredible.

1305
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,720
It's outrageous.

1306
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,000
If you go and actually watch this, like the context of it is really clear.

1307
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,600
So you think that, you know, we were at the market and everywhere we go, they're selling

1308
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,600
these little devices.

1309
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
Take a shot of this, Greg.

1310
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,700
They're hand-carved.

1311
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:23,820
These are the little devices they use to scrape the opium sap off the plant.

1312
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,520
And I watched as you bought every one that was for sale because you care so deeply.

1313
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,520
Why'd you do that?

1314
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,520
I want them off the street.

1315
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,360
The idea is that we don't want to harvest the poppy.

1316
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,480
We want to, you know, hopefully turn the poppy over and put some wheat, cotton, watermelon,

1317
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
cucumber.

1318
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,960
It's all great stuff they grow out here.

1319
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,880
We just want to see that come to fruition and the poppy just to go away.

1320
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,960
It's completely counter to the context that Alex is describing it in, and it's also counter

1321
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,420
to the context that Joe has been convinced of.

1322
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:57,720
We want to see the poppy go away is a very hard sentence to avoid when your argument

1323
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,680
is, they're helping them grow it to kill Americans.

1324
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,120
And when Alex says specifically they're giving them the seed and the fertilizer, and when

1325
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,900
you look at that clip, it's specifically seed and fertilizer in the context of other crops

1326
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,960
they can grow instead.

1327
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:21,200
So this behavior is so consistent throughout Joe Rogan's career with Alex that I just don't,

1328
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:26,640
I can't believe that it's not, I don't know what to think about it.

1329
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,700
He can't stop himself from being like, yeah, he's too credulous towards a guy who has been

1330
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,480
lying to him since they met.

1331
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,480
Yeah.

1332
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,480
And it's wild.

1333
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,760
It doesn't feel like it's believable.

1334
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,760
No it's not.

1335
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,760
It's not believable.

1336
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,880
It's hard to, it's, I can't square the idea that he is not in on it in some fashion.

1337
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,880
Yes.

1338
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
It's not unfathomable.

1339
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,040
You can't not be at least a little bit in on it.

1340
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:57,040
This level of being duped, but like it's pathological.

1341
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,280
Like it would have to show up in all of his other relationships too.

1342
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,280
Totally.

1343
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,280
Totally.

1344
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,280
No, no, no.

1345
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,160
Everybody has to either be taking advantage of him or he's in on it in some way.

1346
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,640
But honestly, I don't think that that's too unbelievable.

1347
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,640
No, that's not.

1348
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,000
I mean, look at the people he's had on his show in the past.

1349
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,560
You have that Dave Seaman guy who's a big Pizzagate dude.

1350
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,160
You had Dave Rubin was on a bunch, Steven Crowder.

1351
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,960
Did the Molyneux on there one time?

1352
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,960
Molyneux?

1353
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,960
Couple times.

1354
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,960
Couple times.

1355
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,960
I think a couple times.

1356
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,960
It's brutal.

1357
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
Yeah.

1358
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,640
And so I think that there is a decent chance that maybe he is pathologically gullible.

1359
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,340
He's just too gullible.

1360
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,240
But then you'd think it would show up in his relationships with people like the closer

1361
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,240
folks.

1362
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,240
Like Anari Shafir.

1363
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,240
Sure.

1364
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,240
Or Tom Segura.

1365
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,240
Or Bert Kreischer.

1366
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,380
Yeah, but I mean that's why comics hang around with other comics.

1367
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,520
We don't know what you normal people are doing.

1368
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,200
We don't know what's going on with you guys.

1369
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
You could say anything.

1370
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,720
We're just trying to write bits, man.

1371
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,920
I'm just trying to write bits.

1372
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,040
I guess you've got to kind of take comedians out of the entire conversation because that's

1373
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,040
a whole other world.

1374
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:02,520
Because we're just a different, yeah, it's just weird.

1375
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:08,800
Yeah I find it difficult to believe that that's true though because it would be something

1376
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,840
that I think he would need to get therapy with or like he couldn't have made it to the

1377
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,920
point he's at now if he falls for this kind of shit on a regular basis.

1378
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,320
Oh and because I also don't understand what is so special about Alex that requires him

1379
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,400
to make excuses for decades.

1380
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:31,560
I don't know, it does seem like he has like a weird appeal to authority like hack in him

1381
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:38,760
where if you just say something so confidently and you have like a group of people who tell

1382
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,280
Joe that you're actually a very smart person and then you just say something confidently,

1383
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,240
Joe's like, wow, a lot of people have to believe this so it must be true.

1384
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,920
Because Dan Hope thinks he's cool.

1385
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,240
Yeah exactly, like it does seem like there's that just, oh okay, well I heard this was

1386
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,640
cool and this guy is, I'm told this guy is super smart so I have to at least engage with

1387
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,960
it and then it's too easy to...

1388
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:06,120
It's just remarkable to me to see the exact same dynamic though that happened in these

1389
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,700
present day podcast appearances being done to Rogan in 2010.

1390
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:17,200
This lying about the context of something, Joe calls him on it and then there's evidence

1391
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:23,120
proffered but whether the evidence that's given is selectively edited to the point where

1392
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:29,320
it only shows what Alex wants him to see or he sees it and accepts Alex's framing of it

1393
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:35,120
despite the clear context that's to the contrary, whatever it is, he's not equipped to deal

1394
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,920
with the sort of people he's associating with clearly.

1395
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,360
And now of course it's got to be 10 million times as hard because if you confront that

1396
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:52,180
reality now then you have to be like, okay, well for the past 30 years this guy I have

1397
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:57,080
thought was my friend has been a complete piece of shit liar to me.

1398
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,880
Yeah it's almost like, you know, you get that Nigerian prince email.

1399
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,920
Yeah and you're like, man, you know, I just...

1400
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,960
You respond and then you give him $1,000 and then he wants five.

1401
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,660
I don't want to be the stupid guy, I'm not going to be the stupid guy who doesn't, yeah.

1402
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,280
It's almost like Joe's pot committed on not calling out Alex at this point.

1403
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,000
It does seem like it, yeah.

1404
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Anyway.

1405
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,720
Oh boy, sorry Joe.

1406
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:25,480
Did you ever, I don't know if this is a sort of experience that I had or if it's more universal

1407
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,960
but we had a bunch of National Geographics in the house.

1408
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,380
Tons of magazines in National Geographic because they're educational, they're glossy.

1409
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,160
So as a kid I would read tons of things about forests and various animals.

1410
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,160
I would have liked that.

1411
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:47,040
I barely got dinosaurs and National Geographic was too believed in evolution for my household

1412
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,040
at the time.

1413
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,200
Well did you know that Nat Geo is putting out a lot of cover-ups?

1414
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,280
I did not know that Nat Geo is covering, okay, okay.

1415
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,680
Putting out a lot of cover-ups on the chemtrail issue.

1416
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,680
I'm here for it.

1417
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,680
You know what it is?

1418
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,480
Nat Geo puts out these, something with Nat Geo is connected with the government because

1419
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,480
you watch anything...

1420
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,440
No, no, no, National Geographic, you've all heard about how record numbers of missionaries

1421
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,040
turn out to be CIA.

1422
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,040
Really?

1423
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,040
Yeah, and record numbers of Peace Corps.

1424
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,040
What?

1425
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,040
Record to what?

1426
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,040
Compared to what?

1427
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,600
No, National Geographic is a eugenics organization and they are one of the highest level CIA

1428
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,600
fronts.

1429
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,600
Really?

1430
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,640
I'm just going to say that a lot of people will say this is Malarkey, a very good friend

1431
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,640
of mine.

1432
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,880
His father is in the CIA.

1433
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,880
Cool.

1434
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:37,000
Okay, my buddy's dad is in the CIA, so obviously Nat Geo is a fucking record, record compared

1435
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
to what?

1436
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Sure, it's meaningless.

1437
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,440
But it's never substantiated how National Geographic is a eugenics front and a high-level

1438
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,440
CIA operation.

1439
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,600
Sure, of the highest level.

1440
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,240
Just throwing that out there, and then, well, you guys are going to say this is Malarkey.

1441
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,060
But my buddy's dad is in the CIA, enough said.

1442
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,040
Joe Biden stole Malarkey from Rogan.

1443
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,040
Yeah, exactly.

1444
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1445
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,040
That's what he gave him $100 million for.

1446
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,040
That's true.

1447
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:11,640
So, there's some conspiracies that, you know, Eddie Bravo doesn't seem to be on the earth

1448
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,260
is flat tip.

1449
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,400
At least not yet.

1450
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Right.

1451
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Right.

1452
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,440
And that actually comes to a point I want to make.

1453
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,440
And that is that...

1454
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,440
The earth is flat.

1455
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,160
We've been trying to get to this for a while.

1456
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,160
Yes.

1457
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,160
Okay, I've been waiting for it.

1458
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,160
Finally.

1459
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,160
I knew it was going to come sooner or later.

1460
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,160
No.

1461
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,160
I've been waiting for it.

1462
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,160
I've been waiting for it for years.

1463
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,080
I was interested to see if you'd go back and you'd see the same conspiracies that he's

1464
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,600
into in the present being floated in 2010.

1465
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,600
Sure, yeah.

1466
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,840
Because if the earth is flat now, it was no less flat then.

1467
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:45,320
And it's not like these ideas weren't spiraling around in places on the internet.

1468
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,760
It's not like it's a recent phenomenon.

1469
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,760
Sure, sure.

1470
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,680
So, I was going back and I'm like, it's incredible there's not any flat earth stuff.

1471
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,240
And part of the reason is that that wasn't that popular in 2010.

1472
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,240
It wasn't a meme yet.

1473
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,240
On the internet.

1474
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,240
Yeah.

1475
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Exactly.

1476
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1477
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,520
And this is something that's important to understand about conspiracy theorists.

1478
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,000
They think that they're independent thinkers.

1479
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Yeah.

1480
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,600
And they think that they're like, oh, really?

1481
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,600
Really digging into stuff.

1482
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,600
Red pill, man.

1483
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,360
They are the biggest fucking followers in the world.

1484
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
Easy.

1485
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:21,480
These things are popular and then they get into them and then nothing ever happens and

1486
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,120
something else will become popular.

1487
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,120
Yeah.

1488
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,280
Like the Sandy Hook truth or whenever that was popular.

1489
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Totally.

1490
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,600
No, it's a fashionable, it's a fashion thing.

1491
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,860
Conspiracy theories are fashion.

1492
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,960
And some things are aesthetically important to retain along the way.

1493
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,960
Of course.

1494
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,520
Much like, I may not listen to the boss tones anymore but I'll still be a boss tones fan

1495
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,520
until I die.

1496
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,520
Sure.

1497
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,000
He's gonna be a 9-11 truther until he dies.

1498
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Of course.

1499
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,400
But it's maybe not the most primary thing to talk about all the time.

1500
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,160
You can't spend your life listening to the boss tones.

1501
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,160
No.

1502
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,520
And you can't spend your life always talking about 9-11 conspiracies.

1503
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,520
Exactly.

1504
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,520
Yeah, you gotta move on.

1505
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:57,800
There's going to be a piece of each of our histories and I just, I found that fascinating

1506
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,880
that it was like, well, yeah, of course.

1507
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,880
Yeah.

1508
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,880
You're into what you're into at the time.

1509
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
Totally.

1510
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,920
And it turns out something that he's into at the time is that Hurricane Katrina might

1511
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
have been fake.

1512
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,920
Oh boy.

1513
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,680
What do you think about the conspiracy theories about a Katrina being a controlled hurricane?

1514
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,760
How the way it...

1515
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,520
Multiple top meteorologists said it had two eyes for a while, it just sat there, it didn't

1516
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,760
act like a normal hurricane, and I've had the father of weather weapons on who was flying

1517
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,120
into cyclones that are over 200 miles an hour in the 40s, Ben Livingston, and this is all

1518
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,120
declassified.

1519
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,120
This is like AP.

1520
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,560
And, well, we're going to break, but to make a long story short...

1521
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,560
We're going to break already?

1522
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,560
Yeah.

1523
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,360
In 1967, it's a regular radio clock.

1524
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,280
There's like long segments, short segments.

1525
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,760
In 1967, Stanford Research Institute and the Naval Weapons Laboratory certified they can

1526
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,680
create and control hurricanes as easy as, kiss my hand, we'll be right back.

1527
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,840
So it was a weather weapon hurricane?

1528
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,120
I suppose?

1529
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,360
We don't get back to this.

1530
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,440
Why would we?

1531
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,200
It was or it wasn't, and it is.

1532
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,360
So it was.

1533
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,360
Cool.

1534
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,360
Yeah.

1535
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,360
What are the implications of that?

1536
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,720
Well, let's see.

1537
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,940
If Katrina was a controlled hurricane, sent by whom would be the first question.

1538
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,760
That is an important first question.

1539
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,680
We would assume the American government, I suppose, or a foreign power.

1540
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,680
Right.

1541
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,680
All right.

1542
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,900
So then the question would follow why, why specifically where it was attacked.

1543
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,040
So then you got to say that it's a race-based bioweapon, I would assume.

1544
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,040
I don't know.

1545
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,040
Yeah.

1546
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,720
Anyway, another conspiracy that gets floated when they come back from break is that the

1547
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,200
movie Machete is meant to start a race war.

1548
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,200
Okay.

1549
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,880
So you believe that the movie Machete with Danny Trejo is by the government designed

1550
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,360
to fuel a race war?

1551
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,560
He's a superhero Mexican home Depot guy.

1552
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,920
Just beat that out.

1553
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,920
I'm sorry.

1554
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,920
I'm sorry.

1555
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,920
I totally okay.

1556
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,720
But just, just, just, just, okay.

1557
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
We took care of that.

1558
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
Are we good?

1559
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,720
Did we take?

1560
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,720
Yeah, we did.

1561
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,720
Okay.

1562
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,720
I feel like it got out.

1563
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,720
No, it didn't.

1564
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,720
Okay.

1565
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,720
Stop guys.

1566
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,720
Come on.

1567
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,720
Sorry guys.

1568
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,720
Alex is not drunk.

1569
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,720
Did we just racial slur?

1570
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,720
I think so.

1571
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
I think we just racial slurred.

1572
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
I think so.

1573
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Yes.

1574
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,680
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1575
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,680
Wow.

1576
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:19,920
Um, but Eddie Bravo does explain that he is a Mexican individual and so, right.

1577
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,080
Uh, but it's certainly not a, I mean, this is on the radio.

1578
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,080
Yeah.

1579
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,080
I wouldn't put that one out there.

1580
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,080
Yeah.

1581
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,080
I wouldn't put your business out like that.

1582
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,080
At the time.

1583
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:32,360
Apparently they had a little bit better a delay situation.

1584
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,520
It seems like whoever was on the button on the red button there, boom, I'm there.

1585
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
Oh boy.

1586
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,520
Yeah.

1587
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
Yeah.

1588
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,520
Big bang machine.

1589
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,200
They had actual adults working for him instead of hiring teens up the street.

1590
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,200
Yeah.

1591
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,000
So at this point now we have Alex sober trying to deal with doing a show that has FCC rules

1592
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,120
with two guys who are high and one of them is clearly a lunatic.

1593
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,000
Insane and unable to deal with the FCC.

1594
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yeah.

1595
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yeah.

1596
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So he has been shamed.

1597
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Eddie has been shamed a little bit.

1598
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Sure.

1599
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,300
And so he recedes into the background while Joe complains about the governor of Arizona.

1600
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,960
How hilarious is that dumb lady that's running Arizona that Jan, whatever the hell her name

1601
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,960
is?

1602
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,360
Who's the, who's the governor of Arizona?

1603
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,040
Well, well, yeah, that was a little Jan Brewer.

1604
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,040
Yeah.

1605
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,040
That lady is so dumb.

1606
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,760
Have you ever seen her on TV?

1607
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,960
Oh my God.

1608
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,300
When she was on the debate and she just paused, she didn't know what to say.

1609
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,780
She paused for like 10 solid seconds, said nothing.

1610
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,060
She makes up stuff about people getting their heads cut off over in Arizona that Mexicans

1611
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,080
are coming over here and cutting people's heads off.

1612
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,520
And then they're like, where are these bodies?

1613
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
Like, what are you talking about?

1614
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,520
Wow.

1615
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,920
It sounds like Alex present day.

1616
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,920
Wow.

1617
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,920
Yeah.

1618
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,920
Wow.

1619
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,920
Yeah.

1620
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,320
I don't think Joe should be allowed to call anybody dumb.

1621
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,320
No.

1622
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,320
Yeah.

1623
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,240
It's, it's tough to hear.

1624
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,240
Yeah, buddy.

1625
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,000
Um, but yeah, it's, it's interesting cause Alex then has to sort of rebut a little bit

1626
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
because he is also quite xenophobic.

1627
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Yeah.

1628
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,880
He's trying to be, yeah, you're cutting in on my racism here, buddy.

1629
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,160
And the governor is a Republican.

1630
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,160
Right.

1631
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,760
And he's like, you know, there is the need to have sort of at least a little bit of a

1632
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,760
pushback.

1633
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,760
Yeah.

1634
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,480
Um, and then Eddie gets back in the mix.

1635
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,480
Sure.

1636
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,480
He tries again.

1637
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,480
Element of chaos.

1638
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,480
Let me, let me just say something.

1639
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,400
I'm not a big fan and Joe knows this.

1640
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,400
I hate super movie.

1641
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,480
Eddie Bravo.

1642
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,480
Come on man.

1643
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,480
We're on the radio.

1644
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,480
I'm sorry.

1645
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,480
I can't bring him with me anymore.

1646
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,480
This is ridiculous.

1647
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,480
He's not a professional.

1648
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,560
I hate superhero movies.

1649
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:36,080
I hate super, I'm a Mexican, El Machete wasn't the greatest plot ever.

1650
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,280
So he's trying to get back to Machete.

1651
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,280
Yeah.

1652
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,280
Is that what we were doing?

1653
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,280
Yeah.

1654
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,280
So he doesn't like superhero movies.

1655
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,280
Uh huh.

1656
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,280
Something got bleeped.

1657
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,280
Yeah.

1658
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,280
Okay.

1659
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:54,920
Now as Eddie goes on, I think he's making actually a fairly decent point.

1660
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:02,280
And that is, you know, when I, as somebody of Mexican descent, uh, heritage, I see Spider-Man.

1661
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,960
I can't identify with Spider-Man.

1662
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Sure.

1663
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,960
I don't identify with Batman.

1664
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
Sure.

1665
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
This rich asshole with all his gadgets.

1666
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,960
Of course not.

1667
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,840
I don't, uh, I don't see myself in these, these heroes and for me maybe Machete is somebody

1668
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,680
that I can see as, and Alex is like, nah, nah, nah, he's not nice enough to white people.

1669
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,680
Oh boy.

1670
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,240
You know, as a Mexican, you can't relate to Spider-Man.

1671
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:30,440
That's a white nerd who, you know, and then, and then, uh, um, wait, as Mexican people,

1672
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,440
we have nothing.

1673
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,240
Now we have something, you know, Superman, a white guy from another galaxy.

1674
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,120
Now we have El Machete, you know, for me, I've felt like, why couldn't it be a Mexican

1675
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:45,320
scientist who, you know, who becomes the incredible Hulk or something.

1676
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,080
The Mexican superhero hacks up gringos.

1677
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,680
Pull up with an axe.

1678
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
That's ridiculous.

1679
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,680
Yeah.

1680
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,680
He's a Mexican long hair.

1681
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,680
Well, let me tell you something.

1682
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,800
Let me tell you something.

1683
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,360
The Mexicans I know that warned me about this film that run the production.

1684
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:03,360
They didn't like the stereotype of Mexicans as working at home Depot and wanting to kill

1685
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,360
gringos.

1686
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,360
I like that.

1687
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,960
Oh, well, this has been an insane interview, Eddie Bravo, you, you just really ruined the

1688
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,960
whole cause.

1689
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,400
Did we get another racial slur burped out?

1690
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,400
No, I don't think so.

1691
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,720
I think it was just awkward silence.

1692
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,720
Oh, okay.

1693
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,720
Yeah.

1694
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,720
Yeah.

1695
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,720
It makes a fine point.

1696
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,720
Yeah.

1697
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,720
For the most part.

1698
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,200
I mean, I think that's an acceptable point and I think Alex's point is essentially just,

1699
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,200
I don't know.

1700
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,200
Whoa.

1701
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,200
Whoa.

1702
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,200
Whoa.

1703
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,200
Whoa.

1704
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,200
We can't be having superheroes who aren't nice to white people.

1705
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,200
Let's calm it down.

1706
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,200
Oh, a superhero who doesn't like white people.

1707
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Then what would be the point of superheroes?

1708
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,200
Yup.

1709
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
Oh boy.

1710
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,440
So we get a really big revelation on this episode.

1711
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,440
What's that?

1712
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:49,440
That Superman helped defeat the KKK's expansion efforts in his radio serials?

1713
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,440
No.

1714
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,440
Oh, okay.

1715
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:57,440
The mainstream media, the MSM failed to pick up on this, what could be the largest story

1716
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,440
of our times.

1717
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,440
Okay.

1718
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,600
And that is that Alex Jones knows how to mind control birds.

1719
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,240
I've even tried this with birds around my house and things.

1720
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:10,080
If I come out and even put in my mind the intent, like I'm going to kill that bird without

1721
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,840
even having a weapon, the bird flies off.

1722
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,200
But if you're just being out nice and friendly, you know, the birds just sit there, almost

1723
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,200
land on your hand.

1724
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,760
They're all, I've got all these tame swallows around my house.

1725
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,200
So it's almost like there's something telepathic they pick up on the intent.

1726
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,680
Someone is going to take this clip and use it and say, Alex Jones uses mind control on

1727
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,680
birds.

1728
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,560
They probably will.

1729
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,280
I have fulfilled the prophecy.

1730
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,800
Alex Jones uses mind control on birds.

1731
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,800
I just had to play it to the bed.

1732
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,800
You had to do it.

1733
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,800
You had to do it.

1734
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,800
You couldn't not do it.

1735
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,800
Yeah.

1736
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
It had to be done.

1737
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,800
I was a little bored.

1738
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,800
Yeah.

1739
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,520
At this point, like things are kind of starting to fall apart a little bit.

1740
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,520
Yeah.

1741
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,520
I can sense that.

1742
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,880
I think Eddie and Joe's patience and their high is like, kind of like, I want to have

1743
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,880
fun.

1744
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,880
It's abating.

1745
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,880
I want out of here.

1746
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,880
Alex isn't having fun.

1747
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,440
Whenever Eddie starts trying to talk in his, like just the normal way he socially communicates,

1748
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,640
he ends up saying things that he can't say on the radio.

1749
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,640
Yeah.

1750
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,480
It's like when you go visit your friend at work, you're not allowed to be like, oh, hey,

1751
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,560
we're at this hardware store.

1752
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,000
Let me drop some racial slurs.

1753
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Yeah.

1754
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You can't do it.

1755
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yeah.

1756
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,080
And so it's the last clips here.

1757
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,080
Is it possible?

1758
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,720
Is it, you would know, is it possible to create a bomb that makes everybody gay?

1759
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,000
Was that possible?

1760
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Probably not.

1761
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Okay.

1762
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Probably not.

1763
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Probably not.

1764
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh boy.

1765
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Probably not.

1766
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,280
And this is where like sort of questions are coming a little faster.

1767
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,280
Yeah.

1768
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,280
Yeah.

1769
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,280
Can we make a gay bomb?

1770
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,280
Probably not.

1771
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,280
Yeah.

1772
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,280
Are you disappointed in Charlie Sheen?

1773
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,280
Are we doing lightning round?

1774
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,280
A little bit.

1775
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,280
Okay.

1776
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,280
When Charlie Sheen choked his wife, were you like, damn, you're messing up the cause.

1777
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,600
Like I had you on the program.

1778
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,040
You were looking good.

1779
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:52,880
Charlie Sheen calling for full disclosure on nine one one and then he's got to go and

1780
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,680
well, he needs a vaccine for that.

1781
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,680
Is that what it is?

1782
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,560
That would make me look, I'm not going to get into that whole story.

1783
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,920
I'm not going to get into that whole story, but all I wanted to know is does this ever

1784
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,920
wear on you?

1785
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,280
I mean, you're constantly dealing with negative stuff by the way.

1786
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,280
Charlie's a good guy.

1787
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,280
He is a good guy.

1788
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,280
Okay.

1789
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,520
Charlie's good guy, but also chokes his wife.

1790
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,080
Hey Joe, I'm going to go with one.

1791
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:22,900
It says a lot about you and Alex that your first thought of Alex's reaction was, how

1792
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:28,960
is Alex going to take this as personally hurting him as opposed to giving a shit about the

1793
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,060
fact that, uh, let me, let me actually clarify that even more.

1794
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:40,760
He's saying, how is this going to affect the cause that Alex is pretending to be so passionately

1795
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,920
fighting for?

1796
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:48,240
How is Charlie Sheen's personal transgressions going to hurt Alex's crusade against imaginary

1797
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,120
windmills?

1798
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,680
Now here's where things turned for me.

1799
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,000
I mean, I feel like that's super dark.

1800
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,880
That's that's a real dark clip that just happened right there.

1801
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,600
Oh, you know, Ooh, I have bad news.

1802
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,840
It's going to get more dark.

1803
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,840
Yeah.

1804
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,160
Oh, but that one was really dark.

1805
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:10,560
That's like, um, sort of violence trigger warning maybe for this next clip where Joe

1806
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,640
goes next, by the way, Charlie's a good guy.

1807
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,640
I use a good guy.

1808
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,640
I'm a fan.

1809
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,640
I'm a fan.

1810
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,640
Platoon was an awesome movie.

1811
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,640
I'm a fan of Charlie Sheen.

1812
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,400
Have you ever, some chicks need to be choked.

1813
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,400
How about that?

1814
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:26,520
Some of them get a little mouthy and you want to get out to them and know who's paying the

1815
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,520
rent here.

1816
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,520
All right.

1817
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,520
Freak.

1818
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,520
Is it illegal to choke a girl?

1819
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,520
Yes.

1820
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,520
I'm kidding.

1821
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,520
I don't choke anybody.

1822
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,640
I don't choke girls, especially unless they want it.

1823
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,640
And then it's free.

1824
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,640
Okay.

1825
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,640
That's enough.

1826
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,640
Yeesh.

1827
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,640
That's dark.

1828
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,640
Yeah.

1829
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,680
Significantly darker than I was expecting.

1830
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,680
Yeah.

1831
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:48,000
I mean, you know, I guess what you'd call it is the sort of like playful misogyny of

1832
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
2010.

1833
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,960
This, uh, yeah.

1834
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,960
Wow.

1835
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:57,760
I suppose you could, I, wow, it is, it is like, it's really, it, you know, when you

1836
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,280
go back and you watch a nineties movie, like when you rewatch trading places, I rewatch

1837
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,740
that and you're like, well, you could get away with a lot of shit there, but then you

1838
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:10,140
think it's 2010 and you couldn't get away with that.

1839
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,140
That's too recent.

1840
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,040
No, you could get away with that shit in 2010 for sure.

1841
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,040
Yeah.

1842
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,040
Yeah.

1843
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,040
It's wild.

1844
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,040
I, I, I, Jesus.

1845
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,480
It's not a joke.

1846
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,480
No, it's not.

1847
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,480
It's not a joke.

1848
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:27,120
He thinks it's a joke, but even if it, you know, even if it is a joke, it's not like,

1849
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,580
it's not a well-constructed joke.

1850
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,640
It's not, it's not a new thought.

1851
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,680
It's really just playing on the edge of sometimes domestic violence is warranted honeymooners

1852
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,160
level shit.

1853
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,680
That's what we're talking about here.

1854
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,680
Yeah.

1855
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,680
Yes.

1856
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,680
In the 1950s, Jackie Gleason can be like, Oh, I'm going to hit you.

1857
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:47,680
Like, yeah, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1858
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,680
Yeah.

1859
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,680
It's very, it's very strange.

1860
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,600
But one of the things that I think is even more strange is that Alex can sense the like

1861
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:58,800
responsibility he has as a host, which he has completely abdicated in present days.

1862
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
Gone.

1863
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:05,640
He's he has, he feels some responsibility to be like, come on, man, come on.

1864
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,840
That would be interesting to hear today.

1865
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,480
Would he just be like, yeah, no, right.

1866
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,480
Like who's that?

1867
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,480
Yes.

1868
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,480
He would have to.

1869
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,480
Right.

1870
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,120
Cause he had, he does not give a shit.

1871
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,120
No.

1872
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,120
God damn.

1873
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,120
Yeah.

1874
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,120
It is kind of interesting.

1875
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:27,600
He had some semblance in 2010 of something that was precluding him and stopping him from

1876
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,680
going into that.

1877
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:34,120
Maybe it's a possibility of like, the audience was more family audience at that time.

1878
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Could be.

1879
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,200
Maybe there was more of a puritanical streak to the people who had listened to him on the

1880
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:43,920
radio and shortwave, which was the most of his audience as the internet and the supplement

1881
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,200
lines came in.

1882
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:52,820
Maybe he didn't have to keep such a pretend air of, uh, Hey, this kind of conversation

1883
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,580
doesn't fly here, gentlemen.

1884
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:57,560
I imagine getting kicked off of social media and stuff.

1885
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,080
Probably that was much later though.

1886
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:03,720
I think he'd given up some of that, uh, Oh, even back at like 2014.

1887
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:08,800
I bet he would let Joe Rogan riff a little bit more, even if it was getting into territories

1888
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:16,080
that was seemingly advocating for, even if it's facetiously advocating for, sometimes

1889
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,760
women deserve to be choked.

1890
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,760
Yeah.

1891
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,760
Yeah.

1892
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,760
Like it's, uh, yeah, it's weird.

1893
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:21,760
Yeah.

1894
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,740
This is a real misogynist episode for Joe.

1895
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:30,000
I wouldn't, if I were Joe, I wouldn't look back on this episode, calling Jan Brewer dumb

1896
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,160
and then, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1897
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:39,280
The critique of the Arizona governor, if in a vacuum, could be seen as like things that

1898
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,200
this politician did were dumb.

1899
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,200
Sure.

1900
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,320
You could view them outside of like unnecessarily misogynistic stuff.

1901
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,320
Sure.

1902
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,320
Sure.

1903
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,440
It's tough to, when like, I just wish that conversation.

1904
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,240
To be clear, Jan Brewer, not a good governor.

1905
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,240
Yeah.

1906
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,000
I wish that that conversation wasn't there.

1907
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Yeah.

1908
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Yeah.

1909
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
We could not have that.

1910
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I wish it was.

1911
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,520
Cause then it could just be like, Oh, isn't it funny Eddie thinks that Katrina was fake

1912
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,720
and he keeps saying slurs on air and he keeps getting bleeped.

1913
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,720
Yeah.

1914
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,720
Yeah.

1915
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,300
So anyway, uh, this gets a little bit uncomfortable and uh, they, they, you know, they have to

1916
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:17,440
come towards the end here and uh, Joe has to be like, Alex, you're fun.

1917
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,800
You're fun to hang out with, man.

1918
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,800
Okay, sure.

1919
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,600
Saying that, you know, you're a, you're a fun guy to hang around with and people always

1920
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,200
say, man, you're friends with Alex Jones.

1921
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,200
Is that a bummer?

1922
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,600
And I'm like, no man, Alex Jones is a cool guy.

1923
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,760
We have a good time.

1924
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,960
Last night we went to Fogo to chow, we had some delicious meat.

1925
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,960
It was awesome.

1926
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:33,960
We had a great time.

1927
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,200
Then we went out to the comedy club and we went out to dinner afterwards.

1928
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,200
We had a great time.

1929
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,200
We hung out.

1930
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,200
I had a lot of laughs.

1931
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,200
There was no doom and gloom and you know, it was like, man, hanging out with Alex Jones

1932
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,200
must be a bummer.

1933
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,480
You know, the dude's always talking about the end of the world and vaccines robbing

1934
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,480
your soul.

1935
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,360
And no, you're, you're fun.

1936
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,280
I mean, he's been defensive about hanging out with Alex for over a decade.

1937
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,280
Yeah, man.

1938
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,560
You got to ask yourself why.

1939
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,560
Yeah.

1940
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,560
Why would that be?

1941
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,560
Yup.

1942
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,560
Yup.

1943
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:08,560
Why is it that people think, hey, that guy you keep vouching for bad news over the course

1944
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:13,040
of a decade, constantly having people be like, don't do that.

1945
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,040
Yeah.

1946
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,700
I mean, that is though, that is such comedy.

1947
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:21,320
That is such like the way that it's worked for so long in comedy of just like, yeah,

1948
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,920
there's a little bit of permissiveness.

1949
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,600
It's totally like, oh yeah, yeah, no, no, no, I know, I've heard he's a fucking monster,

1950
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,840
but he's always been cool to me.

1951
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,440
I haven't seen that behavior.

1952
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,440
Exactly.

1953
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:36,240
So, so I totally, so that means he can't be a violent misogynist racist.

1954
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,240
Yeah.

1955
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,240
Yeah.

1956
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,920
I wouldn't listen to his show to see what happened right before I came on.

1957
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,320
Oh, that'd be a terrible idea.

1958
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,320
No.

1959
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,320
That's office behavior.

1960
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,320
That's not fun.

1961
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,320
Yeah.

1962
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,880
Also, there's another funny thing.

1963
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,000
They're talking about Brock Lesnar and he had like diverticulitis and they were talking

1964
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,720
about how like it was because he just ate meat before.

1965
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,720
Sure.

1966
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,720
And that's not good.

1967
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,720
That's bad.

1968
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:05,400
And that's really funny to me because Joe would later have Jordan Peterson on his podcast

1969
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,840
advocating his all meat diet.

1970
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,840
Jesus.

1971
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,320
Jesus Christ.

1972
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,200
I hate these people.

1973
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,560
I hate these people so much.

1974
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,560
Yep.

1975
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,560
Yeah.

1976
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,960
I mean it has to be, it could also be, I could see it being this where it's like Joe discounts

1977
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,200
anything that happens on the show.

1978
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,700
He's just like, yeah, Alex does his show and it's all bullshit.

1979
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:30,440
It's entertainment for, and nothing he says matters on the show.

1980
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,820
It only matters what he says whenever he's off air, when he's a person.

1981
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,680
Does it matter what he says on your show, Joe?

1982
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,680
Exactly.

1983
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,600
Because it's the same, a lot of it is the same.

1984
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,600
You would think.

1985
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,600
There's overlap.

1986
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,600
Yeah.

1987
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,880
And then just like, maybe it is, look, I get it.

1988
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:50,520
If Joe and Alex are super good friends and Joe knows for a fact that Alex is full of

1989
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:56,000
shit and is blah, blah, blah, blah, it's all made up shit, he's still a friend that is

1990
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,560
directly responsible for so much evil happening.

1991
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,560
Yeah, no.

1992
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,560
Even if you think he's faking it.

1993
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,560
Yeah.

1994
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,560
It's almost worse.

1995
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,560
It's not almost.

1996
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,560
It may be worse.

1997
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,560
It's worse.

1998
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,560
Yeah.

1999
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,560
I think you could have a debate on that.

2000
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,560
It's more malicious.

2001
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,560
Yeah.

2002
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,560
Yeah.

2003
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,560
Emptier.

2004
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:21,080
Signing off on it, whether it's real or you know it's fake, is ethically both bad.

2005
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,000
No, it's not good at all.

2006
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah.

2007
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Yeah.

2008
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
There's no way out for Joe.

2009
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,080
There's no redemption for that whatsoever.

2010
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,080
No.

2011
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,040
It's just been over a decade of negligence on his part, not recognizing the cancerous

2012
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:38,560
and toxic influence of this guy that he just has fun at a steakhouse with.

2013
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,560
Yeah.

2014
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2015
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,360
There's a pathetic lack of responsibility on his part.

2016
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,360
Yeah.

2017
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:51,400
It's interesting to me that we've seen it on Joe's show whenever we've talked about

2018
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,400
these present ones.

2019
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,400
Mm-hmm.

2020
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,680
I didn't think it went like that exact same behavior.

2021
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,240
It's the same things.

2022
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:04,320
It's annoying to me the way that you'll hear in these interviews in the present that's

2023
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,240
like, ah, we put on those Bush masks.

2024
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,240
Yeah.

2025
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,200
And they have that same story that they tell that sort of solidifies their friendship and

2026
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,560
their connection, and that's annoying.

2027
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Yeah.

2028
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:21,240
But it's even more annoying to go back to the past in 2010 and see the inability to

2029
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:27,360
fact check claims Alex has made that you instinctually think aren't correct, and then at the same

2030
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:32,880
time be like, ah, you're fun, making excuses for misinformation and complete fraud based

2031
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,560
on like, we have fun.

2032
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,560
Yeah.

2033
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:43,240
And I think I find it viscerally fucked up to go back nearly, like a decade, and see

2034
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:48,280
no change, like no growth, and if anything, regression.

2035
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,280
Yes.

2036
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,280
I would say regression.

2037
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,280
That's fucked.

2038
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,280
Yeah.

2039
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,280
That really fucks with my head.

2040
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,280
Yeah.

2041
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,800
You know, because in my time period, I think we can go back through our show and see just

2042
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,880
pretty consistent like, there's growth, there's change, there's something.

2043
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,680
Yeah, there's some missteps here and there.

2044
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2045
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:12,420
We fuck up, we grow, we move on, and we're, yeah, we do what we can, but to be stasis,

2046
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,640
to just be that, and then get worse.

2047
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:21,860
I see Joe kind of worse because I think he's gotten more entrenched in these positions

2048
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:25,720
of like, hey, Alex is a fun guy, why does everyone not want me to hang out with him?

2049
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:26,720
Totally.

2050
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:32,960
And if he's so consistently being lied to by Alex, Alex showing him either fraudulent

2051
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,520
or misrepresented proof of his claims, he's just gotten deeper and deeper in those holes.

2052
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,520
Yeah.

2053
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,160
I think Eddie seems more delightful at this point.

2054
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,160
Yeah.

2055
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,160
Yeah.

2056
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,040
I agree.

2057
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:49,320
There's something about him that just is delightful and good-

2058
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,320
No, I get it.

2059
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:56,720
There's a nature about him that kind of, I enjoy it when he chimes in with like a, I'm

2060
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,720
a conspiracy freak.

2061
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,720
No, I get it.

2062
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,720
I get it.

2063
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,720
I appreciate John.

2064
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,720
I appreciate the problem.

2065
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:05,320
He has a self-awareness too of himself back then.

2066
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,320
Yeah.

2067
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,320
Like I'm a conspiracy freak.

2068
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,360
He introduces himself as such.

2069
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,760
He's a recognition that some of the things that he's saying are probably dumb.

2070
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:13,760
Yeah.

2071
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,960
He's articulating important things about representation and media.

2072
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:18,960
I don't know.

2073
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,960
It's just, it's weird.

2074
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,720
All of these people are doing worse now.

2075
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,720
Yeah.

2076
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,720
Yeah.

2077
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:29,760
Eddie seems so, he's just a guy who's like, I know everybody's laughing at me and I've

2078
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,800
accepted that and I'm cool with it because I've still got me.

2079
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,120
I've still got my stuff and I'm respected in the field where I'm meant to be respected

2080
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,120
at.

2081
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,120
Yeah.

2082
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,880
And if you laugh at me whenever I say some stupid conspiracy theories, yeah, man, conspiracy

2083
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:42,880
theories are stupid.

2084
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
You should laugh.

2085
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,520
Then a couple of years later, my best friend has a hundred million dollars.

2086
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,520
A hundred million dollars.

2087
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,480
Hey, maybe I start taking this a little bit more seriously.

2088
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,480
Maybe too seriously.

2089
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,480
Yeah.

2090
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,480
Yeah.

2091
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,480
Oh boy.

2092
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,480
Anyway, we have one last clip.

2093
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,480
Okay.

2094
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:04,800
About Y2K, which is an interesting, interesting, uh, Alex's question, uh, his answer, uh, is,

2095
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,760
uh, O'Donnell Ian in its non forthrightness.

2096
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,760
Okay.

2097
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,960
Alex, I got a question about the Y2K you were saying.

2098
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,000
I was listening to old tapes and you were saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2099
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,600
I did nine hours of radio on Y2K on the Genesis network.

2100
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,600
You notice that before a question was even asked, Alex goes into defensive mode.

2101
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,600
Yeah.

2102
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,600
Yeah.

2103
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,840
And my best friend runs in on my wife and she says, they're on ABC news saying a missile

2104
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:30,840
was launched from Russia.

2105
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:31,840
Ooh.

2106
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,840
Now it's his wife's fault.

2107
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,840
Yeah.

2108
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,040
So I run back out there and ABC news is saying a missile has been fired for Russia.

2109
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,840
So I said, I don't know what it means, but a missile has been fired for Russia.

2110
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,360
Then they come back and say, Oh, it was just a scud.

2111
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,480
We have to have the Russians here at NORAD and it was like some kind of drill or something.

2112
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,360
And then I went on a guy named Michael Trudeau show that day and made jokes about it.

2113
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,580
So people took nine hours and edited nine hours.

2114
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:57,960
Part of it, me joking around, like Joe was saying earlier, like nuclear plants were blowing

2115
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,960
up.

2116
01:26:58,960 --> 01:26:59,960
Yeah, no, it's not true.

2117
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:00,960
No, no.

2118
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,080
What they did is they just took pieces and I got to have an AP article saying, well,

2119
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,400
six plants are going offline.

2120
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,960
And then an hour later they'd say it wasn't true.

2121
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,480
They were doing that to create fear.

2122
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:13,240
Like, like I didn't believe in Y2K at first, then the, then the Pentagon said it was going

2123
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,240
to be real.

2124
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,240
Then I started believing it.

2125
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,760
And then right before they said, Oh, we never said that.

2126
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,760
It was a psyop.

2127
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,760
Oh, Ooh.

2128
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:19,760
What?

2129
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,760
Okay.

2130
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,240
What did you, I don't know.

2131
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,640
I feel like even those excuses are contradictory nonsense.

2132
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,640
Yeah.

2133
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,560
No, it was my wife who told me, but I didn't believe it.

2134
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,560
And so it's her fault.

2135
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,560
But also when the Pentagon said it, I was like, well, obviously it's true.

2136
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,080
I didn't believe that because it's their fault.

2137
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,400
I was the mainstream media did the thing and that's it.

2138
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,400
And that's their fault.

2139
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,000
None of this is my fault at all.

2140
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,520
I was on air for nine air, uh, nine hours and they've taken everything out of context.

2141
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,520
Totally.

2142
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,520
They've misrepresented.

2143
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,520
I've been smeared.

2144
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,600
I have been smeared, sir.

2145
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,600
Simultaneously.

2146
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,440
I was reporting on things that were a hundred percent accurate because the media was trying

2147
01:27:54,440 --> 01:28:00,400
to create fear about Y2K reporting on these media stories that were designed to make fear,

2148
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,600
but then they retracted those stores.

2149
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,920
Wait, w w w which is it?

2150
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,280
It's both neither and everything all at once.

2151
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,280
Such horseshit.

2152
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,280
Yup.

2153
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,280
Anyway.

2154
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,280
What an asshole.

2155
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,280
Yup.

2156
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,840
Um, this is an interesting glimpse.

2157
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,560
Couldn't you just one time be like, Oh yeah, I fucked up on that one.

2158
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,960
It's not even, it wouldn't even have to be.

2159
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,960
No explanation.

2160
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,960
No.

2161
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:24,960
Just like, yeah, that one's on me.

2162
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,960
My bad.

2163
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,960
I think it's too embarrassing.

2164
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,960
It has to be.

2165
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,960
Yeah.

2166
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,320
Because I love the second episode.

2167
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,440
Yeah, that's true.

2168
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,360
And looking at the Y2K episode of his show.

2169
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:42,120
And I think, I think some of the stuff that he was doing was like, it's really too far.

2170
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,120
Yeah.

2171
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:48,320
He was saying that like bases were being set up at an Austin airport for people to be around.

2172
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,320
Everyone's out of gas.

2173
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,320
Yup.

2174
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,720
The gas stations are out of food.

2175
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,720
It went hard.

2176
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,720
Yeah.

2177
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,720
I remember.

2178
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,480
I think owning that is too hard to do.

2179
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,640
So you have to create a defensive straw man about like what actually happened and then

2180
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,440
people like Eddie will just give you a pass.

2181
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,440
Yeah, that's true.

2182
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,440
You gotta go to commercial anyway.

2183
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,440
Yeah, that's fair.

2184
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,440
That's fair.

2185
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,440
You hear the music.

2186
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,440
Yeah.

2187
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,680
Run out the clock on this answer and then Eddie will drop it.

2188
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,680
Yeah.

2189
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,500
Or we'll get to commercial and I'll be like, Eddie, that is not a fair question to ask

2190
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,500
me on air.

2191
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,500
Hey, don't ask me that question.

2192
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,500
Yeah.

2193
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,500
You know we're playing a game here.

2194
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,500
It's stupid.

2195
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,500
Yeah.

2196
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:22,500
And now you're making me feel bad.

2197
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,500
Stop it.

2198
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,080
Eddie, you're high and having fun.

2199
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,360
I am not.

2200
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:33,080
So we get to the end of this and I think this is an interesting glimpse back if only for

2201
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,160
this dynamic is so different and so similar.

2202
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,160
Yeah.

2203
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,760
It's similar in the ways that you hate and it's different in the ways that you miss.

2204
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,760
Yup.

2205
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,920
It's not fun in the way that these present day interviews are because Alex is fucked

2206
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,920
up.

2207
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,920
Right, right.

2208
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:48,920
Yeah.

2209
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:49,920
It's nonsensical.

2210
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,920
It's nonsensical.

2211
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:57,000
Yeah, Alex is more willing to like keep the ramble going, keep the riff going long enough

2212
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,240
to where he hangs himself with too much rope, like that kind of thing.

2213
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,240
Yeah.

2214
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:04,640
Whereas on this show he's trying to cut stuff off before he looks too stupid.

2215
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:08,000
He's trying to protect the business.

2216
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Yup.

2217
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Yup.

2218
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,280
So anyway, we'll be back to the present for our next episode or you know, probably.

2219
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,840
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

2220
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:17,840
We do have a website.

2221
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,840
It's knowledgefight.com.

2222
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,840
We are also on Twitter.
