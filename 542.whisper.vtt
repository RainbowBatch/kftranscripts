N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
Knowledgefight.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.360
Knowledgefight.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.360
Riddle her.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.360
Riddle her.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
Riddle her.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.360
I need money.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.360
Riddle her.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.360
Riddle her.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.360
Riddle her.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.360
Andy and Kansas.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
Andy and Kansas.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.360
Stop it.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.360
Andy and Kansas.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.360
Andy and Kansas.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.360
It's time to pray.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.360
Andy and Kansas.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.360
You're on the air.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.360
Thanks for holding.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.360
Hello Alex, I'm a fish and color.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
I'm a huge fan.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.360
I love your room.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.360
Knowledgefight.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.360
Knowledgefight.com.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.360
I love you.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.360
I love you.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
I love you.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.360
I'm Dan.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.360
I'm Jordan.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.120
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk just a little

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Oh indeed we are Dan.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.120
Jordan.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.120
Jordan.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.120
I have a quick question for you.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.120
What's up?

01:11.120 --> 01:12.120
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.120 --> 01:13.120
My bright spot today is another counter shout out.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.120
Another counter shout out.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.120
Counter bright spot.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.120
A counter bright spot.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.120
Aha.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.600
An anti bright spot.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.720
I could not resist the urge while I was sitting around in the house.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.600
I saw those Coca Cola with coffee staring at me.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
You did it again.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.840
Then I tried the vanilla one.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.320
I swear you learn better than anyone else in certain areas and in others you're simply

01:34.320 --> 01:35.320
impossible.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.320
I'm a glutton for punishment.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.320
You are.

01:37.320 --> 01:42.000
When it comes to weird packaged goods.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.160
I've never had it before, it's like your guiding light whenever you're at a store.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.920
Yeah but it also, it's a pretty specific space.

01:49.920 --> 01:50.920
That's true.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.160
Because if it was like Coca Cola now with octopus.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.760
Right, right, right.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.480
That's not going to do it.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.960
It has to also intrigue you.

01:57.960 --> 01:58.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58.960 --> 01:59.960
I get ya.

01:59.960 --> 02:05.360
And kind of a really like 13 year old kid might get excited by this kind of way.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.280
Ooh it's a new type of Nerds.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.280
That's my sweet spot.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.280
Speaking of which they have those Nerds clusters.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.280
They got the Nerds Ropes?

02:11.280 --> 02:12.280
They got Nerds clusters.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.040
No, Nerds Ropes came out like 15, 20 years ago.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.220
Okay fine, fine.

02:15.220 --> 02:18.280
We sold those at the movie theater I used to work out when I was like 17.

02:18.280 --> 02:22.040
I'm sorry I'm not a snack nerd if you will Dan.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.880
So I tried the vanilla one and I gotta say it was better.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
Okay.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
Still really bad.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.880
All right, all right.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Still disgusting.

02:31.880 --> 02:32.880
Okay.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.080
But it was kind of like you know the vanilla masked some of the problems of the coffee.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
Sure.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
Let's add a fourth flavor in here.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.280
Let's throw, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.900
Let's just keep tossing stuff in there.

02:41.900 --> 02:47.120
Cherry vanilla coffee coke, let's see if we can fucking make this taste not atrocious.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.420
It's like when somebody describes wine tea and they're like it's got an oaky finish and

02:50.420 --> 02:54.080
there's hints of fruit in there and somebody's like well what if we just added all those

02:54.080 --> 02:55.080
flavors into coke?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.760
It'd be like a regular drink.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.760
Yeah, yeah.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.120
I say sommelier, I say nay.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.400
Samala nay.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.000
I'm gonna try the caramel one at some point.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Well, of course.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Naturally.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.960
You're already a pot committed here.

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
This is-

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
That's in the fridge.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
Yeah, it's there.

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
I'm gonna drink it at some point.

03:15.960 --> 03:20.400
It's just a matter of how long and how many times will I stare at it before I try.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
Yeah.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
What's your Bright Spot?

03:22.400 --> 03:27.360
My Bright Spot, Dan, is it happens to be a very beautiful day in Chicago and my partner

03:27.360 --> 03:32.080
and I went and played tennis and wow, the outside is nice, Dan.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
You remember the outside?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.880
I've heard a, I've heard tale of it.

03:34.880 --> 03:35.880
You remember the outside?

03:35.880 --> 03:36.880
What were you doing?

03:36.880 --> 03:39.160
You were doing it, you were, what do you do on the show again?

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
Uh, the work.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.160
You were working on the-

03:41.160 --> 03:46.320
Yeah, I was doing that part of it while you were enjoying the outdoors.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.320
There is that.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.640
It's great that you get to do that.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.640
Wow, we also frequently have conversations about how much I love nature and how you think

03:52.640 --> 03:56.200
it sucks to go away.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
There is that, yes.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.520
I'm a man of many contradictions, Dan.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.200
Well, I'm glad you had fun playing big time ping pong.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.440
Uh, yeah, it was great.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.440
Big old ping pong?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.960
Yeah, it's real big.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.440
That was the original name.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.220
Originally ping pong was called whiff waff in the United States, but before that tennis

04:13.220 --> 04:14.920
was called great big whiff waff.

04:14.920 --> 04:15.920
What's pickleball?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.560
Uh, pickleball is-

04:17.560 --> 04:19.400
Is that related to tennis?

04:19.400 --> 04:24.480
Isn't it the one where it's got the whiffleball and there's holes in it and you do the thing

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
with the pickles?

04:25.480 --> 04:26.480
I don't know.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.160
I don't think pickles are actually involved.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.080
I'm not sure that they're not.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.520
I've heard that word said a lot and I don't know what it is.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.800
I have heard pickleball as well.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.880
Please don't send me messages about it, I'm going to look into it as soon as we stop recording.

04:37.880 --> 04:38.880
We're going to need 3,000 messages.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.160
So, Jordan, today we've got an interesting episode to go over.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.200
We're going to be doing a little bit of a time travel adventure.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.560
Come back in time or forward?

04:48.560 --> 04:52.480
You ask that every time and we can't go forward, I've tried.

04:52.480 --> 05:00.280
We are going back to 2010, the magical 11 year old time of 2010.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.280
Sure, sure.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.280
Things were so different.

05:02.280 --> 05:06.360
Yeah, it's like the turn of the millennium, but instead of the Iraq war, we had more of

05:06.360 --> 05:07.360
the Iraq war.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
Sure, sure.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.200
We had the midterms coming up.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.920
We had the Mayan apocalypse on the horizon.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.400
Sure, that's still to come.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
Certainly.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
Yeah, yeah.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
A lot of interesting stuff happening.

05:18.400 --> 05:25.280
So, I'm excited to dabble in on this, but before we get into that, let's take a little

05:25.280 --> 05:29.040
moment to say thank you to some folks who have joined up and are now policy wonks.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
That's a great idea.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.760
So first, Dr. Yummy Feet, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.040
I'm a policy wonk.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.800
Thank you, Dr. Yummy Feet.

05:36.800 --> 05:37.800
Thank you.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.800
Next, Brendan, the policy wonk.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.400
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.700
I'm a policy wonk.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.760
Thank you, Brendan, the policy wonk, policy wonk.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.760
Thank you.

05:44.760 --> 05:51.120
Kranthulus the 12th, conqueror of five empires, lord of the blood pits of Fentha, Fathna,

05:51.120 --> 05:52.120
excuse me.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.440
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.640
I'm a policy wonk.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.640
Thank you very much.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.120
Yeah, Fathna gets really pissed if you don't pronounce their name properly.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.120
It's true.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.120
It's true.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.120
Yeah, it's a brutal, brutal feeling.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.000
But I'm known for my mispronunciations of locations.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
That's true.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm sure the Fathnians will.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
So it's on, hashtag, on brand.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Okay.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.520
Next, Paranoid Lemming, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.820
I'm a policy wonk.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.240
Thank you, Paranoid Lemming.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.240
Thank you.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.440
Thanks for the brain worms, Jon, much love from E, thank you so much, you are now a policy

06:18.440 --> 06:19.440
wonk.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.440
I'm a policy wonk.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.440
Thank you very much.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.440
This might be connected.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.440
What's that?

06:23.440 --> 06:25.840
I do believe that these are both about the same person.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.480
Okay, we have a policy wonk pile on.

06:28.480 --> 06:33.600
So the next one is, Jon, I blame you for getting jokerfied, love rex, thank you so much, you

06:33.600 --> 06:34.800
are now a policy wonk.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.000
I'm a policy wonk.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.240
Thank you very much to all of you.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.800
I think Jon is maybe getting some people into the show.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.680
Jon, you gotta get to, damn.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.600
So thanks, Jon.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.720
So Jordan, like I said, we're going back in time, and I've made this call on the show

06:51.720 --> 06:56.800
before, and I think I did it at a time when we had a smaller audience than we do now,

06:56.800 --> 07:00.400
and maybe this will have a little bit more reach, and so if anybody out there listening

07:00.400 --> 07:08.560
has access to really old Alex Jones episodes, like late 90s, early 2000s, please reach out.

07:08.560 --> 07:15.840
I would like to try and find a way to get my hands on stuff from like 95, 96, 97, and

07:15.840 --> 07:20.640
if anybody has a line on those, I've tried a number of avenues and they all kind of reach

07:20.640 --> 07:21.640
dead ends.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.920
A lot of people have some tips.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.360
Did you text him?

07:26.360 --> 07:27.360
No.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.360
Oh.

07:28.360 --> 07:33.480
I have not, I've considered that a last option.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.480
That assumes that you already have his number.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.480
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Alex, you up?

07:37.480 --> 07:38.480
Hey, Alex, what up?

07:38.480 --> 07:40.520
You got those old episodes for me.

07:40.520 --> 07:45.640
There are a number of paths that I've gone down that seemed like, oh, this'll work out.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.640
It's kind of difficult.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.080
I think there's some, the episodes exist somewhere.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.480
I know that for sure, but it's very, very difficult to find them in any meaningful way.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.160
You think the Smithsonian has them?

07:57.160 --> 07:58.160
Got to.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.160
Library of Congress?

07:59.160 --> 08:00.160
Of course.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.160
Yeah, absolutely.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.720
Yeah, somebody's got to.

08:02.720 --> 08:09.960
So today, Jordan, I was trying to find a fun time travel thing to do and you know, it's

08:09.960 --> 08:10.960
tough.

08:10.960 --> 08:11.960
It's a challenge.

08:11.960 --> 08:12.960
Yeah.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.960
And you're a witch, so you have high standards.

08:13.960 --> 08:14.960
Yeah.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.520
My standards for witchcraft are real.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.520
Yeah, exactly.

08:17.520 --> 08:23.520
I got a message from a guy by the name of Kirby Ferguson, who does some videos on YouTube

08:23.520 --> 08:29.960
and Kirby had just finished up a duo of videos about Joe Rogan and Alex's last interview

08:29.960 --> 08:33.960
and sort of the, some of the techniques and the styles that are used in the conversation.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
Sure.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.960
And I really enjoyed watching that.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.880
It was really a nice thing.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.480
And so I started thinking like, let's find some Rogan.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.480
Oh no.

08:41.480 --> 08:46.480
So I went back to September 15th, 2010 and found.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.840
Welcome ladies and gentlemen.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.120
Welcome and thank you for joining us.

08:49.120 --> 08:55.320
It's September 15th on this Wednesday, 2010 transmission.

08:55.320 --> 09:04.080
I got a call last night, Joe Rogan host of Ultimate Fighting is in town and he was inviting

09:04.080 --> 09:10.840
me tonight to see the UFC and I said, Hey, why don't you come in the studio and get his

09:10.840 --> 09:14.240
view on politics and quote conspiracies.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.080
So that is good, but that wouldn't be enough.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.160
No, no, no, no, no.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
That's not enough.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.560
This is before the Joe Rogan experience, right?

09:21.560 --> 09:24.480
Or like at the very beginning of it, maybe.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.160
I would have a hard time knowing exactly when it started.

09:28.160 --> 09:32.800
I know that he promotes Joe Rogan.net, which is his website.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.640
That's where the Rogan experience was initially.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.520
So I could see it maybe being in like its earliest stages.

09:39.520 --> 09:43.520
At the very least, we know he does not have $100 million yet.

09:43.520 --> 09:48.140
He certainly doesn't, but he does have a friend.

09:48.140 --> 09:54.080
And Eddie Bravo is a jiu-jitsu master.

09:54.080 --> 09:59.280
He's also going to be in studio with Joe today.

09:59.280 --> 10:06.680
So we got an episode from 2010 with Alex, Eddie, and Joe Rogan in Alex's studio.

10:06.680 --> 10:11.000
I thought this would be a fun little thing to glimpse back on scene.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.480
Take a little bit of a load off from the present day nonsense, maybe be a little bit lighter.

10:15.480 --> 10:19.560
This was back when Eddie Bravo was still a practicing doctor, I believe, right?

10:19.560 --> 10:20.560
Doctor jiu-jitsu.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.560
Yeah.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.480
He is licensed.

10:25.480 --> 10:30.840
He's a, boy, he's not made for FCC controlled things.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.840
Oh yeah?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.560
Why do you say that?

10:33.560 --> 10:36.720
We'll get to it when we get to it.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.500
So Alex is going to talk to them at the end of the show.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
That's third hour business.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
Sure, sure, sure.

10:41.500 --> 10:47.140
So I was like, I wonder what's going on beforehand and what sort of show they're, you know, by

10:47.140 --> 10:50.240
appearing on it and being advertised as guests on the show.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.240
What are they basically endorsing?

10:51.240 --> 10:52.240
What are they elevating?

10:52.240 --> 10:53.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.240
What's going on?

10:54.240 --> 10:55.240
Yeah.

10:55.240 --> 11:00.560
And so we get to Alex talking about how back when his grandmas was around, you know, in

11:00.560 --> 11:06.080
grandma's time it was offensive to see a belly button in I Dream of Jeannie, but now society

11:06.080 --> 11:07.080
is collapsing.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
Oh boy.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.000
In fact, last night I was talking to my mom and she was discussing her grandmother back

11:11.000 --> 11:17.680
in the sixties was over at their house and she saw I Dream of Jeannie and she was just

11:17.680 --> 11:23.000
shocked by the fact that the woman's navel was visible.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.720
And now, you know, you can make fun of people who are shocked by things like that, but civilizations

11:29.720 --> 11:33.400
have been wild and decadent and crazy before and people figure out, hey, we better control

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
this to some level.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.400
Put away the belly button.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.400
Or it causes society to collapse because it's a slippery slope.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.400
One belly button.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
Now look at the culture.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.480
It's the end of days.

11:41.480 --> 11:48.720
People see millions and millions over their lifetimes of simulated murders and deaths

11:48.720 --> 11:50.360
and torture.

11:50.360 --> 11:54.840
And every time I go to a movie to analyze it, I'm not really a fan of really violent

11:54.840 --> 11:55.840
films.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.840
What?

11:56.840 --> 11:59.960
It's because I realized how serious it is unless it's in a serious context.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.880
I would have liked to been in the theater when the road came out a few years ago.

12:03.880 --> 12:08.640
I saw it on DVD and was profoundly affected by it because I've studied so much history.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.920
I know how accurate it was dealing with cannibalism and deprivation.

12:12.920 --> 12:20.000
I never put the pieces together until that clip that Alex's entire idea of like everyone

12:20.000 --> 12:22.360
becomes a cannibal within 15 days is just from the road.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.920
Just Cormac McCarthy.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.920
Straight up.

12:24.920 --> 12:25.920
Yeah.

12:25.920 --> 12:31.840
I wouldn't rely on Cormac McCarthy for the betterment of mankind in terms of thematic

12:31.840 --> 12:32.840
elements.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.660
But Alex pretends that that's like stuff from studies and so everyone becomes a cannibal

12:36.660 --> 12:37.660
within 15 days.

12:37.660 --> 12:38.660
Yeah.

12:38.660 --> 12:42.560
No, I mean, that's just kind of like, yeah, there's a bunch of bad people who are cannibals

12:42.560 --> 12:43.560
in the road.

12:43.560 --> 12:48.360
I can see if they had made a movie of it, I could see Alex's Devil being based on the

12:48.360 --> 12:52.320
Judge from Blood Meridian, but that was a book and it's hard to read even if you're

12:52.320 --> 12:53.320
good at reading.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.320
So, no.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.400
It's just a post-apocalyptic fiction novel that's got turned into a movie that Alex is

12:58.400 --> 12:59.400
pretending is real.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
Yeah.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.400
Viggo Mortensen, right?

13:01.400 --> 13:02.400
Yeah, I think so.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
Vigo.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.400
Yeah, it was a good Vigo film.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.840
The historical examples of cannibalism have been in ritual context, which makes sense

13:08.840 --> 13:13.060
because the amount of energy you'd need to exert to kill and eat a non-cooperative human

13:13.060 --> 13:16.520
would not be worth whatever nutritional value you gain from it.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.920
It would be smarter from a caloric perspective to eat just about anything else.

13:19.920 --> 13:24.740
This is just another example of some supposedly researched position that Alex has got that

13:24.740 --> 13:28.400
he's coming from a movie that he experienced as real.

13:28.400 --> 13:36.200
I mean, you know, in many ways, I would argue that man is the most dangerous game.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.680
Because it fights back and it's harder to trap.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
Exactly.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.160
Yeah, so if there's easier game, go for the easier game.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.400
And that includes leaves and shit, man.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.400
It's not hard.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
It's true.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
It's not hard.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
No.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
No.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.920
And the other thing, too, is you will find a number of examples over history, of course,

13:53.920 --> 13:56.560
of people who are in desperate situations who resort to cannibalism.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.560
Of course, yes.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.920
Honor party and such.

13:58.920 --> 13:59.920
Sure.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.920
Yeah.

14:00.920 --> 14:06.000
A lot of those, what makes those sort of unique are isolation.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.160
It's isolation that's really crucial for those, yeah.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.000
It's a lack of other legitimate options.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.720
Somebody who's lost at sea or something.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.720
Right, right, right.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.720
You might eat somebody.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
Yeah.

14:17.720 --> 14:22.320
If they were on, perhaps, a road, it would be far easier.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.420
The problem for many of these people is that they are trapped in the middle of nowhere

14:26.420 --> 14:28.160
with no hope of escape or anywhere.

14:28.160 --> 14:34.040
If there's foliage and wildlife, it's substantially easier and better for everyone to not eat

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
people.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.040
Yeah.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.040
Yeah.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.040
So much better to not eat people.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.440
And you don't need to wait 15 days to figure out that.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.440
Nope.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.440
Nope.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.440
So dumb.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.440
Oh, what a dumb dumb.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.840
I'm not going to eat any of these goddamn fruits.

14:45.840 --> 14:50.640
So Alex has this idea that, and he sort of touched on it in that last clip, and that

14:50.640 --> 14:57.120
is this notion that fake violence on TV and seeing it makes you experience it the same

14:57.120 --> 14:59.520
way you'd experience real violence.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
Sure.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.520
And I have some thoughts about this.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.520
Oh, yeah.

15:02.520 --> 15:07.880
As somebody who's shocked by images of violence and death, someone setting themselves on fire

15:07.880 --> 15:15.000
or blowing their brains out, there's real footage of that out there on the web.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Back in Vietnam, people were shocked by the image of children who'd been napalmed with

15:19.000 --> 15:21.280
their skin burned off.

15:21.280 --> 15:28.440
People were shocked by the image of Vietnamese police blowing a man's head off in the street.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.440
That's shocking.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.740
But now people are like, big deal.

15:30.740 --> 15:32.160
They laugh about it.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.160
Not that...

15:33.160 --> 15:34.160
And they think it's cute.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.160
No.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.160
No.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.160
No.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.160
No.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.160
No.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.160
And it's because A, they don't know history.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.160
B, they don't have common sense.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.200
And C, they haven't experienced trauma.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.400
Wild.

15:46.400 --> 15:50.440
And this has all been done by design so that when your neighbors are being abused by the

15:50.440 --> 15:57.740
jackbooted thugs or when the CPS is taking your kids, even your own family isn't going

15:57.740 --> 16:02.620
to be shocked by it and just accept that bad things happen because the mind sees all this

16:02.620 --> 16:09.040
simulated violence on television as real.

16:09.040 --> 16:13.640
And so it can't differentiate between fact...

16:13.640 --> 16:14.640
Cut off at the break.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.600
That clip is really key to me to the point where it's one of the only times I can remember

16:18.600 --> 16:20.920
where I'm really disappointed he got cut off by the break.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.600
He's kind of interested in where he was going.

16:23.600 --> 16:28.260
Here Alex is lamenting how fake violence on TV is experienced by people as real violence

16:28.260 --> 16:32.440
and that desensitizes them to seeing instances of real life violence.

16:32.440 --> 16:36.200
I don't know how common that is necessarily as a phenomenon.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.040
I bet there is some effect that it has.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.280
But I know that I've seen plenty of horror movies in my life and I still pretty much

16:42.280 --> 16:47.120
experience depiction of violence difference than I do actual violence.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.360
Pro wrestling is a really good example of this.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.680
I can watch people hit each other with chairs and send each other through tables but if

16:52.680 --> 16:56.640
I were watching that being done for real I would not enjoy it.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.540
Any time it appears that someone has actually hurt themselves in wrestling reality creeps

17:00.540 --> 17:05.160
in and I become worried for the performer because it's possible to enjoy the narrative

17:05.160 --> 17:10.440
depiction of combat and still remember that it's a performer performing.

17:10.440 --> 17:14.160
Then there's stuff like the UFC where people are fighting for real and people are trying

17:14.160 --> 17:15.680
to hurt each other.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.440
This is still kind of ritualized violence where everyone watching understands that these

17:19.440 --> 17:23.660
are two trained competitors who've agreed to fight each other under specific rules to

17:23.660 --> 17:25.560
see who's better at the sport.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.240
It's closer to real world violence but it's something that's formalized, professional,

17:29.240 --> 17:33.680
and both parties have consented to what's going on in the contest.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.200
And then there's movies.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.200
Right.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.200
Right.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.520
Which are just totally fictional.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.040
Those are fictional, yes.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.480
Most people can tell the difference between these forms of displays of violence and experience

17:43.480 --> 17:47.960
them differently, whether that different experience is conscious or subconscious.

17:47.960 --> 17:52.540
It seems to me that Alex cannot, and he assumes that because that is his experience everyone

17:52.540 --> 17:56.320
else must also not be able to differentiate between the two.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.880
Now here's where this point gets important.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.960
Because Alex can't tell the difference between fiction and reality, he can't also tell the

18:02.960 --> 18:05.580
difference between reality and fiction.

18:05.580 --> 18:09.440
In the same way that he thinks that a fictional movie like The Road depicts a legitimate realistic

18:09.440 --> 18:14.360
cannibal future, he has a tendency to think very real things like the Sandy Hook shooting

18:14.360 --> 18:16.280
were completely staged.

18:16.280 --> 18:20.400
Alex pretends that exposure to fictitious violence has made everyone desensitized to

18:20.400 --> 18:24.960
real world violence, and yet in my experience one of the major themes of his show is denying

18:24.960 --> 18:29.240
the experiences of people who have experienced the effects of real world violence because

18:29.240 --> 18:30.960
he thinks it's fake.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.960
Yes.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.000
I think that's an important dynamic to recognize.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.680
Yeah, I mean there's that extra level of not just because, you know, he can't tell the

18:39.680 --> 18:44.320
difference between reality and fiction, and so he assumes everybody else can't tell the

18:44.320 --> 18:45.320
difference.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.840
Yes, I do think that is a part of the dynamic.

18:47.840 --> 18:54.040
But that like second level of, of course he can't also not assume that of everyone else,

18:54.040 --> 18:58.960
because if he were to realize that other people can easily tell the difference between reality

18:58.960 --> 19:03.360
and fiction, that would be an attack upon him personally, or it would tell him that

19:03.360 --> 19:06.520
it's possible to tell the difference between reality and fiction.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.520
Hmm.

19:07.520 --> 19:12.920
You know, so the only way that he can maintain his psyche through this is by assuming that

19:12.920 --> 19:17.540
not only can nobody else tell the difference between reality and fiction, but that he's

19:17.540 --> 19:22.880
the only person who can tell you you can't tell the difference between reality and fiction.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.120
Yeah, perhaps that is, that is true.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.560
Yeah, he's a mess.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.720
Yeah, he's a mess.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.720
Yep.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.720
That's a real bummer.

19:29.720 --> 19:35.240
You know, Alex has another story that's going around, and this is, this is interesting to

19:35.240 --> 19:39.960
me because, you know, he's above the political divide, right?

19:39.960 --> 19:40.960
Sure.

19:40.960 --> 19:44.720
The left-right paradigm is an illusion, and it's all meant to get us all mad at each other

19:44.720 --> 19:45.840
and fighting for no reason.

19:45.840 --> 19:46.840
Yeah.

19:46.840 --> 19:51.360
Democrat, left, right, conservative, Republican, meaningless words.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.800
All just infighting for no reason.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.800
This seems weird.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.800
This is 2010.

19:55.800 --> 19:56.800
Mm-hmm.

19:56.800 --> 20:01.880
Big story at Infowars.com by Kurt Nemo, Pennsylvania Homeland Security puts anti-tax protesters

20:01.880 --> 20:03.360
on list of terror threats.

20:03.360 --> 20:10.040
And we got same reports out of Texas six years ago, listing gun owners, veterans as the number

20:10.040 --> 20:11.080
one threat.

20:11.080 --> 20:15.640
But because it was Bush's administration doing it, conservative media wouldn't pick up on

20:15.640 --> 20:16.640
it.

20:16.640 --> 20:22.700
Now that it's Obama, meet the new boss, same as the old boss, like the Who song says.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.560
It's like, oh my gosh, Obama wants to go after conservatives.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.960
Folks, you've always been the enemy.

20:28.960 --> 20:35.400
Again, I would watch conservative pundits on Fox and listen to them on the radio, read

20:35.400 --> 20:36.720
from reports that I had.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.160
They didn't tell you they were reading a report, but I'd read the reports.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.160
We'd covered it here.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.760
I knew they were reading federal demonization scripts.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.640
Whoever's loading their teleprompter is a globalist.

20:47.640 --> 20:52.200
I mean, they're getting a direct government propaganda feed.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.760
We know they're bad.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.880
It's open and shut.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.660
So if you understand what he's saying, if you get to the root of what he's saying when

20:59.660 --> 21:03.560
he's trying to make this argument that he's above this sort of left, right, new boss,

21:03.560 --> 21:12.880
same as the old boss, he's saying that Obama is targeting conservatives in the same way

21:12.880 --> 21:18.160
that the conservatives targeted conservatives.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.000
The left isn't the target of any of this stuff.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.120
It's they are always the victim of no matter what.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.120
No matter what.

21:26.120 --> 21:33.440
No matter who's in charge, the enemy of the globalists is these conservatives, like Alex's.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.480
It's interesting.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.940
It's only the far right white.

21:37.940 --> 21:45.100
But it's interesting that he can articulate this idea of it doesn't matter who's in charge.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.140
They're all the same.

21:46.140 --> 21:51.160
But the thing that he's saying that they're all the same about is that they're all globalists

21:51.160 --> 21:54.200
who hate super far right people like me.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
Yeah.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.160
I mean, essentially it's like, hey, we don't have any white nationalist candidates.

21:58.160 --> 22:01.800
And then they got a white nationalist candidate and they were like, holy shit, this is what

22:01.800 --> 22:03.200
we've been wanting the whole time.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.200
Yeah.

22:04.200 --> 22:08.000
And here in 2010, you're starting to see a little bit of the beginning of that materializing

22:08.000 --> 22:12.360
into a possibility with the Tea Party being on the rise.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.360
Yeah.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.200
Again, because of whiteness.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.680
It was a major driver.

22:16.680 --> 22:17.680
Yeah.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.680
Big deal.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.680
And Coke money.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
Yeah.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.680
Not Coke head money.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.680
Coke brother money.

22:22.680 --> 22:23.680
Yes.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.680
Yes.

22:24.680 --> 22:30.220
So in terms of that, there is something that's going on at this point in September.

22:30.220 --> 22:37.400
And that is that Christine O'Donnell was running for the seat in Delaware in the Senate.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.880
And there had been a little bit of squabbling.

22:40.880 --> 22:47.640
Karl Rove had come out and he'd had an interview that was a little bit critical of O'Donnell.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.440
And Alex is not happy about this.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.320
Here is the New York Times today.

22:53.320 --> 22:59.080
GOP leaders say Delaware upset hurts Senate hopefuls.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.040
Now they basically said the same thing about Rand Paul.

23:02.040 --> 23:05.640
They sent in Cheney to campaign against him.

23:05.640 --> 23:11.000
They put all their money behind the Republican establishment pro bailout candidate.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.620
They demonized him, just like the Democrats are now doing.

23:14.620 --> 23:22.560
And he's widened his lead against the Democrat in the last few months since he won the primary

23:22.560 --> 23:24.080
against the Republican.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.240
But they said the same thing.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.880
Oh, people extreme like him.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.720
And they lied about what he really stood for.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.940
He can't win.

23:30.940 --> 23:35.160
And so they create this self-fulfilling prophecy of, oh, you can't vote for that candidate

23:35.160 --> 23:36.280
because they can't win.

23:36.280 --> 23:42.960
And now the Republicans are creating the hoax with the Democrats that all these different

23:42.960 --> 23:49.960
real Tea Party candidates who actually, you know, are against the out of control spending,

23:49.960 --> 23:55.480
the banker bailouts and the rest of it, that that that they're bad and that they can't

23:55.480 --> 23:56.480
win.

23:56.480 --> 24:00.820
And you need to go for establishment Republicans, the same Republicans that are for.

24:00.820 --> 24:05.820
Banker bailouts, the same Republicans that under Bush four separate times tried to pass

24:05.820 --> 24:11.700
amnesty, the same Republicans like Newt Gingrich, who want global carbon taxes and want world

24:11.700 --> 24:14.320
government.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.920
And the hoax intensifies.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.200
I have the transcript here.

24:18.200 --> 24:23.460
We're not going to play the entire clip, but it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet

24:23.460 --> 24:30.320
dot com in an article that Paul Watson's written anti establishment fervor, a hammer blow to

24:30.320 --> 24:32.000
the Washington elite.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.520
But here's a transcript from Fox News from last night.

24:35.520 --> 24:41.200
Karl Rove questions Christine O'Donnell's serious character problems.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.840
And then I have the quotes here.

24:43.840 --> 24:48.480
They're saying because it took 20 years for her to pay off her student loans, that that

24:48.480 --> 24:49.480
is deceptive.

24:49.480 --> 24:53.400
Again, the serious questions about how does she make her living?

24:53.400 --> 24:56.460
Why did she mislead voters about her college education?

24:56.460 --> 25:00.240
How come it took nearly two decades to pay her college bills?

25:00.240 --> 25:04.240
I've seen numbers of upwards of half of many college students now not paying their loans

25:04.240 --> 25:06.080
because they can't cancel them.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.080
Right.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.720
Yeah, that would make sense.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.320
Yeah, you're on top of it, Alex.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.280
You should absolutely cancel student loan debt.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.860
I think that's Alex's position.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.360
So first of all, fuck Karl Rove.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.360
Yeah.

25:16.360 --> 25:20.280
That being said, Rove was just protecting his brand there and everybody's brand.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.760
It's not really anything more interesting than seeing conventional Democrats be resistant

25:23.760 --> 25:26.320
to embrace AOC in the present.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.320
There's just that tension.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.320
Yeah.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.880
Someone like O'Donnell in particular and the aesthetics of the Tea Party in general were

25:31.880 --> 25:36.260
a vast departure from the type of politics that Rove excelled at for decades.

25:36.260 --> 25:39.840
So that obviously would represent a threat to his position in the market, either as a

25:39.840 --> 25:42.120
strategist or a commentator on Fox News.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.920
Yeah, let's keep the depths of our evil quieter, guys.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.480
That was Karl Rove's philosophy, I believe.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.160
In the end, though, Rove was probably right.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.300
Christine O'Donnell was unelectable.

25:54.300 --> 25:58.640
She finished third in the GOP primary in 2006 after making some pretty offensive comments

25:58.640 --> 26:04.580
about the LGBTQ community and lost the 2008 general election to Joe Biden, who was simultaneously

26:04.580 --> 26:06.320
running for vice president.

26:06.320 --> 26:11.120
She would follow this up by losing the 2010 general election after it came out that she

26:11.120 --> 26:14.680
had, quote, dabbled in witchcraft in high school.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.960
And then, more to the problem, released this ad.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.080
I'm not a witch.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.440
I'm nothing you've heard.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.320
I'm you.

26:25.320 --> 26:30.720
None of us are perfect, but none of us can be happy with what we see all around us.

26:30.720 --> 26:36.200
Politicians who think spending, trading favors, and backroom deals are the ways to stay in

26:36.200 --> 26:38.000
office.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.240
I'll go to Washington and do what you do.

26:42.240 --> 26:46.120
I'm Christine O'Donnell, and I approve this message.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.120
I'm you.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.680
I was really hoping she'd say I'm not a witch.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.160
I wanted her to say I'm not a witch at the end.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.160
Just to reiterate.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.160
As a reminder?

26:53.160 --> 26:54.160
I'm not a witch.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.200
Just to double down on that?

26:56.200 --> 26:57.200
Not a witch here.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.080
Obviously, I don't care if someone messed around with some witch shit.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.800
Some of the coolest people I know have spent some time in that water.

27:02.800 --> 27:08.280
I don't care, but man, Republican voters sure do.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.960
It's one thing to have dabbled in witchcraft in your past when you're trying to run for

27:11.960 --> 27:16.500
office, but it's another thing to cut an ad that starts by saying I'm not a witch.

27:16.500 --> 27:20.120
That's so goofy and embarrassing from a political strategy perspective that anyone who would

27:20.120 --> 27:23.120
do that is someone you shouldn't trust to make good decisions.

27:23.120 --> 27:26.400
It's either an indication of them having bad instincts or being surrounded by people who

27:26.400 --> 27:29.280
have bad instincts, and neither is a good option.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.280
This 2010 midterm and the Tea Party candidates that came into office with it were a warning

27:33.280 --> 27:35.240
of the future we were heading toward.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.560
It's not surprising to look back at 2010 and see Alex supporting someone like Christine

27:38.560 --> 27:42.160
O'Donnell and then flash forward to today to see him backing Marjorie Taylor Greene.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.160
Yeah.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.160
This is what he does.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.160
Yep.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.120
The issues about O'Donnell's college history and loans probably sound like petty issues,

27:48.120 --> 27:52.080
but the point Karl Rove was making was more that the way that O'Donnell was addressing

27:52.080 --> 27:55.480
these questions about her history didn't come off as convincing.

27:55.480 --> 28:00.320
For instance, as early as 2006, she claimed to be a graduate of Fairleigh Dickinson University,

28:00.320 --> 28:04.400
but actually didn't complete her degree until September 2010.

28:04.400 --> 28:09.400
The reason for the delay had first been claimed to be a student loan-related issue, like a

28:09.400 --> 28:13.700
delay because of that, but then the story became that she had to finish an outstanding

28:13.700 --> 28:16.400
elective course before she could get her degree.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.840
Rove was expressing on Fox News that if she was going to win, she would have to be more

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
forthright.

28:20.840 --> 28:24.760
And she said exactly that, quote, she can't get away with simply saying my answer is on

28:24.760 --> 28:29.160
my website or it's puzzling to me why the IRS would file a lien for me when I didn't

28:29.160 --> 28:31.200
pay my taxes in 2005.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.240
I mean, she's got to be more honest than that.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.920
If she does, she's got a shot to win, but it's got to be passionate and factual and

28:36.920 --> 28:37.920
hard hitting.

28:37.920 --> 28:38.920
Yeah.

28:38.920 --> 28:43.920
You know, and I think the very, see, you should have somebody like me if you're going to cut

28:43.920 --> 28:49.220
a political ad because if you open with I'm not a witch, the reasonable person's response

28:49.220 --> 28:51.280
is that's just what a witch would say.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.280
Right.

28:52.280 --> 28:56.640
I know witches aren't real, but my first thought when she said I'm not a witch is like, oh,

28:56.640 --> 28:58.600
that's a witch talking right there.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.600
That's a witch.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.680
I haven't seen a witch before.

29:01.680 --> 29:06.600
And I think anybody with like just a little bit of political instincts or any awareness

29:06.600 --> 29:11.600
of how the media cycle works is like, you're going to get piled on for that.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.600
Yeah.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.600
Leave it alone.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.600
Don't say I'm not a witch.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.440
Don't worry about it.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.440
So easy to ignore.

29:17.440 --> 29:21.320
Cut an ad about how compassionate you are and how you care about the needs of the people

29:21.320 --> 29:22.520
of Delaware.

29:22.520 --> 29:23.640
Don't open.

29:23.640 --> 29:26.080
Don't get ahead of the witch story.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.760
I got to get out in front of this witch thing.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.760
If I don't do this, they'll think I'm a witch.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
People think I'm still a witch.

29:32.760 --> 29:38.260
I think that's, what's really funny about that is Christine O'Donnell's name immediately

29:38.260 --> 29:39.260
popped up.

29:39.260 --> 29:42.620
There was a space in my brain for it, but I wasn't 100% sure.

29:42.620 --> 29:46.640
And then you said witch and I was like, oh yeah, I remember that.

29:46.640 --> 29:52.400
I remember that witch doesn't really actually know all that much about her, but he's decided

29:52.400 --> 29:56.000
to defend her just because he likes, who doesn't seem to like her.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Now.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
I don't know this lady from the side of a barn, but the fact that the attacking her,

30:05.000 --> 30:12.360
the fact that the system is demonizing her, the fact that they have the Republicans and

30:12.360 --> 30:15.240
Democrats coming out against her, I mean, that tells you all you need to know.

30:15.240 --> 30:22.680
So yeah, Alex is just like defiant basically, but you know what's funny is like, why isn't

30:22.680 --> 30:24.320
Alex talking about how she's a witch?

30:24.320 --> 30:25.320
He seems to hate witches.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.360
He hates witches.

30:26.360 --> 30:31.760
It's because that clip doesn't come out until two days after this episode.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.760
Oh boy.

30:35.760 --> 30:40.160
Not the clip that we played, but the information about her babbling about her being a witch.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.680
Bill Maher plays that two days later.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.680
Jesus.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.200
It sets off the witch news cycle.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
That's so funny.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.200
Yeah.

30:48.200 --> 30:53.520
So Alex gets around to playing the clip of Rove talking on Fox news.

30:53.520 --> 30:58.300
And I think this is really interesting because Alex sets it up pretty poorly.

30:58.300 --> 31:04.200
And so let's go ahead and play a short clip of Karl Rove, you know, really demonizing

31:04.200 --> 31:10.400
this poor lady and just repeating that talking point over and over again that she has serious

31:10.400 --> 31:13.960
character problems and then when you actually go find out what those character problems

31:13.960 --> 31:18.760
are, he just uses that term when you actually find out what they are.

31:18.760 --> 31:23.000
It took her 20 years to pay off her student loans and she had an $11,000 lien on her from

31:23.000 --> 31:24.200
the IRS.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.200
No due process.

31:25.200 --> 31:26.200
They just slapped it on her.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.200
Here it is.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.200
You know what?

31:28.200 --> 31:32.260
If you vote for cap and tax and you have an opponent that says they wouldn't, then they

31:32.260 --> 31:33.260
have a choice.

31:33.260 --> 31:34.260
They have an option.

31:34.260 --> 31:38.440
So I think it was, it was very substantive, very based on issues, very based on the voting

31:38.440 --> 31:41.120
record of one and the promise voting record of another.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.160
You know, again, you're making my case.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.640
This was about Mike Castle's bad votes.

31:45.640 --> 31:50.360
It does conservatives little good to support candidates who at the end of the day, while

31:50.360 --> 31:56.340
they may be conservative in their public statements, do not events, the characteristics of rectitude

31:56.340 --> 32:03.280
and truthfulness and sincerity and character that the voters are looking for.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.540
She doesn't show rectitude.

32:06.540 --> 32:11.520
This was a guy up there high and mighty saying, I tell you who has rectitude.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.480
I tell you who is morally good.

32:13.480 --> 32:17.360
I tell you, you know, who you could vote for and who you can't.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.360
I'm the grand Puba.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.840
I'm the high priest.

32:19.840 --> 32:24.240
I'm going to tell you Republicans what you can and can't do your need to stay on the

32:24.240 --> 32:28.400
Karl Rove reservation because I am morally of high rectitude.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.700
This is the guy lying about WMDs.

32:30.700 --> 32:35.240
So what you have is Alex introduces this clip in a way that the clip doesn't actually reflect

32:35.240 --> 32:36.240
what he's saying.

32:36.240 --> 32:40.980
And Karl Rove is actually making a fair point in terms of the context of this conversation.

32:40.980 --> 32:47.160
That is there's some kind of non forthrightness that's going on and that is not great.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.160
Yeah.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.160
Yeah.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.200
And so in order for Alex to deal with the clip that's played, he attacks the messenger.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.040
He's just, and look, fuck Karl Rove.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.040
I don't care.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.320
But saying fuck him and saying he lied about weapons of mass destruction doesn't deal with

32:58.320 --> 32:59.960
the issue that he brings up.

32:59.960 --> 33:00.960
Totally.

33:00.960 --> 33:01.960
Yeah.

33:01.960 --> 33:02.960
That just point.

33:02.960 --> 33:03.960
Oh, Oh my God.

33:03.960 --> 33:04.960
You're all liars.

33:04.960 --> 33:05.960
What a shock.

33:05.960 --> 33:12.520
If I were a snarky debate kid online, I would say that is a, uh, Ooh, this is a person of

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
the tech.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.520
This is not.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.840
We don't even bother.

33:17.840 --> 33:21.920
And I have scored a point or whatever.

33:21.920 --> 33:26.160
But that's, that's what you can do whenever, I mean it, the audience enjoys it.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.480
I think you even kind of enjoy it.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.720
Enjoy what?

33:29.720 --> 33:31.240
Just piling on Karl Rove.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.960
Oh, fuck that guy.

33:32.960 --> 33:33.960
Yeah.

33:33.960 --> 33:34.960
All right.

33:34.960 --> 33:35.960
I don't know.

33:35.960 --> 33:36.960
I don't have any skin in that game.

33:36.960 --> 33:42.200
I just, I just like to see, uh, any, any shit piled on Karl Rove is a good day for me.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.200
Sure.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.200
Yeah.

33:44.200 --> 33:47.720
So in this next clip, we see Alex doing something we saw recently on a, on another, I believe

33:47.720 --> 33:53.320
time travel episode that we did, we saw him pretending to discover the strategy of Google

33:53.320 --> 33:54.320
bombing.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.320
Oh yeah.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.320
Yeah.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.320
Yeah.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.320
And so he's going to start a Google bomb.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.320
Okay.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.320
Of course.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.320
So we're going to have a new search term today.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.320
We haven't done this in a week or so.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.320
We're gonna have a new search term.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.320
We're going to make number one today.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.000
This is the first search search term we've done.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.440
Every time it's become number one, Google search the term Gates, death panels, Gates,

34:12.440 --> 34:16.640
death panels with an S Gates, death panels.

34:16.640 --> 34:20.880
Just search those three words in Google, in Yahoo, in every major search engine, do it

34:20.880 --> 34:26.000
over and over again and send the story out to everyone and click on the story and it's

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
already the number one link.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.240
If you type in Bill Gates, death panels on Google news, it's our story is already number

34:32.240 --> 34:33.240
one.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.560
This is Paul Watson's article from yesterday.

34:35.560 --> 34:39.680
And so, uh, we're going to push this out as the number one search term and then hundreds

34:39.680 --> 34:42.920
of newspapers and blogs as you've seen, we'll then go click on our story to find out what

34:42.920 --> 34:43.920
it's about.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
They'll research it.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.920
They'll write about it.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.800
It'll cause another chain reaction.

34:47.800 --> 34:51.240
So Bill Gates is who we're going after today.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.000
And for the next 11 years.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Wow.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Wow.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Oh boy.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Yeah.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Okay.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.320
It's interesting to think about like the 11 years intermediate, the like different

35:02.320 --> 35:03.320
careers.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.320
Alex and Bill Gates have had.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.320
Yeah.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.320
They've gone on separate paths.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.320
Yeah.

35:07.320 --> 35:10.760
There was, there was a moment where they could have come together, you know, things really

35:10.760 --> 35:11.760
diverged.

35:11.760 --> 35:12.760
Yeah.

35:12.760 --> 35:13.760
Yeah.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.960
You know, it's one of those, uh, uh, I took the path less trod, you know, that kind of

35:16.960 --> 35:17.960
thing.

35:17.960 --> 35:18.960
Yep.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
Yeah.

35:19.960 --> 35:20.960
So Alex takes calls.

35:20.960 --> 35:21.960
Um, and a lot of it ends up being about vaccines.

35:21.960 --> 35:22.960
Sure.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.960
And a caller, right?

35:23.960 --> 35:26.840
Of course it is because you're a witch, Dan.

35:26.840 --> 35:31.240
So this caller is, uh, his kid is, uh, scheduled to be vaccinated.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.240
Sure.

35:32.240 --> 35:37.480
And Alex has a, has a way to, is a, he has a bad metaphor.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.480
That's kind of what I was thinking.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.560
I just wanted to, to thank you for what you do.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.560
Uh, you're my hero.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.640
Uh, first of all, I just want to say that I'm really nervous.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.640
I apologize.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.200
Um, I have a two month old son.

35:48.200 --> 35:53.320
Uh, he's our, our first child and he's about to get his shots.

35:53.320 --> 35:58.280
Uh, he's scheduled to get in this week, uh, for the vaccines and stuff like that.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.400
Um, and I really,

35:59.400 --> 36:04.960
You know, that's kind of like Jews were scheduled to get on trains and go to Dachau and Auschwitz.

36:04.960 --> 36:08.000
And he's like, Oh, it's your scheduling.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.160
It's your time to ride the carousel and Logan's run.

36:11.160 --> 36:15.000
Um, uh, I mean, just cause they say it's scheduled.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.040
I mean, did they take his blood at birth for the Pentagon database?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.600
Uh, I think so.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
I'm not real sure.

36:21.600 --> 36:25.040
I mean, if he was born in a hospital, they did, but I mean, so,

36:25.040 --> 36:26.400
Oh boy.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.400
Yeah.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.840
So that's the tone that he's coming at this caller with.

36:30.840 --> 36:34.120
The caller's just saying that, uh, the child is scheduled to have some vaccinations.

36:34.120 --> 36:39.000
He's like, Oh, like, uh, like Jewish people in the world war II going on trains.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
They were scheduled.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.120
You know, I really like not having measles.

36:43.120 --> 36:47.440
Uh, and I, I think I re my childhood was better from not having measles.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.160
What about all the polio you had?

36:49.160 --> 36:52.620
I, I, it felt great to not have polio.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.080
And of course you died of the whooping cough.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.080
Right.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.080
Yeah.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.080
It was a struggle.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.080
That was tough.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.800
We did make it through that as a, as a unit.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.240
Uh, I think that's great.

37:02.240 --> 37:05.120
But 17 of your siblings died of tetanus.

37:05.120 --> 37:08.200
Doesn't it seem like that should be an easier sell?

37:08.200 --> 37:09.200
Yeah.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.940
Like, Hey, you know how we don't have polio?

37:11.940 --> 37:13.320
That's because of the vaccines.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.880
So just think Alex thinks it's cause of hand washing or something.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.000
That really bothers me.

37:18.000 --> 37:23.320
It really bothers me because of fucking witches and people being good for a while or whatever.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.320
It's more or less about witches.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.320
Bums me out.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.320
Yep.

37:26.320 --> 37:30.880
So, uh, but it's important to see the, the way this tone works.

37:30.880 --> 37:35.080
So he starts out the call and the guy just says that his kid is scheduled and Alex immediately

37:35.080 --> 37:41.640
compares it to trains and the Holocaust, then he, he, he tries to sort of play reasonable

37:41.640 --> 37:47.760
a little bit, but going back to vaccines, uh, to decision you have to make, uh, the

37:47.760 --> 37:52.520
Japanese, it's gotta be more than a decade ago, made a rule, no vaccination until age

37:52.520 --> 37:58.560
two, because they found completely that this stuff causes neurological problems, autoimmune

37:58.560 --> 38:03.600
problems, but it's much worse when a little bitty baby has all these shots going in them.

38:03.600 --> 38:08.360
By the time they grow up and get bigger and get some cognitive development, it won't stunt

38:08.360 --> 38:09.540
them as much.

38:09.540 --> 38:14.220
So now Alex is trying to play that, Hey, everybody's got to make their own decision and then immediately

38:14.220 --> 38:17.400
jumps to this story about Japan, which is a complete lie.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.400
Yeah.

38:18.400 --> 38:23.880
In 1994, Japan amended a law that they had, uh, they had a law that made vaccines mandatory

38:23.880 --> 38:28.440
and they amended this making instead quote, it was more of a civic duty than a strict

38:28.440 --> 38:29.800
legal obligation.

38:29.800 --> 38:34.500
According to the AFP, uh, the world health organization stats from 2018 reflect a vaccination

38:34.500 --> 38:41.020
rate of 99% for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis in one year old Japanese children and 97%

38:41.020 --> 38:44.000
for the same age group with the polio vaccine.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.360
Alex is just making shit up to demonize vaccination, but it's important to pay attention to that

38:48.360 --> 38:50.160
way that he's trying to frame things.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.160
Yeah.

38:51.160 --> 38:55.360
You know, it's the, the, the caller brings this up, he compares it to the Holocaust.

38:55.360 --> 38:59.560
Hey, everybody's got to make their own decision, but also here's a lie about Japanese people.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.560
Okay.

39:00.560 --> 39:07.780
So if 99%, 97% of Japanese babies, then we can look back and see if his numbers make

39:07.780 --> 39:10.200
sense 25 years later or whatever it is.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.400
And uh, they don't.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.040
So can't we be done then?

39:13.040 --> 39:16.600
Well, we can't because Alex is now- But I want to be done with anti-vax.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.240
No, because Alex has said that everybody needs to make up their own mind.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.960
Oh, but what if we have the proof of concept from Japan?

39:23.960 --> 39:27.580
Everybody's got to, well, look, everybody's got to make up their own mind with the caller.

39:27.580 --> 39:30.440
And so this caller is still on the line.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.440
This is fucked up.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.760
This is not what you do when you want someone to make up their own mind.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.000
Does that answer your question?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Yeah.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.280
I really, really appreciate that.

39:38.280 --> 39:39.280
I appreciate your time.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.040
Uh, I guess I'm just not going to do it.

39:42.040 --> 39:46.200
I mean, I mean, um, but when it becomes old enough to go to school, I mean, would that,

39:46.200 --> 39:47.200
would that be a problem?

39:47.200 --> 39:48.200
Yes.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.200
Yes.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.200
They are criminals.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.200
They are hardcore criminals.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
Again, they lie to you and say, it's the law.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.200
He must take the shots.

39:53.200 --> 39:57.680
They lied to you and said, there wasn't mercury until we forced it out in the open.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.100
And now they say, okay, mercury is there.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.240
It's good for you.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.240
Then they're going to lie when he goes in school and say, it's the law.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.320
Your child can't be in the school without shots.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.400
And you say, I know you've got the waiver.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.000
It's not even a law, but it's a waiver to a non-law.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.480
I know you've got a waiver that I'm supposed to fill out.

40:12.480 --> 40:17.320
So they make a list of you, but courts have even shown you can eat and not even do that.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.240
And then they'll lie to you again, cause they're getting money.

40:19.240 --> 40:23.220
When they hit your kid with a weapon from the feds, that that's tied to the federal

40:23.220 --> 40:24.220
money they're given.

40:24.220 --> 40:25.600
Uh, they have quotas.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.360
They've got to get 97% or more vaccinated.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.960
They don't get their money.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.580
Then then the school nurse or the principal is going to lie and say, there's no such thing.

40:32.580 --> 40:35.480
And then you can already have Googled your state.

40:35.480 --> 40:41.160
You're calling from Tennessee, Tennessee vaccine waiver, conscientious objector, religious

40:41.160 --> 40:42.160
objector.

40:42.160 --> 40:47.840
So really principal or assistant principal, here's the waiver for Tennessee.

40:47.840 --> 40:52.720
You lied to me and see, you'll know you're there with a hardcore liar.

40:52.720 --> 40:59.200
Again, lying trash, an entire government and corporate system trained to lie.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.620
And these teachers take their kids and inject them with the mercury too.

41:02.620 --> 41:06.880
And they love the fact that in many schools, a third of the schools now special ed, and

41:06.880 --> 41:10.840
there's just giant warehouses of children wearing football helmets, literally because

41:10.840 --> 41:15.080
they bumped their heads on the walls and in wheelchairs and in diapers and they put taser,

41:15.080 --> 41:18.000
taser, uh, belts around them in the public schools.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.600
Now when they don't mind, they zap them and they love it.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.900
They just love all of it.

41:21.900 --> 41:25.280
And soon the whole school will be in the corner drooling.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.840
And by that point they can just start euthanizing everyone.

41:27.840 --> 41:33.440
They are just savagely chemically hurting us as bad as they can so they can submit,

41:33.440 --> 41:37.560
make us submit and then just come in and have the helicopters fly over and spray the nerve

41:37.560 --> 41:39.020
gas and kill everybody.

41:39.020 --> 41:40.960
They're just getting everybody ready for that.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.960
Okay.

41:41.960 --> 41:42.960
That's hardcore truth, buddy.

41:42.960 --> 41:46.240
Listen, those are criminals when they lie to you and, and, and, and try to force those

41:46.240 --> 41:47.240
vaccines.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.240
You understand that?

41:48.240 --> 41:49.240
Yeah, I do.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.240
Okay.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.240
I appreciate your call.

41:51.240 --> 41:54.320
I mean, it's hitting the game, ladies and gentlemen, everybody's got to make up their

41:54.320 --> 41:55.320
own mind.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.320
Everybody's got to make up your own mind.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.440
I mean, they're trying to murder you in your fucking bed.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.800
You coward.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.000
They're trying to kill you in their life.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.120
But everybody's got to make up their own mind about, look, everybody's got their own choice

42:08.120 --> 42:11.940
to make between getting murdered in their own bed and being a heroic patriot who gives

42:11.940 --> 42:12.940
me money.

42:12.940 --> 42:13.940
It's a simple choice.

42:13.940 --> 42:14.940
Yeah.

42:14.940 --> 42:16.480
Joe Rogan's on this episode of this show.

42:16.480 --> 42:19.120
Maybe we should never have expected all that much from him.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.440
That would have made sense.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.240
That would have made sense.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.280
We get another caller and this is, this is just for good clean fun.

42:26.280 --> 42:27.280
This is a little bit of parsley.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.280
Okay.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.920
This dude's asking about a JFK documentary if Alex has seen it.

42:31.920 --> 42:37.200
And then we find that Alex doesn't know a very important bit of trivia about JFK.

42:37.200 --> 42:40.840
Now he fancies himself kind of like a, you know, a guy who knows a lot about the conspiracy.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
Sure.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.840
Sure.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.840
Sure.

42:43.840 --> 42:44.840
He's a conspiracy guy.

42:44.840 --> 42:48.280
It's kind of rough that he doesn't know this bit of, it's kind of a big one, right?

42:48.280 --> 42:49.280
Incredible.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.280
Deep, deep.

42:50.280 --> 42:51.280
You should watch it.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.280
It's revealing.

42:52.280 --> 42:57.720
Even some of the attorneys that were defending, um, uh, the guy who took over JFK's position.

42:57.720 --> 43:01.600
Now I can't remember his name, uh, when he, when they assassinated him.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.640
Who is a, who is the next person, the vice president who took over, I can't remember

43:04.640 --> 43:05.640
his name now.

43:05.640 --> 43:08.920
Uh, well it was, uh, it was Robert Kennedy.

43:08.920 --> 43:09.920
What?

43:09.920 --> 43:10.920
Yeah.

43:10.920 --> 43:15.560
And well, of course he was the attorney general, um, who was JFK's vice president.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.640
Um, boy, I'm having a moment here.

43:17.640 --> 43:18.640
I should know that.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.640
Yeah, you should.

43:19.640 --> 43:20.640
Yeah.

43:20.640 --> 43:24.680
You should fucking know who LB goddamn Jay is.

43:24.680 --> 43:25.680
This is a big part of the conspiracy.

43:25.680 --> 43:26.680
He's the reason.

43:26.680 --> 43:27.680
Oh my God.

43:27.680 --> 43:35.500
He's LBJ is probably one of the biggest reasons that Alex hates the left anyways because of

43:35.500 --> 43:38.680
LBJ that we got the civil rights act through there.

43:38.680 --> 43:42.640
So I mean, not because of him, he fought tooth and nail for a long time, but it was a part

43:42.640 --> 43:43.640
of the history.

43:43.640 --> 43:44.640
Yeah.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.640
Yeah.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
Yeah.

43:46.640 --> 43:47.640
That's weird.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.440
Alex does eventually remember LBJ and then he tries to pretend that he just couldn't

43:50.440 --> 43:53.760
come up with Humphrey who was LBJ's vice president.

43:53.760 --> 43:54.760
Wow.

43:54.760 --> 43:55.760
Wow, buddy.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.760
Wow, dude.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.760
That's brutal.

43:57.760 --> 44:01.880
I understand if you take like a little bit of a second, but like that's too long.

44:01.880 --> 44:02.880
Yeah.

44:02.880 --> 44:07.280
Especially for LBJ, who's kind of a big figure in American history.

44:07.280 --> 44:11.320
And a big figure in JFK assassination conspiracy theories.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.320
Totally.

44:12.320 --> 44:13.320
Totally.

44:13.320 --> 44:17.600
In fact, one of the many people suspected of JFK's murder.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.600
Yeah.

44:18.600 --> 44:19.600
Yeah.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
Definitely.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.600
Yeah.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.600
Weird.

44:22.600 --> 44:26.120
So now we get to the point of the episode where we get the introduction of Joseph Rogan

44:26.120 --> 44:27.800
and Edward Bravo.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.800
Oh boy.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.800
It's interesting.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.800
They have a different vibe back then.

44:31.800 --> 44:32.800
Oh yeah?

44:32.800 --> 44:33.800
Yeah.

44:33.800 --> 44:34.800
Maybe not.

44:34.800 --> 44:35.800
Joe's definitely high.

44:35.800 --> 44:36.800
Wow.

44:36.800 --> 44:37.800
It's high as hell.

44:37.800 --> 44:38.800
That's nice.

44:38.800 --> 44:39.800
That's good to know.

44:39.800 --> 44:40.800
But this is really awkward.

44:40.800 --> 44:41.800
It's really, really awkward.

44:41.800 --> 44:45.240
Well, it's good having you here and it was good seeing you last night.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.240
There's so much to talk about.

44:46.240 --> 44:51.880
Obviously, Joe Rogan of NewsRadio, Fear Factor, The Man Show, the list goes on and on, UFC

44:51.880 --> 44:53.880
Ultimate Fighting Championship.

44:53.880 --> 44:56.680
You've been doing that pretty much since the start, haven't you?

44:56.680 --> 44:59.280
I started working for the UFC in 1997.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.160
I was the post-fight interviewer.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.160
So 13 years.

45:03.160 --> 45:04.160
Yeah.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.160
It's been a long time.

45:05.160 --> 45:09.440
In fact, I remember like in 99 talking to you and you're like, man, this UFC is going

45:09.440 --> 45:10.440
to be huge.

45:10.440 --> 45:11.440
And I never even heard of it.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.840
It's going to be bigger than the NFL.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.840
Yeah.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.120
Everybody was like, what are you talking about?

45:15.120 --> 45:16.120
You're crazy.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.120
Yeah.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.120
It's now look at it's giant.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.240
And it's in Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.240
Right here.

45:22.240 --> 45:26.980
You know, when I was with Ventura last week, one of the guys from the company that does

45:26.980 --> 45:30.560
stuff for UFC was there and he was going to interview Brock Lesnar right after that when

45:30.560 --> 45:32.400
he was on the shoot with us.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.440
And so old Brock's back bigger than ever, huh?

45:34.440 --> 45:35.440
Yeah.

45:35.440 --> 45:36.440
Yeah.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.440
Yeah.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.440
That was great.

45:38.440 --> 45:40.560
It's not as electric as some of this present day stuff.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.360
And I think it's because Alex is sober.

45:43.360 --> 45:49.240
I think there is a markedly different chemistry.

45:49.240 --> 45:53.000
They might need something to grease the wheels on this.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.240
There might need to be some grease on these wheels.

45:55.240 --> 45:56.240
That's possible.

45:56.240 --> 45:58.440
Holy shit.

45:58.440 --> 46:01.800
This is not what I expected because it's chemistry.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.680
There's a chemical missing, if you will.

46:03.680 --> 46:04.680
Yeah.

46:04.680 --> 46:05.680
Ethanol.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.680
Yeah.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.600
Alex is sitting here with Eddie and Joe.

46:10.600 --> 46:18.040
All of the human elements are there for the record setting most listened to podcast ever

46:18.040 --> 46:19.040
in human history.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.960
Hundreds of millions of people have listened to it.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.720
And then the sequel that set the world on fire.

46:23.720 --> 46:24.720
On fire.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.760
And it is just trash.

46:26.760 --> 46:27.760
You gotta be drunk.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.760
So bad.

46:28.760 --> 46:32.560
You gotta be in Rogan's house and you gotta be a half of a fifth through.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.560
Yeah.

46:33.560 --> 46:34.880
I think there's some funny stuff to get into.

46:34.880 --> 46:39.880
And I think one really gigantic lie that Alex tells that I think is interesting.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.400
But this is a case of me getting hoisted on my own petard.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.120
I legitimately thought it would be fun.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.120
Yep.

46:47.120 --> 46:48.120
And it's kind of...

46:48.120 --> 46:49.680
It's kind of a dud.

46:49.680 --> 46:50.680
Well, no.

46:50.680 --> 46:51.680
It's not.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.600
It's a fine interview for the most part.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.600
Sure.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.600
Like, Rogan's high.

46:55.600 --> 46:56.600
Well, yeah.

46:56.600 --> 46:59.160
Like, Alex is talking about, like, oh, we were talking last night.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.800
You told me something really interesting.

47:00.800 --> 47:04.000
And it's clearly that Rogan was, like, trying to spitball.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.400
Maybe he was working on a joke or something.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.400
Sure.

47:07.400 --> 47:08.400
Sure.

47:08.400 --> 47:09.400
Sure.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.400
Sure.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.400
And Alex takes it as, like, a real point.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.400
Oh, no.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.400
Last night, you were really making a lot of points that I thought were right on.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.520
Let's get into the red button.

47:16.520 --> 47:17.520
The red button.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.520
You were talking about how if there's a red button, they're gonna hit it.

47:19.520 --> 47:24.880
Well, you know, what I was saying is that I believe that all human behavior is natural.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.880
Just like I believe that all animal behavior is natural.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.160
Bees make beehives and ants make anthills.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.320
These are all natural things.

47:32.320 --> 47:37.000
Humans are far more complex, but we don't think of ourselves as being natural, that

47:37.000 --> 47:38.880
we're moving in a natural direction.

47:38.880 --> 47:45.880
And I think that human beings and human society, especially with technology, I think we create

47:45.880 --> 47:47.320
technology and innovation.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.420
That's what we're here for.

47:48.420 --> 47:53.400
And it's very possible that what human beings are here for is to make some new reality,

47:53.400 --> 47:57.200
make some new technological innovation that's gonna change the world.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.840
And it could be a big bang machine.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.160
It could be a time machine.

48:01.160 --> 48:08.760
It could be just some incredible discovery, something that they're going to invent eventually.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.880
I mean, if they keep going with things like the Large Hadron Collider, they're not gonna

48:11.880 --> 48:12.880
stop there.

48:12.880 --> 48:16.760
They're gonna use whatever findings that they get from the Large Hadron Collider if it doesn't

48:16.760 --> 48:17.760
blow up the world.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.280
And they're gonna try the next thing.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.280
Well, what happens now?

48:20.280 --> 48:21.280
The goal is blow up the world.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.920
Well, I don't know what the goal is.

48:22.920 --> 48:24.080
I mean, that's just the joke.

48:24.080 --> 48:27.660
The joke is that we're here to make the big bang machine and that there's a reset button

48:27.660 --> 48:31.800
that gets pressed every 15 billion years and that these intelligent monkeys get to a point

48:31.800 --> 48:36.160
where they break down matter and try to figure out what is at the center of the universe.

48:36.160 --> 48:39.040
And they press that button and it restarts all over again.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.400
I mean, who knows?

48:40.400 --> 48:41.400
Just speculation.

48:41.400 --> 48:42.400
Wow.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.400
Wow.

48:43.400 --> 48:44.400
Heavy, man.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.400
Heavy.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.400
It's some good shit, man.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.740
It's some good shit.

48:47.740 --> 48:53.520
I think Douglas Adams put it better that if the question and the answer were ever known

48:53.520 --> 48:56.520
then the universe would be destroyed and replaced by something weirder.

48:56.520 --> 48:59.000
It was a lot simpler and a lot more quick.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.840
But I mean, that kind of a thing is like, yeah, I could imagine getting high with someone

49:04.840 --> 49:08.440
like a lot of the people I knew in college and having almost identical conversations

49:08.440 --> 49:09.440
to that.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.440
Yeah, 100%.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.440
There's nothing wrong with that.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.440
That's fine.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.440
No.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.440
We've moved on to simulation theory now.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.440
It's the same basic thing.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.440
But that's a fine place for Joe to exist.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.440
Yeah.

49:17.440 --> 49:23.360
Because he's like, okay, he's the older brother who's into weed, but maybe you've only stolen

49:23.360 --> 49:30.680
a few beers at this point in your development down the opening your mind spectrum.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.720
And that can be useful in people's lives.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.800
That can open up your brain to new vistas.

49:35.800 --> 49:36.800
Yeah, yeah.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.800
It's like Val Kilmer in Real Genius.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.760
It's just not that deep.

49:40.760 --> 49:45.560
And then it's also clearly, you can tell that Joe was talking about this as some kind of

49:45.560 --> 49:51.200
like an idea that has the structure of a Rogan bit.

49:51.200 --> 49:54.320
It has the structure of something you could see him doing on stage.

49:54.320 --> 50:00.200
And Alex is like, yeah, man, you know, it is an interesting idea that humans are trying

50:00.200 --> 50:01.200
to make open.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.200
They're trying to kill us all.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.240
That's just how we're supposed to do it.

50:04.240 --> 50:08.280
It's again, not being able to parse out the like reality and sort of.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.280
Yeah.

50:09.280 --> 50:13.280
You can't have jokes if you don't realize the transgression over reality.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.320
That's why his humor is so terrible.

50:15.320 --> 50:19.840
So Alex now gets to trying to plug some Eddie Bravo's jujitsu business.

50:19.840 --> 50:23.080
Guys, both of you, fire out your websites.

50:23.080 --> 50:31.080
Joe Rogan dot net, 10th Planet JJ dot com, 10th Planet JJ jujitsu dot com.

50:31.080 --> 50:34.280
Man, I see your 10th Planet shirts and stuff everywhere.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.040
I mean, I'm really I'm all over the country.

50:36.040 --> 50:39.640
I'll see people wearing 10th Planet stuff or talking really incredible.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.680
Well, how many how many gems do you have?

50:41.680 --> 50:45.240
Twenty five, I think, you know, something like that.

50:45.240 --> 50:50.000
Well, aren't you one of the best known jujitsu teachers?

50:50.000 --> 50:52.920
He won't toot his own horn, so I'll say yes.

50:52.920 --> 50:58.200
He's one of the most innovative and important jujitsu instructors in the country.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.600
Sounds like B.S. because he's my best friend, but it really is true.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.960
He's one of the most important.

51:02.960 --> 51:06.560
He's just smokes a lot of weed and comes up with crazy jujitsu moves.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.280
And it turns out they work.

51:08.280 --> 51:11.320
And I'm I'm also known as a conspiracy theorist freak.

51:11.320 --> 51:15.880
So that's right. He and he's more of a conspiracy theorist freak than me.

51:15.880 --> 51:18.480
Eddie sounds like kind of fun.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.760
Yeah, I'm a freak.

51:20.760 --> 51:22.720
I'm a conspiracy freak, man.

51:22.720 --> 51:23.640
That's what I'm here.

51:23.640 --> 51:29.920
But he also has to introduce that, like to the proceeding as just the energy is off.

51:29.920 --> 51:36.600
Yeah, it seems like Eddie or Alex should have just been like, let's do some conspiracy theories.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.440
That's what we're here for. Well, Eddie tries.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.200
Yeah, Eddie tries to push in that direction.

51:40.200 --> 51:43.160
That's right. But Alex can't because Eddie is a no one to him,

51:43.160 --> 51:47.320
whereas he's got to talk to Joe, the the big star or whatever.

51:47.320 --> 51:52.680
It's less that. And I think it's more that like he's not fucked up and he doesn't want to.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.920
That's fair. I just think it's that he's not fucked up.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.160
It might get too weird.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.000
Yeah. Although I just looked it up.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.240
It turns out that Rogan's podcast has started by this point.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.840
OK. Started in December 2009.

52:03.840 --> 52:08.440
So he's almost a year in the Rogan experience at this point.

52:08.440 --> 52:17.240
Yeah. So Alex is they get to talking about Eddie wants to know about the troops

52:17.240 --> 52:20.880
and the like drug trade with opium in Afghanistan.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.560
All right. OK, OK, OK.

52:22.560 --> 52:27.600
One of his one of his like is like, how do they make money on that?

52:27.600 --> 52:29.680
How do they make money selling drugs?

52:29.680 --> 52:32.280
Sure. How does the actual process work?

52:32.280 --> 52:33.360
OK, OK, OK.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.320
And we never do get an answer on it.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.000
Well, naturally.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.800
But this next clip, I think, is fascinating because it is the behavior that you see on the Joe Rogan experience

52:42.800 --> 52:48.920
whenever Alex is a guest being, you know, carried out by Joe 11 years prior.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.320
It's flowing out and the U.S. troops protect the opium.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.960
They put this on the news because if they don't, Al Qaeda will get the money.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.440
And no, no, no, I'm serious.

52:57.440 --> 53:01.880
I mean, I played a clip of Fox News or all those things, how patriotic it is to grow opium.

53:01.880 --> 53:03.840
But you think I'm joking?

53:03.840 --> 53:05.200
Come on, guys, cue it up.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.800
Oh, let's see this.

53:06.800 --> 53:10.920
You're only here for an hour because you've got to go see it at the way ends at two thirty.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.560
Yes, but I have to see that.

53:12.560 --> 53:13.960
So he calls him on it.

53:13.960 --> 53:16.400
Yeah, he calls Alex on this.

53:16.400 --> 53:18.160
Show me this video then.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.560
So they start playing the clip.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.200
But Joe and Eddie don't have headphones.

53:23.200 --> 53:27.240
Alex, but how does how do the Americans get paid for the opium is what I'm saying?

53:27.240 --> 53:28.400
How does that work?

53:28.400 --> 53:30.480
It gets the OK.

53:30.480 --> 53:31.480
Nineteen ninety nine.

53:31.480 --> 53:32.480
Rivera. Yep.

53:32.480 --> 53:33.840
Can we hear him?

53:33.840 --> 53:35.400
Yeah, you guys would have to have headphones on.

53:35.400 --> 53:38.560
Look, I just played it yesterday during the break.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.560
I'll play it for you.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.560
How's that sound?

53:40.560 --> 53:41.560
Sounds OK.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.560
And listeners have seen it.

53:42.560 --> 53:43.560
Exactly.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.560
Word for word.

53:44.560 --> 53:45.560
Well, there's a shill.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.560
Is your show.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.560
I don't know.

53:47.560 --> 53:53.440
He was the guy who introduced the he was the one who had the Zapruder film first on television.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.640
The word is he knows all about this stuff.

53:55.640 --> 53:57.680
But yeah, at Fox News, he didn't really get into it.

53:57.680 --> 53:58.680
What did he say?

53:58.680 --> 54:02.400
He goes, I'm out here with the colonel and they're out here helping them grow the opium

54:02.400 --> 54:04.000
and the colonel's like, that's right.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.200
We're going the seeds and the fertilizer.

54:06.200 --> 54:07.440
What?

54:07.440 --> 54:10.320
Here's the actual clip that Alex is talking about.

54:10.320 --> 54:13.600
That is the principal crop that is being grown here.

54:13.600 --> 54:16.380
The Taliban lend the farmers the money.

54:16.380 --> 54:18.440
They are indebted to the Taliban.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.020
They have to grow the opium.

54:20.020 --> 54:24.600
Now the Marines in their success are, in a sense, a victim of their success, because

54:24.600 --> 54:30.460
now the population is you know, they have these opium fields and we are tolerating it.

54:30.460 --> 54:35.040
We are tolerating the cultivation of the opium because we know that if we were to destroy

54:35.040 --> 54:39.640
it now, the population would turn against the Marines and it would be a real security

54:39.640 --> 54:40.640
risk.

54:40.640 --> 54:41.880
Let me introduce Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas.

54:41.880 --> 54:45.560
He's the commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 6 Marines.

54:45.560 --> 54:48.040
Really a wonderful group of Marines here.

54:48.040 --> 54:53.620
I know that you care deeply about this this contradiction, the fact that here you have

54:53.620 --> 54:57.180
one of the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted.

54:57.180 --> 55:00.600
And in a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.

55:00.600 --> 55:03.200
I know it grinds at your gut.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.320
How do you deal with it?

55:04.320 --> 55:05.320
What are you doing about it?

55:05.320 --> 55:07.680
Well, frankly, this is a part of the culture.

55:07.680 --> 55:11.960
So while it might grind in my gut, it's what they do.

55:11.960 --> 55:16.160
We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.600
The alternatives are different crops to grow.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.780
They're getting the seed and the fertilizer to do it.

55:20.780 --> 55:24.680
So when Alex says the guy is talking about giving them seed and fertilizer, he's talking

55:24.680 --> 55:30.640
about alternative crops that they can grow instead of poppy, but that just taking all

55:30.640 --> 55:35.640
of their poppy or destroying the fields wouldn't be productive to the mission that he's trying

55:35.640 --> 55:36.720
to undertake.

55:36.720 --> 55:41.560
So Alex goes to commercial and he shows Joe this clip.

55:41.560 --> 55:48.400
Presumably Joe's seen it, and he's either too dumb or Alex showed him a completely edited

55:48.400 --> 55:49.400
version of it.

55:49.400 --> 55:54.520
Well, that is a fascinating piece of video footage with Geraldo Rivera in the poppy for

55:54.520 --> 55:58.560
with the soldiers talking about the poppy fields and how they're protecting them and

55:58.560 --> 56:01.480
providing them fertilizer and helping them grow it.

56:01.480 --> 56:02.480
Yeah.

56:02.480 --> 56:04.480
I mean, that's incredible.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.720
It's outrageous.

56:05.720 --> 56:10.000
If you go and actually watch this, like the context of it is really clear.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.600
So you think that, you know, we were at the market and everywhere we go, they're selling

56:13.600 --> 56:14.600
these little devices.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.600
Take a shot of this, Greg.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.700
They're hand-carved.

56:17.700 --> 56:23.820
These are the little devices they use to scrape the opium sap off the plant.

56:23.820 --> 56:28.520
And I watched as you bought every one that was for sale because you care so deeply.

56:28.520 --> 56:29.520
Why'd you do that?

56:29.520 --> 56:30.520
I want them off the street.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.360
The idea is that we don't want to harvest the poppy.

56:32.360 --> 56:37.480
We want to, you know, hopefully turn the poppy over and put some wheat, cotton, watermelon,

56:37.480 --> 56:38.480
cucumber.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.960
It's all great stuff they grow out here.

56:39.960 --> 56:44.880
We just want to see that come to fruition and the poppy just to go away.

56:44.880 --> 56:49.960
It's completely counter to the context that Alex is describing it in, and it's also counter

56:49.960 --> 56:52.420
to the context that Joe has been convinced of.

56:52.420 --> 56:57.720
We want to see the poppy go away is a very hard sentence to avoid when your argument

56:57.720 --> 57:01.680
is, they're helping them grow it to kill Americans.

57:01.680 --> 57:05.120
And when Alex says specifically they're giving them the seed and the fertilizer, and when

57:05.120 --> 57:10.900
you look at that clip, it's specifically seed and fertilizer in the context of other crops

57:10.900 --> 57:12.960
they can grow instead.

57:12.960 --> 57:21.200
So this behavior is so consistent throughout Joe Rogan's career with Alex that I just don't,

57:21.200 --> 57:26.640
I can't believe that it's not, I don't know what to think about it.

57:26.640 --> 57:32.700
He can't stop himself from being like, yeah, he's too credulous towards a guy who has been

57:32.700 --> 57:34.480
lying to him since they met.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.480
Yeah.

57:35.480 --> 57:36.480
And it's wild.

57:36.480 --> 57:39.760
It doesn't feel like it's believable.

57:39.760 --> 57:40.760
No it's not.

57:40.760 --> 57:41.760
It's not believable.

57:41.760 --> 57:46.880
It's hard to, it's, I can't square the idea that he is not in on it in some fashion.

57:46.880 --> 57:47.880
Yes.

57:47.880 --> 57:48.880
It's not unfathomable.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.040
You can't not be at least a little bit in on it.

57:51.040 --> 57:57.040
This level of being duped, but like it's pathological.

57:57.040 --> 58:00.280
Like it would have to show up in all of his other relationships too.

58:00.280 --> 58:01.280
Totally.

58:01.280 --> 58:02.280
Totally.

58:02.280 --> 58:03.280
No, no, no.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.160
Everybody has to either be taking advantage of him or he's in on it in some way.

58:06.160 --> 58:09.640
But honestly, I don't think that that's too unbelievable.

58:09.640 --> 58:10.640
No, that's not.

58:10.640 --> 58:13.000
I mean, look at the people he's had on his show in the past.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.560
You have that Dave Seaman guy who's a big Pizzagate dude.

58:16.560 --> 58:20.160
You had Dave Rubin was on a bunch, Steven Crowder.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.960
Did the Molyneux on there one time?

58:21.960 --> 58:22.960
Molyneux?

58:22.960 --> 58:23.960
Couple times.

58:23.960 --> 58:24.960
Couple times.

58:24.960 --> 58:25.960
I think a couple times.

58:25.960 --> 58:26.960
It's brutal.

58:26.960 --> 58:27.960
Yeah.

58:27.960 --> 58:29.640
And so I think that there is a decent chance that maybe he is pathologically gullible.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.340
He's just too gullible.

58:31.340 --> 58:36.240
But then you'd think it would show up in his relationships with people like the closer

58:36.240 --> 58:37.240
folks.

58:37.240 --> 58:38.240
Like Anari Shafir.

58:38.240 --> 58:39.240
Sure.

58:39.240 --> 58:40.240
Or Tom Segura.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.240
Or Bert Kreischer.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.380
Yeah, but I mean that's why comics hang around with other comics.

58:43.380 --> 58:45.520
We don't know what you normal people are doing.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.200
We don't know what's going on with you guys.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.200
You could say anything.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.720
We're just trying to write bits, man.

58:49.720 --> 58:50.920
I'm just trying to write bits.

58:50.920 --> 58:56.040
I guess you've got to kind of take comedians out of the entire conversation because that's

58:56.040 --> 58:57.040
a whole other world.

58:57.040 --> 59:02.520
Because we're just a different, yeah, it's just weird.

59:02.520 --> 59:08.800
Yeah I find it difficult to believe that that's true though because it would be something

59:08.800 --> 59:13.840
that I think he would need to get therapy with or like he couldn't have made it to the

59:13.840 --> 59:17.920
point he's at now if he falls for this kind of shit on a regular basis.

59:17.920 --> 59:23.320
Oh and because I also don't understand what is so special about Alex that requires him

59:23.320 --> 59:25.400
to make excuses for decades.

59:25.400 --> 59:31.560
I don't know, it does seem like he has like a weird appeal to authority like hack in him

59:31.560 --> 59:38.760
where if you just say something so confidently and you have like a group of people who tell

59:38.760 --> 59:43.280
Joe that you're actually a very smart person and then you just say something confidently,

59:43.280 --> 59:47.240
Joe's like, wow, a lot of people have to believe this so it must be true.

59:47.240 --> 59:48.920
Because Dan Hope thinks he's cool.

59:48.920 --> 59:53.240
Yeah exactly, like it does seem like there's that just, oh okay, well I heard this was

59:53.240 --> 59:57.640
cool and this guy is, I'm told this guy is super smart so I have to at least engage with

59:57.640 --> 59:59.960
it and then it's too easy to...

59:59.960 --> 01:00:06.120
It's just remarkable to me to see the exact same dynamic though that happened in these

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.700
present day podcast appearances being done to Rogan in 2010.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:17.200
This lying about the context of something, Joe calls him on it and then there's evidence

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:23.120
proffered but whether the evidence that's given is selectively edited to the point where

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:29.320
it only shows what Alex wants him to see or he sees it and accepts Alex's framing of it

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:35.120
despite the clear context that's to the contrary, whatever it is, he's not equipped to deal

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.920
with the sort of people he's associating with clearly.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.360
And now of course it's got to be 10 million times as hard because if you confront that

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:52.180
reality now then you have to be like, okay, well for the past 30 years this guy I have

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:57.080
thought was my friend has been a complete piece of shit liar to me.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.880
Yeah it's almost like, you know, you get that Nigerian prince email.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.920
Yeah and you're like, man, you know, I just...

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.960
You respond and then you give him $1,000 and then he wants five.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.660
I don't want to be the stupid guy, I'm not going to be the stupid guy who doesn't, yeah.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.280
It's almost like Joe's pot committed on not calling out Alex at this point.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.000
It does seem like it, yeah.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Anyway.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.720
Oh boy, sorry Joe.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:25.480
Did you ever, I don't know if this is a sort of experience that I had or if it's more universal

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.960
but we had a bunch of National Geographics in the house.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:34.380
Tons of magazines in National Geographic because they're educational, they're glossy.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:39.160
So as a kid I would read tons of things about forests and various animals.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.160
I would have liked that.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:47.040
I barely got dinosaurs and National Geographic was too believed in evolution for my household

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.040
at the time.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.200
Well did you know that Nat Geo is putting out a lot of cover-ups?

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.280
I did not know that Nat Geo is covering, okay, okay.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.680
Putting out a lot of cover-ups on the chemtrail issue.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.680
I'm here for it.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.680
You know what it is?

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.480
Nat Geo puts out these, something with Nat Geo is connected with the government because

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.480
you watch anything...

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.440
No, no, no, National Geographic, you've all heard about how record numbers of missionaries

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.040
turn out to be CIA.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040
Really?

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.040
Yeah, and record numbers of Peace Corps.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.040
What?

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.040
Record to what?

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040
Compared to what?

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:22.600
No, National Geographic is a eugenics organization and they are one of the highest level CIA

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600
fronts.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600
Really?

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.640
I'm just going to say that a lot of people will say this is Malarkey, a very good friend

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640
of mine.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.880
His father is in the CIA.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.880
Cool.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:37.000
Okay, my buddy's dad is in the CIA, so obviously Nat Geo is a fucking record, record compared

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
to what?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Sure, it's meaningless.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.440
But it's never substantiated how National Geographic is a eugenics front and a high-level

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.440
CIA operation.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.600
Sure, of the highest level.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.240
Just throwing that out there, and then, well, you guys are going to say this is Malarkey.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.060
But my buddy's dad is in the CIA, enough said.

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.040
Joe Biden stole Malarkey from Rogan.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040
That's what he gave him $100 million for.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040
That's true.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:11.640
So, there's some conspiracies that, you know, Eddie Bravo doesn't seem to be on the earth

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.260
is flat tip.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.400
At least not yet.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400
Right.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
Right.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.440
And that actually comes to a point I want to make.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440
And that is that...

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.440
The earth is flat.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.160
We've been trying to get to this for a while.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.160
Yes.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160
Okay, I've been waiting for it.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.160
Finally.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160
I knew it was going to come sooner or later.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160
No.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160
I've been waiting for it.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160
I've been waiting for it for years.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.080
I was interested to see if you'd go back and you'd see the same conspiracies that he's

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.600
into in the present being floated in 2010.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600
Sure, yeah.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.840
Because if the earth is flat now, it was no less flat then.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.320
And it's not like these ideas weren't spiraling around in places on the internet.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.760
It's not like it's a recent phenomenon.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760
Sure, sure.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:54.680
So, I was going back and I'm like, it's incredible there's not any flat earth stuff.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.240
And part of the reason is that that wasn't that popular in 2010.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240
It wasn't a meme yet.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.240
On the internet.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.240
Yeah.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240
Exactly.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.520
And this is something that's important to understand about conspiracy theorists.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.000
They think that they're independent thinkers.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Yeah.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.600
And they think that they're like, oh, really?

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600
Really digging into stuff.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.600
Red pill, man.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.360
They are the biggest fucking followers in the world.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
Easy.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:21.480
These things are popular and then they get into them and then nothing ever happens and

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.120
something else will become popular.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.120
Yeah.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.280
Like the Sandy Hook truth or whenever that was popular.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.280
Totally.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.600
No, it's a fashionable, it's a fashion thing.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.860
Conspiracy theories are fashion.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.960
And some things are aesthetically important to retain along the way.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.960
Of course.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.520
Much like, I may not listen to the boss tones anymore but I'll still be a boss tones fan

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.520
until I die.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.520
Sure.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.000
He's gonna be a 9-11 truther until he dies.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Of course.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.400
But it's maybe not the most primary thing to talk about all the time.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.160
You can't spend your life listening to the boss tones.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.160
No.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.520
And you can't spend your life always talking about 9-11 conspiracies.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520
Exactly.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.520
Yeah, you gotta move on.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.800
There's going to be a piece of each of our histories and I just, I found that fascinating

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.880
that it was like, well, yeah, of course.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.880
Yeah.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.880
You're into what you're into at the time.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880
Totally.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.920
And it turns out something that he's into at the time is that Hurricane Katrina might

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.920
have been fake.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.920
Oh boy.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.680
What do you think about the conspiracy theories about a Katrina being a controlled hurricane?

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.760
How the way it...

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.520
Multiple top meteorologists said it had two eyes for a while, it just sat there, it didn't

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.760
act like a normal hurricane, and I've had the father of weather weapons on who was flying

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.120
into cyclones that are over 200 miles an hour in the 40s, Ben Livingston, and this is all

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.120
declassified.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.120
This is like AP.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.560
And, well, we're going to break, but to make a long story short...

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560
We're going to break already?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560
Yeah.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.360
In 1967, it's a regular radio clock.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.280
There's like long segments, short segments.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.760
In 1967, Stanford Research Institute and the Naval Weapons Laboratory certified they can

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:51.680
create and control hurricanes as easy as, kiss my hand, we'll be right back.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.840
So it was a weather weapon hurricane?

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.120
I suppose?

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.360
We don't get back to this.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.440
Why would we?

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.200
It was or it wasn't, and it is.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.360
So it was.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360
Cool.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360
Yeah.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.360
What are the implications of that?

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.720
Well, let's see.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.940
If Katrina was a controlled hurricane, sent by whom would be the first question.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.760
That is an important first question.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.680
We would assume the American government, I suppose, or a foreign power.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680
Right.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680
All right.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.900
So then the question would follow why, why specifically where it was attacked.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.040
So then you got to say that it's a race-based bioweapon, I would assume.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040
I don't know.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.040
Yeah.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.720
Anyway, another conspiracy that gets floated when they come back from break is that the

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.200
movie Machete is meant to start a race war.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200
Okay.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.880
So you believe that the movie Machete with Danny Trejo is by the government designed

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.360
to fuel a race war?

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.560
He's a superhero Mexican home Depot guy.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.920
Just beat that out.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920
I'm sorry.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920
I'm sorry.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920
I totally okay.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.720
But just, just, just, just, okay.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720
We took care of that.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720
Are we good?

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720
Did we take?

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.720
Yeah, we did.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.720
Okay.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.720
I feel like it got out.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.720
No, it didn't.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720
Okay.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720
Stop guys.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720
Come on.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.720
Sorry guys.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720
Alex is not drunk.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720
Did we just racial slur?

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720
I think so.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
I think we just racial slurred.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
I think so.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Yes.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.680
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.680
Wow.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:19.920
Um, but Eddie Bravo does explain that he is a Mexican individual and so, right.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.080
Uh, but it's certainly not a, I mean, this is on the radio.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.080
Yeah.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.080
I wouldn't put that one out there.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.080
Yeah.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.080
I wouldn't put your business out like that.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.080
At the time.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.360
Apparently they had a little bit better a delay situation.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.520
It seems like whoever was on the button on the red button there, boom, I'm there.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.520
Oh boy.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.520
Yeah.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.520
Yeah.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.520
Big bang machine.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.200
They had actual adults working for him instead of hiring teens up the street.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.200
Yeah.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.000
So at this point now we have Alex sober trying to deal with doing a show that has FCC rules

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.120
with two guys who are high and one of them is clearly a lunatic.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.000
Insane and unable to deal with the FCC.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Yeah.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Yeah.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So he has been shamed.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Eddie has been shamed a little bit.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Sure.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.300
And so he recedes into the background while Joe complains about the governor of Arizona.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.960
How hilarious is that dumb lady that's running Arizona that Jan, whatever the hell her name

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960
is?

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.360
Who's the, who's the governor of Arizona?

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.040
Well, well, yeah, that was a little Jan Brewer.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040
Yeah.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040
That lady is so dumb.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.760
Have you ever seen her on TV?

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.960
Oh my God.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.300
When she was on the debate and she just paused, she didn't know what to say.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.780
She paused for like 10 solid seconds, said nothing.

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:33.060
She makes up stuff about people getting their heads cut off over in Arizona that Mexicans

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.080
are coming over here and cutting people's heads off.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.520
And then they're like, where are these bodies?

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520
Like, what are you talking about?

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.520
Wow.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.920
It sounds like Alex present day.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920
Wow.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920
Yeah.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920
Wow.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920
Yeah.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.320
I don't think Joe should be allowed to call anybody dumb.

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320
No.

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320
Yeah.

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.240
It's, it's tough to hear.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240
Yeah, buddy.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.000
Um, but yeah, it's, it's interesting cause Alex then has to sort of rebut a little bit

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
because he is also quite xenophobic.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yeah.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.880
He's trying to be, yeah, you're cutting in on my racism here, buddy.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.160
And the governor is a Republican.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.160
Right.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.760
And he's like, you know, there is the need to have sort of at least a little bit of a

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760
pushback.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760
Yeah.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.480
Um, and then Eddie gets back in the mix.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.480
Sure.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480
He tries again.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480
Element of chaos.

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
Let me, let me just say something.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.400
I'm not a big fan and Joe knows this.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.400
I hate super movie.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.480
Eddie Bravo.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.480
Come on man.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.480
We're on the radio.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.480
I'm sorry.

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.480
I can't bring him with me anymore.

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.480
This is ridiculous.

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:27.480
He's not a professional.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.560
I hate superhero movies.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:36.080
I hate super, I'm a Mexican, El Machete wasn't the greatest plot ever.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.280
So he's trying to get back to Machete.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.280
Yeah.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.280
Is that what we were doing?

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.280
Yeah.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.280
So he doesn't like superhero movies.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280
Uh huh.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.280
Something got bleeped.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280
Yeah.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.280
Okay.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:54.920
Now as Eddie goes on, I think he's making actually a fairly decent point.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:02.280
And that is, you know, when I, as somebody of Mexican descent, uh, heritage, I see Spider-Man.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.960
I can't identify with Spider-Man.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960
Sure.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960
I don't identify with Batman.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960
Sure.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.960
This rich asshole with all his gadgets.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:08.960
Of course not.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.840
I don't, uh, I don't see myself in these, these heroes and for me maybe Machete is somebody

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.680
that I can see as, and Alex is like, nah, nah, nah, he's not nice enough to white people.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680
Oh boy.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.240
You know, as a Mexican, you can't relate to Spider-Man.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:30.440
That's a white nerd who, you know, and then, and then, uh, um, wait, as Mexican people,

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.440
we have nothing.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.240
Now we have something, you know, Superman, a white guy from another galaxy.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:40.120
Now we have El Machete, you know, for me, I've felt like, why couldn't it be a Mexican

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.320
scientist who, you know, who becomes the incredible Hulk or something.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.080
The Mexican superhero hacks up gringos.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.680
Pull up with an axe.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
That's ridiculous.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.680
Yeah.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.680
He's a Mexican long hair.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.680
Well, let me tell you something.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.800
Let me tell you something.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.360
The Mexicans I know that warned me about this film that run the production.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.360
They didn't like the stereotype of Mexicans as working at home Depot and wanting to kill

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360
gringos.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.360
I like that.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:11.960
Oh, well, this has been an insane interview, Eddie Bravo, you, you just really ruined the

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960
whole cause.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:16.400
Did we get another racial slur burped out?

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400
No, I don't think so.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.720
I think it was just awkward silence.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720
Oh, okay.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.720
Yeah.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720
Yeah.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.720
It makes a fine point.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.720
Yeah.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.720
For the most part.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.200
I mean, I think that's an acceptable point and I think Alex's point is essentially just,

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200
I don't know.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200
Whoa.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200
Whoa.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200
Whoa.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200
Whoa.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.200
We can't be having superheroes who aren't nice to white people.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200
Let's calm it down.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200
Oh, a superhero who doesn't like white people.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200
Then what would be the point of superheroes?

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200
Yup.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200
Oh boy.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.440
So we get a really big revelation on this episode.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.440
What's that?

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:49.440
That Superman helped defeat the KKK's expansion efforts in his radio serials?

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440
No.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440
Oh, okay.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:57.440
The mainstream media, the MSM failed to pick up on this, what could be the largest story

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.440
of our times.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.440
Okay.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.600
And that is that Alex Jones knows how to mind control birds.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.240
I've even tried this with birds around my house and things.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:10.080
If I come out and even put in my mind the intent, like I'm going to kill that bird without

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.840
even having a weapon, the bird flies off.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.200
But if you're just being out nice and friendly, you know, the birds just sit there, almost

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.200
land on your hand.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.760
They're all, I've got all these tame swallows around my house.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:22.200
So it's almost like there's something telepathic they pick up on the intent.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.680
Someone is going to take this clip and use it and say, Alex Jones uses mind control on

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680
birds.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.560
They probably will.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.280
I have fulfilled the prophecy.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.800
Alex Jones uses mind control on birds.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.800
I just had to play it to the bed.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.800
You had to do it.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.800
You had to do it.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.800
You couldn't not do it.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.800
Yeah.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:42.800
It had to be done.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.800
I was a little bored.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.800
Yeah.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.520
At this point, like things are kind of starting to fall apart a little bit.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520
Yeah.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520
I can sense that.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.880
I think Eddie and Joe's patience and their high is like, kind of like, I want to have

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880
fun.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880
It's abating.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880
I want out of here.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.880
Alex isn't having fun.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.440
Whenever Eddie starts trying to talk in his, like just the normal way he socially communicates,

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.640
he ends up saying things that he can't say on the radio.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.640
Yeah.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.480
It's like when you go visit your friend at work, you're not allowed to be like, oh, hey,

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.560
we're at this hardware store.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.000
Let me drop some racial slurs.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You can't do it.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Yeah.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.080
And so it's the last clips here.

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.080
Is it possible?

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.720
Is it, you would know, is it possible to create a bomb that makes everybody gay?

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.000
Was that possible?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Probably not.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Okay.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Probably not.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Probably not.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh boy.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Probably not.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.280
And this is where like sort of questions are coming a little faster.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280
Yeah.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280
Yeah.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280
Can we make a gay bomb?

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280
Probably not.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280
Yeah.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280
Are you disappointed in Charlie Sheen?

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.280
Are we doing lightning round?

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.280
A little bit.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.280
Okay.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.280
When Charlie Sheen choked his wife, were you like, damn, you're messing up the cause.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.600
Like I had you on the program.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.040
You were looking good.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.880
Charlie Sheen calling for full disclosure on nine one one and then he's got to go and

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.680
well, he needs a vaccine for that.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.680
Is that what it is?

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.560
That would make me look, I'm not going to get into that whole story.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.920
I'm not going to get into that whole story, but all I wanted to know is does this ever

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920
wear on you?

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.280
I mean, you're constantly dealing with negative stuff by the way.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.280
Charlie's a good guy.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.280
He is a good guy.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.280
Okay.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.520
Charlie's good guy, but also chokes his wife.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.080
Hey Joe, I'm going to go with one.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.900
It says a lot about you and Alex that your first thought of Alex's reaction was, how

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:28.960
is Alex going to take this as personally hurting him as opposed to giving a shit about the

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.060
fact that, uh, let me, let me actually clarify that even more.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:40.760
He's saying, how is this going to affect the cause that Alex is pretending to be so passionately

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.920
fighting for?

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.240
How is Charlie Sheen's personal transgressions going to hurt Alex's crusade against imaginary

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.120
windmills?

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.680
Now here's where things turned for me.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.000
I mean, I feel like that's super dark.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.880
That's that's a real dark clip that just happened right there.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.600
Oh, you know, Ooh, I have bad news.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.840
It's going to get more dark.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.840
Yeah.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.160
Oh, but that one was really dark.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:10.560
That's like, um, sort of violence trigger warning maybe for this next clip where Joe

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.640
goes next, by the way, Charlie's a good guy.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640
I use a good guy.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.640
I'm a fan.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.640
I'm a fan.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.640
Platoon was an awesome movie.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.640
I'm a fan of Charlie Sheen.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.400
Have you ever, some chicks need to be choked.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.400
How about that?

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:26.520
Some of them get a little mouthy and you want to get out to them and know who's paying the

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.520
rent here.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.520
All right.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.520
Freak.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520
Is it illegal to choke a girl?

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520
Yes.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.520
I'm kidding.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:33.520
I don't choke anybody.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.640
I don't choke girls, especially unless they want it.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640
And then it's free.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640
Okay.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640
That's enough.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640
Yeesh.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640
That's dark.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640
Yeah.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.680
Significantly darker than I was expecting.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.680
Yeah.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.000
I mean, you know, I guess what you'd call it is the sort of like playful misogyny of

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
2010.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.960
This, uh, yeah.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960
Wow.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.760
I suppose you could, I, wow, it is, it is like, it's really, it, you know, when you

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.280
go back and you watch a nineties movie, like when you rewatch trading places, I rewatch

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.740
that and you're like, well, you could get away with a lot of shit there, but then you

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:10.140
think it's 2010 and you couldn't get away with that.

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.140
That's too recent.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.040
No, you could get away with that shit in 2010 for sure.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.040
Yeah.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.040
Yeah.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040
It's wild.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.040
I, I, I, Jesus.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.480
It's not a joke.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.480
No, it's not.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.480
It's not a joke.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.120
He thinks it's a joke, but even if it, you know, even if it is a joke, it's not like,

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.580
it's not a well-constructed joke.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.640
It's not, it's not a new thought.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.680
It's really just playing on the edge of sometimes domestic violence is warranted honeymooners

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.160
level shit.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.680
That's what we're talking about here.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.680
Yeah.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.680
Yes.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.680
In the 1950s, Jackie Gleason can be like, Oh, I'm going to hit you.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.680
Like, yeah, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.680
Yeah.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680
It's very, it's very strange.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.600
But one of the things that I think is even more strange is that Alex can sense the like

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.800
responsibility he has as a host, which he has completely abdicated in present days.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800
Gone.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:05.640
He's he has, he feels some responsibility to be like, come on, man, come on.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.840
That would be interesting to hear today.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.480
Would he just be like, yeah, no, right.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.480
Like who's that?

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.480
Yes.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480
He would have to.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480
Right.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.120
Cause he had, he does not give a shit.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.120
No.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.120
God damn.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.120
Yeah.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.120
It is kind of interesting.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:27.600
He had some semblance in 2010 of something that was precluding him and stopping him from

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.680
going into that.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.120
Maybe it's a possibility of like, the audience was more family audience at that time.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.120
Could be.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.200
Maybe there was more of a puritanical streak to the people who had listened to him on the

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:43.920
radio and shortwave, which was the most of his audience as the internet and the supplement

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.200
lines came in.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:52.820
Maybe he didn't have to keep such a pretend air of, uh, Hey, this kind of conversation

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.580
doesn't fly here, gentlemen.

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:57.560
I imagine getting kicked off of social media and stuff.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.080
Probably that was much later though.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:03.720
I think he'd given up some of that, uh, Oh, even back at like 2014.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.800
I bet he would let Joe Rogan riff a little bit more, even if it was getting into territories

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:16.080
that was seemingly advocating for, even if it's facetiously advocating for, sometimes

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.760
women deserve to be choked.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.760
Yeah.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.760
Yeah.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.760
Like it's, uh, yeah, it's weird.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.760
Yeah.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.740
This is a real misogynist episode for Joe.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:30.000
I wouldn't, if I were Joe, I wouldn't look back on this episode, calling Jan Brewer dumb

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.160
and then, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:39.280
The critique of the Arizona governor, if in a vacuum, could be seen as like things that

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.200
this politician did were dumb.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.200
Sure.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.320
You could view them outside of like unnecessarily misogynistic stuff.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.320
Sure.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320
Sure.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.440
It's tough to, when like, I just wish that conversation.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.240
To be clear, Jan Brewer, not a good governor.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.240
Yeah.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.000
I wish that that conversation wasn't there.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Yeah.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Yeah.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
We could not have that.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I wish it was.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.520
Cause then it could just be like, Oh, isn't it funny Eddie thinks that Katrina was fake

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.720
and he keeps saying slurs on air and he keeps getting bleeped.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.720
Yeah.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720
Yeah.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.300
So anyway, uh, this gets a little bit uncomfortable and uh, they, they, you know, they have to

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:17.440
come towards the end here and uh, Joe has to be like, Alex, you're fun.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.800
You're fun to hang out with, man.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.800
Okay, sure.

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.600
Saying that, you know, you're a, you're a fun guy to hang around with and people always

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.200
say, man, you're friends with Alex Jones.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200
Is that a bummer?

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.600
And I'm like, no man, Alex Jones is a cool guy.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.760
We have a good time.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.960
Last night we went to Fogo to chow, we had some delicious meat.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960
It was awesome.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.960
We had a great time.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.200
Then we went out to the comedy club and we went out to dinner afterwards.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200
We had a great time.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.200
We hung out.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.200
I had a lot of laughs.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.200
There was no doom and gloom and you know, it was like, man, hanging out with Alex Jones

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.200
must be a bummer.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.480
You know, the dude's always talking about the end of the world and vaccines robbing

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.480
your soul.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.360
And no, you're, you're fun.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.280
I mean, he's been defensive about hanging out with Alex for over a decade.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.280
Yeah, man.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.560
You got to ask yourself why.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560
Yeah.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560
Why would that be?

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560
Yup.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560
Yup.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:08.560
Why is it that people think, hey, that guy you keep vouching for bad news over the course

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:13.040
of a decade, constantly having people be like, don't do that.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.040
Yeah.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.700
I mean, that is though, that is such comedy.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:21.320
That is such like the way that it's worked for so long in comedy of just like, yeah,

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.920
there's a little bit of permissiveness.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:27.600
It's totally like, oh yeah, yeah, no, no, no, I know, I've heard he's a fucking monster,

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.840
but he's always been cool to me.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.440
I haven't seen that behavior.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440
Exactly.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.240
So, so I totally, so that means he can't be a violent misogynist racist.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240
Yeah.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.240
Yeah.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.920
I wouldn't listen to his show to see what happened right before I came on.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.320
Oh, that'd be a terrible idea.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.320
No.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.320
That's office behavior.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.320
That's not fun.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.320
Yeah.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.880
Also, there's another funny thing.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:54.000
They're talking about Brock Lesnar and he had like diverticulitis and they were talking

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.720
about how like it was because he just ate meat before.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:57.720
Sure.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:58.720
And that's not good.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.720
That's bad.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:05.400
And that's really funny to me because Joe would later have Jordan Peterson on his podcast

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.840
advocating his all meat diet.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:08.840
Jesus.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.320
Jesus Christ.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.200
I hate these people.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.560
I hate these people so much.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.560
Yep.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560
Yeah.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.960
I mean it has to be, it could also be, I could see it being this where it's like Joe discounts

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.200
anything that happens on the show.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.700
He's just like, yeah, Alex does his show and it's all bullshit.

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:30.440
It's entertainment for, and nothing he says matters on the show.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.820
It only matters what he says whenever he's off air, when he's a person.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.680
Does it matter what he says on your show, Joe?

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.680
Exactly.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.600
Because it's the same, a lot of it is the same.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.600
You would think.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.600
There's overlap.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.600
Yeah.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.880
And then just like, maybe it is, look, I get it.

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:50.520
If Joe and Alex are super good friends and Joe knows for a fact that Alex is full of

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:56.000
shit and is blah, blah, blah, blah, it's all made up shit, he's still a friend that is

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.560
directly responsible for so much evil happening.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.560
Yeah, no.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.560
Even if you think he's faking it.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560
Yeah.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560
It's almost worse.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560
It's not almost.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.560
It may be worse.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.560
It's worse.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560
Yeah.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.560
I think you could have a debate on that.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.560
It's more malicious.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.560
Yeah.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.560
Yeah.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.560
Emptier.

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:21.080
Signing off on it, whether it's real or you know it's fake, is ethically both bad.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.000
No, it's not good at all.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Yeah.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Yeah.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
There's no way out for Joe.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.080
There's no redemption for that whatsoever.

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.080
No.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:33.040
It's just been over a decade of negligence on his part, not recognizing the cancerous

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.560
and toxic influence of this guy that he just has fun at a steakhouse with.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.560
Yeah.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.360
There's a pathetic lack of responsibility on his part.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.360
Yeah.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:51.400
It's interesting to me that we've seen it on Joe's show whenever we've talked about

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.400
these present ones.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.400
Mm-hmm.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.680
I didn't think it went like that exact same behavior.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.240
It's the same things.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:04.320
It's annoying to me the way that you'll hear in these interviews in the present that's

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.240
like, ah, we put on those Bush masks.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240
Yeah.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:11.200
And they have that same story that they tell that sort of solidifies their friendship and

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.560
their connection, and that's annoying.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.560
Yeah.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:21.240
But it's even more annoying to go back to the past in 2010 and see the inability to

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:27.360
fact check claims Alex has made that you instinctually think aren't correct, and then at the same

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.880
time be like, ah, you're fun, making excuses for misinformation and complete fraud based

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.560
on like, we have fun.

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560
Yeah.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:43.240
And I think I find it viscerally fucked up to go back nearly, like a decade, and see

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.280
no change, like no growth, and if anything, regression.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.280
Yes.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.280
I would say regression.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.280
That's fucked.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.280
Yeah.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280
That really fucks with my head.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.280
Yeah.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:58.800
You know, because in my time period, I think we can go back through our show and see just

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.880
pretty consistent like, there's growth, there's change, there's something.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.680
Yeah, there's some missteps here and there.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:12.420
We fuck up, we grow, we move on, and we're, yeah, we do what we can, but to be stasis,

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:15.640
to just be that, and then get worse.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:21.860
I see Joe kind of worse because I think he's gotten more entrenched in these positions

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.720
of like, hey, Alex is a fun guy, why does everyone not want me to hang out with him?

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.720
Totally.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.960
And if he's so consistently being lied to by Alex, Alex showing him either fraudulent

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.520
or misrepresented proof of his claims, he's just gotten deeper and deeper in those holes.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.520
Yeah.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:41.160
I think Eddie seems more delightful at this point.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160
Yeah.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160
Yeah.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.040
I agree.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.320
There's something about him that just is delightful and good-

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.320
No, I get it.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:56.720
There's a nature about him that kind of, I enjoy it when he chimes in with like a, I'm

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720
a conspiracy freak.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.720
No, I get it.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.720
I get it.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.720
I appreciate John.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.720
I appreciate the problem.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.320
He has a self-awareness too of himself back then.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.320
Yeah.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.320
Like I'm a conspiracy freak.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.360
He introduces himself as such.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.760
He's a recognition that some of the things that he's saying are probably dumb.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.760
Yeah.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:17.960
He's articulating important things about representation and media.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.960
I don't know.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960
It's just, it's weird.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.720
All of these people are doing worse now.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720
Yeah.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.720
Yeah.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:29.760
Eddie seems so, he's just a guy who's like, I know everybody's laughing at me and I've

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.800
accepted that and I'm cool with it because I've still got me.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.120
I've still got my stuff and I'm respected in the field where I'm meant to be respected

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.120
at.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.120
Yeah.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.880
And if you laugh at me whenever I say some stupid conspiracy theories, yeah, man, conspiracy

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.880
theories are stupid.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.880
You should laugh.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.520
Then a couple of years later, my best friend has a hundred million dollars.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.520
A hundred million dollars.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.480
Hey, maybe I start taking this a little bit more seriously.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.480
Maybe too seriously.

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.480
Yeah.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.480
Yeah.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.480
Oh boy.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.480
Anyway, we have one last clip.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.480
Okay.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.800
About Y2K, which is an interesting, interesting, uh, Alex's question, uh, his answer, uh, is,

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.760
uh, O'Donnell Ian in its non forthrightness.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.760
Okay.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.960
Alex, I got a question about the Y2K you were saying.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.000
I was listening to old tapes and you were saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.600
I did nine hours of radio on Y2K on the Genesis network.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.600
You notice that before a question was even asked, Alex goes into defensive mode.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.600
Yeah.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.600
Yeah.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.840
And my best friend runs in on my wife and she says, they're on ABC news saying a missile

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.840
was launched from Russia.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.840
Ooh.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.840
Now it's his wife's fault.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.840
Yeah.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.040
So I run back out there and ABC news is saying a missile has been fired for Russia.

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.840
So I said, I don't know what it means, but a missile has been fired for Russia.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.360
Then they come back and say, Oh, it was just a scud.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:47.480
We have to have the Russians here at NORAD and it was like some kind of drill or something.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.360
And then I went on a guy named Michael Trudeau show that day and made jokes about it.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.580
So people took nine hours and edited nine hours.

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:57.960
Part of it, me joking around, like Joe was saying earlier, like nuclear plants were blowing

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960
up.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:26:59.960
Yeah, no, it's not true.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.960
No, no.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.080
What they did is they just took pieces and I got to have an AP article saying, well,

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.400
six plants are going offline.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.960
And then an hour later they'd say it wasn't true.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.480
They were doing that to create fear.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.240
Like, like I didn't believe in Y2K at first, then the, then the Pentagon said it was going

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240
to be real.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.240
Then I started believing it.

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.760
And then right before they said, Oh, we never said that.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760
It was a psyop.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760
Oh, Ooh.

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.760
What?

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.760
Okay.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.240
What did you, I don't know.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.640
I feel like even those excuses are contradictory nonsense.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.640
Yeah.

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.560
No, it was my wife who told me, but I didn't believe it.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.560
And so it's her fault.

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:33.560
But also when the Pentagon said it, I was like, well, obviously it's true.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.080
I didn't believe that because it's their fault.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.400
I was the mainstream media did the thing and that's it.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.400
And that's their fault.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.000
None of this is my fault at all.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.520
I was on air for nine air, uh, nine hours and they've taken everything out of context.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.520
Totally.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.520
They've misrepresented.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.520
I've been smeared.

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.600
I have been smeared, sir.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.600
Simultaneously.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.440
I was reporting on things that were a hundred percent accurate because the media was trying

01:27:54.440 --> 01:28:00.400
to create fear about Y2K reporting on these media stories that were designed to make fear,

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.600
but then they retracted those stores.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.920
Wait, w w w which is it?

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.280
It's both neither and everything all at once.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280
Such horseshit.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.280
Yup.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.280
Anyway.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.280
What an asshole.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280
Yup.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.840
Um, this is an interesting glimpse.

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.560
Couldn't you just one time be like, Oh yeah, I fucked up on that one.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.960
It's not even, it wouldn't even have to be.

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960
No explanation.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960
No.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960
Just like, yeah, that one's on me.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.960
My bad.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.960
I think it's too embarrassing.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.960
It has to be.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.960
Yeah.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.320
Because I love the second episode.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.440
Yeah, that's true.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.360
And looking at the Y2K episode of his show.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:42.120
And I think, I think some of the stuff that he was doing was like, it's really too far.

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.120
Yeah.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:48.320
He was saying that like bases were being set up at an Austin airport for people to be around.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.320
Everyone's out of gas.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.320
Yup.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.720
The gas stations are out of food.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.720
It went hard.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.720
Yeah.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.720
I remember.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.480
I think owning that is too hard to do.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.640
So you have to create a defensive straw man about like what actually happened and then

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:03.440
people like Eddie will just give you a pass.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.440
Yeah, that's true.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.440
You gotta go to commercial anyway.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.440
Yeah, that's fair.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.440
That's fair.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.440
You hear the music.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.440
Yeah.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.680
Run out the clock on this answer and then Eddie will drop it.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.680
Yeah.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.500
Or we'll get to commercial and I'll be like, Eddie, that is not a fair question to ask

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.500
me on air.

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.500
Hey, don't ask me that question.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.500
Yeah.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.500
You know we're playing a game here.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.500
It's stupid.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.500
Yeah.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.500
And now you're making me feel bad.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.500
Stop it.

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.080
Eddie, you're high and having fun.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.360
I am not.

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:33.080
So we get to the end of this and I think this is an interesting glimpse back if only for

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.160
this dynamic is so different and so similar.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.160
Yeah.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.760
It's similar in the ways that you hate and it's different in the ways that you miss.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.760
Yup.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.920
It's not fun in the way that these present day interviews are because Alex is fucked

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.920
up.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.920
Right, right.

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.920
Yeah.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:49.920
It's nonsensical.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.920
It's nonsensical.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:57.000
Yeah, Alex is more willing to like keep the ramble going, keep the riff going long enough

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.240
to where he hangs himself with too much rope, like that kind of thing.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240
Yeah.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.640
Whereas on this show he's trying to cut stuff off before he looks too stupid.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.000
He's trying to protect the business.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Yup.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Yup.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.280
So anyway, we'll be back to the present for our next episode or you know, probably.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.840
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.840
We do have a website.

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:18.840
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840
We are also on Twitter.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.840
We are on Twitter.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.840
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.840
Now go to Ben Jordan.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.840
Yeah.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840
We're also on Facebook.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.840
We are on Facebook.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:28.320
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320
doing God's work right now.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320
Yup.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320
We'll be back.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.320
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320
I'm Leo.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320
I'm DZX.

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320
Clark.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320
I am not a witch.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.320
Andy in Kansas.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320
You're on the air.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320
Thanks for holding.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.320
Hello, Alex.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320
I'm a first time caller.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.320
I'm a huge fan.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320
I love your work.

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:51.320
I love you.
