N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I have great respect for knowledgefight

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I need, I need money

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Stop it, Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your room

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
knowledgefight

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
knowledgefight.com

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love you

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Jordan

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh indeed we are Dan

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Jordan

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Dan

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Jordan

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Quick question for you

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's up

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's your bright spot today?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My bright spot today is, I'd like to thank a wonk out there named Pat

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
who got in touch and helped me find some old Alex Jones episodes

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm still on the hunt for more

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But it's one of the first times that a tip has actually paid off

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and I've got some interesting stuff

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I like it

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to look at, so I really appreciate that

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's good news

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It definitely, especially as like the modern day, it's kind of like

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean, spoiler alert, basically I'm really underselling the episode we're about to do

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sure, sure, sure, sure

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And I don't enjoy listening to it nearly as much as I probably would some kind of like

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
way deep in the past intellectual exercise

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Kind of thing

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So you got home movies is what you're saying

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Clips of Alex playing baseball at 12

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Nah

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's gonna be great

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Unless it's a variant of baseball

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that is all about anti-communist heroes of his

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
John Birchball I believe is what it's called

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Birchball

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, Birchball

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, so that's my bright spot, how about you?

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My bright spot, Dan, is I found a TV show called Wellington Paranormal

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that's made by the same guys that did What We Do in the Shadows

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's fantastic, it's really good, it's like an X-Files that's super understated

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in that New Zealand way where it's like they're trying to give a ticket to a werewolf

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
like that kind of situation where they're just

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That sounds fun

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oblivious to the absolute insanity going on around them

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's just like, no, we're just trying to do our jobs

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can dig that

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, it's really, really funny

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's in that great vein of the mockumentary kind of stuff

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's great

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I hate these kinds of moments because I hear that and I'm like,

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
that sounds good, I probably enjoy that

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You'll never see it

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Exactly

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The second moment is like, I'm never gonna watch that

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm never gonna watch that shit

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh well, maybe one day

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Someday I'll get to New Zealand

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then I'll watch it

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, we'll see it on the local TV

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know, Jordan, I gotta say, I feel like it's been too long

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It feels like too long in between episodes

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What, between Mondays and Fridays?

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, it really does

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It just feels like too long

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You are

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm itching to be back in this seat

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're utterly incapable of doing anything but 12 episodes per week

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you could, I would just

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I feel like we're getting back together and it's been forever

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's surprising that it has been a while

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Especially considering, I think we watched a movie together on Tuesday

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like, yeah

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, Monday

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Whatever

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Anyway, we're back in the saddle

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Indeed

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And today we'll be going over March 23rd and 24th, 2021 Blackjack

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Blackjack, oh god dammit

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And this is Tuesday and Wednesday

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Of this here week

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And there's something interesting that's going on, man

105
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Beginning of this week, Alex was gone again

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He was out of studio again doing something on the East Coast

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, okay

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Something mysterious

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's trying to get out of Texas slowly and then it keeps pulling him back in like the Twilight Zone kind of situation

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He apparently recorded a video of himself at the Skull and Bones

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sure

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Which I applaud

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Going back to his roots

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, absolutely

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's the kind of thing he should be moving back towards

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why not?

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Certainly better than literal devil stuff

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, I'm on Team Fuck the Skull and Crossbones

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't like Yale or whatever it is, fine

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
At the same time, as I expressed to you, I'm going to be furious if I have to do more episodes about where Geronimo's bones are

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, I'm not going to be stoked about that one, that's true

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't want to hear it

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ah, yeah

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Anyway, he is back on the 23rd and I would say not better than ever

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And we'll get down to talking about that in a little stretch of time

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But before we do, let's take a little moment, Jordan, to say thank you to some folks who are now policy wonks

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, that's a great idea

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So first, globalist big Dr. B, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm a policy wonk

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Thank you very much, BDB

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you

136
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Next, Jay in Maine, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm a policy wonk

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thanks, Jay

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Next, you are now a policy wonk, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm a policy wonk

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you very much, you are now a policy wonk

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tongue twister

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, boy

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Next, Lord Cakewagon, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm a policy wonk

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you very much Lord Cakewagon

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And Muffin pants, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm a policy wonk

150
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Thank you very much, Muffin pants

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Also, Baby Goblin, what's going on? You are now a policy wonk

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm a policy wonk

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you very much, Runc

154
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,460
Did you know that Baby Goblin was made a Lord between now and when they sent that in so that's Lord Baby Goblin

155
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:50,100
I did not realize that. 40% of all Wonks are Lords. I did not realize there was this honorific. Yeah, it's a weird thing that happens.

156
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,760
Hmm. Yeah, and then also that reminded me that when we were doing our zipping up the mailbag

157
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,940
One of the things we forgot was that goblin. Oh, I know! That got sent, it was sitting right next to you. I brought it from my place

158
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,840
I was so gentle with it. I was holding it at the palm of my hand like can't let anything bad happen to it. Very, very delicate. And then I didn't get to show anybody.

159
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,440
And that was from Cameron, and so thank you so much Cameron. You are now a technocrat. Yes, thank you very much.

160
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,040
And Drew Desedue, thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

161
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm a policy wonk. Crikey mate, that's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

162
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,040
How's your 401k doing, bro?

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,940
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright? Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

164
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,440
Why you pimps so good? My neck is freakishly large. I declare info war on you.

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Thank you to y'all. Yes, thank you very much.

166
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:51,840
So yeah, I would say that this stretch of time is bad. And there was actually a bit more in it that I felt it was offensively bad.

167
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Like, it felt more like I don't want to do this. Which type? We have many different types of bad on this show.

168
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,840
We have the incompetent kind, we have the uninspired kind, we have the horrific evil kind.

169
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,840
What type of bad are we talking about? We can't even use the word bad anymore. Yeah, that's true.

170
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,840
It's tough to exactly pigeonhole it, but it just feels like generalized incitement.

171
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,840
And it's kind of a generalized boring incitement. That's not good.

172
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,840
That largely has to do around white fears and immigrants, there's a lot of that.

173
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840
And I questioned on a certain level while I was listening to these, is this even worth it?

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Does this rise to the level of paying attention to it? Because it's pretty much just fucking gross most of the time.

175
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Well that's not good. No, it's not.

176
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,840
It's not even super bad, it's just real gross.

177
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Anyway, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

178
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,840
These people are evil. And when I say they're not even physically ugly, it's that they're not real.

179
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Like when you see a mannequin or you see, like I say, plastic fruit, you know it's plastic fruit no matter how good it is, no matter how fake it is.

180
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,840
You look at it and you go, that's fake. You just know.

181
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
And you look at them and you go, that's not normal. That's not normal.

182
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Look at Brian Stelter, that's not normal. That's an enemy. That's the enemy.

183
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,840
God Blaggit? God Blaggit. God Blaggit? Blaggit!

184
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,840
He screams to God himself, how dare you make me kill my son Blaggit?

185
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:35,840
I heard that and I was like, all I want to do now for the rest of my life is hide plastic fruit around Alex.

186
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,840
I was going to say, that sounds like a man who has tried to eat plastic fruit. 100%.

187
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I just want to get him on camera eating plastic fruit.

188
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,840
It's like somebody who goes out of the way to all of a sudden be like, you know, I've never tripped going upstairs embarrassingly.

189
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,840
It's never happened to me. I've seen tons of people do it before, but not me!

190
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,840
So Alex is late to work on the 23rd and it's because his plane was delayed.

191
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,840
And so he recorded himself prior to this so you'd have something to play in the beginning of the show.

192
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm Alex Jones, your host, and as we speak, I'm about to arrive at the studio and complete the transmission live.

193
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,840
But I'm coming to you from earlier today in the space-time continuum as major news and information breaks.

194
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,840
We're about to premiere this amazing report that only you can share with others and defeat the globalists.

195
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,840
This is seriously a mission. We are seriously on the cutting edge of this fight.

196
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,840
This goddamn anti-communist Smokey the Bear.

197
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Only you can stop the globalists.

198
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Okay, we gotta get, we gotta get, I want video surveillance footage of him recording that in a weird bathroom somewhere.

199
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Right, and trying to eat the fake fruit that's on the counter.

200
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Actually, I don't want that surveillance. Never mind. Yeah.

201
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,840
So, you know, here's some of the stuff he's covering in his pre-recorded shit.

202
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Okay.

203
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Now the incredible news is Project Veritas has done it yet again.

204
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:01,840
They just had a major court ruling where a judge said the New York Times printed lies about them, that they were fake news, that that was a known fraud and that the New York Times lied.

205
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Project Veritas did not win that lawsuit.

206
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:13,840
The headline that Alex is lying about here have to do with a New York Supreme Court judge determining that Veritas's defamation suit against the Times can move forward.

207
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:21,840
A couple articles in the Times referred to some Veritas videos as deceptive, but the judge felt that this was more opinion than it was straight up reporting of news.

208
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:29,840
This kind of ruling honestly just seems like a parody where a liar is getting the court to force journalists to strictly adhere to rules that they themselves think are jokes.

209
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Yeah.

210
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
I don't know.

211
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Anyway, the game here for Project Veritas isn't actually to win the case or anything like that.

212
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,840
It's about the media circus they can drum up along the way while simultaneously trying to make other outlets scared to critically cover their work.

213
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
That's what's going on here.

214
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Yeah, there should be a consultancy for dumb old judges who are like, well, I guess we have to take these people as good faith actors because of the legal system.

215
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,840
And we could just be like, hey, no, you guys probably should have charged them with a federal crime a few years ago.

216
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
So no, fuck these guys.

217
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,840
So Alex still hasn't shown up at this point and it's getting to be like a ways into the show.

218
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,840
And so Owen's got to break in with some big news.

219
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Ladies and gentlemen, we are live inside the Infowars world headquarters here.

220
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Owen Troyer sitting in studio.

221
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,840
We're going to go back to Alex Jones here shortly.

222
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,840
He's going to be joining us live here shortly as well.

223
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:33,840
But I had to break in and report some of the latest that we know of the Boulder, Colorado shooter.

224
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Obviously his name, Ahmad Al Isa.

225
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
It's now coming out.

226
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,840
He was an Islamic State sympathizer, so an Islamicist.

227
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,840
He was a immigrant from Syria.

228
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I don't know if I can find any evidence that he was an Islamic State sympathizer outside of wild conjecture being made by the guy who runs Jihad Watch.

229
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Yeah, I was going to say, all we've got there is Owen read the name and he was like, well, obviously this is a terrorist.

230
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,840
And the thing that I find really interesting is even like within the last week, you can see how news is dealt with differently.

231
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,840
When there was those shootings at the spas in Atlanta, Alex didn't even talk about it.

232
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,840
And then the next day it was like, ah, incel weirdo, or whatever.

233
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
And then just moved on.

234
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Maybe touched the story for a second on the second day.

235
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,840
When it's this, break into coverage.

236
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Owen Troyer's got to come into studio to break in to give you the latest.

237
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Kind of see what's going on here.

238
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,840
This is something that should fill people with great shame.

239
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:40,840
And the only way they can survive this long is by having that part of their brain removed at some point in their lives.

240
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Because that is disgusting.

241
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Just on a really deep human level, just disgusting.

242
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Because it proves beyond reasonable doubt that they are choosing which stories maliciously.

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Not because of any kind of newsworthiness purely by malice.

244
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Yeah.

245
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
Yeah.

246
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Yeah.

247
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I mean, I think it's demonstrated throughout the most of my career.

248
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,840
I mean, you can't even, there's no middle ground on that whatsoever.

249
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
No, it's pretty tough.

250
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Yeah.

251
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,840
So Owen knows, I mean he's been around long enough at Infowars that he knows the game.

252
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,840
He knows exactly what they do in these cases of shootings.

253
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Sure. Gun control is common.

254
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Well, of course. But also, psych meds, got to talk about that.

255
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Got to portray him as the other side.

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Sure.

257
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
He was a leftist, bro.

258
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Of course.

259
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,840
He was, it seems maybe a paranoid schizophrenic.

260
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,840
So who knows what kind of pharmaceutical drugs he had been prescribed potentially for those mental problems.

261
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,840
And then we also have a lot of his social media activity before it was deleted.

262
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Before it was deleted, showing that he was an anti-Trumper.

263
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,840
He was a leftist, liberal progressive.

264
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,840
He was one of those that pushed the leftist narrative to a T.

265
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,840
So, I mean, they do have some screenshots of what appear to be his social media.

266
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Sure.

267
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
And I mean, some of those descriptions are slightly fair.

268
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,840
He had some post that they showed that were critical of Trump, but like,

269
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Cool.

270
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,840
I don't know how much, like, it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with,

271
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,840
at least they haven't demonstrated at all that it has anything to do with what happened.

272
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,840
So Alex plays audio of the shooting.

273
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
No.

274
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,840
And I think it's incredibly exploitative and I'm not going to play that here,

275
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
but I'm going to play what he has afterwards.

276
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Okay.

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
This is his, something he had prerecorded also.

278
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:53,840
His name was Eric Talley, a 51-year-old father of seven who was a patriot and who really loved human life.

279
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,840
And that everybody that knew him said was just an amazing person.

280
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,840
And he died heroically, helping stop some type of insane demonic psycho

281
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,840
that went into a King's Super grocery store in Boulder, Colorado,

282
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,840
and shot and killed 10 people, including this police officer.

283
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
He's the only name we know right now.

284
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,840
This is tragic and I'm not, you know, not going to diminish anything,

285
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,840
but the way Alex is behaving around this is really exploitative.

286
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
That's really the only way I can put it.

287
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,840
And then when Owen starts talking about what the solution to these problems are,

288
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,840
it kind of runs counter to the way Alex in his prerecorded stuff is trying to build this up.

289
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Look, here's the deal.

290
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Mass shootings in this country are really a rare occurrence

291
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,840
and they would be even more rare if we had citizens with guns stopping them.

292
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,840
But they know the police take at least two minutes to get to the scene

293
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,840
so they know they can fire off at least a magazine or two full of rounds

294
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
of innocent people killing people and get away with it

295
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,840
because they never get stopped until the cops show up.

296
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,840
One person, one citizen, one good citizen with a gun

297
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,840
could have saved lives in that Colorado grocery store.

298
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,840
And so there's this whole notion like, oh, you just want it to be like,

299
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
blah, blah, blah, everybody with a pistol on their head, blah, blah, blah.

300
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,840
No, that's not how I want it. That's not how I want it at all.

301
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
I want white people to have guns.

302
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,840
One crazy guy, one bad guy with a gun to kill ten people,

303
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,840
all it would have taken was one good guy with a gun in that store to stop it.

304
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,840
The problem is that one of the people who was killed was a cop

305
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
who was responding who had a gun.

306
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Oh, they didn't give him the gun that day.

307
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I mean, it's not like this disproves any possibility

308
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,840
of someone disrupting an active shooting or anything like that,

309
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,840
but the notion that they have that this is a magic, pardon the expression,

310
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,840
a magic bullet to stop situations like this is just, it's just ludicrous.

311
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Yeah, in order to stop mass shootings, we need to get one good guy with a gun

312
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,840
to either assume people are going to be a mass shooter

313
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,840
and just start killing before anyone is a mass shooter

314
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,840
or get to the point where they're killing people after one or two killings.

315
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,840
So it's not a mass shooting. It's just four or five people dead.

316
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,840
I don't think you're solving a goddamn thing.

317
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Yeah, interject into the center of an active shooting

318
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,840
and deputize yourself to shoot out with somebody who...

319
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I don't think this is a good solution,

320
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,840
and I think that InfoWar's own reporting is a little bit convoluted on this front.

321
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Anyway, Owen has a belief that most people won't ever be really affected by mass shootings,

322
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:49,840
and I mean, that's a little offensive, but everyone will be affected by liberal policies.

323
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
Oh, that'll happen.

324
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Most people listening to this broadcast will probably never be directly impacted by a mass shooting.

325
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Let's pray to God that continues.

326
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
But almost everybody listening to this podcast,

327
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
almost everybody listening to this radio show,

328
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,840
almost everybody watching this right now

329
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,840
is going to be negatively impacted by Democrat liberal policies

330
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,840
just like everyone in that grocery store was.

331
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
That's the real threat.

332
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,840
And now the liberal lefties are going so out of control.

333
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Their minds are so warped. Their minds are so bent, propagandized.

334
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
They've become dangers to society.

335
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,840
So this individual was a danger to society.

336
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,840
He came in with a gun. He killed people.

337
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Well, most of these liberals may not have a gun, but they're dangers to society.

338
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Their policies will kill you.

339
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Their policies will kill freedom in the West.

340
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,840
So the only policies really that he could be really talking about are...

341
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Have to be gun control, right?

342
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Well, that's one possibility.

343
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Disarming people who could be the good person with a gun who can carry out murder against a murderer.

344
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Or it's immigration-related, because this guy came from Syria a number of years back.

345
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,840
And so that would be the leftist policy that he's attacking there.

346
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,840
They're letting people who do these mass shootings in.

347
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

348
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,840
And either way, it's dumb.

349
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
But it's also just... it's disappointing.

350
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to just... it's not far apart.

351
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,840
It's hard to be like, oh, it's liberals letting people in a week after it's not liberals letting people in.

352
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,840
You know, it's like, maybe there's a larger problem.

353
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Maybe there's one that should be dealt with.

354
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
And maybe we should deal with it in a way that makes sense.

355
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
And unfortunately...

356
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Or we could issue everybody guns. Do you want a gun, Dan?

357
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:43,840
No.

358
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Oh, are you sure?

359
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Not at the moment.

360
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
On the hip?

361
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
Nah, I'm alright for right now.

362
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
Okay, fine.

363
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
I like how you're like, would you like an appetizer?

364
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Would you like a gun?

365
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
I'm okay.

366
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Are you sure?

367
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,840
I also think that Owen's not the best prism to be looking at this through.

368
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,840
He's very milquetoast, but also clearly pretty extreme.

369
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Yeah, no, he's got a psychopathic energy of the banality of evil going on about him.

370
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Alex is more sort of interesting, and Harrison Smith is more of a straight-up bigot.

371
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Yeah, Harrison Smith just says, don't let brown people in, and if they are in, shoot them with guns.

372
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
But being boring about it, which is terrifying.

373
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
So thankfully, Owen is done at this point, and Alex shows back up.

374
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,840
You know what he was doing? He was on a secret mission.

375
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Well, I was on a secret mission in Connecticut.

376
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I bet we'll find out what it is.

377
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
It was yesterday, but that's part of it.

378
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,840
But I am back in Austin, just landed about 30 minutes ago, rushed here to the studio.

379
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Flight was a little bit delayed, or I would have been here from the start of the broadcast.

380
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,840
So we don't know. We don't get to find out what this secret mission was to Connecticut.

381
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,840
We don't get to find out what it is?

382
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
No.

383
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
What about the video we have of it out there?

384
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Well, I mean, he went to the Skull and Bones.

385
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Sure.

386
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
But that wasn't his main trip.

387
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Oh, okay.

388
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
His main trip was, I would guess, if I had to bet anything, it would be lawyer-related.

389
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
It was in Connecticut.

390
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
It was in Connecticut.

391
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Does he have any possible reason? There's no secret mission I could think of to go to Connecticut.

392
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Boy, you know, there's a lot of reasons to go to Connecticut if you're Alex Jones.

393
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
At the drop of a hat.

394
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I would argue he has more reasons to go to Connecticut than just about anybody else alive.

395
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
He has one very specific reason to go to Connecticut.

396
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,840
He is locked into Connecticut.

397
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,840
I would guess it had something to do with maybe like Discovery or something to do with the Sandy Hook case.

398
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,840
I mean, like, I can't imagine it being unrelated to that case.

399
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Yeah, it would be hard. It would be hard.

400
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,840
When he said he was going to the East Coast, I was like, smells like Sandy Hook something.

401
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
But, you know, I don't know. There's a lot of places he could go on the East Coast.

402
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Sure, sure.

403
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:54,840
When he said it's Connecticut, he's either, it's either Sandy Hook case related or he went to Stanford and he's trying to get a job with Vince McMahon.

404
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Ah, that's possible. I'm not going to say no to that.

405
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Yeah, that's the only other possibility.

406
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Maybe he's enrolling in UConn. He wants to be a Husky, Dan. I went there for a semester.

407
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Hey, maybe he's following your footsteps.

408
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Yeah, he's always wanted to be me.

409
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
So, Trump, you know, this narrative gets really interesting with Alex at this point.

410
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
He's like, Obama, bad camps for immigrants and migrants coming over.

411
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Bad.

412
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Trump cleaned it all up.

413
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Good.

414
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Everything is good. Now, bad again.

415
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
How is it bad so fast?

416
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
It went bad really fast.

417
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
It seems like it's too fast.

418
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Well, it's because Biden had a clip that Alex keeps playing where he's saying that he wants people to surge in whenever he becomes president.

419
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Sure.

420
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:43,840
And what he's talking about is people applying for refugee status that were disallowed from being able to apply for refugee status during the Trump administration because he would just not.

421
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,840
We took four refugees during the entire Trump administration. Biden's like, can we have more than four?

422
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,840
That's not accurate, but also the ceiling was dropped quite a bit.

423
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Yes, I was being perhaps embellishing.

424
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,840
And the only way to apply for asylum in the United States as a refugee, you have to be in the United States.

425
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,840
So when the Trump administration would stop people from making it into consulates or on the border, that was what he's talking about.

426
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,840
So Alex is pretending that Biden was like, everybody over the wall.

427
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,840
And so anyway, it's bad now. The camps are back to bad.

428
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Sure.

429
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Remember all the nice facilities Trump built with the water fountains in each area?

430
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,840
And they said, oh, you're drinking out of toilets. And AOC went and cried in front of a fence in a parking lot.

431
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Well, she's not crying now because she's a monster and an exploiter for the most powerful, rich, tax exempt billionaires on the planet.

432
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Ladies and gentlemen, AOC literally came out immediately against Biden, having migrant facilities open for children.

433
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,840
She tweeted, quote, This is not OK. Never has been OK. Never will be OK, no matter the administration or party.

434
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,840
Alex is making up that AOC doesn't oppose the things that Biden's administration is doing at the border because that's too complicated of a story for him to tell his audience.

435
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,840
The listeners are used to very simplistic good versus evil characterizations of people.

436
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:15,840
So to introduce the idea that AOC was against the treatment of migrants under Trump and is still opposed to the same types of treatment under Biden,

437
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,840
that represents a threat to the characters that Alex has painted.

438
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Yeah, it really fucks things up whenever your enemy, I suppose, of Alex's has ideological consistency.

439
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,840
And ideological differences between the people Alex wants to pretend are all working for the fucking devil.

440
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Yeah, that's that's that's what I'm saying.

441
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,840
He could have picked plenty of Democrats who are like, well, we're Democrats in the White House now.

442
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,840
We don't need to worry about. Yeah, that's that's not an unpopular opinion.

443
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Yeah, but AOC is. Yeah. So I like most of this episode has been immigrant bashing at this point.

444
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Like there is I have not, you know, cut out or I have not included a ton just because it's kind of standard, boring immigrant bashing that I just don't.

445
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,840
I don't know. He said a lot of this stuff before.

446
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Yeah, he hates nonwhite people going into the country. We got it.

447
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:20,840
And then they're bringing in hard core people. Most of the, quote, Middle Eastern immigrants, the country, the refugees in the U.S., it's over 75 percent that are men.

448
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Look, the numbers up in Europe. Again, look it up. Eighty five to 90 percent are men, military age men.

449
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Yeah, there's this tweet, Ahmed Al Isa, why refugees and immigrants are good for America.

450
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,840
So he's trying to connect that to the the boulder shooting.

451
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,840
And it kind of makes a little clearer what what Owen's line of thought probably was.

452
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,840
Like I said, this episode is almost impossible to listen to. There's no real substance going on.

453
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,840
And it's mostly Alex just rambling nonsense to make his listeners afraid of immigrants.

454
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,840
According to the Pew Research numbers put out in August 2020, Alex is completely full of shit.

455
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:11,840
One thing he probably doesn't even know is that, quote, among all refugees admitted in fiscal year 2019, 4,900 are Muslims and 23,800 are Christian.

456
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,840
That's 16 percent Muslim and 79 percent Christian. That's super different than the picture Alex tends to paint, which is weird.

457
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
It's kind of weird. Yeah.

458
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Also, according to the statistics from the Department of Homeland Security regarding refugee arrivals in 2019,

459
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:32,840
there's just no way to pretend that everyone coming in are military aged men. For one, 49 percent of arrivals in 2019 were women.

460
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Secondly, 12 percent of all arrivals were aged 45 or older.

461
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,840
But then again, I have no idea what Alex would consider military aged.

462
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Finally, the thing that Alex is mostly banking on here is that 43.2 percent of arrivals were between the ages of zero and 17.

463
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,840
That's a pretty wide age gap, so using the same number, Alex could try to make you scared of refugee teens,

464
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,840
and someone else could explain to you that a lot of these people are children.

465
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Issues related to immigration and refugee resettlement are super important in the real world, but they aren't important when dealing with Alex.

466
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,840
He isn't living in reality and making an argument for policy.

467
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,840
He's decided that he hates immigration and the U.S. becoming less white, and he's making up shit to justify it.

468
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,840
None of this stuff is real, and it's just an appeal to fear, and it's boring.

469
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Yeah, and it's really, really fucked up on the back of a racist, misogynist mass shooting.

470
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Like, okay, whoa, we gotta hold off on being racist towards Asian for a little bit, so we can't not be racist,

471
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,840
so we're gonna switch targets to just blanket immigration.

472
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
How many fucking years are we gonna do this?

473
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,840
It's not like this is a new thing for some white motherfucking asshole to start screaming that all immigrants are evil.

474
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
We do it all the goddamn time.

475
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
You mean Alex, not the shooters.

476
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:55,840
No, I don't mean, yeah, I mean Alex, but I mean, like, it goes back, you can read newspaper articles from 1790 where it's like,

477
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
now we gotta close our fucking borders.

478
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Right, right.

479
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,840
You know, it's like, we're just not gonna deal with it.

480
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,840
And the maligned groups can change, but the mentality stays the same.

481
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:13,840
And every time it blends up in violence, it doesn't stop, and we could deal with it, but we just refuse to,

482
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,840
under some bullshit banner of, just like Project Veritas being allowed to go with their fucking lawsuit,

483
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
I'm just, these guys are not good faith actors.

484
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Yeah, probably not.

485
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,840
But you know who you should go to for information and ideas about immigration?

486
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
The Health Ranger?

487
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Someone in Europe who has a great track record.

488
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Oh no.

489
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Someone who might be the head of Hungary.

490
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Oh no.

491
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,840
More bonds come out from Eastern Europe and said it's forbidden to say so in Europe, but this is organized invasion.

492
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,840
95% of the immigrants are military age men.

493
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Yeah, that's some of the boatloads come in that are 95% military age men.

494
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Hell, some are 100%, but the numbers we've gotten are 85, 95%.

495
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,840
It's on, ladies and gentlemen.

496
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,840
And when they're on video, they're like, I'm here to rape, I'm here to kill, I'm here to burn, and they just start burning cities, raping.

497
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Holy shit.

498
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
That seems extra.

499
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Yeah, and I don't know about appealing to Viktor Orban as your guy.

500
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,840
I don't know if that's a great citation, seeing as he's made assisting refugees a criminal act.

501
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Yeah, I would say, boy, it seems like he's like, you know what, that chow chess cue had some good policies.

502
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,840
I'm not saying he's a good guy, but when it comes to immigration, you want the chow and you get the chess cue, okay?

503
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Yeah, it's strange.

504
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Well, I mean, it's not strange at all. It's very transparent.

505
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:54,840
No. Anyway, if Biden, you know, after these shootings that have happened, if he wants to take a guns, turns out Alex and his friends are going to be more deadly than the Viet Cong.

506
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Okay.

507
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,840
So let me tell you where this is going to end.

508
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:11,840
If Joe Biden tries to take the guns, it's going to wipe out law enforcement and a lot of military to the cause of civil war that'll make the Vietnamese resistance in Vietnam look tame.

509
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,840
And then if they were even successful to break the back of the country and get most people to do it, it will then create a giant underground and lawlessness.

510
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,840
You'll have such bad police involved. They'll all be corrupt that you will be worse than Mexico.

511
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:34,840
We will be a completely failed state with kidnappings, murders, beheadings, hundreds of thousands dead every few years, just like we basically are becoming.

512
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Because the Tower of Babel can be every AI globalist takeover that's killing everybody that wants a post human world.

513
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure exactly what he's trying to intimate.

514
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Like, is it that if Biden puts in better background check regulations for guns, that everybody will be murdered on the street?

515
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Or is it that he and his friends will start guerrilla warfare?

516
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I think he's just imagining Red Dawn. That's what he's talking about. He's talking about joining the Wolverines, going up in the mountains and running the Swamp Fox 2.0.

517
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Yeah, 1776 2.0. No! That's over with. 1764 2.0, Dan.

518
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,840
It seems like a little, I don't know, it doesn't make me feel all that comfortable.

519
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:34,840
You know, it's going back to a lot of the ideas that were more popular within some of these militia right wing communities earlier on.

520
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:42,840
You know, the books like Unintended Consequences, those kinds of ideas that it's just, it's not great to see them popping up again.

521
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Things feel a lot more volatile right now.

522
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Yeah, on the other hand, they are a bunch of cosplaying cowards that give up at the first hint of actual resistance.

523
00:31:52,840 --> 00:32:06,840
So there's, you know, it is a little bit heartening for me to look back on the 6th and remember that when push comes to shove, Alex will say that it was never his idea and it was all the liberals' fault in the end.

524
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,840
So I'm not too worried about guerrilla warfare from these assholes.

525
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Hey, you know all those people who are out there doing the Red Dawn thing? That's just Antifa.

526
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,840
No, that was, I was saying, Antifa, they're Red Dawning us because of the double Red Dawn proposition.

527
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Okay.

528
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Yeah.

529
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,840
So the, oh boy, this isn't good.

530
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Yeah, I'll just tell you that. There's a good set up for this clip.

531
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Okay.

532
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
This isn't good.

533
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
Not good.

534
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
So let me explain how this works.

535
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
They collapse the third world.

536
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Sure.

537
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,840
They flood us with Africans, military age men, Europe particularly.

538
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
That doesn't sound right.

539
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,840
And then, yeah, I mean, you're in a town of 500 Germans.

540
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,840
They put 2,000 military age men, black men from a poor country there with no jobs at refugee center.

541
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
They start raping and robbing you, some of them.

542
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Now you hate black people.

543
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Now you want to annihilate them.

544
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,840
And see, that's how the globalists are going to make us join them in the extermination of the third world.

545
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
That's coming next.

546
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,840
I don't know if I would be susceptible to that sort of plan that the globalists would have because I see other solutions to problems.

547
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm confused.

548
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:21,840
I'm not entirely sure if there are these towns with 500 people and 2,000 immigrants come into it, all men with no jobs or whatever.

549
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
But let's assume that is the situation.

550
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Sure.

551
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,840
I feel like there could be some other sort of structural ways that we could deal with the issue.

552
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Hey, let's put some government works projects together, get these people employed.

553
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Let's get some jobs.

554
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Sure.

555
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Let's get some maintenance.

556
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,840
I know this from the United States and Chicago specific.

557
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Every bridge needs a little bit of work.

558
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
That's true. That is true.

559
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Bridges are scary.

560
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,840
They are deteriorating quick.

561
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Yes.

562
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,840
So let's get the government involved and inject a little bit of money. Everybody has a job.

563
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,840
That does make sense.

564
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,840
No, no, Alex is determined that this is how they're going to trick you into wanting to annihilate a population.

565
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Yeah, I really feel like maybe you don't need, or maybe, I feel like maybe you're manufacturing reasons to do what you already want to do.

566
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Maybe.

567
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,840
That's what I would, that would be my instant reaction to this.

568
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Maybe you want to feel blameless about having those feelings already, and so you're creating excuses.

569
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm just going to go out on a limb here, and I'm going to say that that would probably become a national news story.

570
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Maybe a global news story. If Germany's government, Merkel is just like,

571
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:41,840
yeah, we're going to put 2,000 only military-aged men in with this small, tiny town of 500 people,

572
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
and then they're going to murder everyone.

573
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Right.

574
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,840
And they'd be like, at the very least, this would call for a special session of Congress, right?

575
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Yeah.

576
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
At least one.

577
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
Yeah.

578
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,840
So one of the things that I think is really interesting is that Alex plays a lot of games with what he believes is going on.

579
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Sure.

580
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,840
You know, like he'll say that the globalists believe that they're talking to an extra-dimensional being.

581
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
I'm not saying I believe that.

582
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
No, no, no, he doesn't believe that.

583
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,840
I'm saying that that's what they believe. I'm just here warning you what they believe.

584
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,840
He does follow that up usually with, now it's obviously true.

585
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Well, yeah, but just to be totally clear here, Alex is expressing that he literally believes he's fighting the biblical devil.

586
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
I was going to say, yeah. There we go.

587
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,840
And at the end of the day, they want to get everybody, because again, they make some of the elite white people think,

588
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,840
oh, you're going to be part of the club. No. Now they admit it's a post-human world, whatever this is running things.

589
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,840
And I believe the Bible, it's the devil, does not want any humans.

590
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,840
The Bible tells us the devil comes to destroy God's creation.

591
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,840
So Alex believes he's fighting the Christian biblical literal devil.

592
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Question.

593
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Yeah.

594
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
For Alex's theology.

595
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Uh-huh.

596
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,840
All right. So the devil wants to destroy all humans.

597
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Mm-hmm.

598
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Okay. What happens to their souls?

599
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Do they still get heaven and hellified or is he going for all the souls in heaven and hell too?

600
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
That's a great question.

601
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
And if so, how is he going to pull that one off?

602
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Ooh.

603
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Finally, should he succeed in killing all the humans, then what?

604
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Or let's go another direction.

605
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Uh-huh.

606
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Let's say Alex is successful in vanquishing the devil.

607
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Okay. What does he do? Who takes over stewardship of hell?

608
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Right.

609
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Yeah. All those people are just hanging out?

610
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
That's going to be chaos.

611
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,840
That's going to be, yeah, that's really going to fuck up the infrastructure of hell currently.

612
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,840
Right. And then how does that reshape theology for the future?

613
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Doesn't it?

614
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
It's like, okay, so we-

615
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
You have to rewrite the entire Bible.

616
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
There needs to be a new Bible.

617
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
There has to be an entirely new Bible.

618
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,840
A lot of it is probably going to be based on stuff from our show.

619
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,840
The animals of Alex Jones.

620
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,840
You have the Old Testament, you have the New Testament, and the Jones Testament.

621
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Yeah, because it nullifies almost all of the prophecies.

622
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Like the revelations is, you don't even talk about God defeating the devil or a thousand years of Jesus' reign.

623
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,840
It's just more like Alex did it.

624
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:13,840
That's the end of revelations is, hey man, it was a good thing God gave us Alex fucking Jones.

625
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

626
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,840
The last verse of the Bible is, I'm not bragging, but we did it guys.

627
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Just one mission. No Bible at all. Just a mission accomplished banner. That's it.

628
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Yeah, I don't really quite understand what, I don't know.

629
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,840
I just think it's really important to recognize that whenever he says stuff like,

630
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I'm not saying that I believe this stuff, it's what they believe.

631
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Of course.

632
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,840
That's him trying to hold onto some thread of respectability and credibility with people who would call him nuts.

633
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

634
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
He's like, I'm fighting the devil.

635
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Yeah, that's tough.

636
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Everybody needs to recognize that.

637
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
That's really tough.

638
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
You need to recognize he thinks it's the devil.

639
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
I know.

640
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,840
It is a little bit like how they, all the articles about Roger Stone are always conspicuously like,

641
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:08,840
he was a lobbyist and he was close to Trump's inner circle and they never mentioned that he hosted a show on Infowars for two years.

642
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,840
That is a news outlet whose editorial position is staunchly anti-devil.

643
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Yes, 100% anti-communism, anti-devil.

644
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Roger Stone absolutely, I guarantee, said that the basic problem is the devil.

645
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Probably. I don't know if he ever believed it.

646
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
I doubt it. I don't know if he believes anything.

647
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Yeah, I think that it would be interesting to have that be what the public conversation is.

648
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Totally.

649
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
It's not like he's a free speech crusader.

650
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
No.

651
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,840
He's not a Trump fan. He's a guy who thinks he's fighting the devil.

652
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Totally.

653
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,840
And he's also super racist.

654
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Yes.

655
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,840
But there are interesting things that he tries to get, he's taken some calls here on the show,

656
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:58,840
and he has this conversation that he has with the caller about taking these racist feelings you have and then redirecting them at the globalists.

657
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
That's nice.

658
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
No.

659
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,840
2024, really a massive political expression is needed.

660
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Well, everything the enemy does is divide us.

661
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,840
And look, I'm tribal, I got red blood, don't you think I see all this and get mad at groups?

662
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Then I go, that's my animal side.

663
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I had that programming to survive in the old times against the group attacking me, but the enemy is using that against us.

664
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,840
And we have to still defend ourselves against groups or whatever, but we have to be aware of the larger plan.

665
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
That's the only way to defeat this.

666
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
This is an alien attack.

667
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,840
I don't go off UFOs or any of that.

668
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
I mean, it's alien.

669
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,840
The whole thing is rewrite humans, bring in world government.

670
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Also, UFOs are real.

671
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
They want to kill everybody.

672
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
They try to kill us all.

673
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
UFOs are realer than the devil.

674
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Well, I don't care if they were just killing the Africans, I'm against it.

675
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,840
But the truth is, they're killing everybody.

676
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Does that make sense?

677
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Not totally.

678
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,840
But the point that he's trying to make is essentially that he has this old timey racist programming that's inside him.

679
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,840
And you've got to take that and direct it towards the globalists.

680
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,840
And it's like, well, no, you should rise above it.

681
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Maybe wrestle with it.

682
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Wrestle with those feelings as opposed to just hate someone else.

683
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,840
It has to be evolution itself that makes him racist.

684
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
It can't possibly be cultural.

685
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,840
I actually don't think that he was talking about caveman days.

686
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Where it's like a group.

687
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
I think he was talking about when he was in high school.

688
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,840
Because he constantly talks about how black people would beat him up in high school.

689
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Sure, sure.

690
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
He talks about that all the time.

691
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
That's true.

692
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
I think he's talking about youth.

693
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
What an asshole.

694
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:35,840
I think it's so ironic now, with all the reports that we have from very credible sources and the government releasing shit,

695
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,840
that it's like, look, we see UFOs all the time.

696
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
I've got to be honest with you.

697
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,840
We see UFOs all the goddamn time.

698
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
Here are tapes of navy pilots.

699
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Here's video. Here's everything.

700
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,840
And Alex is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't believe in UFOs.

701
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
It's the devil we're fighting.

702
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
I'm fighting a demon.

703
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
It's the devil.

704
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Right.

705
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,840
At the same time, still, the functioning letter in UFO is U.

706
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Of course.

707
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,840
And, you know, let's get some more, let's make those IFOs.

708
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Sure, sure, sure, sure. I see what you're saying.

709
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:11,840
So Alex takes another call, and this guy, he seems to be worried that the FBI is following his social media.

710
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,840
And Alex's response to it is a little bit weird.

711
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
Hey, Alex.

712
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:24,840
So I just want to preface this message with what Paul said in first collagens, because it's kind of scary, what I'm going to say.

713
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,840
He said that the powers of darkness were defeated on the cross.

714
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,840
And that is the, that is our only hope right now.

715
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Look, I had the FBI show up at my house.

716
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:43,840
I have a TikTok account and Snapchat, and I basically preach the gospel on there.

717
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
And I went into the vaccine.

718
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I'm kind of nervous on this phone call, to be honest with you, because...

719
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
It's okay, sir.

720
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,840
The FBI is the run by the Chinese now, and it's run by the Globals.

721
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,840
They just, they're told just to come out and intimidate you.

722
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
It's all, there's nothing to be afraid of.

723
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
That does relax me.

724
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
That's okay.

725
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,840
That's a wildly, oh, man, I'm so relaxed.

726
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Yeah.

727
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,840
I was worried about the FBI, but that was the American government's FBI.

728
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Now that I know they're controlled by the Chinese, and the Chinese just tell them to go rough people up a little bit.

729
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I don't know what to believe about this caller.

730
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,840
He sounds a little skittish and a little weird.

731
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Sure, a little bit.

732
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:27,840
I don't believe that the FBI, I don't know if I believe the FBI showed up at his house.

733
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,840
If they did, I believe that he's posting more on that account than he's letting on.

734
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:41,840
It does sound like maybe the FBI wouldn't just walk around at the behest of the Chinese government to scare him a little bit because of his TikTok.

735
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Whatever the reality or non-reality of this one visit is, I'm guessing there's not going to be a follow-up visit, and they're not listening to him call into Alex's show.

736
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
I would say so.

737
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:56,840
There's some delusional paranoia that's going on here, and Alex is doing a great disservice to his listener by being like, oh, don't worry about it.

738
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Don't worry about it.

739
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
It's just the FBI working for the Chinese.

740
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Come on.

741
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:08,840
That is the way, like, to deal with delusional paranoia, he's like, we're not going to deal with the delusion whatsoever.

742
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
We're going to deal with the paranoia.

743
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
I'm going to try and make you calm down.

744
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Of course the delusion is true.

745
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,840
I'm going to make you calm down, but also make it way worse.

746
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,840
Like, whatever you're worried about, so much worse.

747
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

748
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
Come on, what are you doing?

749
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Oh, you're starving.

750
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
A nuclear bomb's coming.

751
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,840
Oh, you're worried about one government?

752
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
You're worried about law enforcement?

753
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Guess what?

754
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
The new government's talking about.

755
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
Now it's everybody.

756
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Oh, also, and the new world order.

757
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,840
And the European government is trying to hire Africans to kill your entire town.

758
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,840
And also they're working with the spider leadership and the raptors.

759
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,840
All run by the literal devil.

760
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Does the devil want to destroy aliens?

761
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Alex hasn't weighed in on that, man.

762
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
He doesn't get into UFO stuff.

763
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
I just want to know.

764
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
I'm just adding that in there?

765
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Silly, silly UFO stuff.

766
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,840
Okay, so Alex gets another call, and this guy makes an interesting point, and that is

767
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,840
that China isn't communist.

768
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
There is that.

769
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,840
Which is an interesting problem for Alex, because he constantly calls them the chai

770
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,840
comms and yells about communist China.

771
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Yeah, there's a problem.

772
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Uh oh.

773
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,840
I read China's not a communist country, nor at all a socialist country, but a primitive

774
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:25,840
crony capitalist country economically and a totalitarian dictatorship politically.

775
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
Now that's it.

776
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,840
China is a giant slave colony of the globalist.

777
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,840
We used to leverage out the whole planet and let them economically through economic warfare

778
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
and take over.

779
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
Here's what's going to happen.

780
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Oh, we're not going to.

781
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
We've got one more 11 minute segment.

782
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
Okay.

783
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
We're not going to bother with that.

784
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
Not going to engage.

785
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

786
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Crony capitalism and totalitarian government, which we absolutely have nothing resembling

787
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
here.

788
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,840
He rephrased this in a way that works for me, which is it's a testing ground for the

789
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,840
globalists and then we'll move on and I won't have to deal with how I am full of shit.

790
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,840
And he might as well just like neiner, neiner, neiner.

791
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
I'm going to call him communist tomorrow.

792
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,840
Like, that might as well have been his response.

793
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
Yeah.

794
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,840
So he gets another call, and this guy has a story from a year ago that blows Alex's

795
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,840
mind because it helps him demonize Muslims.

796
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Locally, in Knoxville a year ago, April 8th, we had a stabbing.

797
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,840
You can find it on the internet.

798
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:31,840
Three pilot, that's a gas station, three pilot employees killed in stabbing attack at Knoxville

799
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
I-40 truck stop.

800
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,840
And of course they got no coverage because it was a knife.

801
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Well, and yes, and then they had an article on the front page of the local newspaper,

802
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,840
a rag, the Knoxville News Sentinel under the leadership of the editor, Joel Christopher.

803
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
I wouldn't wipe my rear end with it.

804
00:45:51,840 --> 00:46:03,840
They gave a front page coverage to the mother of the stabbing stabber, and she said that

805
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,840
it was not possible that he could have done what he did.

806
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,840
So why are we not hearing about it?

807
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,840
What is the racial makeup?

808
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,840
He was of Middle Eastern descent.

809
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Bingo.

810
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Yeah.

811
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,840
If a Muslim doesn't think, well, who else wants to stab three women?

812
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,840
I mean, 90% of the time it's going to be a Muslim.

813
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
Let's just say it.

814
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,840
I'm on against all Muslims, but give me a break, man.

815
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,840
They got a thing about killing women.

816
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Wow.

817
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,840
That's wild.

818
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Wow.

819
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,840
That's really wild.

820
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,840
In Altadena, California last week, two people were fatally stabbed on a Zoom call, and I've

821
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
not heard Alex bring that story up at all.

822
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,840
There's a news story out of Michigan where a 14-year-old girl spent months planning to

823
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,840
stab her friend in the woods because she, quote, wanted to see someone die.

824
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,840
You had to hear this reported on Infowars.

825
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,840
We could do this all day, but the point doesn't matter.

826
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,840
Stories are props for Alex, and this is a prop for him to demonize and foment hatred

827
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,840
towards Muslims.

828
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,840
I believe this caller is also conflating things.

829
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:02,840
The claims that I believe were in those articles, they weren't that the guy, he couldn't have

830
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,840
been the person at the stabbing.

831
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:11,840
They were that he couldn't have been involved in a previous stabbing in a town called Millington

832
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,840
that initially people thought might have been connected because he definitely wasn't in

833
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,840
that other town, and I think that he's just conflating things about the reporting being

834
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,840
like, it couldn't have been him.

835
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,840
Because why worry about details like that, Dan?

836
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,840
You've got a group of people to smear and hate for the rest of your life.

837
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
Yeah.

838
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
Cool.

839
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,840
So Alex is like, this is exciting, a year-old story about a stabbing at a gas station.

840
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,840
Hooray, let's talk about this forever.

841
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,840
And the media covered it up by putting it in the front page of the local newspaper.

842
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,840
And covered it up by, like, there's a bunch of stories you can find about it if you want.

843
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,840
Anyway, they decide to talk about it for quite a while.

844
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,840
And then, Alex, they went on to have follow-up articles on the front page of the local newspaper

845
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:03,840
rag, and they said that the people who stopped him, who killed him and stopped him from killing

846
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,840
people, were investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing.

847
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:14,840
Yeah, they had an article at Yale saying, should I be arrested for being at Yale?

848
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Wow, I'm glad you call in and know about this.

849
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,840
We're pulling the articles up now.

850
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,840
So Islamic stabs and kills three women, because he hates, you know, seeing that I'm free.

851
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,840
And then the media calls him a victim.

852
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
Holy mackerel.

853
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Bill, I gotta jump, and I'm glad you called.

854
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Let us know about that.

855
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,840
Wow.

856
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,840
You can see here how Alex takes little pieces of inaccurate information that a caller has

857
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,840
passed along to him, and then he writes his own headlines about them.

858
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,840
He's decided, based on literally nothing, that this person who stabbed people at a pilot

859
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,840
station was motivated by his religious beliefs and because he was so mad about women being

860
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,840
free because he's a Muslim.

861
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,840
This is all completely made up and based on nothing other than Alex's intense hatred towards

862
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,840
people he sees as different from himself.

863
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Also, this caller is once again fucking up details.

864
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,840
The articles in the paper after the stabbing incident were about whether or not the police

865
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,840
were justified in using deadly force against the stabber.

866
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,840
They had ordered him to drop his weapon eight times and the police killed him when he failed

867
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,840
to drop his weapon and he began to walk towards the police car.

868
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,840
The news articles that this guy is referring to were about the DA's determination that

869
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,840
it was a justified shooting, which isn't the same as being like, oh, was it right to...

870
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,840
Yeah.

871
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,840
Whatever.

872
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,840
Fucking assholes.

873
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,840
I'm noticing the length of time we're spending on this call versus the one that was like,

874
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,840
the Chinese are a crony capitalist country.

875
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
Let's move on.

876
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,840
It does seem like he moved on from that awful quick.

877
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,840
Oh wait, you got a story about someone who you think is a Muslim stabbing somebody?

878
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,840
I mean, considering...

879
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,840
A year ago, this is exciting.

880
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,840
Considering discovering that information about China, seeing as how China is his main boogeyman

881
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,840
really, that could shake his entire worldview.

882
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,840
So he should really spend more time thinking on that as opposed to this one, which confirms

883
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
his biases.

884
00:49:52,840 --> 00:50:01,840
Also, I found a C-SPAN symposium that Alex did about 9-11 conspiracy theories in 2006.

885
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:09,840
And one of his arguments that he makes is that somehow the globalists are working against

886
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
China.

887
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,840
So in 2006, they were against each other.

888
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Completely different cosmology of evil at that time.

889
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Gotcha.

890
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,840
So, we're done with the 23rd here.

891
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,840
And a lot of the show seems to be really intensely anti-immigrant.

892
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,840
It's disgustingly anti-Muslim and boring, just sort of paint-by-numbers nonsense of

893
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
Alex's bullshit.

894
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,840
And then, you know, the show's just disgusting on the 24th.

895
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,840
Some, like, weird pedophile stuff.

896
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
Jesus.

897
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,840
It's all about hurting your children.

898
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,840
And as soon as you figure that out, these are demonic monsters the sooner we beat them.

899
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,840
They are a cult.

900
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Most of them are pedophiles.

901
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,840
Mid-level Democrats and up are pedophiles.

902
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
Remember that.

903
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,840
You don't even get in the club unless you rape children.

904
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,840
So Alex is above the political divide.

905
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Totally.

906
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,840
You know, the left-right paradigm is all an illusion to this guy.

907
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Mm-hmm.

908
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
Yep.

909
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,840
But all mid-level Democrats and above.

910
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Yep.

911
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,840
What is a mid-level Democrat?

912
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,840
I was wondering the exact same thing.

913
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,840
What's the cut-off point for mid-level?

914
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,840
Well, it's gotta be any elected official, right?

915
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,840
I mean, I don't know.

916
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Would you call a state rep mid-level?

917
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Maybe.

918
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Or, like, as an alderman in Chicago mid-level?

919
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
Mayor?

920
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
Mayor?

921
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
Small town mayor.

922
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Small town...

923
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Sheriff.

924
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Sheriff.

925
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
Constitutional sheriff.

926
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
No, those are high-level patriots.

927
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,840
What about Democratic constitutional...

928
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
I don't even know if that exists, yeah.

929
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,840
Yeah, I just find this unacceptable and stupid, and I don't have time for it.

930
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
No.

931
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,840
So we get to an interesting story.

932
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:52,840
And this is a story about, allegedly, Black Lives Matter kidnapped 100 people.

933
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
That just...

934
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,840
Okay.

935
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,840
You didn't hear about this?

936
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,840
Okay.

937
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,840
You didn't hear about this this week?

938
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,840
Hold on one second.

939
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,840
Yeah.

940
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
Black Lives Matter as a whole...

941
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
Nah, just some people in Rochester.

942
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
Okay.

943
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,840
A group in Rochester, Black Lives Matter.

944
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,840
Okay.

945
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,840
Kidnapped a bunch of people inside a grocery store.

946
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
A hundred people?

947
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Yes.

948
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
Okay.

949
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,840
And Soros is apparently paying them to do this.

950
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,840
That sounds true.

951
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,840
It's about keeping us shut down, intimidating us.

952
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,840
You ask, why would somebody do something this over the top and this crazy?

953
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,840
They do it because they've been told by Soros to go do it, they're paid to do it, and they're

954
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,840
seeing how far they can push us.

955
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,840
And guess what?

956
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,840
We keep putting up with it so it's gonna get worse.

957
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,840
The article's up on infowars.com and newswars.com.

958
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,840
It's also from gatewaypundit.com.

959
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:44,280
BLM mob traps 100 customers inside grocery store.

960
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,840
We're shutting stuff down.

961
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,840
S down.

962
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,920
S-H, you know what, down.

963
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,880
And they kept them in there for a long time.

964
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,840
According to a reporter for WROC who's on the scene, the entire framing of this story

965
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,660
is completely fake and a racist lie being perpetuated by right wing media to attack

966
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,660
Black Lives Matter.

967
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,200
That does sound more likely.

968
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,560
Kayla Green, who was there, said, quote, Wegmans closed doors and customers were kept inside

969
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,420
temporarily but were let out soon after.

970
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,940
Protesters never entered the store.

971
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,080
Protesters are currently listening to music and eating pizza in the parking lot.

972
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,920
Nobody is, quote, trapped inside.

973
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,740
Yeah, I was gonna say, every one of these types of protests I've been to have been sometimes

974
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,940
overly incredibly kind.

975
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,160
Protesters were having a memorial demonstration on the anniversary of the day that Rochester

976
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,080
police arrested Daniel Prude, which ultimately led to his death.

977
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,240
But instead of discussing any of that reality, Alex just says that Soros is paying to agitate

978
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,920
the goodly white people of the country to make them feel bad and stay inside a grocery

979
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,920
store or something.

980
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Yeah.

981
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
It's all nonsense.

982
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:53,440
It is kind of really a good example of that kind of going, you know, that propaganda method

983
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,240
of going at your enemy's strength instead of their weakness.

984
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,640
When he goes after, like, why would somebody do something so over the top and ridiculous?

985
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,640
Because they wouldn't.

986
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,680
This is too over the top and ridiculous.

987
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,680
Aha.

988
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,320
I will just cut past all of that by saying Soros.

989
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,320
See?

990
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,320
Done.

991
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,720
Now, I will say that this next clip worried me because it's even more over the top.

992
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,440
And it also made me think, Alex...

993
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,560
Black Lives Matter clowned Mount Everest and blew it up.

994
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,800
No, he starts acting like they committed criminal kidnapping.

995
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Sure.

996
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,720
Now, let me show you under federal and state law.

997
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:35,200
This is Title five, offense against the person, chapter 20, kidnapping, unlawful restraint

998
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,880
and smuggling of persons.

999
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,520
And that's what OJ Simpson went to jail for over a decade for.

1000
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,120
And these were folks he found out were counterfeiting his stuff and he was pissed at them.

1001
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,720
I might say what he was right, but, you know, I kind of get it.

1002
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,720
Are you defending OJ?

1003
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,720
But he actually...

1004
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,960
Are we defending OJ now?

1005
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,760
It makes me worried he's going to OJ me.

1006
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,760
Is that a thing?

1007
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,760
Are we defending OJ?

1008
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,760
Okay.

1009
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,760
Alright.

1010
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:07,200
So, anyway, this Black Lives Matter protest in Rochester kidnapped and wrongly arrested

1011
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,200
these people.

1012
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
Sure.

1013
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,200
Sure.

1014
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,920
And hey, man, if Alex was there, he probably would have started swinging.

1015
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,480
Aren't we in an occupied government?

1016
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,680
Aren't laws meaningless now?

1017
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,680
That was a week ago.

1018
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,680
That was a week ago.

1019
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,680
Sorry about that.

1020
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,040
It was in service of a completely different conversation.

1021
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,040
Sorry.

1022
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,040
I forgot.

1023
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,040
And it felt really good at the time.

1024
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,040
Those are still real.

1025
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,040
Yeah.

1026
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,240
But if Alex was there, he would have started swinging on people, man, just started knocking

1027
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,840
people out left and right.

1028
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:37,880
And then, then the media, the media would have called it a race war.

1029
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:49,980
So they go to a grocery store, a Wegmans grocery store, and trap an estimated 100 people in.

1030
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,740
Some reports are this went on for at least an hour.

1031
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,600
You know, what do you got to go home to your kids?

1032
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
What was that?

1033
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,600
An hour?

1034
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,600
Some reports.

1035
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,600
An hour.

1036
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
I got to shoot my mouth off.

1037
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,860
But if a couple of hundred people came and blocked me inside a grocery store and I had

1038
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,200
to go somewhere, I can't help it.

1039
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,480
I'm going to get violent.

1040
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,640
And then it's going to be called a race war.

1041
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,800
No, if some white people blocked me in a grocery store, I'm going to start kicking their ass.

1042
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,520
I mean, brown people, I don't give a damn.

1043
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,720
At a certain point, folks, this is out of control.

1044
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,640
And if we put up with this, we'll put anything.

1045
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,640
Huh.

1046
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,640
See, that's what I'm saying.

1047
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,240
I'm not worried about them starting a guerrilla warfare campaign because we're at the level

1048
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:32,360
of, like, I'm not worried about Mark Wahlberg actually stopping 9-11.

1049
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
Do you understand?

1050
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,000
Like, you blustery asshole, I would punch them and like, shut the fuck up.

1051
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah.

1052
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,880
And this formulation, too, of like, because we keep putting up with it, like, so the solution

1053
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,240
is to stop putting up with protest.

1054
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
Right.

1055
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,240
Right?

1056
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,900
I mean, like, obviously that's the message that would be being sent.

1057
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,520
We stamp out any and all protests, we destroy the first amendment.

1058
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:05,600
Particularly ones that are central to, you know, non-straight, white, Christian, male-related

1059
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,600
issues.

1060
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,000
Stamp out all those protests because they're Soros instigated.

1061
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Of course.

1062
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,280
Yeah, I don't know, it doesn't seem great.

1063
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,660
They do understand.

1064
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,120
These people do understand.

1065
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,320
Actually, never mind.

1066
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,320
They don't.

1067
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,320
No.

1068
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,320
I should end every sentence.

1069
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
They do understand.

1070
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,320
Actually, I'm wrong.

1071
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,320
Well, I think, I think the only explanation I could come up with for, like, to sort of

1072
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,520
maintain the dignity of Alex's listeners is like, they have to just think he's telling

1073
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
the truth.

1074
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,200
Like, I can't imagine listening to this having a kernel of skepticism and maintaining any

1075
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,360
illusion that he knows what he's talking about.

1076
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,880
Dan, he brought it up.

1077
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,560
If you covered this story and you went and found the, like, pictures of it, you found

1078
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:55,280
the explanation for what was going on at this Wegmans and how Alex is for some reason imagining

1079
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,560
people would call it a race war if he started fighting his way out of the store, you'd have

1080
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,380
to just be like, okay, this is about you, man.

1081
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,200
This isn't about reality.

1082
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,200
This isn't about the story.

1083
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
You're projecting everything.

1084
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,780
All of those paper articles are written directly by Soros.

1085
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:16,760
Did you know that 98% of all newspaper articles in the mainstream media were written directly

1086
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,760
by George Soros?

1087
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,760
Yep.

1088
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,640
I read that in one of the 2% that isn't.

1089
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,600
So I don't think that this is true.

1090
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,800
But this is being praised on Facebook and Twitter as a good thing.

1091
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:32,600
They just go randomly to a grocery store and there's black people, white people, you name

1092
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:38,220
it inside, and block everybody in and start screaming at people.

1093
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,420
And they surrounded the whole building and the emergency exits and wouldn't let people

1094
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,200
out.

1095
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,420
And look, I'm a man, so I'm, you know, still pretty tough at 47.

1096
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,520
I'm still being intimidated and angry by this.

1097
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,520
Imagine being a woman.

1098
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,520
Imagine being an old person.

1099
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,000
Imagine being some 80-year-old woman on her walker trying to get some food.

1100
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
This is thug behavior.

1101
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,560
It's criminal and it's disgusting.

1102
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,120
And the police need to stop kissing the ass of these type of globalist thugs and need

1103
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,400
to start arresting them for racketeering.

1104
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,400
What?

1105
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,160
Anyway, I'm not sure there's enough protesters there to surround a building.

1106
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,400
Wegmans, they're not usually small stores.

1107
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,040
They're usually fairly big.

1108
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,780
And I've seen a bunch of pictures of the gathering.

1109
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,560
It was not a giant mob.

1110
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:25,480
Also, in reality, Wegmans closed the door to their store out of fear of the protesters.

1111
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,840
So any decisions that Alex wants to complain about should be directed to Wegmans customer

1112
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,280
corporate office or whatever the fuck.

1113
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,760
The reason the protesters chose this location for their protest is that Wegmans uses uniformed

1114
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,080
Rochester police officers for security.

1115
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,440
And their protest was in part calling for the firing of the officers who were involved

1116
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,880
in the Daniel Prude case.

1117
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,400
It all makes total sense.

1118
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,500
It's not random.

1119
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,880
The reason they showed up there was not random.

1120
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,820
And Alex is going to pretend that it's random in a very racist way.

1121
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,820
And let's say what it is.

1122
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,840
This is the equivalent of KKK.

1123
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,720
This is a bunch of black people and white people.

1124
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,200
And I guess it looks like there's some brown people there that are literally angry randomly

1125
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,080
at random people at a grocery store.

1126
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,400
And you see in the video, there's like an hour of it.

1127
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,520
The old lady in the walker looks like she's about to have a heart attack.

1128
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,020
And then she tries to get out the back and they yell at her.

1129
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,640
So again, and this is just, this video is the beginning of it.

1130
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:29,040
Hundreds of people surrounded the grocery store, all these big fat welfare queens.

1131
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,360
And again, nothing is if you're fat, but man, all these people bitch about this country

1132
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,360
sucks.

1133
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,480
400 pounds, man.

1134
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,520
You wouldn't last 10 minutes in Africa.

1135
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,520
Whoa.

1136
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1137
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,560
Weird.

1138
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,560
Wild.

1139
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,180
Be a little too clear, Alex.

1140
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,240
That's tough to back away from.

1141
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,240
Yeah.

1142
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
That's tough to back away from.

1143
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
That's outrageous.

1144
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,240
Yeah, yeah.

1145
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,600
Whenever Alex is like, I'm not racist, show me the clip.

1146
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,600
Well.

1147
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
Wow.

1148
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
Well, there's one of them.

1149
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
Yep.

1150
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,920
One of many, just on this episode, you flagrant racist.

1151
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,920
Yeah.

1152
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,560
That's, that's pretty, uh, it's pretty much, that's too explicit.

1153
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,560
Yeah.

1154
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,160
That's, that's too explicit.

1155
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,040
It's yeah, it's pretty, pretty embarrassing.

1156
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,040
Yeah.

1157
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,720
Um, so yeah, I don't know.

1158
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,720
The story's dumb.

1159
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,880
Spends quite a bit of time on this, uh, this Wegmans grocery store, uh, story and a lot

1160
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,000
of time talking about how M4s may be gone soon.

1161
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,680
There's no protest about racial justice that's ever random.

1162
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,680
No.

1163
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,360
And not even that, but it's a daily occurrence.

1164
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,520
And there's none that Alex will ever deem acceptable.

1165
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,680
Yeah, of course not.

1166
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,000
There's no version of it that Alex would ever, uh, see as like, oh, this is a productive

1167
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
conversation.

1168
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,880
This is something that's bringing attention to an important, blah, blah, blah.

1169
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,480
Like you wouldn't, it just there, it doesn't exist.

1170
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,480
Yeah.

1171
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,420
Uh, it's, it would always be some kind of a Soros agitation in order to create division

1172
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,520
in society and make white people feel bad.

1173
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,520
Totally.

1174
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
Yeah.

1175
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,240
It's, it's, and that's what I was kind of talking about at the beginning of this episode

1176
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,800
where everything is just kind of boring.

1177
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,800
Yeah.

1178
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,000
Like he's just, these are just Alex Jones tricks that he's doing.

1179
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Retreads.

1180
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah.

1181
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
A little bit.

1182
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,240
It's just racism on autopilot, which is fucking boggling.

1183
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,240
Yeah.

1184
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,240
I was a little bit disappointed.

1185
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,920
Um, I don't know, I just, I shouldn't expect anything.

1186
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
Yeah.

1187
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,920
Yeah.

1188
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,920
But Infowars might be gone soon, man.

1189
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,880
That's why we got to cherish this while we have it.

1190
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,880
Yeah.

1191
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,480
This is just like, these people cannot be at all introspective whatsoever if you can

1192
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,380
have racism on autopilot this explicit, right?

1193
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:37,720
Like at no point in time does he ever like sit down and go, did what I say come off as

1194
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,720
super racist?

1195
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,560
Well, it's, it's, it's interesting to me to imagine like a listener who's hearing like

1196
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,560
particularly that last clip and he's talking about these welfare queens of 400 pounds.

1197
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,560
Yeah.

1198
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,400
And hearing that it'd be like, Ooh, that's weird.

1199
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,400
Yeah.

1200
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,840
But maybe you're somebody who's, you know, in inundated with shitty right wing media.

1201
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,640
And that's just like, Hey, that's where we live.

1202
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,880
I mean, then being like, why did you say you wouldn't last a day in Africa?

1203
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,880
That's a weird one.

1204
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
Yeah.

1205
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,080
Why, why, why was that where you were adding, adding all of that is just strange.

1206
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,080
Yeah.

1207
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,080
Why?

1208
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,880
I can't imagine being a listener and not being like, Oh, I get what he's saying.

1209
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,880
Yeah.

1210
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,880
It's black people.

1211
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,880
Yeah.

1212
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,920
But I mean, if you were a Reagan voter, you can't be mad about welfare queen at this point.

1213
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,000
You know, I'm not sure Alex loves Reagan.

1214
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Yeah.

1215
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,720
Well he loves using Reagan's racist talking points.

1216
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,720
Sure.

1217
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,080
The squid metaphor was maybe gone soon.

1218
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,560
We've been hearing this for quite a while and I grow weary of it.

1219
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,880
I'm running out of gas.

1220
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,960
Now I probably wouldn't even play this cause he says like stuff about him being gone all

1221
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,960
the time.

1222
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,960
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1223
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,720
Except he makes a squid metaphor that maybe goes too long and I find it interesting.

1224
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,720
I like a good squid metaphor.

1225
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,240
I'm not going to spend time getting into all the things they do to us.

1226
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,200
I'm not going to say the things that they're doing that have an effect, the things that

1227
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,720
deflect the things that don't have an effect because I'm not going to give the enemy any

1228
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,800
idea of where to keep attacking.

1229
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:02,840
But let me just tell you this, do not sit there and expect info wars to be here forever.

1230
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,120
I've had a lot of classy family that had cancer and was dying and you just hear that that

1231
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,680
member of the family's dead.

1232
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,140
They were at work one week, totally nice, got their affairs in order.

1233
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:17,320
So manly, so tough, so feminine, so tough that they just die and make no big deal about

1234
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,000
it and donate their bodies of science and stuff like that.

1235
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,760
I'm not as stoic as some of my ancestors.

1236
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,320
I'd like to point out that I'm really glad that Alex did make that caveat that that's

1237
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,320
not me.

1238
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,320
Yeah.

1239
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,320
I'm not that person who's stoic.

1240
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,000
I'm going to go down, I'm going to go down whining.

1241
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,240
I'm going to renounce God.

1242
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:42,360
I'm going to sell my soul to Satan for one single longer second than I can handle it.

1243
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,840
You're going to see me on a pink sweater.

1244
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,000
Yeah, exactly.

1245
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,480
I will do anything.

1246
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,480
Yeah.

1247
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,160
And I don't have cancer.

1248
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:56,040
But America has cancer and this operation has a giant globalist squid attached to us

1249
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,760
gnawing on our face.

1250
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,760
Okay.

1251
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,240
And I just let it sit there and gnaw and I know how far it can go till it gets to our

1252
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:08,240
arteries and I'm, I'm laying eggs real fast escape pods too.

1253
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,080
And we'll just see how they do getting caught in the whole underwater jet stream here and

1254
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,240
what the, what they'll grow into and what they'll do.

1255
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,240
Are you the squid and the person?

1256
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,200
I'll grow a bunch of eggs to use that analogy if I'm a fish with a big thing attached to

1257
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
me, eating me.

1258
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,920
Um, so I need energy to be able to make sure that all those things that we're insuring

1259
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,040
in the future continue on because that's the main mission and I've, and I've looked at

1260
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:34,000
all the different possible future scenarios and, um, we're going to get eaten by a squid.

1261
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,680
The globalists are so off the chart and so crazy now that there's a good chance that

1262
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,520
they'll go ahead and just kill me and at a certain level, I kind of look forward to that

1263
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,800
because in the big, great burden, atmospheres of pressure that I have to carry out this

1264
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,200
mission will be gone.

1265
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,120
Didn't he just say like when he got back from his last a weird vacation to Florida that

1266
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,520
like all the weight had been lifted from him and he'd completed his mission.

1267
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,400
Now he's like, Oh, I wish I was dead.

1268
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,920
I had a good week where the burden wasn't there and now it's back and I really wish

1269
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,640
the globalists would just fucking kill me.

1270
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,440
Certainly had nothing to do with going to Connecticut.

1271
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,500
Yeah, nothing in Connecticut made me feel like I want to die and that info Wars won't

1272
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,240
be around forever.

1273
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,840
Nothing in Connecticut would ever give me the impression that info Wars may be going

1274
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,840
out of business.

1275
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,960
I have to think that the metaphor here, the squid, I mean it's clunky metaphor, but the

1276
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,000
squid is the, that's attached to info Wars is the Sandy Hook lawsuit.

1277
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,960
He knows how far they can nibble before it hits the carotid.

1278
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,240
That would be once his finances become public or they get discovery on a lot of this stuff.

1279
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,840
People realize what kind of shit he's really into.

1280
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,840
Yeah.

1281
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,320
And yeah, then he fell apart with the I'm laying eggs because that could either be like

1282
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:48,520
I'm trying to give money to other organizations or I'm hiding money in my dad's business.

1283
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,600
That would make the most sense.

1284
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,600
I don't know.

1285
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,960
But anyway, he's got some more.

1286
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,960
I love life.

1287
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,960
I'll never commit suicide.

1288
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,760
If they, if I die, it wasn't suicide.

1289
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,280
I'm just saying I literally have no more fear.

1290
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,800
I I've been through this so long.

1291
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,800
I've done so much that I don't fear death.

1292
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,800
I don't fear anything.

1293
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,360
I may lose my whole family.

1294
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,360
I may lose my children.

1295
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,080
I mean, hell, the whole world's about to go.

1296
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:13,560
I mean, you fear shadow all that matters is our souls, but you've got from me a total

1297
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,960
commitment as strong as I can be.

1298
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
I will fight.

1299
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,040
And does that mean I'm going to go off the rails and act crazy?

1300
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,840
Yeah, because I'm, I'm, I'm burnout folks.

1301
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,840
I'm fried.

1302
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,480
When you fight evil like this at a level like this, this long, you don't just care about

1303
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,880
them.

1304
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,440
You don't just not care about them killing you.

1305
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,360
You don't just not care about you start getting to the point where there's no inhibition anymore.

1306
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,360
Does that make sense?

1307
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,360
No.

1308
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,680
I give you my word that I will be as focused and hardcore as I can until the very end,

1309
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,160
but I need financial support.

1310
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,160
We know.

1311
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,160
Yeah.

1312
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,160
Yeah.

1313
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,160
It's, it's, it's weird.

1314
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:51,480
I would, I would pray that I would have all of my support dry up.

1315
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,440
Uh, if I ever get to the point where I speak that modeling.

1316
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,440
Yeah.

1317
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,160
If I ever get that, like, uh, I, you know, just doing this at the level that I've done

1318
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,800
it, I'm not afraid to die.

1319
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,840
Dan, Dan, I won't let you go out like that.

1320
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,840
Yeah.

1321
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,600
But I will very much need you to check me if I ever start even getting close to that

1322
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,440
level of blow harder.

1323
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,760
We're going to get on a boat.

1324
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,280
I'll take care of you.

1325
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,400
Godfather style.

1326
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,680
It'll be great.

1327
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,680
This is embarrassing.

1328
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,680
Yeah.

1329
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,080
Um, yeah, that's not good.

1330
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,640
So in a way there's squids out.

1331
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,640
Squids.

1332
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,120
I believe he's a fish in the metaphor.

1333
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,360
I think that's how far I've gotten with the metaphor.

1334
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,480
I think he's a fish being eaten by a squid.

1335
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,840
I think he did say that.

1336
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,520
I think he said, once he started to say that he was putting out eggs, he realized he had

1337
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,960
to be something that laid eggs.

1338
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,960
Yeah.

1339
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,960
So now he had to...

1340
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:37,960
Yeah.

1341
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,000
The moment he said eggs, I think he thought he was the squid for a second.

1342
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah.

1343
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And then...

1344
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,520
This is the problem with Alex and protracted metaphors.

1345
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Yeah.

1346
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,520
He's not good at metaphors.

1347
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Nah, it's a dicey game.

1348
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,520
Yeah.

1349
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,780
So Alex gets some bad news here on the 24th and that is that the ninth circuit has made

1350
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,780
a ruling.

1351
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:52,780
That's not good.

1352
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,240
This is a big deal on the ninth circuit.

1353
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,640
We'll be tracking that very, very closely.

1354
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,520
That's just now breaking, overturning, um, concealed carry period.

1355
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,840
This is just, you're like, Oh, the Supreme Court will overturn that.

1356
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,800
Don't hold your breath folks, because we don't put pressure on them.

1357
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,000
They don't fear the American people's political action.

1358
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,360
They fear the mainstream media.

1359
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,680
They fear the stacking of the court because nobody calls the bluff of the left.

1360
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,480
And so the left is Buffalo-ing us, stampeding us.

1361
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,680
It's only gonna get more crazy.

1362
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,000
Go after him for fast and furious.

1363
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,360
Get on the offense.

1364
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,880
Go after him for the child smuggling across the border.

1365
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,000
Do like Ted Cruz does, but almost everybody else sits there.

1366
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,720
Don't do like Ted Cruz doesn't matter.

1367
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,720
He's got guts.

1368
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,720
And guts is enough.

1369
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,720
Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget.

1370
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,080
We got free shipping on the mega blowout sale.

1371
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,080
Oh boy.

1372
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,080
Oh boy.

1373
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,760
That was, that was clunky one.

1374
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,760
Yup.

1375
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,760
Yeah.

1376
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,760
So go after them for fast and furious.

1377
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,760
Yeah.

1378
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,760
Yeah.

1379
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,760
That'll do it.

1380
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,760
You got them.

1381
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,760
Man.

1382
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,400
It's interesting how he pretends that they didn't have hearings on that.

1383
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:56,640
Nobody ever calls the left's bluff, you know, like nobody's ever like, we refuse to sit

1384
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:03,420
a Supreme Court justice until, yeah, nobody's ever been like, oh, we got to put pressure

1385
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:10,520
on the Supreme Court by removing and replacing all of the, yeah, cool, cool guys.

1386
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:17,100
Also this ninth court ruling, it has said, if I recall correctly, let me pull up the

1387
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:23,220
exact wording of it, quote, there is no right to carry arms openly in public, nor is any

1388
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,000
such right within the scope of the second amendment.

1389
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yeah.

1390
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
That's what the U.S. court judge J. Bybee said.

1391
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,640
I would be hard pressed to find the wording within the second amendment that's like, yeah,

1392
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,080
and carry them in the Wagner's.

1393
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:44,620
No, like that, that is, you know, something that I would think that Alex would be like,

1394
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,620
it's over.

1395
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,620
Yeah.

1396
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:47,620
Yeah.

1397
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,620
That's the slippery slope.

1398
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Right.

1399
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,620
And he's already said the Supreme Court isn't going to.

1400
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,620
They're not going to help us at all.

1401
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:56,040
Should this be at the point where now, like his, you know, Viet Cong thing from earlier?

1402
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,040
I don't know.

1403
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,200
There weren't any laws anymore anyways, Dan.

1404
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,240
The entire government is unconstitutional.

1405
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,240
Mm-hmm.

1406
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,680
All right.

1407
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,680
What are we going to do?

1408
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,680
I don't know.

1409
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,680
Let's take their guns away.

1410
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,880
He doesn't really talk about this story as much as you would think based on the fact

1411
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,520
that it should be.

1412
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,040
The most important story that's ever happened.

1413
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,040
He should go apoplectic.

1414
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1415
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,040
He should lose his mind.

1416
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,760
The Mayak report came out and he made such a stink about it for so long.

1417
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,760
Yeah.

1418
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,760
He talks to some weirdo who's got like a YouTube show for an hour about like trying to make

1419
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,080
people afraid of stuff at the border.

1420
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,640
And I didn't care because I got a little bit deeper into this next interview.

1421
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,720
So I thought it was different and a little bit more interesting.

1422
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Okay.

1423
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:43,040
And so what we have here is that Jim Hoft from Gateway Pundit, his brother, whose name

1424
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,680
I refuse to learn, is on.

1425
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,680
Jim Hoft's brother.

1426
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,680
That's right.

1427
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,680
That is his name.

1428
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,680
To me it is.

1429
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,680
Yeah.

1430
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,680
He's on because he's got some news about COVID.

1431
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,360
The historical had a lot of new information that just confirmed a lot of the older information.

1432
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:01,840
It's a breaking exclusive, thegatewaypundit.com, location of origin of COVID-19 pandemic identified

1433
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,480
between two of China's biological warfare facilities in Wuhan.

1434
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,040
So this is apparently a situation where Jim Hoft's brothers learned that there was a cluster

1435
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:15,760
of cases early of COVID-19 in an area that's geographically between the Wuhan Institute

1436
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,120
of Virology and another lab in Wuhan.

1437
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,560
And thus, put those pieces together, man.

1438
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,560
Wait.

1439
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,560
It was in between the two?

1440
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,560
Yeah.

1441
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,560
It was geographically in between the two.

1442
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,560
Like on the street?

1443
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,560
Yeah.

1444
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,560
It was just on the street.

1445
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,560
It was in a neighborhood.

1446
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,560
Oh, okay.

1447
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,040
See, what happened was, obviously, people were going back and forth between those labs.

1448
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,040
Sure.

1449
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,040
And they were coughing on people.

1450
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,040
Right.

1451
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,200
He's proved it.

1452
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,960
So the place they stopped for gas is where the COVID outbreak started.

1453
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,960
He's solved this case.

1454
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,960
Oh, okay.

1455
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,360
I gotta say, I gotta give it up to Jim Hoft's brother.

1456
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:52,640
Well, Jim Hoft's brother really, Agatha Christie'd this one to completion.

1457
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,360
I read the article on Gateway Ponder.

1458
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,840
Initially, I was just gonna dismiss this and be like, oh, fuck yourself, Jim Hoft's brother.

1459
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:04,500
But there's actually a really interesting piece in here that just demonstrates how these

1460
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,120
people do their dirty work.

1461
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,400
Well, congratulations, Jim Hoft's brother.

1462
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:14,920
That area that's really, really dark where this signifies the most cases is between a

1463
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,960
couple of biological warfare facilities.

1464
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,740
Editorializing there a little bit, maybe.

1465
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:27,040
He's describing a map where there is shaded clusters of where there were early instances

1466
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,240
of COVID.

1467
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:33,620
One is the entity that we've talked about for a long time, maybe for...

1468
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:39,200
We started reporting on this Wuhan Institute of Virology back in April last year.

1469
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,340
And where it looked like, yeah, this is what's going on.

1470
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,520
Wuhan was released from there.

1471
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:52,480
And then near that is another entity they're calling, that's labeled the Biological Preparations

1472
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,560
Institute, BPI.

1473
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,260
It's the yellow square on that map.

1474
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:06,440
And between these two facilities is where they're saying the initial cases, the large

1475
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:12,380
number of initial cases were first identified.

1476
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,380
How far away?

1477
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:19,480
Giving us more, I guess, more evidence that this thing wasn't just something that was

1478
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,480
natural.

1479
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,480
Is that more evidence?

1480
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,320
That occurred in the food market, that red dot.

1481
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:30,320
No, the large number of cases comes between the black star there and the yellow box.

1482
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,840
So I've got some issues with this map.

1483
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,320
It's actually, I found this very fascinating.

1484
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,200
Is it the way that he's got a black box, a yellow square, and a red dot?

1485
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,360
No, I mean, you got to have whatever as markers on a map.

1486
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,080
Well, I'm fine with that.

1487
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,320
My first issue is that there are four additional clusters of early cases that are nowhere near

1488
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,560
either lab and at least 10 other reported infectors also outside the area that Jim Hoft's

1489
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,300
brother is focusing on.

1490
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:58,960
In theory, it would be just as easy to argue that someone got infected in one of those

1491
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,120
other clusters and brought the condition back to the neighborhood that Hoft is focusing

1492
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,080
on from the information that he's providing.

1493
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,200
There's literally no way that he could prove otherwise.

1494
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:13,120
You bring in multiple points of fact that would undermine his argument, but on the other

1495
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,640
hand, have you considered, don't worry about it?

1496
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,080
No, I have not considered that.

1497
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,780
So the second major issue I have here is that the map is taken from a study in the International

1498
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:26,800
Journal of Geo-Information, and it has to do with geographic data from a medical help-seeking

1499
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,360
app called Weibo.

1500
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,560
The data isn't meant to be used in the way that Jim's brother is using it.

1501
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,000
It's misused data.

1502
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,440
Only on one app?

1503
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:41,120
Yeah, it's tracking the people who reached out for help through this app, which I think

1504
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:46,600
there's value to, obviously, as data points, but it's not for this.

1505
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,200
The third problem is that the map they're publishing on Gateway Pundit isn't the map

1506
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,480
from that journal article, or at least it isn't the only one.

1507
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:58,560
The map that's closest to theirs is the one that depicts Weibo help-seekers prior to January

1508
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,640
18th, 2020.

1509
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,080
Gateway Pundit doesn't include the subsequent maps depicting Weibo seekers from January

1510
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:10,380
19th to 20th, which shows the distribution going way towards the areas nowhere near the

1511
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:15,120
labs that they're focusing on, nor do they even bring up the map from January 21st to

1512
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,600
22nd, which shows more of the same, shifting away from that hotspot that he decided to

1513
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,760
cherry-pick data and just make his argument with.

1514
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,440
Okay, so then in this case, here's what I've got for you.

1515
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,440
Okay.

1516
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,720
So, some dudes?

1517
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:38,000
Shuffling dangerous COVID back from lab to lab.

1518
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,200
They stop at a gas station, accidentally drop a vial, right?

1519
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
It explodes.

1520
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,760
That causes problems.

1521
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,080
But that's a small outbreak.

1522
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,360
It's just one vial.

1523
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:51,480
So then they go to the other places, and that's where the big vials are tossed out of the

1524
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,480
car.

1525
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,640
I mean, it's an interesting plot for a book or something, but I don't think this supports

1526
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,640
it.

1527
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,640
I've written it down.

1528
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,920
The final problem is that according to Google Maps, Jim Hough's brother has mislabeled the

1529
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,420
map he published.

1530
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:09,280
It appears that that yellow square that he's talking about to signify the Biological Preparations

1531
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,280
Institute?

1532
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,280
Sure.

1533
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,960
That's actually the Biological Preparations Institute Marketing Center.

1534
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:24,200
Well, they were trying to figure out how to advertise the pandemic, yeah, naturally.

1535
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:29,420
The actual Wuhan Biological Preparations Institute is about 25 kilometers south of where they

1536
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:34,040
have it marked on the map, and if you actually use the correct location, there are no clusters

1537
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,040
right near it.

1538
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,840
I swear to God, I want to throw baseballs at these people.

1539
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
It's amazing.

1540
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,840
Really hard.

1541
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,640
Yeah, and it took a little while of looking at the map and asking myself questions about

1542
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,380
like, what is this entity exactly?

1543
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,520
Is this what they're saying it is?

1544
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,000
And you know, it took a little while to unravel, but this is pretty basic stuff that they didn't

1545
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,760
even consider, or they did consider and decided to lie about in service of making their argument.

1546
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:06,520
This is that one situation of, what's the name of those places where there's the institute

1547
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:11,520
and the university or whatever, and they keep mixing them up?

1548
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,520
The Tavistock Institute?

1549
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,840
Yes, the Tavistock Institute, and yeah, it's the same thing where they just keep mixing

1550
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,520
up the dumb stuff and they're like, nobody's ever going to follow up on this except for

1551
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,520
Dan.

1552
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,680
Well, but I also, I would fully think that it's a very good chance that they just didn't

1553
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,680
even check.

1554
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,680
They just saw.

1555
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,680
That's what I'm saying.

1556
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,680
Yeah.

1557
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,680
They don't even bother.

1558
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,680
Why would they?

1559
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,760
Again, no one's going to follow up on this except Dan.

1560
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:41,640
It's so sloppy and embarrassing that this is like Gateway Pundit's editorial, like that's

1561
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:49,000
what's good enough to be put out as an exclusive and then come on Alex's show and ramble about

1562
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
it.

1563
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,760
And even problems that I was able to find with the way they were using that map from

1564
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:01,080
the journal itself to what they were doing, even if they did have the right location,

1565
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,080
there were problems.

1566
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,080
Yeah.

1567
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,040
And the fact that that is a different location than they're pretending it is makes it just

1568
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,040
comical.

1569
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,040
It's farce.

1570
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,040
That's stupid.

1571
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,040
That's stupid.

1572
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,040
Yeah.

1573
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,040
So anyway, at that point I checked out.

1574
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,040
You're like the Sigma-5 of propaganda.

1575
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:18,480
Like, you know how Sigma-5 scientists are like, there's a one in a million chance that we're

1576
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,660
not 100% correct on this.

1577
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:24,160
You know, Sigma-3 is like one in a thousand or whatever.

1578
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:28,400
There's a point in propaganda where it's like, well, only Dan's going to care about this.

1579
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,400
So we're fine.

1580
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,440
And he might not if he doesn't accidentally get curious about it.

1581
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Yeah, exactly.

1582
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,440
If we fly this one by Dan, we're golden.

1583
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,440
Yeah.

1584
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,440
Yeah.

1585
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,440
We can just make this boring enough.

1586
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,440
I know.

1587
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,440
Have Jim Hoff's brother talk about it.

1588
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,440
Yeah.

1589
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,440
Sigma-4 is Dan and some other people.

1590
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,680
Sigma-3 is Dan and like the New York Times.

1591
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:49,560
I don't know, man.

1592
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:53,080
I unfortunately, you know, spent a little bit of time looking at that and it kind of

1593
01:19:53,080 --> 01:20:01,440
burned me out a tiny bit between the like sort of just very constant and boring racism

1594
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,400
and immigrant bashing.

1595
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,520
And then, you know, that I was just like, I'm out.

1596
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,520
I'm out.

1597
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,360
And unfortunately that made me miss Roger Stone.

1598
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,920
He showed up in the fourth hour of the show.

1599
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,360
I don't usually watch the fourth hour because I completely missed it.

1600
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,800
Maybe we'll get it next week.

1601
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,800
Who knows?

1602
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,800
Probably not.

1603
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,800
Roger Stone's boring.

1604
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,800
He sucks.

1605
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,800
Yeah.

1606
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,800
He's boring now.

1607
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,800
Yeah.

1608
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,800
He doesn't do anything.

1609
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,000
I think ever since he got that pardon, he's just not the same.

1610
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Just not the same, man.

1611
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,480
Well, I mean, you know, I get it, right?

1612
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,480
Like you've got all the adrenaline of like, am I going to go to jail?

1613
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,480
Am I going to go to jail?

1614
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,300
And then you get a pardon and you're like, well now what do I do?

1615
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,200
It feels like the definition of once bitten, twice shy.

1616
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,200
Yeah.

1617
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,200
Yeah.

1618
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,200
Yeah.

1619
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,600
I'm not going to fuck around with needing a pardon again because I don't got a pardon

1620
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,880
coming for the second one.

1621
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:52,280
I will try and get attention to myself as best I can and maybe do some publicity stunt

1622
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,280
things.

1623
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,280
I need some money from people.

1624
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,280
I'll be a shithead.

1625
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,280
That'll be fine.

1626
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,280
Yeah.

1627
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,280
I'll have a good bone mow from time to time.

1628
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,280
Sure.

1629
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,280
Yeah.

1630
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:01,280
I'll yell at Larry Klayman if I get a chance.

1631
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,280
Not hard.

1632
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,280
Not hard to do.

1633
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,080
So yeah, I don't know.

1634
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:10,000
I found this stretch.

1635
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,800
When I said at the beginning of the show, I was like, is there even value in talking

1636
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,800
about it?

1637
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,160
Well, part of the reason is because I don't think a lot of it brings much new to the table.

1638
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,160
True.

1639
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,600
I think with Jim Hoff's brother and talking about some of the specific instances of things

1640
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:30,440
he brings up, maybe there's a little bit, but his coverage of, for instance, the shooting

1641
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,560
is all in service of anti Muslim rhetoric.

1642
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,760
It's all in service of anti immigrant.

1643
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:41,880
There's nothing there that you don't see in the aftermath of so many other tragic events.

1644
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:48,160
If you look at Alex's coverage, there's just, and it kind of, I don't know.

1645
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:51,320
It makes me sad that you can just still get away with the same tricks.

1646
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,320
Yeah.

1647
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,400
It is one of those things where sometimes we do an episode that I want in court as like,

1648
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,560
this isn't a first amendment issue.

1649
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,720
This is malice.

1650
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,520
We can prove malice.

1651
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,520
Listen to this shit.

1652
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,800
Now you're going to have to listen to about, I think about a thousand hours of knowledge

1653
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,000
fight at this point.

1654
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,800
So strap in, but you'll get there and we'll get the conviction on this one.

1655
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,760
We'll get it.

1656
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,160
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back.

1657
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,160
Indeed.

1658
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,160
We will, Dan.

1659
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,420
But until then we have a website.

1660
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:24,420
We have a website.

1661
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,420
It's knowledgefight.com.

1662
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,420
Yes.

1663
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,420
We're also on Twitter.

1664
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,420
We are on Twitter.

1665
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,420
It's at knowledgefight.com.

1666
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:30,420
And I go to bed Jordan.

1667
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,420
We are also on Facebook.

1668
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:36,040
And if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1669
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,200
doing God's work still.

1670
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,200
Yep.

1671
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,200
And until then I'm Neo.

1672
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,200
I'm Leo.

1673
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,200
I'm DZX Clark.

1674
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1675
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:47,600
I pledge on the altar of God to try to force Alex Jones to eat fake fruit.

1676
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,600
Andy in Kansas.

1677
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,600
You're on the air.

1678
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,600
Thanks for holding.

1679
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,600
Hello Alex.

1680
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,600
I'm a first time caller.

1681
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,600
I'm a huge fan.

1682
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,600
I love your work.

1683
01:22:54,600 --> 01:23:18,280
I love you.
