00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I need, I need money

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Stop it, Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I love your room

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
knowledgefight

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
knowledgefight.com

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I love you

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Jordan

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Jordan

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Dan

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Jordan

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Quick question for you

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
What's up

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
My bright spot today is, I'd like to thank a wonk out there named Pat

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
who got in touch and helped me find some old Alex Jones episodes

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm still on the hunt for more

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
But it's one of the first times that a tip has actually paid off

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
and I've got some interesting stuff

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I like it

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
to look at, so I really appreciate that

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
That's good news

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
It definitely, especially as like the modern day, it's kind of like

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
I mean, spoiler alert, basically I'm really underselling the episode we're about to do

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Sure, sure, sure, sure

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
And I don't enjoy listening to it nearly as much as I probably would some kind of like

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
way deep in the past intellectual exercise

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Kind of thing

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
So you got home movies is what you're saying

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Clips of Alex playing baseball at 12

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Nah

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It's gonna be great

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Unless it's a variant of baseball

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
that is all about anti-communist heroes of his

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
John Birchball I believe is what it's called

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Birchball

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, Birchball

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, so that's my bright spot, how about you?

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
My bright spot, Dan, is I found a TV show called Wellington Paranormal

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
that's made by the same guys that did What We Do in the Shadows

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
It's fantastic, it's really good, it's like an X-Files that's super understated

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
in that New Zealand way where it's like they're trying to give a ticket to a werewolf

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
like that kind of situation where they're just

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
That sounds fun

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Oblivious to the absolute insanity going on around them

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It's just like, no, we're just trying to do our jobs

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I can dig that

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, it's really, really funny

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It's in that great vein of the mockumentary kind of stuff

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
It's great

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I hate these kinds of moments because I hear that and I'm like,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
that sounds good, I probably enjoy that

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
You'll never see it

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Exactly

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
The second moment is like, I'm never gonna watch that

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm never gonna watch that shit

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Oh well, maybe one day

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Someday I'll get to New Zealand

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Then I'll watch it

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, we'll see it on the local TV

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
You know, Jordan, I gotta say, I feel like it's been too long

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
It feels like too long in between episodes

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
What, between Mondays and Fridays?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, it really does

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Okay

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
It just feels like too long

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
You are

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I'm itching to be back in this seat

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
You're utterly incapable of doing anything but 12 episodes per week

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
If you could, I would just

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I feel like we're getting back together and it's been forever

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It's surprising that it has been a while

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Especially considering, I think we watched a movie together on Tuesday

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Like, yeah

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah, Monday

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Whatever

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Anyway, we're back in the saddle

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Indeed

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And today we'll be going over March 23rd and 24th, 2021 Blackjack

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Blackjack, oh god dammit

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And this is Tuesday and Wednesday

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Of this here week

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And there's something interesting that's going on, man

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Beginning of this week, Alex was gone again

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Okay

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
He was out of studio again doing something on the East Coast

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Okay, okay

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Something mysterious

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
He's trying to get out of Texas slowly and then it keeps pulling him back in like the Twilight Zone kind of situation

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
He apparently recorded a video of himself at the Skull and Bones

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sure

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Which I applaud

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Going back to his roots

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
No, absolutely

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
That's the kind of thing he should be moving back towards

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Why not?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yes

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Certainly better than literal devil stuff

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, I'm on Team Fuck the Skull and Crossbones

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I don't like Yale or whatever it is, fine

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
At the same time, as I expressed to you, I'm going to be furious if I have to do more episodes about where Geronimo's bones are

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, I'm not going to be stoked about that one, that's true

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I don't want to hear it

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Ah, yeah

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
Anyway, he is back on the 23rd and I would say not better than ever

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
And we'll get down to talking about that in a little stretch of time

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
But before we do, let's take a little moment, Jordan, to say thank you to some folks who are now policy wonks

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh, that's a great idea

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
So first, globalist big Dr. B, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Thank you very much, BDB

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Thank you

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Next, Jay in Maine, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Thanks, Jay

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Thank you

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Next, you are now a policy wonk, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Thank you very much, you are now a policy wonk

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Tongue twister

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Oh, boy

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Next, Lord Cakewagon, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Thank you very much Lord Cakewagon

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And Muffin pants, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Thank you very much, Muffin pants

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Also, Baby Goblin, what's going on? You are now a policy wonk

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I'm a policy wonk

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Thank you very much, Runc

05:37.000 --> 05:43.460
Did you know that Baby Goblin was made a Lord between now and when they sent that in so that's Lord Baby Goblin

05:43.460 --> 05:50.100
I did not realize that. 40% of all Wonks are Lords. I did not realize there was this honorific. Yeah, it's a weird thing that happens.

05:50.100 --> 05:55.760
Hmm. Yeah, and then also that reminded me that when we were doing our zipping up the mailbag

05:55.760 --> 06:01.940
One of the things we forgot was that goblin. Oh, I know! That got sent, it was sitting right next to you. I brought it from my place

06:01.940 --> 06:08.840
I was so gentle with it. I was holding it at the palm of my hand like can't let anything bad happen to it. Very, very delicate. And then I didn't get to show anybody.

06:08.840 --> 06:14.440
And that was from Cameron, and so thank you so much Cameron. You are now a technocrat. Yes, thank you very much.

06:14.440 --> 06:19.040
And Drew Desedue, thank you so much. You are now a technocrat.

06:19.040 --> 06:23.540
I'm a policy wonk. Crikey mate, that's fantastic. Have yourself a brew.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.040
How's your 401k doing, bro?

06:25.040 --> 06:30.940
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright? Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin.

06:30.940 --> 06:37.440
Why you pimps so good? My neck is freakishly large. I declare info war on you.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.440
Thank you to y'all. Yes, thank you very much.

06:40.440 --> 06:51.840
So yeah, I would say that this stretch of time is bad. And there was actually a bit more in it that I felt it was offensively bad.

06:51.840 --> 06:58.840
Like, it felt more like I don't want to do this. Which type? We have many different types of bad on this show.

06:58.840 --> 07:04.840
We have the incompetent kind, we have the uninspired kind, we have the horrific evil kind.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.840
What type of bad are we talking about? We can't even use the word bad anymore. Yeah, that's true.

07:08.840 --> 07:15.840
It's tough to exactly pigeonhole it, but it just feels like generalized incitement.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.840
And it's kind of a generalized boring incitement. That's not good.

07:19.840 --> 07:25.840
That largely has to do around white fears and immigrants, there's a lot of that.

07:25.840 --> 07:31.840
And I questioned on a certain level while I was listening to these, is this even worth it?

07:31.840 --> 07:40.840
Does this rise to the level of paying attention to it? Because it's pretty much just fucking gross most of the time.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.840
Well that's not good. No, it's not.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.840
It's not even super bad, it's just real gross.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.840
Anyway, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

07:49.840 --> 07:55.840
These people are evil. And when I say they're not even physically ugly, it's that they're not real.

07:55.840 --> 08:02.840
Like when you see a mannequin or you see, like I say, plastic fruit, you know it's plastic fruit no matter how good it is, no matter how fake it is.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.840
You look at it and you go, that's fake. You just know.

08:05.840 --> 08:09.840
And you look at them and you go, that's not normal. That's not normal.

08:09.840 --> 08:14.840
Look at Brian Stelter, that's not normal. That's an enemy. That's the enemy.

08:14.840 --> 08:20.840
God Blaggit? God Blaggit. God Blaggit? Blaggit!

08:20.840 --> 08:26.840
He screams to God himself, how dare you make me kill my son Blaggit?

08:26.840 --> 08:35.840
I heard that and I was like, all I want to do now for the rest of my life is hide plastic fruit around Alex.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.840
I was going to say, that sounds like a man who has tried to eat plastic fruit. 100%.

08:40.840 --> 08:44.840
I just want to get him on camera eating plastic fruit.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.840
It's like somebody who goes out of the way to all of a sudden be like, you know, I've never tripped going upstairs embarrassingly.

08:49.840 --> 08:53.840
It's never happened to me. I've seen tons of people do it before, but not me!

08:53.840 --> 08:59.840
So Alex is late to work on the 23rd and it's because his plane was delayed.

08:59.840 --> 09:06.840
And so he recorded himself prior to this so you'd have something to play in the beginning of the show.

09:06.840 --> 09:12.840
I'm Alex Jones, your host, and as we speak, I'm about to arrive at the studio and complete the transmission live.

09:12.840 --> 09:19.840
But I'm coming to you from earlier today in the space-time continuum as major news and information breaks.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.840
We're about to premiere this amazing report that only you can share with others and defeat the globalists.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.840
This is seriously a mission. We are seriously on the cutting edge of this fight.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.840
This goddamn anti-communist Smokey the Bear.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.840
Only you can stop the globalists.

09:33.840 --> 09:41.840
Okay, we gotta get, we gotta get, I want video surveillance footage of him recording that in a weird bathroom somewhere.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.840
Right, and trying to eat the fake fruit that's on the counter.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.840
Actually, I don't want that surveillance. Never mind. Yeah.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.840
So, you know, here's some of the stuff he's covering in his pre-recorded shit.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.840
Okay.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.840
Now the incredible news is Project Veritas has done it yet again.

09:52.840 --> 10:01.840
They just had a major court ruling where a judge said the New York Times printed lies about them, that they were fake news, that that was a known fraud and that the New York Times lied.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.840
Project Veritas did not win that lawsuit.

10:03.840 --> 10:13.840
The headline that Alex is lying about here have to do with a New York Supreme Court judge determining that Veritas's defamation suit against the Times can move forward.

10:13.840 --> 10:21.840
A couple articles in the Times referred to some Veritas videos as deceptive, but the judge felt that this was more opinion than it was straight up reporting of news.

10:21.840 --> 10:29.840
This kind of ruling honestly just seems like a parody where a liar is getting the court to force journalists to strictly adhere to rules that they themselves think are jokes.

10:29.840 --> 10:30.840
Yeah.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.840
I don't know.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.840
Anyway, the game here for Project Veritas isn't actually to win the case or anything like that.

10:35.840 --> 10:41.840
It's about the media circus they can drum up along the way while simultaneously trying to make other outlets scared to critically cover their work.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.840
That's what's going on here.

10:43.840 --> 10:54.840
Yeah, there should be a consultancy for dumb old judges who are like, well, I guess we have to take these people as good faith actors because of the legal system.

10:54.840 --> 11:00.840
And we could just be like, hey, no, you guys probably should have charged them with a federal crime a few years ago.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
So no, fuck these guys.

11:02.840 --> 11:08.840
So Alex still hasn't shown up at this point and it's getting to be like a ways into the show.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.840
And so Owen's got to break in with some big news.

11:12.840 --> 11:17.840
Ladies and gentlemen, we are live inside the Infowars world headquarters here.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.840
Owen Troyer sitting in studio.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.840
We're going to go back to Alex Jones here shortly.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.840
He's going to be joining us live here shortly as well.

11:25.840 --> 11:33.840
But I had to break in and report some of the latest that we know of the Boulder, Colorado shooter.

11:33.840 --> 11:37.840
Obviously his name, Ahmad Al Isa.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
It's now coming out.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.840
He was an Islamic State sympathizer, so an Islamicist.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.840
He was a immigrant from Syria.

11:45.840 --> 11:53.840
I don't know if I can find any evidence that he was an Islamic State sympathizer outside of wild conjecture being made by the guy who runs Jihad Watch.

11:53.840 --> 11:59.840
Yeah, I was going to say, all we've got there is Owen read the name and he was like, well, obviously this is a terrorist.

11:59.840 --> 12:06.840
And the thing that I find really interesting is even like within the last week, you can see how news is dealt with differently.

12:06.840 --> 12:11.840
When there was those shootings at the spas in Atlanta, Alex didn't even talk about it.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.840
And then the next day it was like, ah, incel weirdo, or whatever.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.840
And then just moved on.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.840
Maybe touched the story for a second on the second day.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.840
When it's this, break into coverage.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.840
Owen Troyer's got to come into studio to break in to give you the latest.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.840
Kind of see what's going on here.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.840
This is something that should fill people with great shame.

12:33.840 --> 12:40.840
And the only way they can survive this long is by having that part of their brain removed at some point in their lives.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.840
Because that is disgusting.

12:42.840 --> 12:47.840
Just on a really deep human level, just disgusting.

12:47.840 --> 12:54.840
Because it proves beyond reasonable doubt that they are choosing which stories maliciously.

12:54.840 --> 13:00.840
Not because of any kind of newsworthiness purely by malice.

13:00.840 --> 13:01.840
Yeah.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.840
Yeah.

13:02.840 --> 13:03.840
Yeah.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.840
I mean, I think it's demonstrated throughout the most of my career.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.840
I mean, you can't even, there's no middle ground on that whatsoever.

13:10.840 --> 13:11.840
No, it's pretty tough.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
Yeah.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.840
So Owen knows, I mean he's been around long enough at Infowars that he knows the game.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.840
He knows exactly what they do in these cases of shootings.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.840
Sure. Gun control is common.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.840
Well, of course. But also, psych meds, got to talk about that.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.840
Got to portray him as the other side.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.840
Sure.

13:28.840 --> 13:29.840
He was a leftist, bro.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.840
Of course.

13:30.840 --> 13:35.840
He was, it seems maybe a paranoid schizophrenic.

13:35.840 --> 13:43.840
So who knows what kind of pharmaceutical drugs he had been prescribed potentially for those mental problems.

13:43.840 --> 13:50.840
And then we also have a lot of his social media activity before it was deleted.

13:50.840 --> 13:55.840
Before it was deleted, showing that he was an anti-Trumper.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.840
He was a leftist, liberal progressive.

13:58.840 --> 14:05.840
He was one of those that pushed the leftist narrative to a T.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.840
So, I mean, they do have some screenshots of what appear to be his social media.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.840
Sure.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.840
And I mean, some of those descriptions are slightly fair.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.840
He had some post that they showed that were critical of Trump, but like,

14:16.840 --> 14:17.840
Cool.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.840
I don't know how much, like, it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with,

14:21.840 --> 14:25.840
at least they haven't demonstrated at all that it has anything to do with what happened.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.840
So Alex plays audio of the shooting.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.840
No.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.840
And I think it's incredibly exploitative and I'm not going to play that here,

14:34.840 --> 14:36.840
but I'm going to play what he has afterwards.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.840
Okay.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.840
This is his, something he had prerecorded also.

14:43.840 --> 14:53.840
His name was Eric Talley, a 51-year-old father of seven who was a patriot and who really loved human life.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.840
And that everybody that knew him said was just an amazing person.

14:56.840 --> 15:03.840
And he died heroically, helping stop some type of insane demonic psycho

15:03.840 --> 15:07.840
that went into a King's Super grocery store in Boulder, Colorado,

15:07.840 --> 15:10.840
and shot and killed 10 people, including this police officer.

15:10.840 --> 15:11.840
He's the only name we know right now.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.840
This is tragic and I'm not, you know, not going to diminish anything,

15:15.840 --> 15:20.840
but the way Alex is behaving around this is really exploitative.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.840
That's really the only way I can put it.

15:22.840 --> 15:27.840
And then when Owen starts talking about what the solution to these problems are,

15:27.840 --> 15:33.840
it kind of runs counter to the way Alex in his prerecorded stuff is trying to build this up.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.840
Look, here's the deal.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.840
Mass shootings in this country are really a rare occurrence

15:38.840 --> 15:43.840
and they would be even more rare if we had citizens with guns stopping them.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.840
But they know the police take at least two minutes to get to the scene

15:46.840 --> 15:51.840
so they know they can fire off at least a magazine or two full of rounds

15:51.840 --> 15:54.840
of innocent people killing people and get away with it

15:54.840 --> 15:58.840
because they never get stopped until the cops show up.

15:58.840 --> 16:03.840
One person, one citizen, one good citizen with a gun

16:03.840 --> 16:08.840
could have saved lives in that Colorado grocery store.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.840
And so there's this whole notion like, oh, you just want it to be like,

16:11.840 --> 16:14.840
blah, blah, blah, everybody with a pistol on their head, blah, blah, blah.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.840
No, that's not how I want it. That's not how I want it at all.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.840
I want white people to have guns.

16:20.840 --> 16:26.840
One crazy guy, one bad guy with a gun to kill ten people,

16:26.840 --> 16:30.840
all it would have taken was one good guy with a gun in that store to stop it.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.840
The problem is that one of the people who was killed was a cop

16:33.840 --> 16:35.840
who was responding who had a gun.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.840
Oh, they didn't give him the gun that day.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.840
I mean, it's not like this disproves any possibility

16:41.840 --> 16:44.840
of someone disrupting an active shooting or anything like that,

16:44.840 --> 16:48.840
but the notion that they have that this is a magic, pardon the expression,

16:48.840 --> 16:53.840
a magic bullet to stop situations like this is just, it's just ludicrous.

16:53.840 --> 16:59.840
Yeah, in order to stop mass shootings, we need to get one good guy with a gun

16:59.840 --> 17:02.840
to either assume people are going to be a mass shooter

17:02.840 --> 17:06.840
and just start killing before anyone is a mass shooter

17:06.840 --> 17:11.840
or get to the point where they're killing people after one or two killings.

17:11.840 --> 17:15.840
So it's not a mass shooting. It's just four or five people dead.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.840
I don't think you're solving a goddamn thing.

17:18.840 --> 17:22.840
Yeah, interject into the center of an active shooting

17:22.840 --> 17:26.840
and deputize yourself to shoot out with somebody who...

17:26.840 --> 17:29.840
I don't think this is a good solution,

17:29.840 --> 17:34.840
and I think that InfoWar's own reporting is a little bit convoluted on this front.

17:34.840 --> 17:40.840
Anyway, Owen has a belief that most people won't ever be really affected by mass shootings,

17:40.840 --> 17:49.840
and I mean, that's a little offensive, but everyone will be affected by liberal policies.

17:49.840 --> 17:50.840
Oh, that'll happen.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.840
Most people listening to this broadcast will probably never be directly impacted by a mass shooting.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.840
Let's pray to God that continues.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.840
But almost everybody listening to this podcast,

17:59.840 --> 18:01.840
almost everybody listening to this radio show,

18:01.840 --> 18:04.840
almost everybody watching this right now

18:04.840 --> 18:08.840
is going to be negatively impacted by Democrat liberal policies

18:08.840 --> 18:11.840
just like everyone in that grocery store was.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.840
That's the real threat.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.840
And now the liberal lefties are going so out of control.

18:16.840 --> 18:21.840
Their minds are so warped. Their minds are so bent, propagandized.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.840
They've become dangers to society.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.840
So this individual was a danger to society.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.840
He came in with a gun. He killed people.

18:30.840 --> 18:35.840
Well, most of these liberals may not have a gun, but they're dangers to society.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.840
Their policies will kill you.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.840
Their policies will kill freedom in the West.

18:42.840 --> 18:46.840
So the only policies really that he could be really talking about are...

18:46.840 --> 18:47.840
Have to be gun control, right?

18:47.840 --> 18:49.840
Well, that's one possibility.

18:49.840 --> 18:55.840
Disarming people who could be the good person with a gun who can carry out murder against a murderer.

18:55.840 --> 19:01.840
Or it's immigration-related, because this guy came from Syria a number of years back.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.840
And so that would be the leftist policy that he's attacking there.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.840
They're letting people who do these mass shootings in.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.840
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.840
And either way, it's dumb.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.840
But it's also just... it's disappointing.

19:15.840 --> 19:21.840
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to just... it's not far apart.

19:21.840 --> 19:29.840
It's hard to be like, oh, it's liberals letting people in a week after it's not liberals letting people in.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.840
You know, it's like, maybe there's a larger problem.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.840
Maybe there's one that should be dealt with.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.840
And maybe we should deal with it in a way that makes sense.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.840
And unfortunately...

19:40.840 --> 19:43.840
Or we could issue everybody guns. Do you want a gun, Dan?

19:43.840 --> 19:43.840
No.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.840
Oh, are you sure?

19:44.840 --> 19:45.840
Not at the moment.

19:45.840 --> 19:46.840
On the hip?

19:46.840 --> 19:47.840
Nah, I'm alright for right now.

19:47.840 --> 19:48.840
Okay, fine.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.840
I like how you're like, would you like an appetizer?

19:50.840 --> 19:51.840
Would you like a gun?

19:51.840 --> 19:52.840
I'm okay.

19:52.840 --> 19:53.840
Are you sure?

19:53.840 --> 19:56.840
I also think that Owen's not the best prism to be looking at this through.

19:56.840 --> 20:01.840
He's very milquetoast, but also clearly pretty extreme.

20:01.840 --> 20:06.840
Yeah, no, he's got a psychopathic energy of the banality of evil going on about him.

20:06.840 --> 20:13.840
Alex is more sort of interesting, and Harrison Smith is more of a straight-up bigot.

20:13.840 --> 20:19.840
Yeah, Harrison Smith just says, don't let brown people in, and if they are in, shoot them with guns.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.840
But being boring about it, which is terrifying.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.840
So thankfully, Owen is done at this point, and Alex shows back up.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.840
You know what he was doing? He was on a secret mission.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.840
Well, I was on a secret mission in Connecticut.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.840
I bet we'll find out what it is.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.840
It was yesterday, but that's part of it.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.840
But I am back in Austin, just landed about 30 minutes ago, rushed here to the studio.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.840
Flight was a little bit delayed, or I would have been here from the start of the broadcast.

20:44.840 --> 20:50.840
So we don't know. We don't get to find out what this secret mission was to Connecticut.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.840
We don't get to find out what it is?

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
No.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.840
What about the video we have of it out there?

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
Well, I mean, he went to the Skull and Bones.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.840
Sure.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.840
But that wasn't his main trip.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
Oh, okay.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.840
His main trip was, I would guess, if I had to bet anything, it would be lawyer-related.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
It was in Connecticut.

21:04.840 --> 21:05.840
It was in Connecticut.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.840
Does he have any possible reason? There's no secret mission I could think of to go to Connecticut.

21:09.840 --> 21:14.840
Boy, you know, there's a lot of reasons to go to Connecticut if you're Alex Jones.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.840
At the drop of a hat.

21:16.840 --> 21:21.840
I would argue he has more reasons to go to Connecticut than just about anybody else alive.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.840
He has one very specific reason to go to Connecticut.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.840
He is locked into Connecticut.

21:27.840 --> 21:33.840
I would guess it had something to do with maybe like Discovery or something to do with the Sandy Hook case.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.840
I mean, like, I can't imagine it being unrelated to that case.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.840
Yeah, it would be hard. It would be hard.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.840
When he said he was going to the East Coast, I was like, smells like Sandy Hook something.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.840
But, you know, I don't know. There's a lot of places he could go on the East Coast.

21:45.840 --> 21:46.840
Sure, sure.

21:46.840 --> 21:54.840
When he said it's Connecticut, he's either, it's either Sandy Hook case related or he went to Stanford and he's trying to get a job with Vince McMahon.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.840
Ah, that's possible. I'm not going to say no to that.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.840
Yeah, that's the only other possibility.

21:59.840 --> 22:03.840
Maybe he's enrolling in UConn. He wants to be a Husky, Dan. I went there for a semester.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.840
Hey, maybe he's following your footsteps.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.840
Yeah, he's always wanted to be me.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.840
So, Trump, you know, this narrative gets really interesting with Alex at this point.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.840
He's like, Obama, bad camps for immigrants and migrants coming over.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.840
Bad.

22:16.840 --> 22:17.840
Trump cleaned it all up.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.840
Good.

22:18.840 --> 22:19.840
Everything is good. Now, bad again.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.840
How is it bad so fast?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
It went bad really fast.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.840
It seems like it's too fast.

22:24.840 --> 22:33.840
Well, it's because Biden had a clip that Alex keeps playing where he's saying that he wants people to surge in whenever he becomes president.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.840
Sure.

22:34.840 --> 22:43.840
And what he's talking about is people applying for refugee status that were disallowed from being able to apply for refugee status during the Trump administration because he would just not.

22:43.840 --> 22:49.840
We took four refugees during the entire Trump administration. Biden's like, can we have more than four?

22:49.840 --> 22:53.840
That's not accurate, but also the ceiling was dropped quite a bit.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.840
Yes, I was being perhaps embellishing.

22:57.840 --> 23:05.840
And the only way to apply for asylum in the United States as a refugee, you have to be in the United States.

23:05.840 --> 23:13.840
So when the Trump administration would stop people from making it into consulates or on the border, that was what he's talking about.

23:13.840 --> 23:19.840
So Alex is pretending that Biden was like, everybody over the wall.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.840
And so anyway, it's bad now. The camps are back to bad.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.840
Sure.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.840
Remember all the nice facilities Trump built with the water fountains in each area?

23:28.840 --> 23:35.840
And they said, oh, you're drinking out of toilets. And AOC went and cried in front of a fence in a parking lot.

23:35.840 --> 23:44.840
Well, she's not crying now because she's a monster and an exploiter for the most powerful, rich, tax exempt billionaires on the planet.

23:44.840 --> 23:50.840
Ladies and gentlemen, AOC literally came out immediately against Biden, having migrant facilities open for children.

23:50.840 --> 23:56.840
She tweeted, quote, This is not OK. Never has been OK. Never will be OK, no matter the administration or party.

23:56.840 --> 24:04.840
Alex is making up that AOC doesn't oppose the things that Biden's administration is doing at the border because that's too complicated of a story for him to tell his audience.

24:04.840 --> 24:08.840
The listeners are used to very simplistic good versus evil characterizations of people.

24:08.840 --> 24:15.840
So to introduce the idea that AOC was against the treatment of migrants under Trump and is still opposed to the same types of treatment under Biden,

24:15.840 --> 24:18.840
that represents a threat to the characters that Alex has painted.

24:18.840 --> 24:27.840
Yeah, it really fucks things up whenever your enemy, I suppose, of Alex's has ideological consistency.

24:27.840 --> 24:33.840
And ideological differences between the people Alex wants to pretend are all working for the fucking devil.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
Yeah, that's that's that's what I'm saying.

24:35.840 --> 24:40.840
He could have picked plenty of Democrats who are like, well, we're Democrats in the White House now.

24:40.840 --> 24:45.840
We don't need to worry about. Yeah, that's that's not an unpopular opinion.

24:45.840 --> 24:52.840
Yeah, but AOC is. Yeah. So I like most of this episode has been immigrant bashing at this point.

24:52.840 --> 25:02.840
Like there is I have not, you know, cut out or I have not included a ton just because it's kind of standard, boring immigrant bashing that I just don't.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.840
I don't know. He said a lot of this stuff before.

25:04.840 --> 25:08.840
Yeah, he hates nonwhite people going into the country. We got it.

25:08.840 --> 25:20.840
And then they're bringing in hard core people. Most of the, quote, Middle Eastern immigrants, the country, the refugees in the U.S., it's over 75 percent that are men.

25:20.840 --> 25:29.840
Look, the numbers up in Europe. Again, look it up. Eighty five to 90 percent are men, military age men.

25:29.840 --> 25:38.840
Yeah, there's this tweet, Ahmed Al Isa, why refugees and immigrants are good for America.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.840
So he's trying to connect that to the the boulder shooting.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.840
And it kind of makes a little clearer what what Owen's line of thought probably was.

25:46.840 --> 25:50.840
Like I said, this episode is almost impossible to listen to. There's no real substance going on.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.840
And it's mostly Alex just rambling nonsense to make his listeners afraid of immigrants.

25:54.840 --> 25:59.840
According to the Pew Research numbers put out in August 2020, Alex is completely full of shit.

25:59.840 --> 26:11.840
One thing he probably doesn't even know is that, quote, among all refugees admitted in fiscal year 2019, 4,900 are Muslims and 23,800 are Christian.

26:11.840 --> 26:18.840
That's 16 percent Muslim and 79 percent Christian. That's super different than the picture Alex tends to paint, which is weird.

26:18.840 --> 26:19.840
It's kind of weird. Yeah.

26:19.840 --> 26:24.840
Also, according to the statistics from the Department of Homeland Security regarding refugee arrivals in 2019,

26:24.840 --> 26:32.840
there's just no way to pretend that everyone coming in are military aged men. For one, 49 percent of arrivals in 2019 were women.

26:32.840 --> 26:36.840
Secondly, 12 percent of all arrivals were aged 45 or older.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.840
But then again, I have no idea what Alex would consider military aged.

26:40.840 --> 26:47.840
Finally, the thing that Alex is mostly banking on here is that 43.2 percent of arrivals were between the ages of zero and 17.

26:47.840 --> 26:53.840
That's a pretty wide age gap, so using the same number, Alex could try to make you scared of refugee teens,

26:53.840 --> 26:56.840
and someone else could explain to you that a lot of these people are children.

26:56.840 --> 27:02.840
Issues related to immigration and refugee resettlement are super important in the real world, but they aren't important when dealing with Alex.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.840
He isn't living in reality and making an argument for policy.

27:05.840 --> 27:11.840
He's decided that he hates immigration and the U.S. becoming less white, and he's making up shit to justify it.

27:11.840 --> 27:15.840
None of this stuff is real, and it's just an appeal to fear, and it's boring.

27:15.840 --> 27:21.840
Yeah, and it's really, really fucked up on the back of a racist, misogynist mass shooting.

27:21.840 --> 27:29.840
Like, okay, whoa, we gotta hold off on being racist towards Asian for a little bit, so we can't not be racist,

27:29.840 --> 27:33.840
so we're gonna switch targets to just blanket immigration.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.840
How many fucking years are we gonna do this?

27:36.840 --> 27:43.840
It's not like this is a new thing for some white motherfucking asshole to start screaming that all immigrants are evil.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.840
We do it all the goddamn time.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.840
You mean Alex, not the shooters.

27:47.840 --> 27:55.840
No, I don't mean, yeah, I mean Alex, but I mean, like, it goes back, you can read newspaper articles from 1790 where it's like,

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
now we gotta close our fucking borders.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
Right, right.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.840
You know, it's like, we're just not gonna deal with it.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.840
And the maligned groups can change, but the mentality stays the same.

28:05.840 --> 28:13.840
And every time it blends up in violence, it doesn't stop, and we could deal with it, but we just refuse to,

28:13.840 --> 28:20.840
under some bullshit banner of, just like Project Veritas being allowed to go with their fucking lawsuit,

28:20.840 --> 28:23.840
I'm just, these guys are not good faith actors.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.840
Yeah, probably not.

28:26.840 --> 28:31.840
But you know who you should go to for information and ideas about immigration?

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
The Health Ranger?

28:32.840 --> 28:35.840
Someone in Europe who has a great track record.

28:35.840 --> 28:36.840
Oh no.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.840
Someone who might be the head of Hungary.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
Oh no.

28:40.840 --> 28:47.840
More bonds come out from Eastern Europe and said it's forbidden to say so in Europe, but this is organized invasion.

28:47.840 --> 28:50.840
95% of the immigrants are military age men.

28:50.840 --> 28:54.840
Yeah, that's some of the boatloads come in that are 95% military age men.

28:54.840 --> 28:59.840
Hell, some are 100%, but the numbers we've gotten are 85, 95%.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.840
It's on, ladies and gentlemen.

29:02.840 --> 29:08.840
And when they're on video, they're like, I'm here to rape, I'm here to kill, I'm here to burn, and they just start burning cities, raping.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.840
Holy shit.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.840
That seems extra.

29:11.840 --> 29:17.840
Yeah, and I don't know about appealing to Viktor Orban as your guy.

29:17.840 --> 29:22.840
I don't know if that's a great citation, seeing as he's made assisting refugees a criminal act.

29:22.840 --> 29:31.840
Yeah, I would say, boy, it seems like he's like, you know what, that chow chess cue had some good policies.

29:31.840 --> 29:37.840
I'm not saying he's a good guy, but when it comes to immigration, you want the chow and you get the chess cue, okay?

29:37.840 --> 29:39.840
Yeah, it's strange.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.840
Well, I mean, it's not strange at all. It's very transparent.

29:42.840 --> 29:54.840
No. Anyway, if Biden, you know, after these shootings that have happened, if he wants to take a guns, turns out Alex and his friends are going to be more deadly than the Viet Cong.

29:54.840 --> 29:55.840
Okay.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.840
So let me tell you where this is going to end.

29:58.840 --> 30:11.840
If Joe Biden tries to take the guns, it's going to wipe out law enforcement and a lot of military to the cause of civil war that'll make the Vietnamese resistance in Vietnam look tame.

30:11.840 --> 30:19.840
And then if they were even successful to break the back of the country and get most people to do it, it will then create a giant underground and lawlessness.

30:19.840 --> 30:23.840
You'll have such bad police involved. They'll all be corrupt that you will be worse than Mexico.

30:23.840 --> 30:34.840
We will be a completely failed state with kidnappings, murders, beheadings, hundreds of thousands dead every few years, just like we basically are becoming.

30:34.840 --> 30:41.840
Because the Tower of Babel can be every AI globalist takeover that's killing everybody that wants a post human world.

30:41.840 --> 30:48.840
Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure exactly what he's trying to intimate.

30:48.840 --> 30:57.840
Like, is it that if Biden puts in better background check regulations for guns, that everybody will be murdered on the street?

30:57.840 --> 31:01.840
Or is it that he and his friends will start guerrilla warfare?

31:01.840 --> 31:13.840
I think he's just imagining Red Dawn. That's what he's talking about. He's talking about joining the Wolverines, going up in the mountains and running the Swamp Fox 2.0.

31:13.840 --> 31:19.840
Yeah, 1776 2.0. No! That's over with. 1764 2.0, Dan.

31:19.840 --> 31:25.840
It seems like a little, I don't know, it doesn't make me feel all that comfortable.

31:25.840 --> 31:34.840
You know, it's going back to a lot of the ideas that were more popular within some of these militia right wing communities earlier on.

31:34.840 --> 31:42.840
You know, the books like Unintended Consequences, those kinds of ideas that it's just, it's not great to see them popping up again.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.840
Things feel a lot more volatile right now.

31:45.840 --> 31:52.840
Yeah, on the other hand, they are a bunch of cosplaying cowards that give up at the first hint of actual resistance.

31:52.840 --> 32:06.840
So there's, you know, it is a little bit heartening for me to look back on the 6th and remember that when push comes to shove, Alex will say that it was never his idea and it was all the liberals' fault in the end.

32:06.840 --> 32:10.840
So I'm not too worried about guerrilla warfare from these assholes.

32:10.840 --> 32:15.840
Hey, you know all those people who are out there doing the Red Dawn thing? That's just Antifa.

32:15.840 --> 32:22.840
No, that was, I was saying, Antifa, they're Red Dawning us because of the double Red Dawn proposition.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.840
Okay.

32:23.840 --> 32:24.840
Yeah.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.840
So the, oh boy, this isn't good.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.840
Yeah, I'll just tell you that. There's a good set up for this clip.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.840
Okay.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
This isn't good.

32:32.840 --> 32:33.840
Not good.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.840
So let me explain how this works.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.840
They collapse the third world.

32:37.840 --> 32:38.840
Sure.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.840
They flood us with Africans, military age men, Europe particularly.

32:41.840 --> 32:42.840
That doesn't sound right.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.840
And then, yeah, I mean, you're in a town of 500 Germans.

32:45.840 --> 32:51.840
They put 2,000 military age men, black men from a poor country there with no jobs at refugee center.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.840
They start raping and robbing you, some of them.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.840
Now you hate black people.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.840
Now you want to annihilate them.

32:58.840 --> 33:03.840
And see, that's how the globalists are going to make us join them in the extermination of the third world.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.840
That's coming next.

33:04.840 --> 33:11.840
I don't know if I would be susceptible to that sort of plan that the globalists would have because I see other solutions to problems.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm confused.

33:14.840 --> 33:21.840
I'm not entirely sure if there are these towns with 500 people and 2,000 immigrants come into it, all men with no jobs or whatever.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.840
But let's assume that is the situation.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.840
Sure.

33:24.840 --> 33:30.840
I feel like there could be some other sort of structural ways that we could deal with the issue.

33:30.840 --> 33:35.840
Hey, let's put some government works projects together, get these people employed.

33:35.840 --> 33:36.840
Let's get some jobs.

33:36.840 --> 33:37.840
Sure.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.840
Let's get some maintenance.

33:39.840 --> 33:43.840
I know this from the United States and Chicago specific.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
Every bridge needs a little bit of work.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.840
That's true. That is true.

33:47.840 --> 33:48.840
Bridges are scary.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.840
They are deteriorating quick.

33:51.840 --> 33:52.840
Yes.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.840
So let's get the government involved and inject a little bit of money. Everybody has a job.

33:56.840 --> 33:57.840
That does make sense.

33:57.840 --> 34:04.840
No, no, Alex is determined that this is how they're going to trick you into wanting to annihilate a population.

34:04.840 --> 34:15.840
Yeah, I really feel like maybe you don't need, or maybe, I feel like maybe you're manufacturing reasons to do what you already want to do.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.840
Maybe.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.840
That's what I would, that would be my instant reaction to this.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.840
Maybe you want to feel blameless about having those feelings already, and so you're creating excuses.

34:23.840 --> 34:29.840
I'm just going to go out on a limb here, and I'm going to say that that would probably become a national news story.

34:29.840 --> 34:34.840
Maybe a global news story. If Germany's government, Merkel is just like,

34:34.840 --> 34:41.840
yeah, we're going to put 2,000 only military-aged men in with this small, tiny town of 500 people,

34:41.840 --> 34:43.840
and then they're going to murder everyone.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.840
Right.

34:44.840 --> 34:49.840
And they'd be like, at the very least, this would call for a special session of Congress, right?

34:49.840 --> 34:50.840
Yeah.

34:50.840 --> 34:51.840
At least one.

34:51.840 --> 34:52.840
Yeah.

34:52.840 --> 34:58.840
So one of the things that I think is really interesting is that Alex plays a lot of games with what he believes is going on.

34:58.840 --> 34:59.840
Sure.

34:59.840 --> 35:04.840
You know, like he'll say that the globalists believe that they're talking to an extra-dimensional being.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.840
I'm not saying I believe that.

35:06.840 --> 35:07.840
No, no, no, he doesn't believe that.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.840
I'm saying that that's what they believe. I'm just here warning you what they believe.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.840
He does follow that up usually with, now it's obviously true.

35:14.840 --> 35:19.840
Well, yeah, but just to be totally clear here, Alex is expressing that he literally believes he's fighting the biblical devil.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.840
I was going to say, yeah. There we go.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.840
And at the end of the day, they want to get everybody, because again, they make some of the elite white people think,

35:25.840 --> 35:31.840
oh, you're going to be part of the club. No. Now they admit it's a post-human world, whatever this is running things.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.840
And I believe the Bible, it's the devil, does not want any humans.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.840
The Bible tells us the devil comes to destroy God's creation.

35:37.840 --> 35:41.840
So Alex believes he's fighting the Christian biblical literal devil.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.840
Question.

35:42.840 --> 35:43.840
Yeah.

35:43.840 --> 35:44.840
For Alex's theology.

35:44.840 --> 35:45.840
Uh-huh.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.840
All right. So the devil wants to destroy all humans.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.840
Mm-hmm.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.840
Okay. What happens to their souls?

35:51.840 --> 35:57.840
Do they still get heaven and hellified or is he going for all the souls in heaven and hell too?

35:57.840 --> 35:58.840
That's a great question.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.840
And if so, how is he going to pull that one off?

36:01.840 --> 36:02.840
Ooh.

36:02.840 --> 36:08.840
Finally, should he succeed in killing all the humans, then what?

36:08.840 --> 36:10.840
Or let's go another direction.

36:10.840 --> 36:11.840
Uh-huh.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.840
Let's say Alex is successful in vanquishing the devil.

36:14.840 --> 36:21.840
Okay. What does he do? Who takes over stewardship of hell?

36:21.840 --> 36:22.840
Right.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.840
Yeah. All those people are just hanging out?

36:24.840 --> 36:25.840
That's going to be chaos.

36:25.840 --> 36:30.840
That's going to be, yeah, that's really going to fuck up the infrastructure of hell currently.

36:30.840 --> 36:34.840
Right. And then how does that reshape theology for the future?

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
Doesn't it?

36:35.840 --> 36:36.840
It's like, okay, so we-

36:36.840 --> 36:37.840
You have to rewrite the entire Bible.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
There needs to be a new Bible.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.840
There has to be an entirely new Bible.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.840
A lot of it is probably going to be based on stuff from our show.

36:43.840 --> 36:48.840
The animals of Alex Jones.

36:48.840 --> 36:53.840
You have the Old Testament, you have the New Testament, and the Jones Testament.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.840
Yeah, because it nullifies almost all of the prophecies.

36:57.840 --> 37:04.840
Like the revelations is, you don't even talk about God defeating the devil or a thousand years of Jesus' reign.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.840
It's just more like Alex did it.

37:07.840 --> 37:13.840
That's the end of revelations is, hey man, it was a good thing God gave us Alex fucking Jones.

37:13.840 --> 37:14.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

37:14.840 --> 37:20.840
The last verse of the Bible is, I'm not bragging, but we did it guys.

37:20.840 --> 37:25.840
Just one mission. No Bible at all. Just a mission accomplished banner. That's it.

37:25.840 --> 37:31.840
Yeah, I don't really quite understand what, I don't know.

37:31.840 --> 37:35.840
I just think it's really important to recognize that whenever he says stuff like,

37:35.840 --> 37:38.840
I'm not saying that I believe this stuff, it's what they believe.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.840
Of course.

37:39.840 --> 37:45.840
That's him trying to hold onto some thread of respectability and credibility with people who would call him nuts.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.840
He's like, I'm fighting the devil.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.840
Yeah, that's tough.

37:49.840 --> 37:50.840
Everybody needs to recognize that.

37:50.840 --> 37:51.840
That's really tough.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.840
You need to recognize he thinks it's the devil.

37:53.840 --> 37:54.840
I know.

37:54.840 --> 38:00.840
It is a little bit like how they, all the articles about Roger Stone are always conspicuously like,

38:00.840 --> 38:08.840
he was a lobbyist and he was close to Trump's inner circle and they never mentioned that he hosted a show on Infowars for two years.

38:08.840 --> 38:12.840
That is a news outlet whose editorial position is staunchly anti-devil.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.840
Yes, 100% anti-communism, anti-devil.

38:15.840 --> 38:22.840
Roger Stone absolutely, I guarantee, said that the basic problem is the devil.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.840
Probably. I don't know if he ever believed it.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.840
I doubt it. I don't know if he believes anything.

38:27.840 --> 38:33.840
Yeah, I think that it would be interesting to have that be what the public conversation is.

38:33.840 --> 38:34.840
Totally.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
It's not like he's a free speech crusader.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.840
No.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.840
He's not a Trump fan. He's a guy who thinks he's fighting the devil.

38:39.840 --> 38:40.840
Totally.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.840
And he's also super racist.

38:44.840 --> 38:45.840
Yes.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.840
But there are interesting things that he tries to get, he's taken some calls here on the show,

38:49.840 --> 38:58.840
and he has this conversation that he has with the caller about taking these racist feelings you have and then redirecting them at the globalists.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.840
That's nice.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
No.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.840
2024, really a massive political expression is needed.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.840
Well, everything the enemy does is divide us.

39:05.840 --> 39:10.840
And look, I'm tribal, I got red blood, don't you think I see all this and get mad at groups?

39:10.840 --> 39:12.840
Then I go, that's my animal side.

39:12.840 --> 39:18.840
I had that programming to survive in the old times against the group attacking me, but the enemy is using that against us.

39:18.840 --> 39:23.840
And we have to still defend ourselves against groups or whatever, but we have to be aware of the larger plan.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.840
That's the only way to defeat this.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.840
This is an alien attack.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.840
I don't go off UFOs or any of that.

39:28.840 --> 39:29.840
I mean, it's alien.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.840
The whole thing is rewrite humans, bring in world government.

39:32.840 --> 39:33.840
Also, UFOs are real.

39:33.840 --> 39:34.840
They want to kill everybody.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
They try to kill us all.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.840
UFOs are realer than the devil.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.840
Well, I don't care if they were just killing the Africans, I'm against it.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.840
But the truth is, they're killing everybody.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.840
Does that make sense?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.840
Not totally.

39:45.840 --> 39:51.840
But the point that he's trying to make is essentially that he has this old timey racist programming that's inside him.

39:51.840 --> 39:54.840
And you've got to take that and direct it towards the globalists.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.840
And it's like, well, no, you should rise above it.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.840
Maybe wrestle with it.

39:59.840 --> 40:03.840
Wrestle with those feelings as opposed to just hate someone else.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.840
It has to be evolution itself that makes him racist.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.840
It can't possibly be cultural.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.840
I actually don't think that he was talking about caveman days.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.840
Where it's like a group.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.840
I think he was talking about when he was in high school.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.840
Because he constantly talks about how black people would beat him up in high school.

40:20.840 --> 40:21.840
Sure, sure.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
He talks about that all the time.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.840
That's true.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.840
I think he's talking about youth.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.840
What an asshole.

40:28.840 --> 40:35.840
I think it's so ironic now, with all the reports that we have from very credible sources and the government releasing shit,

40:35.840 --> 40:38.840
that it's like, look, we see UFOs all the time.

40:38.840 --> 40:39.840
I've got to be honest with you.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.840
We see UFOs all the goddamn time.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.840
Here are tapes of navy pilots.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.840
Here's video. Here's everything.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.840
And Alex is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't believe in UFOs.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.840
It's the devil we're fighting.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.840
I'm fighting a demon.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.840
It's the devil.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.840
Right.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.840
At the same time, still, the functioning letter in UFO is U.

40:57.840 --> 40:58.840
Of course.

40:58.840 --> 41:02.840
And, you know, let's get some more, let's make those IFOs.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.840
Sure, sure, sure, sure. I see what you're saying.

41:04.840 --> 41:11.840
So Alex takes another call, and this guy, he seems to be worried that the FBI is following his social media.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.840
And Alex's response to it is a little bit weird.

41:14.840 --> 41:15.840
Hey, Alex.

41:15.840 --> 41:24.840
So I just want to preface this message with what Paul said in first collagens, because it's kind of scary, what I'm going to say.

41:24.840 --> 41:29.840
He said that the powers of darkness were defeated on the cross.

41:29.840 --> 41:33.840
And that is the, that is our only hope right now.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.840
Look, I had the FBI show up at my house.

41:36.840 --> 41:43.840
I have a TikTok account and Snapchat, and I basically preach the gospel on there.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.840
And I went into the vaccine.

41:45.840 --> 41:49.840
I'm kind of nervous on this phone call, to be honest with you, because...

41:49.840 --> 41:50.840
It's okay, sir.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.840
The FBI is the run by the Chinese now, and it's run by the Globals.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.840
They just, they're told just to come out and intimidate you.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.840
It's all, there's nothing to be afraid of.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.840
That does relax me.

42:00.840 --> 42:01.840
That's okay.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.840
That's a wildly, oh, man, I'm so relaxed.

42:04.840 --> 42:05.840
Yeah.

42:05.840 --> 42:08.840
I was worried about the FBI, but that was the American government's FBI.

42:08.840 --> 42:14.840
Now that I know they're controlled by the Chinese, and the Chinese just tell them to go rough people up a little bit.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.840
I don't know what to believe about this caller.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.840
He sounds a little skittish and a little weird.

42:20.840 --> 42:21.840
Sure, a little bit.

42:21.840 --> 42:27.840
I don't believe that the FBI, I don't know if I believe the FBI showed up at his house.

42:27.840 --> 42:32.840
If they did, I believe that he's posting more on that account than he's letting on.

42:32.840 --> 42:41.840
It does sound like maybe the FBI wouldn't just walk around at the behest of the Chinese government to scare him a little bit because of his TikTok.

42:41.840 --> 42:48.840
Whatever the reality or non-reality of this one visit is, I'm guessing there's not going to be a follow-up visit, and they're not listening to him call into Alex's show.

42:48.840 --> 42:49.840
I would say so.

42:49.840 --> 42:56.840
There's some delusional paranoia that's going on here, and Alex is doing a great disservice to his listener by being like, oh, don't worry about it.

42:56.840 --> 42:57.840
Don't worry about it.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.840
It's just the FBI working for the Chinese.

42:59.840 --> 43:00.840
Come on.

43:00.840 --> 43:08.840
That is the way, like, to deal with delusional paranoia, he's like, we're not going to deal with the delusion whatsoever.

43:08.840 --> 43:09.840
We're going to deal with the paranoia.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.840
I'm going to try and make you calm down.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.840
Of course the delusion is true.

43:13.840 --> 43:17.840
I'm going to make you calm down, but also make it way worse.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.840
Like, whatever you're worried about, so much worse.

43:20.840 --> 43:21.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:21.840 --> 43:22.840
Come on, what are you doing?

43:22.840 --> 43:23.840
Oh, you're starving.

43:23.840 --> 43:24.840
A nuclear bomb's coming.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.840
Oh, you're worried about one government?

43:27.840 --> 43:28.840
You're worried about law enforcement?

43:28.840 --> 43:29.840
Guess what?

43:29.840 --> 43:30.840
The new government's talking about.

43:30.840 --> 43:31.840
Now it's everybody.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.840
Oh, also, and the new world order.

43:33.840 --> 43:38.840
And the European government is trying to hire Africans to kill your entire town.

43:38.840 --> 43:42.840
And also they're working with the spider leadership and the raptors.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.840
All run by the literal devil.

43:45.840 --> 43:49.840
Does the devil want to destroy aliens?

43:49.840 --> 43:50.840
Alex hasn't weighed in on that, man.

43:50.840 --> 43:51.840
He doesn't get into UFO stuff.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.840
I just want to know.

43:52.840 --> 43:53.840
I'm just adding that in there?

43:53.840 --> 43:55.840
Silly, silly UFO stuff.

43:55.840 --> 43:59.840
Okay, so Alex gets another call, and this guy makes an interesting point, and that is

43:59.840 --> 44:02.840
that China isn't communist.

44:02.840 --> 44:03.840
There is that.

44:03.840 --> 44:08.840
Which is an interesting problem for Alex, because he constantly calls them the chai

44:08.840 --> 44:11.840
comms and yells about communist China.

44:11.840 --> 44:12.840
Yeah, there's a problem.

44:12.840 --> 44:13.840
Uh oh.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.840
I read China's not a communist country, nor at all a socialist country, but a primitive

44:18.840 --> 44:25.840
crony capitalist country economically and a totalitarian dictatorship politically.

44:25.840 --> 44:26.840
Now that's it.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.840
China is a giant slave colony of the globalist.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.840
We used to leverage out the whole planet and let them economically through economic warfare

44:32.840 --> 44:33.840
and take over.

44:33.840 --> 44:34.840
Here's what's going to happen.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.840
Oh, we're not going to.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.840
We've got one more 11 minute segment.

44:37.840 --> 44:38.840
Okay.

44:38.840 --> 44:39.840
We're not going to bother with that.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.840
Not going to engage.

44:40.840 --> 44:41.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:41.840 --> 44:45.840
Crony capitalism and totalitarian government, which we absolutely have nothing resembling

44:45.840 --> 44:46.840
here.

44:46.840 --> 44:50.840
He rephrased this in a way that works for me, which is it's a testing ground for the

44:50.840 --> 44:55.840
globalists and then we'll move on and I won't have to deal with how I am full of shit.

44:55.840 --> 44:58.840
And he might as well just like neiner, neiner, neiner.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.840
I'm going to call him communist tomorrow.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.840
Like, that might as well have been his response.

45:03.840 --> 45:04.840
Yeah.

45:04.840 --> 45:09.840
So he gets another call, and this guy has a story from a year ago that blows Alex's

45:09.840 --> 45:13.840
mind because it helps him demonize Muslims.

45:13.840 --> 45:18.840
Locally, in Knoxville a year ago, April 8th, we had a stabbing.

45:18.840 --> 45:21.840
You can find it on the internet.

45:21.840 --> 45:31.840
Three pilot, that's a gas station, three pilot employees killed in stabbing attack at Knoxville

45:31.840 --> 45:33.840
I-40 truck stop.

45:33.840 --> 45:37.840
And of course they got no coverage because it was a knife.

45:37.840 --> 45:43.840
Well, and yes, and then they had an article on the front page of the local newspaper,

45:43.840 --> 45:49.840
a rag, the Knoxville News Sentinel under the leadership of the editor, Joel Christopher.

45:49.840 --> 45:51.840
I wouldn't wipe my rear end with it.

45:51.840 --> 46:03.840
They gave a front page coverage to the mother of the stabbing stabber, and she said that

46:03.840 --> 46:08.840
it was not possible that he could have done what he did.

46:08.840 --> 46:10.840
So why are we not hearing about it?

46:10.840 --> 46:12.840
What is the racial makeup?

46:12.840 --> 46:15.840
He was of Middle Eastern descent.

46:15.840 --> 46:16.840
Bingo.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.840
Yeah.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.840
If a Muslim doesn't think, well, who else wants to stab three women?

46:19.840 --> 46:21.840
I mean, 90% of the time it's going to be a Muslim.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.840
Let's just say it.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.840
I'm on against all Muslims, but give me a break, man.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.840
They got a thing about killing women.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
Wow.

46:27.840 --> 46:28.840
That's wild.

46:28.840 --> 46:29.840
Wow.

46:29.840 --> 46:30.840
That's really wild.

46:30.840 --> 46:35.840
In Altadena, California last week, two people were fatally stabbed on a Zoom call, and I've

46:35.840 --> 46:37.840
not heard Alex bring that story up at all.

46:37.840 --> 46:40.840
There's a news story out of Michigan where a 14-year-old girl spent months planning to

46:40.840 --> 46:44.840
stab her friend in the woods because she, quote, wanted to see someone die.

46:44.840 --> 46:46.840
You had to hear this reported on Infowars.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.840
We could do this all day, but the point doesn't matter.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.840
Stories are props for Alex, and this is a prop for him to demonize and foment hatred

46:52.840 --> 46:54.840
towards Muslims.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.840
I believe this caller is also conflating things.

46:56.840 --> 47:02.840
The claims that I believe were in those articles, they weren't that the guy, he couldn't have

47:02.840 --> 47:05.840
been the person at the stabbing.

47:05.840 --> 47:11.840
They were that he couldn't have been involved in a previous stabbing in a town called Millington

47:11.840 --> 47:16.840
that initially people thought might have been connected because he definitely wasn't in

47:16.840 --> 47:20.840
that other town, and I think that he's just conflating things about the reporting being

47:20.840 --> 47:22.840
like, it couldn't have been him.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.840
Because why worry about details like that, Dan?

47:25.840 --> 47:29.840
You've got a group of people to smear and hate for the rest of your life.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
Yeah.

47:30.840 --> 47:31.840
Cool.

47:31.840 --> 47:35.840
So Alex is like, this is exciting, a year-old story about a stabbing at a gas station.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.840
Hooray, let's talk about this forever.

47:37.840 --> 47:42.840
And the media covered it up by putting it in the front page of the local newspaper.

47:42.840 --> 47:46.840
And covered it up by, like, there's a bunch of stories you can find about it if you want.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.840
Anyway, they decide to talk about it for quite a while.

47:49.840 --> 47:55.840
And then, Alex, they went on to have follow-up articles on the front page of the local newspaper

47:55.840 --> 48:03.840
rag, and they said that the people who stopped him, who killed him and stopped him from killing

48:03.840 --> 48:08.840
people, were investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing.

48:08.840 --> 48:14.840
Yeah, they had an article at Yale saying, should I be arrested for being at Yale?

48:14.840 --> 48:17.840
Wow, I'm glad you call in and know about this.

48:17.840 --> 48:18.840
We're pulling the articles up now.

48:18.840 --> 48:23.840
So Islamic stabs and kills three women, because he hates, you know, seeing that I'm free.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.840
And then the media calls him a victim.

48:25.840 --> 48:26.840
Holy mackerel.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.840
Bill, I gotta jump, and I'm glad you called.

48:28.840 --> 48:29.840
Let us know about that.

48:29.840 --> 48:30.840
Wow.

48:30.840 --> 48:33.840
You can see here how Alex takes little pieces of inaccurate information that a caller has

48:33.840 --> 48:36.840
passed along to him, and then he writes his own headlines about them.

48:36.840 --> 48:40.840
He's decided, based on literally nothing, that this person who stabbed people at a pilot

48:40.840 --> 48:44.840
station was motivated by his religious beliefs and because he was so mad about women being

48:44.840 --> 48:46.840
free because he's a Muslim.

48:46.840 --> 48:51.840
This is all completely made up and based on nothing other than Alex's intense hatred towards

48:51.840 --> 48:53.840
people he sees as different from himself.

48:53.840 --> 48:57.840
Also, this caller is once again fucking up details.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.840
The articles in the paper after the stabbing incident were about whether or not the police

49:00.840 --> 49:04.840
were justified in using deadly force against the stabber.

49:04.840 --> 49:07.840
They had ordered him to drop his weapon eight times and the police killed him when he failed

49:07.840 --> 49:10.840
to drop his weapon and he began to walk towards the police car.

49:10.840 --> 49:14.840
The news articles that this guy is referring to were about the DA's determination that

49:14.840 --> 49:19.840
it was a justified shooting, which isn't the same as being like, oh, was it right to...

49:19.840 --> 49:20.840
Yeah.

49:20.840 --> 49:21.840
Whatever.

49:21.840 --> 49:22.840
Fucking assholes.

49:22.840 --> 49:26.840
I'm noticing the length of time we're spending on this call versus the one that was like,

49:26.840 --> 49:29.840
the Chinese are a crony capitalist country.

49:29.840 --> 49:30.840
Let's move on.

49:30.840 --> 49:33.840
It does seem like he moved on from that awful quick.

49:33.840 --> 49:36.840
Oh wait, you got a story about someone who you think is a Muslim stabbing somebody?

49:36.840 --> 49:37.840
I mean, considering...

49:37.840 --> 49:38.840
A year ago, this is exciting.

49:38.840 --> 49:43.840
Considering discovering that information about China, seeing as how China is his main boogeyman

49:43.840 --> 49:46.840
really, that could shake his entire worldview.

49:46.840 --> 49:51.840
So he should really spend more time thinking on that as opposed to this one, which confirms

49:51.840 --> 49:52.840
his biases.

49:52.840 --> 50:01.840
Also, I found a C-SPAN symposium that Alex did about 9-11 conspiracy theories in 2006.

50:01.840 --> 50:09.840
And one of his arguments that he makes is that somehow the globalists are working against

50:09.840 --> 50:10.840
China.

50:10.840 --> 50:13.840
So in 2006, they were against each other.

50:13.840 --> 50:17.840
Completely different cosmology of evil at that time.

50:17.840 --> 50:18.840
Gotcha.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.840
So, we're done with the 23rd here.

50:21.840 --> 50:25.840
And a lot of the show seems to be really intensely anti-immigrant.

50:25.840 --> 50:31.840
It's disgustingly anti-Muslim and boring, just sort of paint-by-numbers nonsense of

50:31.840 --> 50:32.840
Alex's bullshit.

50:32.840 --> 50:36.840
And then, you know, the show's just disgusting on the 24th.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.840
Some, like, weird pedophile stuff.

50:39.840 --> 50:40.840
Jesus.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.840
It's all about hurting your children.

50:42.840 --> 50:46.840
And as soon as you figure that out, these are demonic monsters the sooner we beat them.

50:46.840 --> 50:47.840
They are a cult.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.840
Most of them are pedophiles.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.840
Mid-level Democrats and up are pedophiles.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.840
Remember that.

50:52.840 --> 50:54.840
You don't even get in the club unless you rape children.

50:54.840 --> 50:56.840
So Alex is above the political divide.

50:56.840 --> 50:57.840
Totally.

50:57.840 --> 51:01.840
You know, the left-right paradigm is all an illusion to this guy.

51:01.840 --> 51:02.840
Mm-hmm.

51:02.840 --> 51:03.840
Yep.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.840
But all mid-level Democrats and above.

51:05.840 --> 51:06.840
Yep.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.840
What is a mid-level Democrat?

51:08.840 --> 51:10.840
I was wondering the exact same thing.

51:10.840 --> 51:12.840
What's the cut-off point for mid-level?

51:12.840 --> 51:14.840
Well, it's gotta be any elected official, right?

51:14.840 --> 51:16.840
I mean, I don't know.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.840
Would you call a state rep mid-level?

51:19.840 --> 51:20.840
Maybe.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.840
Or, like, as an alderman in Chicago mid-level?

51:22.840 --> 51:23.840
Mayor?

51:23.840 --> 51:24.840
Mayor?

51:24.840 --> 51:25.840
Small town mayor.

51:25.840 --> 51:26.840
Small town...

51:26.840 --> 51:27.840
Sheriff.

51:27.840 --> 51:28.840
Sheriff.

51:28.840 --> 51:29.840
Constitutional sheriff.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.840
No, those are high-level patriots.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.840
What about Democratic constitutional...

51:34.840 --> 51:36.840
I don't even know if that exists, yeah.

51:36.840 --> 51:41.840
Yeah, I just find this unacceptable and stupid, and I don't have time for it.

51:41.840 --> 51:42.840
No.

51:42.840 --> 51:45.840
So we get to an interesting story.

51:45.840 --> 51:52.840
And this is a story about, allegedly, Black Lives Matter kidnapped 100 people.

51:52.840 --> 51:53.840
That just...

51:53.840 --> 51:54.840
Okay.

51:54.840 --> 51:55.840
You didn't hear about this?

51:55.840 --> 51:56.840
Okay.

51:56.840 --> 51:57.840
You didn't hear about this this week?

51:57.840 --> 51:58.840
Hold on one second.

51:58.840 --> 51:59.840
Yeah.

51:59.840 --> 52:00.840
Black Lives Matter as a whole...

52:00.840 --> 52:01.840
Nah, just some people in Rochester.

52:01.840 --> 52:02.840
Okay.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.840
A group in Rochester, Black Lives Matter.

52:04.840 --> 52:05.840
Okay.

52:05.840 --> 52:08.840
Kidnapped a bunch of people inside a grocery store.

52:08.840 --> 52:09.840
A hundred people?

52:09.840 --> 52:10.840
Yes.

52:10.840 --> 52:11.840
Okay.

52:11.840 --> 52:13.840
And Soros is apparently paying them to do this.

52:13.840 --> 52:14.840
That sounds true.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.840
It's about keeping us shut down, intimidating us.

52:17.840 --> 52:22.840
You ask, why would somebody do something this over the top and this crazy?

52:22.840 --> 52:26.840
They do it because they've been told by Soros to go do it, they're paid to do it, and they're

52:26.840 --> 52:28.840
seeing how far they can push us.

52:28.840 --> 52:29.840
And guess what?

52:29.840 --> 52:33.840
We keep putting up with it so it's gonna get worse.

52:33.840 --> 52:36.840
The article's up on infowars.com and newswars.com.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.840
It's also from gatewaypundit.com.

52:38.840 --> 52:44.280
BLM mob traps 100 customers inside grocery store.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.840
We're shutting stuff down.

52:45.840 --> 52:46.840
S down.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.920
S-H, you know what, down.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.880
And they kept them in there for a long time.

52:52.880 --> 52:56.840
According to a reporter for WROC who's on the scene, the entire framing of this story

52:56.840 --> 53:00.660
is completely fake and a racist lie being perpetuated by right wing media to attack

53:00.660 --> 53:01.660
Black Lives Matter.

53:01.660 --> 53:03.200
That does sound more likely.

53:03.200 --> 53:07.560
Kayla Green, who was there, said, quote, Wegmans closed doors and customers were kept inside

53:07.560 --> 53:10.420
temporarily but were let out soon after.

53:10.420 --> 53:11.940
Protesters never entered the store.

53:11.940 --> 53:15.080
Protesters are currently listening to music and eating pizza in the parking lot.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.920
Nobody is, quote, trapped inside.

53:16.920 --> 53:22.740
Yeah, I was gonna say, every one of these types of protests I've been to have been sometimes

53:22.740 --> 53:25.940
overly incredibly kind.

53:25.940 --> 53:30.160
Protesters were having a memorial demonstration on the anniversary of the day that Rochester

53:30.160 --> 53:34.080
police arrested Daniel Prude, which ultimately led to his death.

53:34.080 --> 53:39.240
But instead of discussing any of that reality, Alex just says that Soros is paying to agitate

53:39.240 --> 53:42.920
the goodly white people of the country to make them feel bad and stay inside a grocery

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
store or something.

53:43.920 --> 53:44.920
Yeah.

53:44.920 --> 53:45.920
It's all nonsense.

53:45.920 --> 53:53.440
It is kind of really a good example of that kind of going, you know, that propaganda method

53:53.440 --> 53:57.240
of going at your enemy's strength instead of their weakness.

53:57.240 --> 54:02.640
When he goes after, like, why would somebody do something so over the top and ridiculous?

54:02.640 --> 54:03.640
Because they wouldn't.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.680
This is too over the top and ridiculous.

54:05.680 --> 54:06.680
Aha.

54:06.680 --> 54:09.320
I will just cut past all of that by saying Soros.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.320
See?

54:10.320 --> 54:11.320
Done.

54:11.320 --> 54:15.720
Now, I will say that this next clip worried me because it's even more over the top.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.440
And it also made me think, Alex...

54:17.440 --> 54:21.560
Black Lives Matter clowned Mount Everest and blew it up.

54:21.560 --> 54:25.800
No, he starts acting like they committed criminal kidnapping.

54:25.800 --> 54:26.800
Sure.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.720
Now, let me show you under federal and state law.

54:28.720 --> 54:35.200
This is Title five, offense against the person, chapter 20, kidnapping, unlawful restraint

54:35.200 --> 54:37.880
and smuggling of persons.

54:37.880 --> 54:42.520
And that's what OJ Simpson went to jail for over a decade for.

54:42.520 --> 54:46.120
And these were folks he found out were counterfeiting his stuff and he was pissed at them.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.720
I might say what he was right, but, you know, I kind of get it.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.720
Are you defending OJ?

54:50.720 --> 54:51.720
But he actually...

54:51.720 --> 54:52.960
Are we defending OJ now?

54:52.960 --> 54:54.760
It makes me worried he's going to OJ me.

54:54.760 --> 54:55.760
Is that a thing?

54:55.760 --> 54:57.760
Are we defending OJ?

54:57.760 --> 54:58.760
Okay.

54:58.760 --> 54:59.760
Alright.

54:59.760 --> 55:07.200
So, anyway, this Black Lives Matter protest in Rochester kidnapped and wrongly arrested

55:07.200 --> 55:08.200
these people.

55:08.200 --> 55:09.200
Sure.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.200
Sure.

55:10.200 --> 55:13.920
And hey, man, if Alex was there, he probably would have started swinging.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.480
Aren't we in an occupied government?

55:15.480 --> 55:17.680
Aren't laws meaningless now?

55:17.680 --> 55:18.680
That was a week ago.

55:18.680 --> 55:19.680
That was a week ago.

55:19.680 --> 55:20.680
Sorry about that.

55:20.680 --> 55:22.040
It was in service of a completely different conversation.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.040
Sorry.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.040
I forgot.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.040
And it felt really good at the time.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.040
Those are still real.

55:26.040 --> 55:27.040
Yeah.

55:27.040 --> 55:30.240
But if Alex was there, he would have started swinging on people, man, just started knocking

55:30.240 --> 55:31.840
people out left and right.

55:31.840 --> 55:37.880
And then, then the media, the media would have called it a race war.

55:37.880 --> 55:49.980
So they go to a grocery store, a Wegmans grocery store, and trap an estimated 100 people in.

55:49.980 --> 55:53.740
Some reports are this went on for at least an hour.

55:53.740 --> 55:55.600
You know, what do you got to go home to your kids?

55:55.600 --> 55:56.600
What was that?

55:56.600 --> 55:57.600
An hour?

55:57.600 --> 55:58.600
Some reports.

55:58.600 --> 55:59.600
An hour.

55:59.600 --> 56:00.600
I got to shoot my mouth off.

56:00.600 --> 56:03.860
But if a couple of hundred people came and blocked me inside a grocery store and I had

56:03.860 --> 56:06.200
to go somewhere, I can't help it.

56:06.200 --> 56:07.480
I'm going to get violent.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.640
And then it's going to be called a race war.

56:08.640 --> 56:12.800
No, if some white people blocked me in a grocery store, I'm going to start kicking their ass.

56:12.800 --> 56:15.520
I mean, brown people, I don't give a damn.

56:15.520 --> 56:18.720
At a certain point, folks, this is out of control.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.640
And if we put up with this, we'll put anything.

56:20.640 --> 56:21.640
Huh.

56:21.640 --> 56:22.640
See, that's what I'm saying.

56:22.640 --> 56:27.240
I'm not worried about them starting a guerrilla warfare campaign because we're at the level

56:27.240 --> 56:32.360
of, like, I'm not worried about Mark Wahlberg actually stopping 9-11.

56:32.360 --> 56:33.360
Do you understand?

56:33.360 --> 56:38.000
Like, you blustery asshole, I would punch them and like, shut the fuck up.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Yeah.

56:39.000 --> 56:45.880
And this formulation, too, of like, because we keep putting up with it, like, so the solution

56:45.880 --> 56:48.240
is to stop putting up with protest.

56:48.240 --> 56:49.240
Right.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.240
Right?

56:50.240 --> 56:52.900
I mean, like, obviously that's the message that would be being sent.

56:52.900 --> 56:57.520
We stamp out any and all protests, we destroy the first amendment.

56:57.520 --> 57:05.600
Particularly ones that are central to, you know, non-straight, white, Christian, male-related

57:05.600 --> 57:06.600
issues.

57:06.600 --> 57:10.000
Stamp out all those protests because they're Soros instigated.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
Of course.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.280
Yeah, I don't know, it doesn't seem great.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.660
They do understand.

57:16.660 --> 57:18.120
These people do understand.

57:18.120 --> 57:19.320
Actually, never mind.

57:19.320 --> 57:20.320
They don't.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.320
No.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.320
I should end every sentence.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.320
They do understand.

57:23.320 --> 57:24.320
Actually, I'm wrong.

57:24.320 --> 57:29.320
Well, I think, I think the only explanation I could come up with for, like, to sort of

57:29.320 --> 57:34.520
maintain the dignity of Alex's listeners is like, they have to just think he's telling

57:34.520 --> 57:35.520
the truth.

57:35.520 --> 57:41.200
Like, I can't imagine listening to this having a kernel of skepticism and maintaining any

57:41.200 --> 57:43.360
illusion that he knows what he's talking about.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.880
Dan, he brought it up.

57:44.880 --> 57:49.560
If you covered this story and you went and found the, like, pictures of it, you found

57:49.560 --> 57:55.280
the explanation for what was going on at this Wegmans and how Alex is for some reason imagining

57:55.280 --> 57:59.560
people would call it a race war if he started fighting his way out of the store, you'd have

57:59.560 --> 58:02.380
to just be like, okay, this is about you, man.

58:02.380 --> 58:04.200
This isn't about reality.

58:04.200 --> 58:05.200
This isn't about the story.

58:05.200 --> 58:06.200
You're projecting everything.

58:06.200 --> 58:10.780
All of those paper articles are written directly by Soros.

58:10.780 --> 58:16.760
Did you know that 98% of all newspaper articles in the mainstream media were written directly

58:16.760 --> 58:17.760
by George Soros?

58:17.760 --> 58:18.760
Yep.

58:18.760 --> 58:21.640
I read that in one of the 2% that isn't.

58:21.640 --> 58:24.600
So I don't think that this is true.

58:24.600 --> 58:27.800
But this is being praised on Facebook and Twitter as a good thing.

58:27.800 --> 58:32.600
They just go randomly to a grocery store and there's black people, white people, you name

58:32.600 --> 58:38.220
it inside, and block everybody in and start screaming at people.

58:38.220 --> 58:41.420
And they surrounded the whole building and the emergency exits and wouldn't let people

58:41.420 --> 58:45.200
out.

58:45.200 --> 58:49.420
And look, I'm a man, so I'm, you know, still pretty tough at 47.

58:49.420 --> 58:51.520
I'm still being intimidated and angry by this.

58:51.520 --> 58:52.520
Imagine being a woman.

58:52.520 --> 58:53.520
Imagine being an old person.

58:53.520 --> 58:57.000
Imagine being some 80-year-old woman on her walker trying to get some food.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
This is thug behavior.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.560
It's criminal and it's disgusting.

59:00.560 --> 59:05.120
And the police need to stop kissing the ass of these type of globalist thugs and need

59:05.120 --> 59:07.400
to start arresting them for racketeering.

59:07.400 --> 59:08.400
What?

59:08.400 --> 59:13.160
Anyway, I'm not sure there's enough protesters there to surround a building.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.400
Wegmans, they're not usually small stores.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.040
They're usually fairly big.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.780
And I've seen a bunch of pictures of the gathering.

59:18.780 --> 59:20.560
It was not a giant mob.

59:20.560 --> 59:25.480
Also, in reality, Wegmans closed the door to their store out of fear of the protesters.

59:25.480 --> 59:29.840
So any decisions that Alex wants to complain about should be directed to Wegmans customer

59:29.840 --> 59:32.280
corporate office or whatever the fuck.

59:32.280 --> 59:36.760
The reason the protesters chose this location for their protest is that Wegmans uses uniformed

59:36.760 --> 59:39.080
Rochester police officers for security.

59:39.080 --> 59:42.440
And their protest was in part calling for the firing of the officers who were involved

59:42.440 --> 59:43.880
in the Daniel Prude case.

59:43.880 --> 59:45.400
It all makes total sense.

59:45.400 --> 59:46.500
It's not random.

59:46.500 --> 59:49.880
The reason they showed up there was not random.

59:49.880 --> 59:53.820
And Alex is going to pretend that it's random in a very racist way.

59:53.820 --> 59:54.820
And let's say what it is.

59:54.820 --> 59:56.840
This is the equivalent of KKK.

59:56.840 --> 59:58.720
This is a bunch of black people and white people.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.200
And I guess it looks like there's some brown people there that are literally angry randomly

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.080
at random people at a grocery store.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.400
And you see in the video, there's like an hour of it.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:14.520
The old lady in the walker looks like she's about to have a heart attack.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.020
And then she tries to get out the back and they yell at her.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.640
So again, and this is just, this video is the beginning of it.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:29.040
Hundreds of people surrounded the grocery store, all these big fat welfare queens.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.360
And again, nothing is if you're fat, but man, all these people bitch about this country

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360
sucks.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.480
400 pounds, man.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.520
You wouldn't last 10 minutes in Africa.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520
Whoa.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560
Weird.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560
Wild.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.180
Be a little too clear, Alex.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.240
That's tough to back away from.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.240
Yeah.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.240
That's tough to back away from.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.240
That's outrageous.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.600
Whenever Alex is like, I'm not racist, show me the clip.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600
Well.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600
Wow.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600
Well, there's one of them.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.600
Yep.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.920
One of many, just on this episode, you flagrant racist.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920
Yeah.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.560
That's, that's pretty, uh, it's pretty much, that's too explicit.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560
Yeah.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.160
That's, that's too explicit.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.040
It's yeah, it's pretty, pretty embarrassing.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040
Yeah.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.720
Um, so yeah, I don't know.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.720
The story's dumb.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.880
Spends quite a bit of time on this, uh, this Wegmans grocery store, uh, story and a lot

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.000
of time talking about how M4s may be gone soon.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.680
There's no protest about racial justice that's ever random.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680
No.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.360
And not even that, but it's a daily occurrence.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.520
And there's none that Alex will ever deem acceptable.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.680
Yeah, of course not.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.000
There's no version of it that Alex would ever, uh, see as like, oh, this is a productive

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
conversation.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.880
This is something that's bringing attention to an important, blah, blah, blah.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.480
Like you wouldn't, it just there, it doesn't exist.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.480
Yeah.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.420
Uh, it's, it would always be some kind of a Soros agitation in order to create division

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.520
in society and make white people feel bad.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520
Totally.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520
Yeah.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.240
It's, it's, and that's what I was kind of talking about at the beginning of this episode

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.800
where everything is just kind of boring.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.800
Yeah.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.000
Like he's just, these are just Alex Jones tricks that he's doing.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Retreads.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Yeah.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
A little bit.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.240
It's just racism on autopilot, which is fucking boggling.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.240
Yeah.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.240
I was a little bit disappointed.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.920
Um, I don't know, I just, I shouldn't expect anything.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920
Yeah.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920
Yeah.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920
But Infowars might be gone soon, man.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.880
That's why we got to cherish this while we have it.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.880
Yeah.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.480
This is just like, these people cannot be at all introspective whatsoever if you can

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.380
have racism on autopilot this explicit, right?

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:37.720
Like at no point in time does he ever like sit down and go, did what I say come off as

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.720
super racist?

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.560
Well, it's, it's, it's interesting to me to imagine like a listener who's hearing like

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.560
particularly that last clip and he's talking about these welfare queens of 400 pounds.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.560
Yeah.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.400
And hearing that it'd be like, Ooh, that's weird.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400
Yeah.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.840
But maybe you're somebody who's, you know, in inundated with shitty right wing media.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.640
And that's just like, Hey, that's where we live.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.880
I mean, then being like, why did you say you wouldn't last a day in Africa?

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880
That's a weird one.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.880
Yeah.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.080
Why, why, why was that where you were adding, adding all of that is just strange.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.080
Yeah.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080
Why?

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.880
I can't imagine being a listener and not being like, Oh, I get what he's saying.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.880
Yeah.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.880
It's black people.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.880
Yeah.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.920
But I mean, if you were a Reagan voter, you can't be mad about welfare queen at this point.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.000
You know, I'm not sure Alex loves Reagan.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Yeah.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.720
Well he loves using Reagan's racist talking points.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720
Sure.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.080
The squid metaphor was maybe gone soon.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.560
We've been hearing this for quite a while and I grow weary of it.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.880
I'm running out of gas.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.960
Now I probably wouldn't even play this cause he says like stuff about him being gone all

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960
the time.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.960
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:44.720
Except he makes a squid metaphor that maybe goes too long and I find it interesting.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720
I like a good squid metaphor.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.240
I'm not going to spend time getting into all the things they do to us.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.200
I'm not going to say the things that they're doing that have an effect, the things that

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.720
deflect the things that don't have an effect because I'm not going to give the enemy any

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.800
idea of where to keep attacking.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.840
But let me just tell you this, do not sit there and expect info wars to be here forever.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.120
I've had a lot of classy family that had cancer and was dying and you just hear that that

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.680
member of the family's dead.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.140
They were at work one week, totally nice, got their affairs in order.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.320
So manly, so tough, so feminine, so tough that they just die and make no big deal about

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.000
it and donate their bodies of science and stuff like that.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.760
I'm not as stoic as some of my ancestors.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.320
I'd like to point out that I'm really glad that Alex did make that caveat that that's

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320
not me.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320
Yeah.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:30.320
I'm not that person who's stoic.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.000
I'm going to go down, I'm going to go down whining.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.240
I'm going to renounce God.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:42.360
I'm going to sell my soul to Satan for one single longer second than I can handle it.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.840
You're going to see me on a pink sweater.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.480
I will do anything.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480
Yeah.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.160
And I don't have cancer.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:56.040
But America has cancer and this operation has a giant globalist squid attached to us

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.760
gnawing on our face.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760
Okay.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:02.240
And I just let it sit there and gnaw and I know how far it can go till it gets to our

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:08.240
arteries and I'm, I'm laying eggs real fast escape pods too.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.080
And we'll just see how they do getting caught in the whole underwater jet stream here and

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.240
what the, what they'll grow into and what they'll do.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.240
Are you the squid and the person?

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.200
I'll grow a bunch of eggs to use that analogy if I'm a fish with a big thing attached to

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200
me, eating me.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.920
Um, so I need energy to be able to make sure that all those things that we're insuring

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.040
in the future continue on because that's the main mission and I've, and I've looked at

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.000
all the different possible future scenarios and, um, we're going to get eaten by a squid.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.680
The globalists are so off the chart and so crazy now that there's a good chance that

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.520
they'll go ahead and just kill me and at a certain level, I kind of look forward to that

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.800
because in the big, great burden, atmospheres of pressure that I have to carry out this

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.200
mission will be gone.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.120
Didn't he just say like when he got back from his last a weird vacation to Florida that

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.520
like all the weight had been lifted from him and he'd completed his mission.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.400
Now he's like, Oh, I wish I was dead.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.920
I had a good week where the burden wasn't there and now it's back and I really wish

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.640
the globalists would just fucking kill me.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.440
Certainly had nothing to do with going to Connecticut.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.500
Yeah, nothing in Connecticut made me feel like I want to die and that info Wars won't

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.240
be around forever.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.840
Nothing in Connecticut would ever give me the impression that info Wars may be going

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840
out of business.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.960
I have to think that the metaphor here, the squid, I mean it's clunky metaphor, but the

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.000
squid is the, that's attached to info Wars is the Sandy Hook lawsuit.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.960
He knows how far they can nibble before it hits the carotid.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.240
That would be once his finances become public or they get discovery on a lot of this stuff.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.840
People realize what kind of shit he's really into.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:37.840
Yeah.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.320
And yeah, then he fell apart with the I'm laying eggs because that could either be like

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:48.520
I'm trying to give money to other organizations or I'm hiding money in my dad's business.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.600
That would make the most sense.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.600
I don't know.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.960
But anyway, he's got some more.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.960
I love life.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:54.960
I'll never commit suicide.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.760
If they, if I die, it wasn't suicide.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.280
I'm just saying I literally have no more fear.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.800
I I've been through this so long.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.800
I've done so much that I don't fear death.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800
I don't fear anything.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.360
I may lose my whole family.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.360
I may lose my children.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.080
I mean, hell, the whole world's about to go.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:13.560
I mean, you fear shadow all that matters is our souls, but you've got from me a total

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.960
commitment as strong as I can be.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960
I will fight.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.040
And does that mean I'm going to go off the rails and act crazy?

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.840
Yeah, because I'm, I'm, I'm burnout folks.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.840
I'm fried.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.480
When you fight evil like this at a level like this, this long, you don't just care about

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.880
them.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.440
You don't just not care about them killing you.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:35.360
You don't just not care about you start getting to the point where there's no inhibition anymore.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.360
Does that make sense?

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.360
No.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.680
I give you my word that I will be as focused and hardcore as I can until the very end,

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.160
but I need financial support.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.160
We know.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.160
Yeah.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.160
Yeah.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.160
It's, it's, it's weird.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.480
I would, I would pray that I would have all of my support dry up.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.440
Uh, if I ever get to the point where I speak that modeling.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.440
Yeah.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.160
If I ever get that, like, uh, I, you know, just doing this at the level that I've done

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.800
it, I'm not afraid to die.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.840
Dan, Dan, I won't let you go out like that.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.840
Yeah.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:09.600
But I will very much need you to check me if I ever start even getting close to that

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.440
level of blow harder.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.760
We're going to get on a boat.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.280
I'll take care of you.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.400
Godfather style.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.680
It'll be great.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680
This is embarrassing.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680
Yeah.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.080
Um, yeah, that's not good.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.640
So in a way there's squids out.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.640
Squids.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.120
I believe he's a fish in the metaphor.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.360
I think that's how far I've gotten with the metaphor.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.480
I think he's a fish being eaten by a squid.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.840
I think he did say that.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.520
I think he said, once he started to say that he was putting out eggs, he realized he had

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.960
to be something that laid eggs.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960
Yeah.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960
So now he had to...

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960
Yeah.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.000
The moment he said eggs, I think he thought he was the squid for a second.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Yeah.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And then...

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.520
This is the problem with Alex and protracted metaphors.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.520
Yeah.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.520
He's not good at metaphors.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.520
Nah, it's a dicey game.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.520
Yeah.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.780
So Alex gets some bad news here on the 24th and that is that the ninth circuit has made

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:51.780
a ruling.

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.780
That's not good.

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.240
This is a big deal on the ninth circuit.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.640
We'll be tracking that very, very closely.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.520
That's just now breaking, overturning, um, concealed carry period.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.840
This is just, you're like, Oh, the Supreme Court will overturn that.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.800
Don't hold your breath folks, because we don't put pressure on them.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.000
They don't fear the American people's political action.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.360
They fear the mainstream media.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:12.680
They fear the stacking of the court because nobody calls the bluff of the left.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.480
And so the left is Buffalo-ing us, stampeding us.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.680
It's only gonna get more crazy.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.000
Go after him for fast and furious.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.360
Get on the offense.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.880
Go after him for the child smuggling across the border.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.000
Do like Ted Cruz does, but almost everybody else sits there.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.720
Don't do like Ted Cruz doesn't matter.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720
He's got guts.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720
And guts is enough.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720
Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.080
We got free shipping on the mega blowout sale.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.080
Oh boy.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.080
Oh boy.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.760
That was, that was clunky one.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.760
Yup.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.760
Yeah.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760
So go after them for fast and furious.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.760
Yeah.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.760
Yeah.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760
That'll do it.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.760
You got them.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.760
Man.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.400
It's interesting how he pretends that they didn't have hearings on that.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:56.640
Nobody ever calls the left's bluff, you know, like nobody's ever like, we refuse to sit

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:03.420
a Supreme Court justice until, yeah, nobody's ever been like, oh, we got to put pressure

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:10.520
on the Supreme Court by removing and replacing all of the, yeah, cool, cool guys.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:17.100
Also this ninth court ruling, it has said, if I recall correctly, let me pull up the

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:23.220
exact wording of it, quote, there is no right to carry arms openly in public, nor is any

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.000
such right within the scope of the second amendment.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Yeah.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
That's what the U.S. court judge J. Bybee said.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.640
I would be hard pressed to find the wording within the second amendment that's like, yeah,

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.080
and carry them in the Wagner's.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:44.620
No, like that, that is, you know, something that I would think that Alex would be like,

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.620
it's over.

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.620
Yeah.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.620
Yeah.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.620
That's the slippery slope.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.620
Right.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.620
And he's already said the Supreme Court isn't going to.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.620
They're not going to help us at all.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:56.040
Should this be at the point where now, like his, you know, Viet Cong thing from earlier?

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.040
I don't know.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.200
There weren't any laws anymore anyways, Dan.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.240
The entire government is unconstitutional.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.240
Mm-hmm.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.680
All right.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.680
What are we going to do?

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.680
I don't know.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.680
Let's take their guns away.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.880
He doesn't really talk about this story as much as you would think based on the fact

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.520
that it should be.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.040
The most important story that's ever happened.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
He should go apoplectic.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.040
He should lose his mind.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.760
The Mayak report came out and he made such a stink about it for so long.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.760
Yeah.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.760
He talks to some weirdo who's got like a YouTube show for an hour about like trying to make

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.080
people afraid of stuff at the border.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.640
And I didn't care because I got a little bit deeper into this next interview.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.720
So I thought it was different and a little bit more interesting.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Okay.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:43.040
And so what we have here is that Jim Hoft from Gateway Pundit, his brother, whose name

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.680
I refuse to learn, is on.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.680
Jim Hoft's brother.

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.680
That's right.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.680
That is his name.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680
To me it is.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.680
Yeah.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.680
He's on because he's got some news about COVID.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.360
The historical had a lot of new information that just confirmed a lot of the older information.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:12:01.840
It's a breaking exclusive, thegatewaypundit.com, location of origin of COVID-19 pandemic identified

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.480
between two of China's biological warfare facilities in Wuhan.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.040
So this is apparently a situation where Jim Hoft's brothers learned that there was a cluster

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.760
of cases early of COVID-19 in an area that's geographically between the Wuhan Institute

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.120
of Virology and another lab in Wuhan.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.560
And thus, put those pieces together, man.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.560
Wait.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.560
It was in between the two?

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560
Yeah.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560
It was geographically in between the two.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560
Like on the street?

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.560
Yeah.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.560
It was just on the street.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.560
It was in a neighborhood.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.560
Oh, okay.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.040
See, what happened was, obviously, people were going back and forth between those labs.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.040
Sure.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.040
And they were coughing on people.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.040
Right.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.200
He's proved it.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.960
So the place they stopped for gas is where the COVID outbreak started.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.960
He's solved this case.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.960
Oh, okay.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.360
I gotta say, I gotta give it up to Jim Hoft's brother.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:52.640
Well, Jim Hoft's brother really, Agatha Christie'd this one to completion.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.360
I read the article on Gateway Ponder.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.840
Initially, I was just gonna dismiss this and be like, oh, fuck yourself, Jim Hoft's brother.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:04.500
But there's actually a really interesting piece in here that just demonstrates how these

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.120
people do their dirty work.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.400
Well, congratulations, Jim Hoft's brother.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:14.920
That area that's really, really dark where this signifies the most cases is between a

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.960
couple of biological warfare facilities.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.740
Editorializing there a little bit, maybe.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:27.040
He's describing a map where there is shaded clusters of where there were early instances

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.240
of COVID.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.620
One is the entity that we've talked about for a long time, maybe for...

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:39.200
We started reporting on this Wuhan Institute of Virology back in April last year.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.340
And where it looked like, yeah, this is what's going on.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.520
Wuhan was released from there.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:52.480
And then near that is another entity they're calling, that's labeled the Biological Preparations

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.560
Institute, BPI.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.260
It's the yellow square on that map.

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:06.440
And between these two facilities is where they're saying the initial cases, the large

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:12.380
number of initial cases were first identified.

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.380
How far away?

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:19.480
Giving us more, I guess, more evidence that this thing wasn't just something that was

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.480
natural.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.480
Is that more evidence?

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.320
That occurred in the food market, that red dot.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:30.320
No, the large number of cases comes between the black star there and the yellow box.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.840
So I've got some issues with this map.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.320
It's actually, I found this very fascinating.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.200
Is it the way that he's got a black box, a yellow square, and a red dot?

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.360
No, I mean, you got to have whatever as markers on a map.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.080
Well, I'm fine with that.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.320
My first issue is that there are four additional clusters of early cases that are nowhere near

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.560
either lab and at least 10 other reported infectors also outside the area that Jim Hoft's

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.300
brother is focusing on.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.960
In theory, it would be just as easy to argue that someone got infected in one of those

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.120
other clusters and brought the condition back to the neighborhood that Hoft is focusing

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.080
on from the information that he's providing.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.200
There's literally no way that he could prove otherwise.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:13.120
You bring in multiple points of fact that would undermine his argument, but on the other

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.640
hand, have you considered, don't worry about it?

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.080
No, I have not considered that.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.780
So the second major issue I have here is that the map is taken from a study in the International

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:26.800
Journal of Geo-Information, and it has to do with geographic data from a medical help-seeking

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.360
app called Weibo.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.560
The data isn't meant to be used in the way that Jim's brother is using it.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.000
It's misused data.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.440
Only on one app?

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:41.120
Yeah, it's tracking the people who reached out for help through this app, which I think

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.600
there's value to, obviously, as data points, but it's not for this.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.200
The third problem is that the map they're publishing on Gateway Pundit isn't the map

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.480
from that journal article, or at least it isn't the only one.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:58.560
The map that's closest to theirs is the one that depicts Weibo help-seekers prior to January

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.640
18th, 2020.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.080
Gateway Pundit doesn't include the subsequent maps depicting Weibo seekers from January

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:10.380
19th to 20th, which shows the distribution going way towards the areas nowhere near the

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:15.120
labs that they're focusing on, nor do they even bring up the map from January 21st to

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:20.600
22nd, which shows more of the same, shifting away from that hotspot that he decided to

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.760
cherry-pick data and just make his argument with.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:28.440
Okay, so then in this case, here's what I've got for you.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.440
Okay.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.720
So, some dudes?

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:38.000
Shuffling dangerous COVID back from lab to lab.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.200
They stop at a gas station, accidentally drop a vial, right?

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.200
It explodes.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.760
That causes problems.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.080
But that's a small outbreak.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.360
It's just one vial.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:51.480
So then they go to the other places, and that's where the big vials are tossed out of the

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.480
car.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.640
I mean, it's an interesting plot for a book or something, but I don't think this supports

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.640
it.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640
I've written it down.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.920
The final problem is that according to Google Maps, Jim Hough's brother has mislabeled the

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.420
map he published.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:09.280
It appears that that yellow square that he's talking about to signify the Biological Preparations

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.280
Institute?

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.280
Sure.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.960
That's actually the Biological Preparations Institute Marketing Center.

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:24.200
Well, they were trying to figure out how to advertise the pandemic, yeah, naturally.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.420
The actual Wuhan Biological Preparations Institute is about 25 kilometers south of where they

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:34.040
have it marked on the map, and if you actually use the correct location, there are no clusters

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040
right near it.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.840
I swear to God, I want to throw baseballs at these people.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.840
It's amazing.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.840
Really hard.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.640
Yeah, and it took a little while of looking at the map and asking myself questions about

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.380
like, what is this entity exactly?

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.520
Is this what they're saying it is?

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:56.000
And you know, it took a little while to unravel, but this is pretty basic stuff that they didn't

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.760
even consider, or they did consider and decided to lie about in service of making their argument.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:06.520
This is that one situation of, what's the name of those places where there's the institute

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:11.520
and the university or whatever, and they keep mixing them up?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520
The Tavistock Institute?

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.840
Yes, the Tavistock Institute, and yeah, it's the same thing where they just keep mixing

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.520
up the dumb stuff and they're like, nobody's ever going to follow up on this except for

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520
Dan.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:26.680
Well, but I also, I would fully think that it's a very good chance that they just didn't

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.680
even check.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.680
They just saw.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680
That's what I'm saying.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.680
Yeah.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.680
They don't even bother.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.680
Why would they?

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.760
Again, no one's going to follow up on this except Dan.

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:41.640
It's so sloppy and embarrassing that this is like Gateway Pundit's editorial, like that's

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:49.000
what's good enough to be put out as an exclusive and then come on Alex's show and ramble about

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
it.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.760
And even problems that I was able to find with the way they were using that map from

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:01.080
the journal itself to what they were doing, even if they did have the right location,

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.080
there were problems.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.080
Yeah.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.040
And the fact that that is a different location than they're pretending it is makes it just

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040
comical.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.040
It's farce.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.040
That's stupid.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.040
That's stupid.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040
Yeah.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040
So anyway, at that point I checked out.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040
You're like the Sigma-5 of propaganda.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.480
Like, you know how Sigma-5 scientists are like, there's a one in a million chance that we're

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.660
not 100% correct on this.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:24.160
You know, Sigma-3 is like one in a thousand or whatever.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.400
There's a point in propaganda where it's like, well, only Dan's going to care about this.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.400
So we're fine.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:33.440
And he might not if he doesn't accidentally get curious about it.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440
Yeah, exactly.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440
If we fly this one by Dan, we're golden.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.440
Yeah.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.440
Yeah.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.440
We can just make this boring enough.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.440
I know.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440
Have Jim Hoff's brother talk about it.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.440
Yeah.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.440
Sigma-4 is Dan and some other people.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.680
Sigma-3 is Dan and like the New York Times.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.560
I don't know, man.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.080
I unfortunately, you know, spent a little bit of time looking at that and it kind of

01:19:53.080 --> 01:20:01.440
burned me out a tiny bit between the like sort of just very constant and boring racism

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.400
and immigrant bashing.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.520
And then, you know, that I was just like, I'm out.

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:08.520
I'm out.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.360
And unfortunately that made me miss Roger Stone.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.920
He showed up in the fourth hour of the show.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.360
I don't usually watch the fourth hour because I completely missed it.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.800
Maybe we'll get it next week.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800
Who knows?

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.800
Probably not.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.800
Roger Stone's boring.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.800
He sucks.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.800
Yeah.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.800
He's boring now.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.800
Yeah.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.800
He doesn't do anything.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.000
I think ever since he got that pardon, he's just not the same.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Just not the same, man.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.480
Well, I mean, you know, I get it, right?

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.480
Like you've got all the adrenaline of like, am I going to go to jail?

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.480
Am I going to go to jail?

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.300
And then you get a pardon and you're like, well now what do I do?

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.200
It feels like the definition of once bitten, twice shy.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.200
Yeah.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.200
Yeah.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.200
Yeah.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.600
I'm not going to fuck around with needing a pardon again because I don't got a pardon

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.880
coming for the second one.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:52.280
I will try and get attention to myself as best I can and maybe do some publicity stunt

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280
things.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280
I need some money from people.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280
I'll be a shithead.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280
That'll be fine.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280
Yeah.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280
I'll have a good bone mow from time to time.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280
Sure.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280
Yeah.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280
I'll yell at Larry Klayman if I get a chance.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280
Not hard.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.280
Not hard to do.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.080
So yeah, I don't know.

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:10.000
I found this stretch.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.800
When I said at the beginning of the show, I was like, is there even value in talking

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:13.800
about it?

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:18.160
Well, part of the reason is because I don't think a lot of it brings much new to the table.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.160
True.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.600
I think with Jim Hoff's brother and talking about some of the specific instances of things

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:30.440
he brings up, maybe there's a little bit, but his coverage of, for instance, the shooting

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.560
is all in service of anti Muslim rhetoric.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.760
It's all in service of anti immigrant.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:41.880
There's nothing there that you don't see in the aftermath of so many other tragic events.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:48.160
If you look at Alex's coverage, there's just, and it kind of, I don't know.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.320
It makes me sad that you can just still get away with the same tricks.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320
Yeah.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.400
It is one of those things where sometimes we do an episode that I want in court as like,

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.560
this isn't a first amendment issue.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.720
This is malice.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.520
We can prove malice.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520
Listen to this shit.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.800
Now you're going to have to listen to about, I think about a thousand hours of knowledge

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.000
fight at this point.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.800
So strap in, but you'll get there and we'll get the conviction on this one.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.760
We'll get it.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.160
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.160
Indeed.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.160
We will, Dan.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.420
But until then we have a website.

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:24.420
We have a website.

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.420
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.420
Yes.

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.420
We're also on Twitter.

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.420
We are on Twitter.

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.420
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:30.420
And I go to bed Jordan.
