1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,200
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,200
fight, knowledge fight, I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,200
the bad guys, knowledge fight, Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight, Rattle Earth, Rattle Earth,

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Rattle Earth, need money, Rattle Earth, Rattle Earth, Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy, stop

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,200
it, Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy, it's time to pray, Andy and Kansas,

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Hello Alex, I'm a person calling with your Japan, I love your word, knowledge fight,

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,200
knowledge fight, knowledgefight.com, I love you.

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm Jordan.

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,200
We're a couple dudes, like sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Alex Jones.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Jordan.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Dan.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Jordan.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Quick question.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
What's up?

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
What's your bright spot today?

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
My bright spot today, Jordan, I think that one of the early bright spots when I moved

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,200
into this apartment was that I had a junk drawer.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Yes, that's true, yes.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,200
And to check back up on that, I'd like to make my bright spot today that I had my first

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
real junk drawer moment.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Where you were like, what the fuck did I put in here?

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
No, I was like, of course I've got AA batteries.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Oh no, not the junk drawer batteries moment.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
They've gotta be in there.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
You never win.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
I'm sure.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
You never win the batteries moment.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,200
So I was looking through the junk drawer and I found AAA batteries and no AA's it turns

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
out.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
You are issued AAA's whenever you move in somewhere and nothing fits AAA's.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,200
They always, like AAA's just come in a pack that's too big.

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
You don't need as many as you think you do.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Yeah, we'll give you 30 AAA's for one remote control.

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Yeah, I was going through there, there's like pencils, pens.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm like, oh, I got a deck of cards in here.

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
How about that?

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, why not?

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Great.

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
It's your old timey Batman forever deck of cards.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
You remember those?

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
It was a nice moment.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
It really felt like it's complete.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
You're home.

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
I don't know if I feel home, but the drawer is fun.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
That's fair enough.

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
How about you?

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Dan, my bright spot today is my support structure.

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,200
My partner and you and the many people who helped me.

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,200
It has been a very difficult few days between me and my brain.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,200
A week or so and not a good place to be.

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Sometimes my brain has been downright abusive towards me.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Sure.

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,200
So it is nice to have these amazing people in my life.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Spoiler alert for the audience.

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
I didn't talk to you at all yesterday.

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
No, I know.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
I don't know what I did.

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
You didn't do anything this year.

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Look, I mean, our employee boss relationship, I feel is strong.

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
A rump.

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,200
So it is nice to have that.

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
It's a huge bright spot for me because there have been times

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,200
in my life where that support structure was not around and

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
I was teetering on a knife's edge.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
So it is a huge bright spot.

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Well, I love you, buddy, and I'm glad that you're feeling

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
better now.

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
A little bit better, I assume.

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Let's do the show.

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Okay.

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,200
And to sort of reverse the sort of, just because I'm

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,200
uncomfortable by you saying such positive things, you know,

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
you've really helped me a lot too as a support structure.

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
So thank you.

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
It's great.

82
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
It's nice to be able to be in that position.

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Yeah, it's huge.

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Yeah.

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
So Jordan, today we are going to, this is sort of like what

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,200
we're doing today is also even kind of like my support.

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Okay.

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Self support.

89
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Okay.

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
All right.

91
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,200
As Open Mic Eagle would say, what the fuck is self care?

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
This may be self care for me.

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
And we'll get to it here in a moment.

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
But before we do, we've got to take a little moment to say

95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
hello and shout out to some new wonks.

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
So first, Jason B. also had a birthday recently.

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Thank you so much.

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
You are now a policy wonk.

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm a policy wonk.

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Thanks, Jason.

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
And happy birthday to you.

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Also, BB.

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Thank you so much.

104
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
You are now a policy wonk.

105
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Also, BB just had a birthday recently.

106
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Turned 20 years old.

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
How about that?

108
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Oh, my God.

109
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
You're too young to listen to this show.

110
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Do you remember being 20?

111
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Oh, man.

112
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't.

113
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I mean, I literally don't.

114
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Congratulations, BB.

115
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
You are now a policy wonk.

116
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm a policy wonk.

117
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Thank you, BB.

118
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Next, Jared spelled J-A-R-O-D.

119
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
BS.

120
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
That's two initials, not bullshit.

121
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
That's Jared B to the S.

122
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Yeah.

123
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
You're now a policy wonk.

124
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm a policy wonk.

125
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Thanks, Jared.

126
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Unclear when his birthday is.

127
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,200
If you are a policy wonk, please put your birthday in there just so we can give you

128
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
a happy birthday whether you like it or not.

129
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Next, greetings from the city formerly known as Portland's anarchist jurisdiction.

130
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Thank you so much.

131
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
You are now a policy wonk.

132
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm a policy wonk.

133
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Thank you very much.

134
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Yeah.

135
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
All of you, I suppose.

136
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Next, this is another person who had a birthday.

137
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
On the 23rd, just missed it.

138
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Oh, that's close, though.

139
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
But happy birthday, Cillian.

140
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,200
You are now a policy wonk, as well as Janie, who is also now a policy wonk.

141
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
But I don't know what Janie's birthday is.

142
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Anyway, Janie got in touch with us and wanted us to wish you a happy birthday, Cillian.

143
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Policy wonkery all around.

144
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm a policy wonk.

145
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Thank you very much to all of you.

146
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
And while we're here, Killian Murphy, too.

147
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I think he had a birthday sometime.

148
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
At some point.

149
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Yeah.

150
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
And finally, Prop Comic Sans, thank you so much.

151
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
You are now a policy wonk.

152
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm a policy wonk.

153
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Thank you very much.

154
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Prop Comic Sans.

155
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Good times.

156
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Yes.

157
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Now, Jordan, what we're doing today is...

158
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,200
I've got a question for you.

159
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
What's that?

160
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Do you like apples?

161
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Um...

162
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
So what do you think about them apples?

163
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Okay.

164
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
All right.

165
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Today, Jordan, what we got on our plate is I have found these old Alex Jones episodes.

166
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,200
I've found episodes dating back to 2003.

167
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
All right.

168
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
And I have...

169
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,200
So, how do you like them apples was relevant at the time, is what you're saying.

170
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Well, it was still out of date.

171
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It's a little bit late.

172
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
It's still out of date, but okay.

173
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I found episodes going back to 2003, and I find Alex almost insufferable and very boring

174
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
in the present day.

175
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah.

176
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
I don't want to ignore him in the present day, but I also don't want to be doing a show

177
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
that is constantly just looking at him in the present day.

178
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Yeah.

179
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Because I find that to be dumb.

180
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I think it's worthwhile as a sort of social thing.

181
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Totally.

182
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,200
But as an intellectual exercise, I don't really care all that much about listening to a guy

183
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
constantly say he's fighting the devil.

184
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Totally.

185
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
And then I'm supposed to take it seriously and be like, well, actually the devil started

186
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
as an idea.

187
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Right.

188
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Right.

189
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Right.

190
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I have no interest.

191
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,200
I imagine that the audience does get a little bit bored with, I didn't listen to the third

192
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
hour.

193
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
It was too boring.

194
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
So yeah.

195
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
And a lot of times I did listen to it and I just say, okay, who cares?

196
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
There's nothing in there.

197
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Get the fuck out of here.

198
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Yeah.

199
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
We will obviously still be talking about the present day, but for today I needed to go

200
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
back as far back as I could.

201
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,200
So today we are going to be talking about May 1st, 2003.

202
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Ooh.

203
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Is that when Christopher Lloyd guested?

204
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
No.

205
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Christopher Lloyd, no guests on this episode.

206
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
No guests.

207
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Okay.

208
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
This episode is amazing for a number of reasons.

209
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,200
There's a couple of things that blew my mind.

210
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Okay.

211
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I am convinced I'm a witch now.

212
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
All right.

213
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:39,200
And also I just, I, it's, it's a new day.

214
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,200
It's a new day from 20 years ago.

215
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I find myself like getting these reinvigorations through like whenever I can find these old

216
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
time frames to look back on.

217
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,200
It really is recharging of my batteries and it's, it's, it's man.

218
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
I like it.

219
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,200
So Jordan, we start May 1st, 2003.

220
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Do you remember 2003 much?

221
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Do you remember what was going on in May?

222
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,200
No, I told you, I don't remember.

223
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
The Iraq war had just ended.

224
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Oh boy.

225
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Did we just mission accomplish?

226
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
That was that day.

227
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
That was that day.

228
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
You are a witch.

229
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
May 1st.

230
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
You are a witch.

231
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,200
May 1st, 2003 was the day that George Bush landed on the, uh, the aircraft carrier with

232
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
the mission accomplished banner.

233
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
VI day as we all know it now.

234
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Yes.

235
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Victory was upon us.

236
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Um, and so, Hey, here's Alex and the, we're going to find out a number of things.

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Some of the things that are really interesting to me and I'm most excited to learn about

238
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,200
are things like how is Alex Jones's opposition to Bush and the Iraq war?

239
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
How does it exist when Bush is in office?

240
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Right.

241
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
How can we look at that through the prism of history in the context of knowing how he

242
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,200
behaves in more generally as a pattern, how can we apply that to this source of material?

243
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
And so it's interesting anyway.

244
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I believe you.

245
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Did you know that the new world order has a plan?

246
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,200
It's how many years behind 18 years ago, it's coming into play.

247
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Okay.

248
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:21,200
We are now following the exact model used by dictators to intensify their hold on population

249
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
on populations.

250
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Whether it was bill Clinton or George W. Bush, the agenda of the new world order is spiraling

251
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
out of control.

252
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Years ago, I read a Pensacola news journal article that is on info wars.com.

253
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
And one of our press releases about how during a red alert, you won't be able to leave your

254
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
house and have any rights.

255
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:51,200
You have a link to it in that story, the Marines took over the school and announced, this is

256
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Marshall law.

257
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Bill Clinton wants you to know what Marshall law is about.

258
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Bill Clinton wants you to know what Marshall law is about.

259
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I don't care.

260
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Immediately.

261
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm listening to this and I'm like, this dude is doing a voice.

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Yeah.

263
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I, I wanted to, I wanted to, he's performing.

264
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,200
This is so weird because I was, I was literally writing down, like, I don't know how to describe

265
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
it, but he sounds fatter.

266
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I think it has something to do with the way he's filling up his arms with air.

267
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I think he's doing a bit of a rush Limbaugh impression.

268
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Oh yeah, totally.

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
And I think that rush Limbaugh has a sound better.

270
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah.

271
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I, I, it's just, it's remarkable.

272
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It sounds like a guy who thinks he's, you know, he knows he's doing radio totally.

273
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
And, uh, God, it just, it's refreshing.

274
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Somebody trying.

275
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
It's amazing.

276
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
But apparently the, the globalist plan was falling apart back then to constantly falling

277
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
apart.

278
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
It's like when you're, it's like when you're on a ship, you're constantly rebuilding the

279
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
ship as you sail.

280
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
That's how it's always worked.

281
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Is it?

282
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeah.

283
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Oh, I don't want to sail.

284
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Don't sail.

285
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
It's really hard.

286
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
So I can't find the original article that Alex is talking about from the Pensacola news

287
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,200
journal, nor can I find articles about it on info wars and their archives.

288
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,200
However, I did find a geo cities level website that's copied and pasted what's supposedly

289
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
this article.

290
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
So I'm going to go off of that.

291
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Okay.

292
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Reading the article, you can tell that what was going on there was a situation where this

293
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200
school called Hobbs middle school, it was part of a partnership with Whiting field,

294
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Naval air station.

295
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
And, uh, the, uh, enlisted people coming to the school.

296
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
It was part of them volunteering to help teach for a day.

297
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Yeah.

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
They did this very basic presentation as if the military was in charge of the school to

299
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
help the students better understand the issues that were facing the civilians in Kosovo at

300
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,200
the time, as is clearly laid out as being effective in the article quote, one of Whitfield

301
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,200
students, Julie McCool said the presence of the military personnel in her school made

302
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,200
the news she'd been watching from Yugoslavia seem a little more real.

303
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Sure.

304
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Which is great.

305
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
It achieves an impactful lesson for the students.

306
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I mean, personally, I don't think any military should go anywhere near a middle school, but

307
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
that's, that's just me.

308
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
I mean, I assume that they weren't like, Hey, let's become fascist, but you know, what are

309
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
you going to do?

310
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Right.

311
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I mean, the idea of making the news real, uh, or helping the students understand it.

312
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Totally.

313
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
There's a value to that.

314
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Totally.

315
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,200
If you were growing as far as like hitting the kids with the butt of a gun, then I'm

316
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
out.

317
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Yeah.

318
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
I don't want to, I mean, I, yeah.

319
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,200
And I think that there also to sort of what you're saying, I think that, you know, I wouldn't

320
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,200
be in favor of things that are basically like PR work for the armed forces directed at schools.

321
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
That would kind of be a huge thing for me.

322
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I don't like that.

323
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I've been a Miyazaki fan for a long time and the military teaching children it's okay to

324
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
be in the military is a big deal.

325
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I, from, from the article I, what I was getting from it is not so much that they were teaching,

326
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,400
uh, that it's cool to be in the military, but it still has the effect of rubbing off

327
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,200
and like maybe turning these people into icons that you look up to.

328
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Totally.

329
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Yeah.

330
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,200
I can also see though, like how this kind of an activity could be a really positive,

331
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
uh, as an educational tool for the students.

332
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
So I'm kind of, I don't really have a position on it.

333
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
On the one hand, it could have the effect of making these youths think that the army

334
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
is super cool, but on the other hand, it also has the potential to open up the students

335
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
to things they wouldn't have the chance to experience otherwise.

336
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,200
For instance, from this article quote, last year, students from Hobbs and SS Dixon primary

337
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
school communicated via email with a coast guard Lieutenant on a cruise bound for the

338
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,200
South Pole and had a video teleconference with their friend once she got there.

339
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
That could be a really neat opportunity for students to learn directly about all sorts

340
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,200
of things in a way that's much more real than reading about the South Pole in a book.

341
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
And that could be a positive thing.

342
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Yeah, sure.

343
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
What's it like on the boat?

344
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Have you ever seen a man die?

345
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
We have to keep rebuilding.

346
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
You've never seen a man die before.

347
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I've seen two men die in my arms.

348
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Also, it's important-

349
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I don't know where that voice came from.

350
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
That was a weird voice.

351
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Yeah, that was a weird voice.

352
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
My bad.

353
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
That's a 2003 voice.

354
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Sorry about that.

355
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Also, it's important to keep in mind that these are middle school students.

356
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I would be opposed to this being done with an elementary school since I don't know how

357
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
well second graders could process any of this.

358
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Totally.

359
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
That's how you get Alex Jones.

360
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Yeah, but by middle school, the kids should be exactly at the point where this could be

361
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
a great experience for them.

362
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,200
They're not too young to process it and not too old to think that it's really dumb once

363
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
they're in high school.

364
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

365
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Yeah.

366
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,400
I think this is an article from March 1999, so it's nice to see that even in 2003, Alex

367
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,920
doesn't deal with new news.

368
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,440
I kind of was thinking it's 2003 and we're listening about Clinton and Kosovo, and while

369
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,200
I do think that that is a very important historical thing for us to learn, it's the Iraq War!

370
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah.

372
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,520
And if you're talking about militarization of police post 9-11, obviously, certainly

373
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,260
a topic worth conversing about, but if one of the things that you're leading the show

374
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,840
with is like the military coming into a school in Pensacola, like that was pre-9-11.

375
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

376
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
You just need to, there's better ways to do this.

377
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,640
You used to be able to just walk on a plane.

378
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,080
Whenever the military was at this school, you could walk onto a plane.

379
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Yeah.

380
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Yeah.

381
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,600
So that story from the past is being woven in with a new headline Alex has read about.

382
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,520
Now I have this article, Fox News.

383
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Young Marines teach kids discipline integrity, and it turns out it's an anti-drug, anti-gun

384
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,120
program, and they teach the kids if they join the globalists they get to have guns, if not,

385
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
it's over.

386
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,080
It's all part of pure evil.

387
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,880
So this doesn't really relate at all.

388
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,420
No, it doesn't sound like it.

389
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,540
That four-year-old story was about a day when military, uh, volunteers, they created an

390
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,880
educational experience at a middle school.

391
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,160
This is more or less just a press release about a youth program run by former Marines.

392
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,400
The Young Marines is basically a more discipline-focused version of the Scouts, and it's run by the

393
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,360
Marine Corps League, which is a social organization for former Marines.

394
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,260
They basically put kids in boot camp-like conditions and have them eat MREs in order

395
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,320
to build strength and discipline.

396
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,240
From everything I can tell, it's definitely an anti-drug program, but I did not get the

397
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,440
sense that it's anti-gun.

398
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,300
I would have hated being in this group, and I think it seems kind of fucked up, but the

400
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,560
only way anyone's going to go to it is if they and their parents agree to take part

401
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,760
in it, so I'm not going to spend too much time complaining about their choices.

402
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
Yeah, you guys do what you do.

403
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,920
I don't have time for it.

404
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,640
The Iraq War is just going on.

405
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,200
It's frankly, the Iraq War is just beginning.

406
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,040
When that Mission Accomplished sign up was the beginning of the Iraq War.

407
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,240
No it did not.

408
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,680
No it did not.

409
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,040
That was way back when.

410
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,920
Oh man, we really thought we were going to get out of there, Dan.

412
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,320
I don't know if I thought that back then.

413
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,520
I absolutely did not.

414
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,060
I thought these guys were going to fuck everything up and we were all going to die.

415
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,520
So Alex is above the political divide, the left-right paradigm.

416
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Sure.

417
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
All this stuff.

418
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Talking about Clinton in 2003.

419
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,800
He's above the left-right paradigm.

420
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
48's Bush too.

421
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
True.

422
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
Now, here's where things get a little muddy.

423
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,960
Oh, I got news of conservative states gun-grabbing all across the country.

424
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:11,880
Wait until you hear about this, again, conservatism now is a byword for big government, no freedom,

425
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
condoms, abortion, everything.

426
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Everything?

427
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:22,640
They are ultra-liberals, they are winning the war, destroying America because the liberals

428
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,800
learned how to dress up like conservatives.

429
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,680
It happened, folks, it happened.

430
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,520
It's pretty illuminating to me because it's really the core of Alex's fake presentation

431
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,600
of being above two-party shit.

432
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,220
He's presenting a position where the conservatives out there are actually secret liberals, which

433
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,880
is why the two parties don't matter, because they're both not far enough to the right.

434
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,720
Therefore they're actually the same thing.

435
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,440
That's what his being above the two-party system is.

436
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,880
Yeah, I'm above the two-party system because I want to destroy them and institute a theocracy.

437
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,600
What don't you understand?

438
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,720
It would be fine for Alex to just openly advocate that he feels alienated by politics because

439
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,960
he's way far to the right of anything that exists in polite society.

440
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,340
But even in 2003, he knows that's not going to appeal to a wide audience, so he plays

441
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,060
the game of being like, oh, the left and the right is a lie, and you know why?

442
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,920
If you actually are conservative, you've got to be an extremist to the right because these

443
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,760
really hardcore right-wing people are actually secret liberals.

444
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,440
That makes sense.

446
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,640
Great.

447
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:33,580
So, at this point, there was talk of the need for the provisional government in Iraq sorting

448
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:40,140
out how to set up a system there once we were to withdraw, which as we know from living

449
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,520
in 2021 didn't go great.

450
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:49,480
Well, it turns out that crony capitalism combined with colonialism does not work out well for

451
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
anyone.

452
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Isn't that crazy?

453
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:01,440
U.S. reported to push for Iraqi government with Pentagon prevailing, and they are appointing

454
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,840
the members of the Ba'ath Party, the torture lords and others trained in the U.S. in the

455
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,800
80s and the 70s, all CIA, of course.

456
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,680
They are another easy victory for them.

457
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,800
They're going to be running things.

458
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,160
And we'll get to that for you as well.

459
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,280
I don't know how to read Alex's tone there.

460
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,600
I really don't know what, he's being facetious, or?

461
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Yeah, I was going to say.

462
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,160
There's kind of a smugness to it more than a facetiousness.

463
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,720
I mean, they hadn't really announced de-Ba'athification at that time, did they?

464
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
That's what I'm talking about.

465
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Did they?

466
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
No, no.

467
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
It's a couple weeks after this.

468
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Oh yeah, that's what I was saying.

469
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,240
But yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.

470
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,880
I was like, does Alex not know that that's a major thing that ends up happening?

471
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,880
And it's a major thing that ends up contributing to the massive destabilization in Iraq.

472
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,240
So is he being facetious in such a way that these idiots are trying to get rid of the

473
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,040
Ba'ath Party, or is he actually thinking that the Ba'ath Party is what's going to continue

474
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
going on?

475
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,760
Well, I think that based on the context that I've gleaned from listening to the rest of

476
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,640
this episode, I believe that Alex thinks that the CIA is running the Ba'ath Party and all

477
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,440
the people with Saddam and all this, like Saddam was allowed to get away to some island

478
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
somewhere.

479
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Okay, okay.

480
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,000
How did that work out?

481
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
How did that prediction work out?

482
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Didn't go great.

483
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Didn't go great?

484
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Didn't end up correct.

485
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,800
He was in a hole.

486
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,920
But he, Alex, I think he thinks that the Ba'ath Party loyalists and folks who the CIA were

487
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,400
trained up and all this will pretend that they weren't part of the Ba'ath Party or whatever,

488
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,160
and then they will become the people who are the puppets for the US within Iraq moving

489
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
forward.

490
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,880
Okay, so he didn't assume that the CIA would betray them like they always do?

491
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,240
I think that that's where he's going.

492
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,320
And that actually is one of the things that I, when I was listening to this, I'm like,

493
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,800
that's actually something I really want to track.

494
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,560
I'm interested to see how Alex's tone goes during the Ba'athification.

495
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,420
Yeah, that is interesting.

496
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,360
Because should he be for or against it?

497
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
I don't know.

498
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,480
That's a really good question.

499
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,760
That requires a nuance that Alex is absolutely incapable of now.

500
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,120
2003, Alex, I think is still incapable of it, but I'm interested to find out.

501
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,800
Because at this point, it seems like he's opposed based on this to the Ba'ath Party

502
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,600
members being allowed in the government.

503
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Yes, right.

504
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,200
But then, based on his political ideology, he should be super against how the blanket

505
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,520
banning of Ba'ath Party members from all sorts of positions of influence went down.

506
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Yeah.

507
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,440
It just seems like he can't possibly be for either.

508
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Yeah.

509
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,080
What would, what could possibly, oh, oh, I know what could, the only thing that Alex

510
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,400
could be for is like, we forced all of them to believe in Jesus as their Lord and Savior

511
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
now.

512
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm not coming at this with too much of a 2021 Alex Jones.

513
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,640
You're right, but I'm bitter and angry.

514
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
What am I supposed to do, Dan?

515
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,360
I understand, but we have to look at this through, like, obviously you can't have perfectly

516
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
naive eyes.

517
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Sure.

518
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,600
But you have to, you have to look at this as like a different, a different time frame.

519
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,800
As a different person.

520
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
It's a different person.

521
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Well, it's the same person.

522
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Well, it's the same person.

523
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
And you'll see a lot of similarities.

524
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,600
Okay, well see, now this is why I'm bitter and angry.

525
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Sure.

526
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Yeah.

527
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,800
One of the things I noticed while I was listening to this is that he is definitely way more

528
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,440
doing a radio show and he goes to calls and then he'll get back to a story and then later

529
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
get back to some calls.

530
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,240
Like he jumps around like a lot of normal talk radio shows do.

531
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
It's a radio show.

532
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,040
And he, he's just doing a fucking rush impression.

533
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,760
Like this is outrageous.

534
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,440
You go to places where you can't go and buy a gun and have one in your house legally and

535
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
lawfully.

536
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
You got a lot of crime.

537
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Crime!

538
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,000
Now that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen, that cannot be ignored or avoided.

539
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,200
And we know that when a state has a low threshold of gun control, where you have more liberty

540
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,880
and some semblance of a second amendment left, you have the lowest crime rates.

541
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:09,000
Because even a crackhead or junkie won't invade your home when you're there because they know

542
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,600
there's a 50-50 chance they're going to get killed.

543
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,200
So I just, I heard that and I was just like, this is just Alex doing an impression of right-wing

544
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
talk.

545
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
That's not Alex.

546
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
That's brutal.

547
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Yeah.

548
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
And that sort of more guns is less crime kind of thing.

549
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,000
That's a talking point we've covered exhaustively because he talks about it all the time throughout

550
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
all of his career.

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah.

552
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's not true.

553
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,560
But when I was listening to this, I felt like I can see how someone would hear that and

554
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
believe it.

555
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Yeah.

556
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,560
And it kind of intuitively makes sense that why, if I were a criminal, why would I risk

557
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,840
going somewhere where someone has a gun as opposed to somewhere where someone doesn't

558
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
have a gun?

559
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Sure.

560
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
That makes intuitive sense.

561
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,400
And if you have someone like Alex saying this authoritatively and almost sort of mocking

562
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,920
the alternative, why wouldn't you just assume, why this guy knows what he's talking about?

563
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
It makes sense.

564
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Yeah.

565
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,880
But you know, sometimes intuitive things are incorrect and this is one of them.

566
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Yeah.

567
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,160
And I mean, it's the same way that people think about the death penalty of like, well,

568
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:13,000
if the consequence is so high, then that should act as a deterrent in the same, you know,

569
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,480
it's it makes sense to the macro where it's like, well, obviously we're not getting into

570
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,960
a nuclear war because of mutually assured destruction.

571
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,320
So that's a deterrent against doing that.

572
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,720
But they, you know, you're fucking hungry, man.

573
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,200
You know, like that's, that's a bigger deal than whether or not you're researching the

574
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,920
possibility that this home you need to do it, you know, like that kind of thing.

575
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Yeah.

576
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
It doesn't make sense in the micro level.

577
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
No.

578
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Yeah.

579
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
That's a, that's a good way to put it.

580
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Yeah.

581
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,920
So, uh, George Bush, how would you describe his politics like on the spectrum of right

582
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
to left?

583
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:55,560
Um, ooh boy, I would put him in the, the, the like, not far right, not center, right.

584
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,160
That sweet spot of like, yeah, I want to kill everybody, but I want them to think I'm nice

585
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,240
while I do it.

586
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,200
Would you call him conservative?

587
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,800
Uh, compared to now?

588
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Yes.

589
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,880
Well, you're wrong on all counts.

590
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Oh, okay.

591
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Bush isn't conservative.

592
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,440
His cabinet isn't conservative.

593
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,400
They are the most socialistic creatures ever seen in U S history, but they're just puppets

594
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,040
carrying out the agenda.

595
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,220
If you had Al Gore in office, things would be worse than it was under Clinton and whoever's

596
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,560
in office next, it's going to be worse than under George W because of their puppets, their

597
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
front man.

598
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Yeah.

599
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
So he's a super socialist.

600
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Yeah.

601
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
He's a super socialist.

602
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,600
He's the most socialistic creature in history and all of Bush's cabinet too.

603
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Okay.

604
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
All right.

605
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
All right.

606
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,680
Uh, Oh boy, that's not good.

607
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
That cabinet.

608
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,920
See now that's, that's a cabinet filled with pure psychopaths.

609
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,760
That's the thing about George W. Bush.

610
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,680
I don't think he gave a shit.

611
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,800
I think he just filled this cabinet with a shit ton of psychopaths who wanted to murder.

612
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,160
Let's see if we can surround this team.

613
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,720
Just get it full of weirdos.

614
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Yeah.

615
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,640
Four out of at least at least four of the people in George Bush's cabinet had personally

616
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,720
strangled a person, you know, like that kind of level of psychopathy excited to see the

617
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,600
2004 election happen.

618
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,800
Anyway, this next clip I think is, is, is wild because Alex is talking about how he

619
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,080
doesn't feel bad for Saddam, which obviously I guess that means that he doesn't feel bad

620
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,720
that Saddam's missing or out of power.

621
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,440
It's hard to feel bad for Saddam, but Alex, based on things he says later, I think he

622
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,620
thinks he's on an Island somewhere.

623
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,320
So I mean, obviously don't feel bad for him.

624
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,000
Well, I mean, it's not like Saddam was Napoleon where they're like, okay, we got to exile

625
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
you.

626
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,680
That's our solution to this problem.

627
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,160
And then Alex gives a voice to some stuff that I can actually get, you know, appreciate

628
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,120
that is that he feels bad for the citizens in Iraq, the people in the, on the ground

629
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,360
who are being affected by this stuff.

630
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,620
But if you pay attention to this, this, this is one of these indications that you can get

631
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,160
that Alex, even this empathetic kind of vibe that seems really grounded and decent is actually

632
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,160
rooted in just fervent anti-government sentiment.

633
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,560
Of course, Saddam is a bucket of trash, of course, he's evil.

634
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,060
The CIA hired him folks in 58 as a hit man, told him to invade Kuwait.

635
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,880
I mean, yeah, he's a bad guy, folks.

636
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,540
So I'm not sad for Saddam.

637
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,040
I am sad for the Iraqi people that are being mowed down in large piles by the hundreds.

638
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,200
If they dare to protest and one child throws a rock, I am sad for the US citizen, the young

639
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,300
college girl unarmed, run over by a bulldozer.

640
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:51,560
He then savagely backed back over her in the giant armored army bulldozer.

641
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,200
I am sad for the AP and Reuters cameramen that are being shot by Israeli snipers in

642
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,480
the head as they wear vests that say press.

643
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,600
I am sad for the police officers killed by their own SWAT team members.

644
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,480
I am sad for the people being shot down by corrupt cops and having guns planted on them.

645
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,680
I am sad, ladies and gentlemen, for the people being abused by government worldwide.

646
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,960
It's all in service of just strong anti-government positions.

647
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,760
Yeah, I don't see him caring as much now about the hundreds of millions that were slaughtered

648
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,100
by the United States government.

649
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,840
But you know, what are you going to do?

650
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,560
No, I can't expect him to continue caring about these people.

651
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,920
It's over after today.

652
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,600
Yeah, and that's part of the reason that I think it's really interesting, because he's

653
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,760
saying a lot of the things that are right, but it doesn't feel like it comes from a place

654
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,120
of any solid center to it.

655
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,400
It doesn't feel like it's based on intrinsic belief as much as it is on... well, I guess

656
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,360
it is, but the intrinsic belief is opposition to government.

657
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,200
I'm a little bit taken aback because it seems like I want to say that this is a slicker

659
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
show already.

660
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
A little bit.

661
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,840
I mean, that's because I was just completely out of control in the present day.

662
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,880
Exactly, but it's hard to like, oh, well, see, just because he's...

663
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,800
I would say it's almost more disingenuous by being a slicker show.

664
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,360
Yeah, I agree with that, and I think that that's part of the reason why I feel reinvigorated

665
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,320
by this, because I can see how someone would believe it.

666
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,740
I can see how someone listening to a clip like that could be like, yeah, this guy gets

667
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
it.

668
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
He does get it.

669
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,060
That is fucked up that US troops are killing civilians overseas.

670
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,160
That is fucked up.

671
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:52,080
And that is the way that Alex baits the hook to get people to fall into his anti-government

672
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
shit.

673
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Totally.

674
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
No, it seems reasonable.

675
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
It's fascinating.

676
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:07,920
It's so disingenuous and so evil, just evil, you know, to hide your like, I'm a Joan Bircher

677
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,040
behind like, hey, it's wrong to kill civilians, because his answer is, yeah, it's wrong to

678
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,920
kill civilians until I want to.

679
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,760
You know, it's that kind of situation.

680
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,720
And he just leaves out that last part, which in the present day, he kind of leaves it in.

681
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,160
Yeah, he mostly leaves it in.

682
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,120
Yeah, he mostly leaves it in now.

683
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,360
So we'll get to a lot more of this like overt trickery, because I think you see some pretty

684
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,240
stark examples of it later on.

685
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,020
And actually, the John Birch Society comes up later in an interesting way.

686
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,480
But before we get there, Alex has another headline.

687
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:49,360
This is about Tom Ridge, Homeland Security, wanting to institute an ID system for livestock

688
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:58,240
due to a concern largely about the vulnerabilities within the food chain, the ability to know

689
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,760
if there's a diseased cattle somewhere that causes blah, blah, blah.

690
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,360
So Alex reads this headline, and apparently it's all about like more taxes or something.

691
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,800
Ridge favors national ID system for livestock.

692
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,980
Do you know how bad this is?

693
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:18,680
A whole layer of government bureaucracy in your life, harassing you, taxing you, oh yes,

694
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,600
a whole new bureaucracy knowing everything you've got.

695
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:30,640
Your cats, your dogs will be pigs, sheep, goats, cows, horses, a whole layer of tax.

696
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,880
You'll have a registration fee every year on your animal.

697
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,480
Why don't you keep the homeland and the food supply safe?

698
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,040
Seems to be mocking the idea of protecting the food supply.

699
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,440
Now that's interesting, because that does fit the tone of some of the rest of his coverage

700
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,600
throughout the show.

701
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,940
But what it doesn't fit is the tone of one of his commercials.

702
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
Are you prepared?

703
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,800
Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.

704
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,480
Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for

705
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
America.

706
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,960
Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.

707
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,360
An attack on our food supply would be devastating.

708
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,120
Jerry Guadetti from the ARC Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility

709
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
for years.

710
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,240
Yeah, so it's so weird.

711
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,720
Okay, all right.

712
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,280
I can see how conflicting messages would cause problems for early listeners to the show.

713
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,300
I was listening to this and it seemed very bizarre.

714
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:27,640
It's like, okay, your editorial's out of sync with your advertising at this point.

715
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,780
That's why you're not raking in the cash.

716
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
That could be an issue.

717
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Yeah.

718
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,780
That could be a problem.

719
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
Very weird.

720
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,920
Ted Anderson is still selling crap to his show.

721
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,800
That's a survival seed company, so obviously it would be in their best interest from an

722
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:49,520
advertising perspective to drum up the fears of the damage to the food chain and the food

723
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
supply.

724
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,840
Meanwhile, Alex has an interest politically in painting that as more government and more

725
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
taxes.

726
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Of course.

727
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
They're going to tax your cat.

728
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,400
He says, loving ice.

729
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,340
So I don't know, man.

730
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,000
When you were in school, do you like playing games at recess?

731
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah.

732
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Did you ever play foursquare?

733
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Sure.

734
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Foursquare was great.

735
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,760
No black magic, no cherry bombs.

736
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,240
No black magic.

737
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,340
If you threw a cherry bomb, you're out.

738
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,880
You're kicked out because then you have to chase after the ball.

739
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,080
I don't even remember what any of that means, but I remember exhaustive conversations.

740
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,680
There were a lot of rules.

741
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,860
That was the beginning of when you first find out about the kid who's like, oh no, he's

742
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,360
going to take his ball, isn't he?

743
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
He's going to take his ball.

744
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
Oh shit.

745
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
Now we don't know how.

746
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Now we have nothing to play with.

747
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,560
I remembered the conversation of rules more than I remember foursquare itself.

748
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Totally.

749
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Well, here's the good news.

750
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,880
Foursquare is still legal.

751
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,600
However, dodge ball has been banned.

752
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
All over?

753
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,200
Maybe you haven't heard, but it's been on television.

754
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,560
I know schools right here in Texas, parents right here in Texas that have called in on

755
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
the show about it.

756
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,360
It's been in the news.

757
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,520
Dodge ball has been banned almost nationwide.

758
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,400
I remember our favorite game.

759
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,720
In fact, the girls, the, you know, the kids that weren't that big, the runts, everybody

760
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
loved dodge ball.

761
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,200
I mean, everybody would hooray to play it.

762
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Everyone loved it.

763
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,720
And you know, if somebody didn't like it, that's the way sports are.

764
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,840
That's the way PE should be when you're six years old, seven year old, eight year old,

765
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,960
10, 12, usually play, I guess when you're about 10 or 12, they banned it.

766
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,320
And then I read a report about a month ago where they arrested kids, two or three of

767
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,720
them, criminal charges of assault because they would meet before school.

768
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,160
I remember doing stuff like this, but we would, we would wrestle, we would wrestle and knock

769
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,880
our teeth out and break our noses and the coaches would come around and go, you guys

770
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
watch it.

771
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
You're going to get hurt.

772
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,160
Do that on the mats with your head gear.

773
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Get in here.

774
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,720
I'm giving you a SWAT.

775
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:04,680
You know, you'd, they'd take you to the nurse and fix your lip and you'd get a pop for wrestling

776
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
without head gear.

777
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,880
But the point is now the kids will secretly get behind the school with their dodge balls.

778
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,960
Just a little bit of freedom.

779
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:21,800
I can't find any stories about students getting arrested for pre-school hours, dodge ball

780
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
games.

781
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,200
That's such a, I hate those.

782
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,740
I hate that shit so much.

783
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:32,560
Like one, it seems silly now not to realize that dodge ball at that age is essentially

784
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,720
a way to facilitate bullying.

785
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Yes.

786
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,280
It's like, I'm happy playing a dodge ball as an adult.

787
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
That makes perfect sense.

788
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,400
We all know the game.

789
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,320
We're all doing a great job as a kid.

790
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,240
You're just like so many guys just picked on the smallest, like Alex is like, everybody

791
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,400
loved to play the game.

792
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,520
He wasn't the runt.

793
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Yeah.

794
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:59,400
I think it is a game that can get abusive and I understand people not wanting to play

795
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,320
it and they shouldn't be forced to play it.

796
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Totally not.

797
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,480
But I guess if people want to play during recess, I don't, I don't believe, I can't,

798
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,880
I don't believe that it's been banned almost nationwide.

799
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,500
There aren't arrests happening if you play dodge ball, but I do think it's interesting

800
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,520
the different way that Alex is talking about his school days violence here in 2003, very

801
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,080
less dark, much less dark.

802
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,480
At no point in time did I hear him say he stomped a guy's guts out.

803
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,320
Yeah, no, if we take the present day understanding of Alex's former violent tendencies where

804
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,920
he murdered a couple people.

805
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah.

806
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
A little bit different.

807
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,040
It seems weird that he'd be sitting here in 2003 laughing whimsically about.

808
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Come on.

809
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,120
We used to have little scrapes back in the day.

810
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,240
Now granted I murdered.

811
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,440
I did kill him.

812
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,960
I did kill him.

813
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,800
I hate those fucking stories so much of like, Oh, when I grew up, we used to go out back

814
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,640
and we'd get hit with a switch if we got in trouble and we turned out fine.

815
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,360
And you're like, you guys are all legitimately insane.

816
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,400
Everything you believe is nonsense.

817
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,360
You did not turn out fine.

818
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,200
Do not tell me that story and then not connect it to your violent present.

819
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,140
And that's why they're banning dodge ball.

820
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,140
Of course.

821
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,240
Now, do you think anyone has been arrested for this is going to, this is, this is a trivia

822
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,120
question that is a very important, all right.

823
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,480
Do you think anyone's been arrested for musical chairs?

824
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
Yes, absolutely.

825
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,880
30 to 40 people at a time daily.

826
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
You've probably heard.

827
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,640
They're making a musical chairs.

828
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,080
You can't play musical chairs.

829
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,560
Now there haven't been a rest made for musical chairs for secretly playing dodge ball or

830
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
tag.

831
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
I forgot.

832
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,520
Tag too has been banned.

833
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Tag you get arrested for playing tag.

834
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,400
Then why the hell did you bring?

835
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Bring up tag!

836
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
You did!

837
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Yeah, I know.

838
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
But why did you bring?

839
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,320
No arrests for musical chairs.

840
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,320
I would like statistics on that.

841
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,200
Does the FBI publish musical chairs related arrests?

842
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Yeah, it's from the Bureau of Statistics.

843
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,280
Does the ATF also take care of that?

844
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Yeah.

845
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
I don't know.

846
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,800
I mean, I feel like as I recall musical chairs can get a little bit physical, but it's not

847
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,120
supposed to.

848
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,560
Like if some kid is fighting with somebody over a chair, that's a behavioral issue.

849
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,280
Everybody goes, okay, well we gotta deal with this now.

850
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
This was unintended.

851
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,720
This is not part of the game.

852
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,740
So Alex is pretty deep into a conversation about what you can and can't do at schools

853
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,360
and how the government is cracking down.

854
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Oh, that government.

855
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,120
Now they have gone too far.

856
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
Well here it is.

857
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,440
Banned on campus, boys talking to girls, World Net Daily, elementary students protest restriction

858
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,320
after showing public signs of affection, sixth grade girls protest, photo heralded news newspaper,

859
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,440
and it shows dozens of young sixth grade girls with signs saying, allow us to talk to boys.

860
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,760
Smiling, attack on the shoulder, could lead to criminal charges.

861
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,300
Okay, everything's criminal now.

862
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,000
So that's a good story.

863
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,280
How are we still doing this?

864
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,240
So this is a story out of Portland, a Peterson Elementary School in specific.

865
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,800
What happened was that there was a teacher at the school who witnessed some non-specified

866
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,160
public displays of affection at recess and decided as a preventative measure that they

867
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,960
needed to disallow girls and boys from talking during recess.

868
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,620
Obviously this is taking things a little bit far, but also Alex is completely blowing this

869
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,720
story out of proportion, pretending that if a boy talked to a girl he'd get arrested on

870
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,600
criminal charges.

871
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,160
That's totally made up, because I suspect even Alex knows that talking about this story

872
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,800
on the merits of it might come off as a little desperate in terms of trying to make your

873
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
audience outraged.

874
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Little silly.

875
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,820
Honestly, he's missing the forest for the trees here, and there's a much, much better

876
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,240
story to be told.

877
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,080
That is the story of Sarah Maines and Hannah Guerrero, two 12-year-old girls at the school

878
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,920
who took issue with the rule that got made and protested against it.

879
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,000
Sarah and Hannah straight up formed a student committee, studied the school's rules, and

880
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,720
figured out the proper steps to get a complaint heard.

881
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,660
They got all the protesting student's parents to sign off on letting them demonstrate, then

882
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,520
held a protest to have their complaint heard.

883
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,500
Sarah's mother puts it so well in this article from the Herald and News, quote, I'm so proud

884
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
of my daughter.

885
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,720
The hardest part was to walk into that school after protesting like that.

886
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,880
She stood up for herself.

887
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,360
I think she learned something important.

888
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,560
It's heartwarming.

889
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,300
Yeah, it is nice to know that no matter what era we're in, it is a universal rule that

890
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,200
children are way better people than adults by a wide margin.

891
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,880
Also, the principal of the school said, quote, no disciplinary action would be taken against

892
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,280
the protesters, and he's willing to hear any complaints from students and parents.

893
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,360
What you basically have here is a situation where a teacher possibly and probably over-reacted

894
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,160
to something that they were right to be concerned about.

895
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,980
This led to an overly broad rule being put in place, which got students to become active

896
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,480
in opposition to it.

897
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,040
These kids learned how to appropriately and effectively have their voices heard, how to

898
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,740
present an argument through proper channels to power.

899
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,480
It's honestly an amazing story, and I'm so impressed by these kids.

900
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,820
Yeah, it really is an amazing story.

901
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,520
What a bunch of dicks.

902
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,120
This story that is really inspirational is absent from coverage in places like Infowars

903
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,640
because the story isn't real to Alex.

904
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,440
It's a prop, and for this to be an effective prop, he has to distort details to make it

905
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,960
something the government was doing to these kids, as opposed to an iffy administrative

906
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,980
decision.

907
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,560
It makes me kind of sad because the Infowars audience is deprived of hearing this story

908
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,680
about students getting involved in direct civic action solely because focusing on that

909
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,480
too much makes it clear that this whole thing about flirting becoming a criminal act is

910
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,520
complete bullshit, and that bullshit is how he keeps the audience engaged and outraged.

911
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:48,300
Well, I mean, the story is essentially a microcosm of the people taking on the government exactly

912
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:54,520
like Alex would want them to do theoretically, however, that would be bad for his audience

913
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,240
to actually take civic action to change things because then he would run out of money.

914
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Yeah, the students who were protesting here didn't try and change the government by sending

915
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,040
money to a blowhard student in the class.

916
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,600
There wasn't one student in the class who yelled a whole bunch.

917
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,360
Yeah, exactly, and then they were like, I'll take care of it for you.

918
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,160
I'm the tip of the spear going against this teacher here.

919
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Send me money.

920
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,000
If one student had written a pamphlet that it was selling, yeah, that would be who Alex

921
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
is.

922
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Behold the teacher's horse.

923
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah, exactly.

924
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,280
Oh, she's just in it for the apples.

925
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,560
How does this still work?

926
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,480
I think that's why I'm a little depressed about going back to 2003 because how do adults

927
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,120
still get caught up in this bullshit?

928
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
Look at this.

929
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,600
It's the same story that we're hearing about now.

930
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Yeah, it is.

931
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
It's the same story.

932
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:54,840
It's the same shit, and adults are still, at no point in time, are they like, oh, have

933
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,560
I heard this exact same thing 20 years ago and I'm fine?

934
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,000
Well, yeah, but I think that you forget.

935
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,760
The war on Christmas happens every year.

936
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,200
Sure, sure, that's true.

937
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,960
I think it's one of the evergreen things about-

938
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,760
The Iraq war happens every year.

939
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,160
I think it's one of the evergreen things about the right-wing media ecosystem.

940
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,400
These complaints that somehow all the kids are being softened at school or whatever,

941
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,480
it's just something that will never not elicit a reaction from that audience.

942
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,200
Yeah, no, of course, because if they were to hear that the kids weren't fighting at

943
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,120
all, they were learning, using their words, organizing, and then making a real change

944
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:39,560
in the world, that would not fit in with their, these kids are soft argument.

945
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,040
That would be difficult for them.

946
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,760
It would actually make you look like an idiot for fighting instead of learning and organizing

947
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
and making change.

948
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,120
Yeah, and those girls who started that protest, who got the committee going, studied the rules,

949
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,920
they accomplished what they set out to accomplish.

950
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,940
Yes, and they both grew up to be Michelle Obama.

951
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,520
That's one of the important lessons, I think, is being deprived from the audience, and I

952
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,360
think that's just unfair, but that's how it's supposed to be.

953
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,760
Anyway, Jordan, if you want to get more depressed about thinking about the past and the present,

954
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,520
and about how I'm a witch, I would ask you to put your mic down for this next clip.

955
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,880
The British government actually released foot and mouth.

956
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,760
In fact, two months before the outbreak, they had to admit, they had contacted people, the

957
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,280
agriculture departments in the counties, and said, get pyres ready, get lots of wood ready

958
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,600
to burn piles of dead animals.

959
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,440
They said, why, and they said, oh, well, you'll see, and then they admitted the foot and mouth

960
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,840
got released from porting down Bio Weapons Lab.

961
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,480
They said by accident, someone released it or someone stole it.

962
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,560
By the way, that's a level four Bio Weapons Lab that has stuff that'll kill specific races

963
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,640
of people, wipe out all whites, wipe out all blacks.

964
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Just amazing.

965
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,560
So many similarities to the present.

966
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,640
Wow.

967
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,120
There's no truth to what Alex is saying, but interestingly, in the aftermath of the 2001

968
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,120
foot and mouth outbreak in the UK, there were a ton of rumors flying around about how it

969
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,120
started.

970
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,920
Subsequent investigations have shown that it started on a farm that was feeding its

971
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,040
livestock untreated waste, but that didn't stop theories from flying around in the days

972
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,120
immediately after the outbreak.

973
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,660
One of the popular theories was that there was a vial of this specific strain of foot

974
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,840
and mouth that had been stolen from or accidentally released from porting down, a biological lab

975
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
in England.

976
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
Sure.

977
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,860
This is an interesting story, and it follows essentially the same path as Alex's present

978
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,480
day theories about the novel coronavirus.

979
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,400
At various points in the early days of the 2020 outbreak, Alex has suggested that it

980
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,760
was intentionally or accidentally released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and

981
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,680
he's also discussed the use of race specific bio weapons to bolster his claims.

982
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,680
Jesus.

983
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,720
This is like looking into a funhouse mirror of the past.

984
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
This is so awful.

985
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,120
I'm trying to torture you with this.

986
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,080
I mean, because why would you...

987
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:03,640
Like, okay, I get that we're evil as a species or whatever, and people are going to do...

988
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,320
Just because something shouldn't exist doesn't mean it's not going to, right?

989
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,000
But you can't possibly think it's a good idea.

990
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,040
Even if you could make a race specific bio weapon, you can't think it's a good idea to

991
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,380
leave it anywhere.

992
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:23,260
You have to have that in a safe, inside of a safe, inside of another safe surrounded

993
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,060
by people who've lost their hands, who can't open it, like that kind of shit.

994
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,800
If you would ever endeavor to make something so stupid and destructive, you would have

995
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,600
to keep it in a parody of security.

996
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Yeah.

997
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
It's something that's a hoax.

998
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,600
Yeah.

999
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,440
I mean, it's literally like you're one whoops away from all white people gone.

1000
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,680
That's not okay.

1001
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
Yeah.

1002
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,640
And also race specific bio weapons are real.

1003
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
It's bad.

1004
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,480
So The Guardian looked at the various theories about the foot and mouth outbreak, and the

1005
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,280
port and down one was one of the ones that got their attention.

1006
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,040
Unfortunately for the conspiracy, they spoke to a representative at port and down who said,

1007
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,960
quote, we have never worked on foot and mouth.

1008
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,860
That doesn't sound like folks admitting that it was released from there, but yet Alex is

1009
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,840
on air saying that it's been admitted.

1010
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,240
It's about what they don't say.

1011
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
That's weird.

1012
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,240
It's really weird.

1013
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,260
Kind of like how he always acts.

1014
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,400
This Guardian article also discusses the revelation that months before the outbreak, people from

1015
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,520
the Ministry of Agriculture were calling around getting quotes on the price of timber in order

1016
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,120
to burn diseased animals.

1017
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
That is true.

1018
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Yeah.

1019
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,000
They're reporting this as them sneakily and cryptically telling farmers to prepare piers,

1020
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,520
but that's about the level of accuracy you should expect from Alex.

1021
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,520
Yeah.

1022
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,780
It's kind of close to something that's real, but according to The Guardian, quote, Stratfordshire

1023
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,840
Animal Health Office, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, rang around merchants in the

1024
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,360
autumn asking for quotes for timber for piers as part of an animal contingency plan on how

1025
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,920
to deal with swine fever and foot and mouth outbreaks.

1026
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,360
This is a requirement of all EU countries.

1027
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,960
It happens every year.

1028
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,600
So it's not something that's suspicious at all, but Alex has built it into a foot and

1029
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,920
mouth was intentionally released from a level four bioweapons lab.

1030
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
Of course.

1031
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
In order to...

1032
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,920
Oh, boy.

1033
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:09,220
That's a story that's more about how England was like, remember when we threw dead bodies

1034
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,720
in the Thames and then there was disease?

1035
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,040
We don't do that anymore.

1036
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,520
It was a smart move on our part.

1037
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,320
So another sort of mirror glimpse to the present and the past comes in this next clip.

1038
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,200
Just stylistic, though, instead of content.

1039
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,520
And I haven't even scratched the surface.

1040
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,120
I've covered some of the important news.

1041
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,800
The news is so insane today that I will cover all 100 articles.

1042
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,880
I'm going to do it.

1043
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,800
I'm going to do it in the next two hours, and we're going to get to all your calls immediately

1044
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,320
after this break.

1045
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
That's just...

1046
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Wow.

1047
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Wow.

1048
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,040
He's always about to get to it.

1049
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,360
If you say that, there should be a ticker that appears just by magic.

1050
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Like 100 stories?

1051
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,760
It's a countdown clock.

1052
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,500
It just appears.

1053
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,320
Every day the show ends at 98.

1054
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,320
If I had...

1055
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,680
Got to two stories.

1056
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,120
That's my wish.

1057
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,480
My genie's wish is just like, I don't want money.

1058
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,640
I don't want happiness.

1059
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,840
I want purely just...

1060
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,080
If you make a claim like, I'm going to do 100 things, a ticker appears.

1061
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
The end.

1062
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,720
So Alex does end up going to take some calls, and he gets a call from a guy, and the conversation

1063
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,560
drifts into talking about the government tracking children via cell phone.

1064
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Sure.

1065
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,800
Or tracking people by cell phone and then using the excuse that it's to protect the

1066
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
kids.

1067
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Right?

1068
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,800
Yeah.

1069
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,320
And then Alex says something weird.

1070
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,720
But now that they're announcing that we're about to be tracking you, the government says

1071
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,960
that, oh, the police locally are watching the FEMA command center they built.

1072
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,560
Now it's, oh, it's for the children.

1073
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
See how they introduced it?

1074
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,560
It's for the children.

1075
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,840
It's for the criminals.

1076
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
It's for the minority.

1077
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,520
See, it's always for that other group.

1078
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
Go ahead.

1079
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,400
So that's interesting to me because that's right on the line.

1080
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,800
That's right on the line.

1081
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,900
It's always for a minority.

1082
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,040
That's the kind of thing that if you were really uncharitable and ungenerous to him

1083
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,380
you'd be like, okay, what minority groups are you talking about here?

1084
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,200
Is that coded language?

1085
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,640
But it's also, if you are charitable, you could be like, well, he's just saying that

1086
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,320
groups that aren't the majority, so criminals are a minority of the population.

1087
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,780
It's right there on the line.

1088
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,640
It's always, and it's rich for you to be like, oh, see how they do that?

1089
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,280
They say it's for the children.

1090
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,160
And then the next breath is like, I only care about the millions of aborted babies.

1091
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,880
It's about the aborted babies.

1092
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,120
It's not about controlling women's actions at all.

1093
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,120
Sure.

1094
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
Yeah.

1095
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,440
That's bad financial advice to give.

1096
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,200
Although I will say that he's not saying this as just solid financial advice.

1097
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
Sure.

1098
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,140
There's an ethical component to it, but his audience would have missed out on some money

1099
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,240
if they took this advice.

1100
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,400
You've got to be preemptively down at your county commissioners, your state legislature,

1101
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
calling Washington.

1102
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,200
You've got to preemptively find out if any of the mutual funds you own, own speculative

1103
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,880
tech stocks like Applied Digital.

1104
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,800
If you've got Motorola, they're involved in the biochip.

1105
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
IBM.

1106
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,080
IBM is a, you know, so-called good stock.

1107
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,840
Well, yeah, it's like buying a piece of Satan.

1108
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,360
You need to go ahead and dump that stock.

1109
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,960
It's up from where it was in 2003.

1110
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,840
I would argue.

1111
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,640
It's not hugely up, but you'd make a nice bit of money.

1112
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:36,720
If you'd bought stock in it in 2003, you'd make maybe a good, more than 50% profit.

1113
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
Not bad?

1114
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,720
No.

1115
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,600
But the reason that he wants you to get out of it is, apparently, IBM owns the Chinese

1116
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,600
military.

1117
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,600
I did not know that!

1118
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,160
I would add an addendum to that.

1119
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,960
IBM owns, or the Communist Chinese military, owns Applied Digital Solutions, their front

1120
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
company.

1121
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,920
They don't want to take the heat of being involved with this product, but they are the

1122
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,920
owners.

1123
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
You know, their financial statements, 2000, 2001.

1124
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,880
I think 2002 is out yet, I haven't read it.

1125
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,840
There's a Chinese plant that's being built for the implantator, ejector, and the chip

1126
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
itself.

1127
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,320
It's all part of hell on earth.

1128
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,240
So yeah, apparently there's a Chinese plant that's being built to get the implantator

1129
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,840
and the implants for the chip that they're going to put in everybody.

1130
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,080
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1131
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,800
And IBM owns the Chinese government's military.

1132
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:31,040
That is an interesting way to diversify your business, your revenue streams.

1133
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,680
Yeah, it's like, okay, well we did pretty good, but that almost suggests that the computer

1134
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,640
thing was just a way for them to make enough money to buy the Chinese military.

1135
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,720
It also introduces a lot of questions that I want answers to, like, has it been sold

1136
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,720
since?

1137
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
That's a good question.

1138
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,720
Does IBM still own the Chinese military?

1139
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,920
Also a good question.

1140
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,960
What say does the Chinese government have about military decisions, do they have to

1141
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
check with IBM?

1142
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Sure.

1143
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,520
I think one of those shared office space companies wound up buying it, yeah, I think they wound

1144
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,520
up buying it.

1145
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:06,120
They don't have a solid business plan, so they were like, well we might as well buy

1146
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,280
a military while we've got the cash.

1147
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,280
Yeah.

1148
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,320
So Alex takes another call, and this guy made me really sad.

1149
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,040
I mean, I just can't sleep, I'm going to be honest with you, I spend probably about 15

1150
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,360
hours a day studying, reviewing articles you put out.

1151
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:24,360
That's because you're normal, you're sane, when you read about giant FEMA cams and execution

1152
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,640
centers it upsets you.

1153
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:32,080
I can't imagine reading for a number of hours about things that Alex suggests people read

1154
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,240
and not realizing, oh, this guy's a dumb-dumb.

1155
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,240
Oh, this is full of shit.

1156
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,240
Yeah.

1157
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
All of this is terrible.

1158
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,080
I find that really difficult, I don't know what this guy is reading.

1159
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,460
I don't think he is, I think he's probably reading message boards or something and calling

1160
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,460
it research.

1161
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,280
It almost seems like you would learn about how much bullshit it is by osmosis, just by

1162
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,000
repetition of just like, I've heard this before, I've heard this before, I've heard this before,

1163
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,200
this guy might be full of shit.

1164
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,360
Wait, this doesn't say what Alex says.

1165
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,360
Yeah.

1166
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah, it just bums me out.

1167
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,160
And I think it is indicative of how a lot of his listeners and how a lot of people who

1168
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,360
get into this world, their experience of it is compulsive.

1169
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,600
What he's describing is such a compulsive relationship with this information.

1170
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,320
I read what you write 15 hours a day, because you're normal, man.

1171
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,320
You're normal, bro.

1172
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,440
Because you're a normal dude, that's how people react to the things that I say.

1173
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,440
Yeah.

1174
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,840
So Alex at this point needs to make a programming note.

1175
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Okay.

1176
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,880
And that is actually kind of revealing in as much as he is clear, even in 2003, that

1177
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,600
tragedies bring traffic.

1178
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:45,080
I made a comment last weekend that after every time there's a terror event, the listenership

1179
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,840
peaks, it spikes.

1180
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,960
Well, obviously, all news, newspaper sales go up, radio listenership goes up for news

1181
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
talk.

1182
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
That always happens.

1183
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:01,080
And I made the comment that right after the so-called Iraq war ended, that listenership

1184
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,080
dropped.

1185
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:07,360
And then that gets picked up, and another host says it, another host says it, and basically

1186
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,520
it ends up we don't have any listeners.

1187
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,520
That's ridiculous.

1188
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,520
A little defensive.

1189
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,520
Yeah.

1190
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,600
But I think that this is interesting, because at this point he does understand that dynamic

1191
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,340
of tragedies lead to more people viewing my shit.

1192
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,880
Which is a lesson, obviously, he should have learned from 9-11, and he should know that

1193
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,680
by now pretty well.

1194
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,840
But I question whether he understands at this point fully that obsessing about the immediacy

1195
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,640
of another tragedy happening soon will also spike his ratings.

1196
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,280
I think he learns that pretty quickly, but it doesn't feel like it at this point.

1197
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,760
It just feels like a radio show.

1198
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Yeah.

1199
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:51,400
So he gets another caller, and this guy sent me down a nutso rabbit hole, insane, too much

1200
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
of my time.

1201
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Okay.

1202
00:55:53,400 --> 00:56:01,360
I was wondering if I may take this opportunity to see if we can get any signatures on the

1203
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,040
site that I talked to you before about, if you want to go ahead and announce it.

1204
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,040
What site is that, Eric?

1205
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,040
You've got a site signature.

1206
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,040
Is that a petition?

1207
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,040
Yeah.

1208
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,320
It lists over about 300 grievances.

1209
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,880
Oh, yeah, I read that.

1210
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,880
You sent that to me.

1211
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,680
Yeah, a lot of good grievances there.

1212
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,560
What's the website address?

1213
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
Redeclarationofindependence.com.

1214
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,600
And then I would imagine it.com, yeah.

1215
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,600
You bet.

1216
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,640
2003 is an interesting time for followers of conspiracy culture and the communities

1217
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,920
surrounding it.

1218
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,280
In the present day, extremely far-right tendencies have almost entirely absorbed that space,

1219
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,400
but it wasn't always like that.

1220
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,600
So back then, I would be willing to bet that I'd probably agree with some of this caller's

1221
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,840
suggested new grievances in his post about the government.

1222
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
Okay.

1223
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,320
Luckily, the Wayback Machine exists, and I was able to find this caller's redeclaration

1224
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:56,200
of independence, and perhaps unsurprisingly, I did in fact find some common ground with

1225
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,200
this guy.

1226
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,200
Okay.

1227
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,100
For instance, his first complaint reads, quote, we demand the abolishment of engaging our

1228
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:06,600
military in unconstitutional activities, spreading them out as the police of the world while

1229
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,880
leaving our borders wide open and unprotected.

1230
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,440
I might have left out the part at the end about the borders, since it has nothing to

1231
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,960
do with the main point of unconstitutional engagements of the military, but leaving that

1232
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,240
aside, we agree that the government's got to stop this war stuff.

1233
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,240
True.

1234
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,000
A little bit later, we find even more agreement.

1235
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,880
Quote, we demand the abolishment of all instances of murdering citizens completely within their

1236
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,880
rights and destroying and refusing to disclose evidence in these crimes.

1237
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,320
I would even expand that language to include non-citizen residents, but we're on the same

1238
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,320
page.

1239
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,320
Cop shouldn't be killing people.

1240
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,320
Yeah.

1241
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,760
It's important to remember that that's where those people were, and now they're at Blue

1242
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,080
Lives Matter.

1243
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,080
You know?

1244
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
You don't know what this guy's up to.

1245
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,080
Sure.

1246
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,480
So this whole agreeing thing falls apart pretty quick, since it immediately dovetails into

1247
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,000
complaints about UN treaties and calling for abolishing, quote, the post office, public

1248
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,280
education, and Amtrak.

1249
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,240
Oh, so we're Ron Pauling it.

1250
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,240
A little bit.

1251
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,240
Okay.

1252
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,740
This document completely goes off the rails with words like treason starting to pop up

1253
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,280
in all capital letters.

1254
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,280
There.

1255
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,280
That's where we get into trouble.

1256
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,920
In all caps a word, you are, yeah.

1257
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,680
Apparently part of the re-declaration of independence is charging any individual or

1258
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,160
industry that traded with North Vietnam, China, Russia, Iraq, or any of their satellite countries

1259
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,540
with treason.

1260
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,220
This extends to literally everyone who worked in things like steel or petroleum industries,

1261
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,640
but also to everyone who's been in elected office in Congress or the executive branch

1262
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,200
or the Supreme Court dating back to the Korean War.

1263
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,960
Yeah, you might as well just rewrite that to say, we got to clean house and get rid

1264
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,240
of all these guys.

1265
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,240
And past.

1266
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,020
Let's, yeah, let's begin at the 16th century and we'll start over.

1267
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,960
The document demands, quote, all who served in these political positions during any of

1268
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,640
the times of armed conflict in question from the Korean War to this date be stripped of

1269
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,080
any retirement or other compensation.

1270
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,040
I'm guessing that's in addition to the treason charges.

1271
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,320
What about people who supported the civil war?

1272
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,160
The South, huh?

1273
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,120
Do they get treason charges?

1274
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,120
Yeah, it's before the federal reserves.

1275
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,200
Okay, well, that's fair.

1276
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,400
The thing is, this is nuts.

1277
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,400
This document is nuts.

1278
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,520
And it's hilarious for Alex to pretend that he's read it trying to humor this caller.

1279
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,360
I'm certain that Alex didn't read it, but honestly, it's so much funnier to imagine

1280
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,880
that he had and was still giving this guy a glowing review.

1281
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,440
You see, here's how the new Declaration of Independence ends with a suggestion of what

1282
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:31,240
they should do next, quote, we hereby petition for renewal of government removed entirely

1283
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,440
from Washington D.C. and reconstituted in another region of the land.

1284
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,800
And at least temporarily at first, during its beginnings, this new government for and

1285
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,640
of the people will be situated and redeveloped from Austin, Texas, the birthplace of the

1286
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,080
new people's house with an initial mailing address of bleep, I'll just bleep it out.

1287
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,080
Okay, okay.

1288
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,160
A new government will be birthed for the free world, led initially and temporarily by the

1289
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,920
following patriots of this new age.

1290
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,920
Alex Jones.

1291
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,920
Names?

1292
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,920
Oh, no.

1293
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
Oh, no.

1294
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,920
Top of the list?

1295
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,920
Yep.

1296
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,920
Oh, shit.

1297
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:11,600
Alex Jones, Eric Rainbolt, Mike Hansen, George Humphrey, Chris Athanas, Kevin Smith, and

1298
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,280
Robert Dassey, in order to retain our original forefathers declaration of our God-given rights

1299
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,160
and framework for the lasting legitimate republic promoting global freedom under God's laws,

1300
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,400
not a select group of men's laws, and the complete dismantlement of all forms of tyranny

1301
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
hereafter.

1302
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,000
This wasn't that much farther after Mallrats, so I can see Kevin-

1303
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Wrong Kevin Smith.

1304
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
What?

1305
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,080
It's not the view askew, Kevin Smith.

1306
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,740
This guy wants to overthrow the government, reconstitute it in Austin, and have Alex and

1307
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,880
some of Alex's friends temporarily rule this new blossoming government.

1308
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,880
That's amazing.

1309
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,880
Yeah.

1310
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,360
In case you don't know those names, Mike Hansen was Alex's longtime cameraman and producer.

1311
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,720
Kevin Smith worked at Info Wars, and George Humphrey and Bob Dassey were regular Info

1312
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,720
Wars guests.

1313
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,280
The new Politburo is just employees of Info Wars.

1314
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,080
Yeah, except for Chris Athanas, I don't know who that is, and Eric Rainbolt.

1315
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,000
I was like, who the fuck is that?

1316
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,760
And then I realized, it's this caller.

1317
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,040
Well you're not gonna not insert yourself into the Politburo.

1318
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,180
So if you Google the address that he lists as the temporary address of the new government

1319
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:23,960
of America, you'll find that it's listed as the publishing address for a 2005 book titled

1320
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,280
The Freemasonic Architecture of History, self-published by Eric Rainbolt.

1321
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,680
It's Eric Rainbolt's house.

1322
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,680
It's Eric Rainbolt's house, isn't it?

1323
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,680
Well, hold on.

1324
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,920
It's definitely the address of the publishing of this book that was written and self-published

1325
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,920
by Eric Rainbolt.

1326
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,920
Uh-huh.

1327
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,960
He was also the proprietor of 911exposed.com.

1328
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,880
The real mystery here, though, is that the name of the person listed as the owner of

1329
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,360
that house doesn't match with Eric Rainbolt, so I felt like I was at a dead end, but my

1330
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,640
curiosity was itching too strongly.

1331
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,880
Was this caller the person who wrote the new Declaration of Independence, imagining

1332
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,520
a new government forming at his house in Austin where he gets to rule alongside Alex?

1333
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,440
It's really complicated, but I looked into the phone numbers and addresses listed for

1334
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,520
the publishing endeavor, and I'm pretty certain that it is this dude.

1335
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,760
It was actually written under Eric Thunderwater.

1336
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,320
I found the phone number that's associated with it.

1337
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,080
It's someone else's phone number, but also it's a house phone.

1338
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,360
It's associated with someone named James Rainbolt.

1339
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,000
But Eric Rainbolt has published multiple...

1340
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Still living with his dad.

1341
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
No.

1342
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I don't know.

1343
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Maybe.

1344
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Okay, maybe.

1345
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,560
Eric Rainbolt has written a couple of other books under the name Eric James Rainbolt.

1346
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,840
So anyway, I'm pretty sure it's him.

1347
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
All right.

1348
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,840
Yeah, that would probably be him.

1349
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,340
This is a stupid long road for me to wander down, but the reason I still think it's important

1350
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:42,680
is because there are some fairly critical things that me and this guy would totally

1351
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,680
agree about.

1352
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,120
We would both want to end the Iraq War, and we both want greater oversight on police,

1353
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,720
but it's pretty crucial to recognize that despite our differences, we aren't even close

1354
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,160
to allies, nor could we ever be.

1355
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,440
Ultimately, I want to create a world that operates better and more fairly for everyone.

1356
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,240
And ultimately, this guy wants to be on Alex Jones' small council.

1357
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,240
Yeah.

1358
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,480
Also, this guy ended up with 75 signatures on his petition at the point of the last screenshot

1359
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,760
in the Wayback Machine, available...

1360
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:15,120
This date was from July 2010, so I'm not sure exposure on Alex's show did much to help that

1361
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
petition.

1362
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
I would argue that maybe...

1363
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
75 signatures.

1364
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
That's not good.

1365
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,540
They might have read it and got to the part where it's like, what the fuck?

1366
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,680
Alex is in charge of the government, along with the guy who wrote this?

1367
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,680
Yeah.

1368
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:32,200
The enemy of my enemy is not my friend if they also want to establish a fucking Game

1369
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,160
of Thrones style, I'm the Hand of the King for Alex Jones situation.

1370
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:43,060
Yeah, a bizarro religious extreme libertarian nonsense fantasy land where Alex and some

1371
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,760
of his guests rule the roost.

1372
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1373
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,760
I don't think so.

1374
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,760
I don't think so.

1375
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,760
Yeah.

1376
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,240
I don't think so anymore, but I will choose other people to work on that issue with.

1377
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,240
Yeah.

1378
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,320
Anyway, this was kind of what...

1379
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,480
I was like, I'm sure that's this guy.

1380
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,480
And then...

1381
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,240
Let's talk to Eric in Texas.

1382
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,320
Eric, you're on the air.

1383
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,320
Go ahead, sir.

1384
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,320
That was the beginning of the call.

1385
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,320
It is Eric.

1386
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,320
Oh, it is Eric.

1387
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,320
Yeah.

1388
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320
Okay.

1389
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:13,480
So anyway, Alex gets another call, and this guy is kind of interesting.

1390
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:19,440
This fellow has a plan for dealing with some of the media that he doesn't like, folks like

1391
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,440
Hannity.

1392
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,440
Yeah.

1393
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,800
These folks who are not conservative, apparently.

1394
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,200
I'll make them put the lotion in the basket.

1395
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Nope.

1396
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,200
We need to dig up dirt.

1397
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
Okay.

1398
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,340
You're listeners who are very intelligent and very capable people.

1399
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,320
Many of them have, I'm sure, computers and know how to use them very well.

1400
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,320
You can access a lot of public domain information.

1401
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,160
It's all quite legal.

1402
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:46,720
And I think that we should start a campaign of accessing as much public domain information

1403
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,400
about all these suspect broadcast individuals as we can.

1404
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,400
Case in point, I don't know if you or your listeners are aware, but Sean Hannity was

1405
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,160
a troublemaking adolescent who came from a Long Island, New York community.

1406
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,960
That's a very interesting thing.

1407
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,860
Maybe that needs to be looked into further, and it tells you something about what the

1408
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,240
real makeup of this man is.

1409
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:13,160
Michael Savage, who you mentioned, the guy used to hang out in the late 50s in beatnik

1410
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,960
bars in Greenwich Village, New York.

1411
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,800
That's one of the major articles.

1412
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,840
He's a beatnik communist.

1413
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,840
That's invented.

1414
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,360
So Michael Savage is a beatnik communist.

1415
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,360
Wow.

1416
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,360
Yeah.

1417
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,360
All right.

1418
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,360
Here's what we do, guys.

1419
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,600
We got to blackmail Hannity and Michael Savage with their child records.

1420
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,600
Yeah.

1421
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
It's really interesting.

1422
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,440
You think that that's a potent way to attack these figures on the right that you don't

1423
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,160
like and apparently aren't on the right.

1424
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:45,400
I found out public records that Sean Hannity got a D in his civics class.

1425
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,960
Is that the type of person we want on the radio, Dan?

1426
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,000
It is over for him.

1427
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,800
He's hashtag canceled.

1428
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
He's toast.

1429
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
He's toast.

1430
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
This is cancel culture.

1431
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Yeah.

1432
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
This is cancel culture.

1433
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,800
That's literally what the right does.

1434
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Oh, man.

1435
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:03,720
Anyway, I just think it's really weird to hear this kind of ploy being suggested by

1436
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,720
this caller.

1437
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,720
Yeah.

1438
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,720
Alex being like, all right.

1439
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,560
And then also the political framing is so important.

1440
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,600
We have George Bush in all of his cabinet.

1441
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,960
They're super socialists.

1442
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
Sure.

1443
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,600
You have Michael Savage as a beatnik commie.

1444
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:26,120
These very right wing people are being presented as left.

1445
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,400
Yeah.

1446
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,200
So they're not even moderate.

1447
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,040
Or maybe they're supposed to be the moderate left or whatever.

1448
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,040
Sure.

1449
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,040
Rhinos, if you will, Dan.

1450
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:38,340
That was a big talking point in 2003 and ever and always forever.

1451
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:43,280
But it makes it okay for whatever really, really hard right wing thing you want to be

1452
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,520
like, oh, no, this is just actually normal conservatism.

1453
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,520
Right.

1454
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,520
Right, right, right.

1455
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,520
I don't know about that.

1456
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,520
Jesus.

1457
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,920
Maybe sovereign citizenism is even just normal conservatism.

1458
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,920
Sure.

1459
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,920
Hello, Ida.

1460
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,920
Yes.

1461
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,920
Thank you for taking my call.

1462
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,840
The reason I'm calling is I listen to you almost every day.

1463
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:05,160
And I understand we've got 250 million of the happiest slaves in the world living in

1464
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,160
this country.

1465
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,640
And that's why they'll never revolt.

1466
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,440
I have revolted.

1467
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,000
I have been thrown in jail five times.

1468
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,160
I am now looking at a year and a half in jail plus a $1,500 fine simply because I refuse

1469
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,120
to go down the road without a driver's license.

1470
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,120
Yeah.

1471
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,240
And the federal law actually says that and the court really say that you don't have to

1472
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:31,720
have a license for the generally accepted conveyance, but that's a horse and buggy still.

1473
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,960
Hey, Alex, I've used every definition coming down the pike in court and the judge turns

1474
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:46,320
around, the prosecutor objects and the judge turns around and he says it's okay to object.

1475
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,320
I can't use it.

1476
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,800
And the next thing I know I'm getting paraded off to jail.

1477
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,660
You need to go ahead and appeal it up to a higher court.

1478
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:57,680
But yeah, these courts, even federal judges have said are just rubber stamp kangaroo courts

1479
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,680
now.

1480
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,680
Oh yeah, for sure.

1481
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,680
For sure.

1482
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,680
You don't need a license for sure.

1483
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,680
For sure.

1484
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,680
Your honor, objection, silly bullshit.

1485
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,680
Sustained.

1486
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,760
Yeah, this isn't true.

1487
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,240
What Alex is saying isn't true.

1488
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:17,400
They arrested me simply because I refuse to go down the road without a driver's license

1489
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:22,220
is an interesting way of putting I've been driving without a driver's license and I don't

1490
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,220
give a shit.

1491
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:26,960
Also, Alex later in the call says, I've driven without a license for years, so I think they're

1492
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,960
targeting you.

1493
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,080
Yeah, that sounds right.

1494
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,080
That sounds right.

1495
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,080
It's weird.

1496
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,080
It's weird.

1497
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,240
But that's like a bedrock of sovereign citizen shit.

1498
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,360
It's just a misunderstanding of rules.

1499
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1500
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
Yeah.

1501
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,640
Or almost like an oppositional defiance toward the concept of rules that aren't self-generated.

1502
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,640
Yep.

1503
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,640
Yeah.

1504
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,840
So in the present day, Alex Jones loves one Tucker Carlson.

1505
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,840
Sure.

1506
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,840
He's got enough of him.

1507
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,840
Loves the guy.

1508
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,840
Yeah.

1509
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,840
Didn't like him so much before.

1510
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
Yeah, I was going to say.

1511
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,840
Yeah.

1512
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,840
Obviously we've heard he doesn't like Hannity.

1513
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,320
He thinks that Michael Savage is a commie.

1514
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,880
Coincidentally more important figures than him.

1515
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,000
What do you think he thinks about Fox, Fox News?

1516
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,800
Oh, I think he thinks that they are just a left-wing outlet giving out propaganda for

1517
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,520
an Obama that hasn't even been elected to the Senate yet.

1518
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,260
Do you think that the average Marine or Army that's on the ground today know what's going

1519
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,260
on?

1520
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,260
Do they even have any idea?

1521
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,260
They just don't know.

1522
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:32,120
No, they just have Fox, the ultra commie channel that calls itself conservative beamed into

1523
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,120
them.

1524
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,120
Oh, everybody loves you.

1525
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,120
Oh, it's great.

1526
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,120
Oh, you're the greatest heroes ever.

1527
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:40,600
By the way, we're cutting all your benefits right now, but as so what, you know, that's

1528
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,760
the system.

1529
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,720
Ultra commie channel, Fox News.

1530
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,960
We're cutting all your benefits right now is not a thing that is acceptable for Alex

1531
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,320
to say in a negative way.

1532
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,960
He should be like, yeah, they're cutting all your benefits because you don't deserve them.

1533
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,560
You lazy pieces of shit.

1534
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,560
You know what?

1535
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,560
I quit this show.

1536
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,880
I got to leave.

1537
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,120
I got to leave.

1538
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,680
Ultra commie Fox News.

1539
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,200
Ultra commie Fox News.

1540
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
Yep.

1541
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Oh boy.

1542
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,200
Yeah.

1543
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,200
That wasn't quite what I expected.

1544
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,640
I mean, it's, it's, it's all, it's a lot to see.

1545
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,340
Like when I, when I first turned on the episode, I was like, I think I'm going to have like

1546
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,680
some really subtle things to try and sift through.

1547
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,680
Yeah.

1548
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,560
Instead it's just like, Michael Savage is a commie, Fox News is ultra commie, everyone

1549
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,560
are communists.

1550
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,120
Like, oh wait, this is, this is great.

1551
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,120
Yeah.

1552
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:35,120
That's, that's so, cause we've talked about this for years of like, if you just abandoned

1553
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:40,720
Trump, you could carve out that space of like, I don't trust Fox News.

1554
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,320
They're a bunch of liberal commie bullshit, you know, like listen to that.

1555
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,860
Like you, it's so easy.

1556
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:50,680
You could just be like, oh, there's Biden's giving a speech on CNN and they're whining

1557
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,440
about some nonsense five-year-old who's got a problem.

1558
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,360
Perhaps the proof of the pudding is in the eating as it were.

1559
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,360
That's true.

1560
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:03,040
I mean, like look at where he was in his career in 2003 and look where he is now.

1561
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,120
Like obviously signing up with Trump has massively exposed him.

1562
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,480
It's gotten him a far greater space in the public sphere.

1563
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:19,680
He's made, it's made him relevant to the point where people like at least jokingly make his

1564
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,680
name trend.

1565
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,680
True.

1566
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,680
Sometimes.

1567
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,680
True.

1568
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,280
Back then in 2003, he had like a position of defiance against the right and the left.

1569
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,280
Right.

1570
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,080
He could pretend that it was because he's above the divide, but it's really, he's extremely

1571
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,080
far to the right.

1572
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,080
Exactly.

1573
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,200
But you can see the, it didn't work.

1574
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,200
It didn't work.

1575
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,200
No, that's true.

1576
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
That's true.

1577
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,200
You're not wrong.

1578
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,840
I, but, but it, you know, I'm, I'm still of the opinion of like carving out that comfortable

1579
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:52,000
space is so much better than being like, well, if I hitch my wagon to Trump's train, I can

1580
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,360
become world famous.

1581
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,360
Yes.

1582
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,420
No, I think it would be healthier and better if he had carved out that space.

1583
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,760
But clearly he lusts for the sun, like Icarus.

1584
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,760
That's true.

1585
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,760
That is true.

1586
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,240
And maybe that's just, uh, he could never do that while maintaining whatever it is that

1587
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
he's doing back then.

1588
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,480
Yeah, it is.

1589
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:15,640
It is one of those situations where were the actions and context completely different.

1590
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:20,080
I would be like, man, I got to give it up to you for seeing an opportunity and shooting

1591
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,080
your shot.

1592
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:27,720
And it has not worked out for you, but within the context and his actions, uh, he's an idiot

1593
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,240
and I hate him forever and I want to throw baseballs at him.

1594
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:35,960
I don't know if you know this, but 2003, in addition to seeing the end of the Iraq war,

1595
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,600
um, we also were, uh, in the middle of SARS.

1596
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,600
Okay.

1597
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:47,280
Now, some people may remember the COVID-19 is originally SARS coronavirus two, uh, the

1598
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,680
sequel to, uh, what's going on in 2003 SARS.

1599
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,400
Let's see how, let's see how we handled it differently.

1600
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,360
Reuters money may be the root of all evil, but China is trying to make sure it won't

1601
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,200
be a source of SARS.

1602
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:06,440
Now they already have public service announcements here in this country of how quote cash is

1603
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:12,880
dirty and how we need to get rid of it to the safe cashless society.

1604
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,960
Well the central people's bank of China was putting more new cash into circulation and

1605
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,700
holding used bank notes for 24 hours before putting it back on the people's hands.

1606
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:26,000
The people's daily newspaper said on its website on Tuesday, the communist party mouthpiece

1607
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,320
at some banks or even sterilizing grimy bills and showering them with ultraviolet radiation

1608
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:37,680
trying to kill the SARS virus, which has killed 148 people and infected more than 3,300 in

1609
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,680
China.

1610
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:44,480
Like 300 globally, not even that many folks, this thing, millions die every year from flu.

1611
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,480
This is nothing.

1612
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,000
They can't even isolate the virus.

1613
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It's hysteria.

1614
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,320
As the Toronto star said, it is a UN power grab.

1615
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,320
I didn't say it.

1616
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:58,080
Toronto starred in so weird to see how the past echoes with the present.

1617
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,840
Like you can dip back into 2003 and hear Alex Alex making the exact same nonsense claims

1618
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,560
about SARS that he would eventually make about the novel coronavirus.

1619
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,760
It's remarkable, almost like the actual facts in front of him don't matter.

1620
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,360
And the particular details of a story are just decorations on top of his underlying

1621
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,360
preexisting reality denying narrative.

1622
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,360
SARS was a big deal.

1623
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,020
It was real and it was not a UN power grab.

1624
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:24,560
At this point, scientists hadn't been able to concretely isolate the SARS virus, but

1625
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,900
they did achieve that this same month, on March 22nd, 2003.

1626
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,640
At this point when Alex is making the episode, it's only been a few weeks since China reported

1627
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,640
the outbreak of cases to the World Health Organization, and the situation is very much

1628
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,180
in its infancy.

1629
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:42,240
The international community jumped into action and quickly identified and isolated the virus,

1630
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,880
and cautionary steps were taken to prevent the spread.

1631
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,200
Because of collaborative action, and probably somewhat because the right-wing conspiracy

1632
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:53,200
movement hadn't grown to the size it has in the present day, only 774 people in the world

1633
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:59,260
ended up dying during the outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003.

1634
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:03,320
The Toronto Star article Alex is referencing is something I can't find, but I would bet

1635
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:08,000
anything it was an editorial article presenting the opinion that Toronto's response to SARS

1636
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,680
has been hysterical.

1637
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:16,260
You can find some people still, you know, some existing websites that express that sentiment.

1638
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:20,200
It's hard to say if people there overreacted, but the Greater Toronto Area saw the fourth

1639
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:25,640
largest outbreak of SARS cases in the world, behind China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, so it

1640
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,760
really does kind of make sense that the matter there would be taken seriously in a way that

1641
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,880
might look like hysteria, but if you didn't act that way, who knows what the end result

1642
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,880
would have been.

1643
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,080
You know, I've always been, like, especially, you know, obviously now when you're thinking

1644
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:46,800
about it, but it always kind of, like, messed me up when people say, oh, you're reacting

1645
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:53,760
hysterically to this virus, and it feels like the entire human race should be so hysterical

1646
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,800
about viruses and bacteria, considering...

1647
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,000
Especially really new ones.

1648
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,440
Yeah, considering disease has killed almost all of us.

1649
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:04,300
You know, like, we talk about, oh, I'm so scared of war and all that shit.

1650
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:08,840
Of all the people who have ever lived, most of them have died because of some disease

1651
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,080
or another.

1652
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,080
And I think that...

1653
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:15,320
Like, we should all be hysterical, you know, like, that's what I would say.

1654
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,240
And I think that the conversation largely has been, like, in times when we're not dealing

1655
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:25,080
with outbreaks and infections and stuff, people in medical communities talk about the unknown

1656
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,080
unknowns.

1657
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,080
Exactly.

1658
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,440
About, you know, like, all the conversation about Disease X or whatever, about this thing

1659
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,400
that we don't know about that we may have to deal with.

1660
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:37,640
It's really a terrifying prospect, because you have to figure out how it spreads, what

1661
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,920
its characteristics are, and while you're figuring that out, it's spreading.

1662
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,920
Or it could be spreading, or it might be spreading faster than you think.

1663
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,920
Yeah.

1664
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,920
It's a terrifying thing.

1665
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,920
Yeah.

1666
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,920
I agree with you.

1667
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:54,320
Like, almost levels of hysteria become more rational the more you think about it.

1668
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,320
Yeah.

1669
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:01,200
And I remember some people that I knew were going through some steps that I would say

1670
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,120
were maybe a little bit further than I would have, even, at the beginning of dealing with

1671
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:13,160
the 2020 situation, and I kind of was like, hey, you guys are going a little far with

1672
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,160
this.

1673
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:21,240
And their response was, you know, I'd rather do this and look stupid later than not do

1674
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:27,040
it, and feel like, oh, I could have taken preventative measures.

1675
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,160
And I think that that's a compelling argument, and I felt stupid afterwards.

1676
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,160
Yeah.

1677
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:36,240
And it's also just, but I mean, part of it is just the very fact that so many fucking

1678
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:41,520
people don't not just not understand evolution, but believe in it entirely.

1679
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:48,560
It's just like, you realize that if a virus spreads, it's going to reproduce billions

1680
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:55,040
of times in a very short period of time, which exponentially increases the possibility of

1681
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,200
mutation and adaptation to our measures against it.

1682
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,360
Like it is not, it is a constant battle.

1683
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:09,960
It is not a, like, even now, if we defeat COVID-19, to the extent that we would all

1684
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:15,020
love it, if we don't completely eradicate it, it is going to mutate and it can come

1685
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,720
back any time.

1686
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,620
You know, like it's a real terrifying reality.

1687
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,120
And most people are like, eh, it's probably witches.

1688
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,720
Like that's where we are.

1689
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,720
Yeah.

1690
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,560
Or, you know, witches that work for the UN.

1691
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,560
Totally.

1692
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,560
It's a UN power grab.

1693
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,560
Yeah, it's a UN power grab.

1694
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:30,560
It always is.

1695
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,560
Always.

1696
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:37,520
And I think if, you know, I don't know, I guess if Trump was president and the conspiracy

1697
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:43,120
community existed the way it does now in 2003, SARS might've been a much bigger problem.

1698
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,120
Oh, totally.

1699
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,120
Well, I mean, you think about...

1700
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,120
It's weird to think about it.

1701
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,680
You think about so many of the, you know, like you think about Ebola outbreaks.

1702
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,960
You see, you think about those things that happened in the past that in retrospect you

1703
01:18:53,960 --> 01:19:01,440
realize were handled by people who understood and were serious about the problem instead

1704
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,960
of actively exacerbating it.

1705
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:10,400
And the people who are causing problems should be held responsible in the courts.

1706
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,400
So what you gonna do?

1707
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,920
Hey, you know, Alex, at this point, you know, he's getting towards, you know, the end of

1708
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,920
the show.

1709
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,840
You know, we're getting deep into it.

1710
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,880
He still hasn't covered the news.

1711
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,880
How many of those?

1712
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:27,320
In the next hour, I'll get more into this and what life will be like under the new world

1713
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
order.

1714
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,320
We have covered about a third of it.

1715
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:33,640
I'll have to just jam it all in calmly in the third hour.

1716
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:38,400
I don't know what's been wrong with me this week, but I've been more fired up than usual.

1717
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:43,880
Before I end this segment, you want to find out what really happened with 9-1-1.

1718
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:50,880
You want to see all the information, the globalists admitting it, the documents, the news articles

1719
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,920
in a professional package.

1720
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:58,000
Get Road to Tyranny, get part two of That Matters a Terror, my two films.

1721
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,120
That's the ad pivot back then.

1722
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,160
There's no pills to sell, no wellness supplies.

1723
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
Get my films.

1724
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,440
Yeah, he's just trying to sell his documentaries.

1725
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,800
I'm looking for exposure.

1726
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,000
If you get three of them, price goes down by three films.

1727
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
What about shipping?

1728
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,440
Is shipping still expensive at the time?

1729
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,440
I don't remember.

1730
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,440
Could be free.

1731
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,440
Probably prohibitive.

1732
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,160
Yeah, might be.

1733
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:25,000
So Alex has an epiphany when he comes back from the commercial, and this just made me

1734
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,920
want to throw something.

1735
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,520
I'm frankly starting to panic on air.

1736
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,520
I'm going to be honest with you.

1737
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,520
Stuff's getting so bad.

1738
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,480
I see the plan coming together.

1739
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,600
Now I know my analysis has been dead on all along.

1740
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,120
Worse than I thought, frankly, and it's freaking me out.

1741
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:47,880
I know the nature of the globalist, watching serial killer control freak demons build a

1742
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:57,400
cage for humanity is very energizing, just energized to resist them.

1743
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,540
I've asked God to make me a vessel to fight the New World Order, and sometimes I just

1744
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,440
think there's too much.

1745
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,720
I mean, I'm just too energized.

1746
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,720
I've got all the information.

1747
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:08,720
I know what they're doing.

1748
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:13,320
I know what their plans are, what their operations are, and like my mouth, my speech centers

1749
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:18,760
can not, I don't think, articulate the globalist program properly to you.

1750
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,040
It's just horrible.

1751
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,960
Anyone who listens to our show with any regularity has heard that speech.

1752
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,360
It's one that Alex gives pretty frequently when he gets in a wistful, contemplative mood.

1753
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,400
Yesterday he was confused, but today all the pieces have come together, and he's more certain

1754
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:38,040
than ever that his analysis has been right all along, and it's worse than he thought.

1755
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,400
That's an interesting experience to imagine having when something groundbreaking happens,

1756
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,480
but to go back to a random episode of his show from 18 years ago and see him pretending

1757
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,560
to have the same epiphany that he does regularly on his show nowadays, it's a little annoying.

1758
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:55,540
Also, another reason I pulled this clip is because Alex makes a reference to God and

1759
01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:01,120
to demons, but I think you can tell how much different that feels than how he acts and

1760
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,920
speaks in the present day.

1761
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:08,040
To my ears, listening to this, it kind of comes off like a man who has religious inclinations

1762
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,580
but isn't a zealot.

1763
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:14,340
It feels like a person calling his enemies demons as a pejorative insult, not as a description

1764
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,560
that's meant to be taken literally.

1765
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,520
It's weird to think about, but maybe Alex meant it to be heard as literal all along,

1766
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,080
and people were just giving him an unasked-for benefit of the doubt.

1767
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:29,200
There's no way he could think demons were real, and they were just Democrats.

1768
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,580
That seems crazy.

1769
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:35,080
So we'll assume that he's being metaphorical in this sense.

1770
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,220
I don't think that's the case, but it's fun to think about.

1771
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:42,120
Like the possibility that, nah, he's been pretty upfront about it.

1772
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,680
He's talking about demons.

1773
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:50,320
Dan, I hate time travel episodes sometimes because you're like a Mr. Peabody who refuses

1774
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,600
to let me get into the time machine.

1775
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:57,000
You just make me watch a movie of the past, and you're like, oh yeah, if we used this

1776
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,600
time machine, we could fix it all, but too bad, asshole, we're just gonna watch.

1777
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,600
Well, that'd be a more interesting cartoon.

1778
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,660
Ah, could be.

1779
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:11,640
So Alex gets to another call, and boy, he has some pretty anti-immigrant sentiments

1780
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,640
back in 2003.

1781
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,640
Unsurprising.

1782
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:19,180
You know, I have a lot of friends that are Mexicans, but I don't have too many immigrant

1783
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:23,920
friends, but you kind of wonder how in the world they got their driver's license in the

1784
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,920
first place.

1785
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,920
Look it up.

1786
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,840
You know, if they do have one, and they really do not have a driver's license because they

1787
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,840
do not know the law.

1788
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,920
They're there for big companies to work because they do work.

1789
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,840
Yeah, and the big companies have said, these people are here to vote our rights away because

1790
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,840
they don't even know what they're doing, and they can't speak any language, they're just

1791
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:49,640
the tall what to do with their local bosses, local little bosses, barrio boss, who works

1792
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:54,760
for the government, and they're here to deindustrialize and to give us cheap wages.

1793
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,520
Don't arrest them, don't mess with them, and it happens.

1794
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,200
You on the other hand are middle class and got some money, you're to be fed on, pushed

1795
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:05,240
around, they're going to let you know to keep in line.

1796
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,240
Okay Alex, you know what you're doing, that's for sure.

1797
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:11,800
I would have the exact same response as that caller, you know what you're doing, Alex.

1798
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,640
Yeah, you lying piece of shit, you know what you're doing.

1799
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,640
Yeah, jeez.

1800
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:21,000
This is the same show where just an hour ago we were told you do not need a driver's license.

1801
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Right, with that caller.

1802
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1803
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,120
Sovereign Citizen shit.

1804
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:28,000
So there's a difference, I would say, between who gets to not have a driver's license and

1805
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
who...

1806
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
You're not meant to remember that.

1807
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Fair enough.

1808
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,400
On that same show we had Alex talking, you know, I was talking about that, like, if you're

1809
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:39,640
uncharitable you could hear him saying the minority, and you could hear that as him talking

1810
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:44,540
about, you know, minorities, non-white folk in his mind, or you could look at it as like

1811
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:48,520
criminals are a minority of the population and that's what he's talking about.

1812
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,960
This is not the same thing.

1813
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,960
Nope, nope.

1814
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,960
That's not this.

1815
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:52,960
This is explicit.

1816
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,960
Yeah.

1817
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,600
These guys aren't talking about undocumented immigrants or people who came here through

1818
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,400
improper channels or people who overstayed a visa, they're just talking about the blanket

1819
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:06,160
category of people who are immigrants, and this conversation is outrageously white nationalist

1820
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,160
at its core.

1821
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,160
Oh yeah.

1822
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1823
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,080
This caller is puzzling over how immigrants managed to get driver's licenses, which is

1824
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:15,280
a bit silly, and then Alex shoots the moon by arguing that immigrants are coming to be

1825
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,880
controlled by, quote, barrio bosses and instructed to take, quote, our rights away.

1826
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,880
You got it.

1827
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,880
The coded language is almost comically transparent here, and this walks hand in hand with the

1828
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:30,880
white nationalist ideas about the great replacement that get thrown around in more recent times.

1829
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,420
This is the way that conversation was had back then, and it's basically indistinguishable

1830
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,560
from white supremacist positions on immigration.

1831
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,560
Yeah.

1832
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,560
It's outrageous.

1833
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,760
I just see like a six year old Harrison Smith being like, man, I want to be worse than that

1834
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,760
someday.

1835
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,960
I want to be more explicit about exactly what I know he is saying.

1836
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,480
I want to take this game and push it a little farther.

1837
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,360
Yeah, let's go a little bit further to the racist.

1838
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,420
Oh boy.

1839
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:59,760
So Alex, uh, he gets to, he has this big point that he keeps making and that is that he can

1840
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:06,640
go on any show on any conservative, well, there's, there's a more to it.

1841
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,640
Okay.

1842
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,840
He could go on any show, conservative, liberal, normal, whatever, right in the middle center.

1843
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,840
Who gives a shit?

1844
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,960
He can go on any of these shows.

1845
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,300
They can take 30 calls.

1846
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,340
They all agree with him.

1847
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:16,340
Of course.

1848
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:20,080
They all agree with because he's so ideologically consistent and because everyone knows that

1849
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,480
Bush did nine 11.

1850
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,480
That's true.

1851
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:27,320
So he gets, he ends up role playing a little bit as some callers that he's fantasizing

1852
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,880
about talking to on these radio shows.

1853
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,280
And then I can be on some other station and take 20 calls and then one guy will call and

1854
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:40,520
he'll go, you're a liar, Bush isn't trying to take my guns and I'll go, well, actually

1855
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,760
the bill numbers, that's 22 Republicans are supporting it.

1856
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,760
And you're a line coming.

1857
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,720
I tell you, you liberals come up with some plans to confuse us and get us off track.

1858
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:56,520
George Bush would never, he's a Christian conservative and you've, and then the hustles

1859
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:01,000
say, well, actually he is supporting that and the gal go, Oh, well I still don't like

1860
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
this guy.

1861
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Get him off here.

1862
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,160
I just want to turn my guns in.

1863
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:10,160
I mean, they don't say that, but they say everything else up to that.

1864
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:14,120
So they're in a delusional world and I can be on Pacifica radio or something with all

1865
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:18,360
the, what you would call liberals and they're all calling in a green, making good points

1866
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:23,080
admitting the Democrats are corrupt too because if you're not hypocritical, they'll wake up.

1867
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:27,240
You got liberals calling in going, yeah, I see what you mean about owning guns.

1868
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,240
It makes a lot of sense.

1869
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,960
You know, the government's tyrannical.

1870
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,400
Why should we give our guns up?

1871
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,440
I'm going to realize what you're saying and I did hear Australia's crime rate exploded

1872
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:40,160
once they took the guns and then one person will call in and go, I bet you're racist,

1873
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,160
Mr. Jones.

1874
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,160
Aren't you?

1875
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,160
Yes.

1876
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,640
New World Order is a code word for some type of racial group you're a member of.

1877
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:49,480
And I go, no, actually the government's calling for New World Order and I'll go, wait a minute.

1878
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:56,000
You work for the government, don't you work in intelligence or for the FBI or for the,

1879
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,760
or do you work for some federal program where I work?

1880
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,760
Does it matter?

1881
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,760
I'll go, just answer the question.

1882
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,480
Well, yes, I work for the government.

1883
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:07,120
Well hey, whoa.

1884
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,080
This was one of the moments in the show where I was like, this is kind of feeling like the

1885
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,080
present.

1886
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,240
This is imaginary nonsense.

1887
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1888
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,240
This one's good.

1889
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:20,200
So I've heard that narrative arc of these callers discussed by Alex throughout his career.

1890
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,560
That's sort of, it's very normal.

1891
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,660
These seem to be archetypes of callers that he's imagined arguing with that he uses as

1892
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:30,640
examples for decades as dumb people he has to talk to.

1893
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:34,620
These people are used as caricatures of straw man arguments presenting things that are valid

1894
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,160
complaints about Alex.

1895
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:40,120
He uses these imaginary dumb callers as puppets to introduce these ideas like that he's a

1896
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:44,520
racist because then it's a lot easier to mock and discredit those ideas like that he's a

1897
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,520
racist.

1898
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,520
Yeah.

1899
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:51,120
You can hear Alex essentially laying out that him arguing that the Republican Party is corrupt

1900
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,960
is a way to get liberals who can admit that the Democrats are corrupt to wake up.

1901
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,960
Yeah.

1902
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:01,240
If you lie about him being hypocritical, they'll wake up and they won't know you're lying because

1903
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,660
you're not a malicious figure yet.

1904
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:08,040
This is a strategy and it's meant to make Alex look closer to the middle where this

1905
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,060
hypothetical Democrat is.

1906
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:13,820
The idea is for him to paint a picture where he and this liberal have more in common than

1907
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:18,140
they think and they only don't think so that they're more in common because these two corrupt

1908
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:21,640
political parties have told them that they're not similar.

1909
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,280
This is not true.

1910
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,620
Alex is light years to the right of the GOP.

1911
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:29,700
So what he's actually doing is trying to pull disaffected people of either party towards

1912
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,320
the extreme right.

1913
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:36,120
For people already in the Republican Party, this could mean becoming extremely right wing.

1914
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:40,360
For Democrats, this might mean becoming a jaded political nihilist, maybe embracing

1915
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:44,200
the GOP or just not voting for Democratic candidates.

1916
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:49,560
Ultimately, the political end result of the project Alex is engaging in is this.

1917
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,200
It's always about dragging people to the right while pretending there is no right or left,

1918
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,720
which serves the political interests of whichever viable political entity is furthest to the

1919
01:29:58,720 --> 01:29:59,720
right.

1920
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,720
Yeah.

1921
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,720
That's what he's doing.

1922
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,820
I am above the left right divide, Dan.

1923
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:10,520
They want to do all these taxes and things, and I just want to drink blood from the skulls

1924
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,360
of my enemies.

1925
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,120
What doesn't everybody get about that?

1926
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,120
Wake up, people.

1927
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,960
I'm above the left right divide.

1928
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,960
Right.

1929
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:23,740
I mean, if he was truly opposed to the left right divide or whatever, and someone was

1930
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:26,200
like a Democrat and they were like, oh, you know what?

1931
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,640
The Democratic Party does suck.

1932
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:31,120
I'm going to start exploring further left options.

1933
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,040
He should be just as into that, right?

1934
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,040
I mean.

1935
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,040
That's what I think.

1936
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,040
Yeah.

1937
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,040
Oh, no, he's not.

1938
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,040
Because the socialists are...

1939
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,040
There you go.

1940
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,040
Well, I mean, George Bush is a socialist.

1941
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,040
They're demons.

1942
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1943
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,040
Everybody's a socialist at this point.

1944
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,760
In the present day, he's a socialist of demons.

1945
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,760
We're not sure about that.

1946
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,760
That's fair.

1947
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:47,760
Could be a metaphor in 2003.

1948
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,160
Is he...

1949
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,520
He's anti-Reagan at this point, too, right?

1950
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,440
I haven't heard him bring up Reagan on this episode.

1951
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,440
Oh, that's true.

1952
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,440
I can't speak to that.

1953
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,440
That's true.

1954
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,440
Fair enough.

1955
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,440
He doesn't like anybody, from what I can tell.

1956
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,440
It does sound like that.

1957
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1958
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,160
That is like, you look back and you're like, ooh, gross, conservative.

1959
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,160
They were communists.

1960
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1961
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,520
Which I can...

1962
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:13,620
But you can totally see that kind of being attractive, especially at that time, whenever

1963
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:19,720
you look at the fact that both political parties are like, war is great, and let's do it all

1964
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,720
the time.

1965
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:25,440
And you're like, what's the fucking point of having either of these political parties

1966
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,720
if we're just going to wind up with a mission accomplished banner?

1967
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,720
Right.

1968
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:33,720
And I think that that is why something like Alex is super potent back then.

1969
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,720
Totally, totally.

1970
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,920
Because there are a lot of people who are right in the exact place that they need to

1971
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,400
be to hear a message like that and get sent down a road they don't know they're going

1972
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,400
down.

1973
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,400
Yeah, yeah.

1974
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:52,040
I would say it's hard to argue that, you know, Osama bin Laden didn't destroy an entire country

1975
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,520
by himself.

1976
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:54,520
It's kinda...

1977
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,520
He had compatriots.

1978
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,520
It's kinda a little...

1979
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:02,220
No, he had tons of compatriots, of course, but it's a little bit like, you know, 9-11

1980
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:05,840
really did defeat America.

1981
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,040
Alex does talk a bit about 9-11 on this episode, but not in a way that I felt like this is

1982
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,680
where we're gonna start picking into it.

1983
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,680
Sure.

1984
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,600
So as I look through the 2003 stuff, when he gets into more of it, I'll definitely...

1985
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,600
We'll see some more 9-11.

1986
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:23,480
Yeah, 9-11 will definitely be more of a topic than it has been in our show in the past.

1987
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:28,560
But I can't talk about it today because Alex, as he's talking about these callers that he

1988
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:34,000
gets on radio stations, he ends up talking about being on a show out in the UK, right?

1989
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And this...

1990
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,920
He got a call from a warden, a jail guard, and this is when...

1991
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,580
This is evidence that this show used to be a family show.

1992
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:50,560
I was on in England, and big national show, the James Whale Show, and it covers the whole

1993
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,560
country.

1994
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,560
We're getting calls from Scotland, Ireland, wherever.

1995
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,560
It's a big transmitter.

1996
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,560
A couple transmitters.

1997
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,560
Actually, there's a big one in London.

1998
01:32:55,560 --> 01:33:01,520
They can have like, you know, 500,000 watt AMs there.

1999
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:06,640
And I'm on the show, and they take like 20 calls.

2000
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,280
Everybody agrees with me.

2001
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:14,620
And one guy calls in, and he goes, I'd love to get you in a jail cell.

2002
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,480
I'd love to get you in there.

2003
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:21,000
And well, actually, the guy's threatening me, saying, yeah, you're gonna be...

2004
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
You're a traitor.

2005
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
You're a idiot.

2006
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
You're this and that.

2007
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,720
Don't talk about how my queen's German, because I pointed out their royal family isn't even

2008
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:27,720
there.

2009
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,040
You know, it isn't even British.

2010
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,040
And I said, wait a minute.

2011
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,840
You work for the government, don't you?

2012
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,280
He's like, yeah, I'd like to get you.

2013
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,280
I'd like to get you.

2014
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,560
And he hadn't even said yet that he was a jail guard.

2015
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,080
I go, you're a jail guard, aren't you?

2016
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,080
He goes, huh?

2017
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,080
Huh?

2018
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,080
I go, yeah, aren't you?

2019
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,520
And he goes, yeah, I'd like to get you in the cell, and I'd like to urinate on you.

2020
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,520
He's another word.

2021
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,520
I said, oh, oh.

2022
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,520
And the host was amazed.

2023
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,040
He goes, how'd you know that?

2024
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,480
I can just tell.

2025
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,480
Family show.

2026
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,480
I don't say piss on this show.

2027
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,480
Not back then.

2028
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2029
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:02,280
We're gonna adhere to these FCC rules.

2030
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,280
Yeah.

2031
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,280
No piss.

2032
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:08,480
I would say, I don't know, I haven't heard this radio interview, but I would guess that

2033
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,520
either this caller was like, yeah, I'm a jail guard.

2034
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,520
You did.

2035
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2036
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,520
Sure.

2037
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,520
I'm a jail guard.

2038
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,520
Fine.

2039
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,520
Or this didn't happen, and Alex is imagining it.

2040
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,520
Yes.

2041
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,460
It's interesting, though, Alex goes to spending five minutes talking about how he knew this

2042
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,460
guy was a jail guard.

2043
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:26,320
He's like, he had this tone of his voice where he's saying, I want to get you locked up.

2044
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,400
I want to get you locked up.

2045
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,540
And people only have this tone when they really want to do it.

2046
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:36,640
So I heard this guy's voice, and I knew that he either, either was a serial kidnapper or

2047
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,640
a jail guard.

2048
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,640
That was only two options.

2049
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:42,400
Most people who are smart kidnappers just become jail guards, because then they can

2050
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,140
do all that stuff, and it's legal.

2051
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:45,140
That sounds right.

2052
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,280
That makes intuitive sense.

2053
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,920
And this is how I read this guy's voice and knew that he was a jail guard.

2054
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:54,480
People who kidnap illegally just don't know what they're supposed to be doing, right?

2055
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,840
They just haven't found the right kidnapping job.

2056
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:02,000
It's a little annoying, but also kind of trivially fun.

2057
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,080
Like Alex is just wasting his time.

2058
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:09,760
It's such an annoying habit of so many people to tell you a story where somebody is acting

2059
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:15,060
so over the top, unreasonably, that it's impossible to believe.

2060
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:19,040
And you knew before he even started he was full of shit.

2061
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,040
Yeah.

2062
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,040
It's like, why am I here?

2063
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:25,840
So Alex gets back to calls, and this caller unfortunately has a terrible story of being

2064
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,840
canceled.

2065
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,920
And I'm calling you today because my local FM talk station has banned me from asking

2066
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,960
any questions concerning the Warren Commission because they say it was 40 years ago and it's

2067
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:41,600
so full of holes that they deny its even existence.

2068
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:47,400
It was all a big television drama, like when Ruby shot Oswald.

2069
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,400
But you know-

2070
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:53,000
Anybody who believes that Oswald acted alone, fine, I got a bridge, I want to sell you.

2071
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,280
This is like my favorite thing.

2072
01:35:55,280 --> 01:36:00,720
I love going back to this time in the past, and the callers are fucking callers.

2073
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,960
They're not like sycophant nonsense, I love your brain force now.

2074
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,880
It's a weirdo who can't call the local FM station anymore because he talks too much

2075
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,440
about the Warren Report.

2076
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:17,680
I'm not allowed there anymore because I refuse to discuss anything but 50 year old news.

2077
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,360
That's what I do here.

2078
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,480
I love that.

2079
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:27,200
That's a vibe I could listen to, like, I could listen to that forever.

2080
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:31,440
I'm not allowed on C-SPAN anymore because I won't stop talking about Fort Sumter.

2081
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,920
And it's bullshit, Alex, it's bullshit.

2082
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,400
The cancel culture is out of control.

2083
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,520
It's out of control.

2084
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:44,040
They won't let me harangue them for no reason about Fort Sumter.

2085
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,720
It's infuriating, Dan.

2086
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,720
I love it.

2087
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,760
Love it!

2088
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,320
So he gets another call, and this guy brings up the John Birch Society, which I teased

2089
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,200
would come up.

2090
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,320
Alex believes that the John Birch Society is mostly good.

2091
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,320
Yes.

2092
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,880
He's pretending that so much of his ideology isn't based on people who were in and adjacent

2093
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,880
to the John Birch Society.

2094
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:06,880
Unrelated.

2095
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:07,880
Unrelated to the John Birch Society.

2096
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,880
Very good.

2097
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,880
No.

2098
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:10,880
Unrelated.

2099
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:11,880
I learned everything separate from the John Birch Society.

2100
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,000
I did my own research, I definitely wasn't raised in a household filled with John Birch

2101
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
or literature.

2102
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,240
It was mostly John Birch Society stuff and sci-fi that he thought was real.

2103
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
That's mostly-

2104
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,240
Wow!

2105
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,800
That really does explain everything, doesn't it?

2106
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,800
Not everything, but a lot of it.

2107
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,800
It explains too much.

2108
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,800
Yeah.

2109
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,800
For a human.

2110
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,880
So, this made me laugh so fucking hard.

2111
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:35,080
If you get what he's talking about, don't yell it out.

2112
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,600
Just let this play out.

2113
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:44,960
There is an Oklahoma family who are begging oil and a bunch of other stuff who are actually

2114
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,200
involved in the founding of the John Birch Society, but the John Birch Society overall

2115
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,200
is good.

2116
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:54,920
Certainly, early on, not the Birchers, but other conservative groups have been used by

2117
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,120
the bankers.

2118
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:00,480
They'll tell some good conservative military man, that guy's a communist, go take him out,

2119
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:04,520
and they'll go do it and later take him out for plausible deniability.

2120
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:07,920
So many of our troops over there in Iraq now really are risking their lives and living

2121
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:13,920
in a third world cesspool bombed out stone age system because they really believe in

2122
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:14,920
this country.

2123
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:15,920
Yes, sir.

2124
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,620
But it is evil.

2125
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:18,840
Does that mean the troops are evil?

2126
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:19,840
No.

2127
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:20,840
It means they're ignorant.

2128
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,840
Thanks for the call, Spencer.

2129
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,840
I appreciate the call.

2130
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:23,840
Yeah.

2131
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:24,840
I should have gotten into that.

2132
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:29,680
Man, I had an article, big mainstream article on that family, how they funded the John Birchers

2133
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,640
and all the different things they do and how they are big supporters of Bush.

2134
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:37,040
I need to dig that back up and cover that.

2135
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,040
Hmm.

2136
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,880
I wonder who he's talking about.

2137
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,880
Is he talking about the Candyman?

2138
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:41,880
No.

2139
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,880
He's talking about Fred Koch.

2140
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,000
Oh, that's who he's talking about.

2141
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Son of a bitch.

2142
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Yeah.

2143
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
He's talking about the Koch family.

2144
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
That's right.

2145
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
They're in...

2146
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Oh my God.

2147
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I didn't think of them because of the Kansas thing.

2148
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Yeah.

2149
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,240
They started in Kansas, but Fred Koch eventually, you know, he'd go on to help Hitler build

2150
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,240
some oil refineries.

2151
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,240
Well, sure.

2152
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:03,560
And then he started a crude oil interest in Duncan, Oklahoma called Rock Island Oil and

2153
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,360
Refining Company.

2154
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,360
It's just amazing.

2155
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:12,880
Like in 2003, hearing Alex like, oh yeah, I heard about this big family that they fund

2156
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,360
to the John Birch Society and they support Bush.

2157
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,360
He doesn't know the name.

2158
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,000
He doesn't know anything about this.

2159
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Unreal.

2160
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,480
He's bathed in John Birch Society nonsense and he doesn't know the name of Fred Koch.

2161
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,480
So infuriating.

2162
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,480
Yeah.

2163
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:30,720
And then, you know, you think maybe if Citizens United had gone another way, none of us would

2164
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,160
be able to instantly pull Koch brothers names.

2165
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:35,160
Wouldn't that be lovely?

2166
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,160
Yeah.

2167
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,160
I don't know.

2168
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:42,320
I don't know if that's true, but certainly it made it worse.

2169
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:48,320
I think it's really interesting that like, I'm, you know, obviously I'm fascinated by

2170
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:56,240
particularly that era of anti-communist propaganda and sort of ideology.

2171
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:59,780
And so the John Birch Society is something that looms large and like obviously I've looked

2172
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:05,680
into it a bit and I know about the first meetings and the people and like, yeah, obviously Fred

2173
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,440
Koch was one of the founding members.

2174
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:13,740
Like, it's weird to me to think that Alex came from a family that clearly was Bertie.

2175
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:17,520
Maybe not full on members, but associates of members.

2176
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,120
And he doesn't, he doesn't understand like who the, who some of these players are.

2177
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:27,400
I mean, weren't they supposed to be cells that weren't necessarily connected to each

2178
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,660
other originally.

2179
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:33,520
So it's not like they had a hero worship of their founding members.

2180
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,840
No, but you would know.

2181
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,840
You would think.

2182
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:37,840
You would hope.

2183
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,840
But then again, Fred Koch didn't stay in it for all that long.

2184
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,840
Yeah.

2185
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,840
He was too busy with the Nazis.

2186
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,840
He's got shit to do.

2187
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:49,440
But then again, the Koch brothers were pretty involved with like Ron Paul.

2188
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,640
Yeah, that's true.

2189
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,640
I don't know.

2190
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,640
It's weird.

2191
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:55,360
It's weird that he would, he'd have this non-awareness.

2192
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,320
What an ignorant asshole.

2193
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,520
How dare he tell me that he knows anything.

2194
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,880
It does feel like he's not feigning ignorance.

2195
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:11,240
He does seem like he's frustrated that he doesn't know the name of this big Birch family.

2196
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,240
It's strange.

2197
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,240
Wild.

2198
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,240
Anyway, he gets another call.

2199
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,560
This is where we learned that Saddam Hussein may be on a beach.

2200
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,560
Hey Alex, my name is Nick.

2201
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,840
I was in the water about 22 years.

2202
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,520
Just some full information about Saddam Hussein.

2203
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:32,440
On the 14th of this past month, the Gulf News out of Dubai and the Iranian News Service

2204
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:38,320
both reported that the U.S. reached an agreement with Russia for $5 million cash in credit

2205
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,800
to get Saddam and 100 of his closest followers out.

2206
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:48,240
This past Thursday on Univision, one broadcast in the middle of the day said that Saddam

2207
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:53,920
Hussein had been spotted in Cuba with his family.

2208
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,920
Sounds about right.

2209
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:55,920
Okay.

2210
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:56,920
All right.

2211
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,920
Yep.

2212
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,920
Sounds about right.

2213
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
He's probably in Cuba.

2214
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:00,920
Yep.

2215
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:01,920
That makes sense.

2216
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,920
You know what I would do?

2217
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,120
Possible other explanation.

2218
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,680
Someone who looks like Saddam Hussein was seen in Cuba.

2219
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:08,520
You know what I would do if I was Saddam?

2220
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,280
Get closer to the United States.

2221
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:11,280
Good idea.

2222
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,640
That's a good plan.

2223
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,640
He'll never look.

2224
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,900
I'll take a boat from North Korea to Maine.

2225
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:23,560
We have one last clip here because Alex takes another call, and this person is into the

2226
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,440
Birch Society, and so there's a little bit more conversation about that.

2227
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,560
I think this is kind of interesting.

2228
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:34,760
First, let me say something about the John Birch Society.

2229
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,880
I was a member when I lived in Utah.

2230
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:43,040
I'm not a member now, but I do get the magazine, and they put out wonderful information.

2231
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,040
So you're still a member.

2232
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:49,680
I was going over some old ones the other day that go back into 98, and here they were telling

2233
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:59,080
about this threat of the World Trade Towers being bombed, and this is all a connection

2234
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:04,680
with Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and on and on and on.

2235
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,440
And how the government's going to blame that for it.

2236
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,440
Right.

2237
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:13,480
But the one thing I want to make clear, and this is for everybody, there's people that

2238
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:20,040
say things about Alex Jones and put out information about Alex Jones or John Stattmiller or somebody

2239
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,040
else.

2240
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,320
And this is a ploy.

2241
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:29,920
I remember back in the 50s and 60s, the Communist Party put out a propaganda.

2242
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,920
Divide and conquer.

2243
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:31,920
Right.

2244
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:32,920
And the same thing with MacArthur.

2245
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:38,040
I even hear conservatives talk about MacArthurism as though that was something evil.

2246
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:39,040
No, McCarthy was right.

2247
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,640
No, he wouldn't do what the human wanted, so he's bad, yeah.

2248
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,640
McCarthy was right.

2249
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,800
Well, McCarthy was right.

2250
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,120
The KGB files got released five years ago, and it turned out it was twice as bad than

2251
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,120
he thought.

2252
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,120
But it was okay when he said it was, hold on, let me say something.

2253
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:53,120
Hold on a second, ma'am.

2254
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:58,000
It was okay, ma'am, ma'am, it was okay when he said that it was just communist.

2255
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,200
When he figured out that, he said, wait, the army runs the communists, our army's giving

2256
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:05,400
them nukes and funding them, boom, he was out of there like that.

2257
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,400
Go ahead.

2258
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,840
So Alex has made up a fun story to try and pretend that Joseph McCarthy was right and

2259
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,760
his insane communist witch hunt, but that's all just bullshit.

2260
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,760
Yeah.

2261
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,240
Also, I love the moment there where he almost yells at her.

2262
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,720
Yeah, yeah, that is nice.

2263
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:20,200
That's a really polite, angry Alex.

2264
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:24,560
Yeah, yeah, that's better than now.

2265
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,560
Mm-hmm.

2266
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,560
Fuck off!

2267
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,560
Yeah.

2268
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,560
Look!

2269
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,040
Buy my shit!

2270
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:33,600
I would assume that those issues of the John Birch Society magazine that the caller's referring

2271
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,720
to, I think they have to do with the other time the World Trade Center was bombed back

2272
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,720
in 1993.

2273
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,720
You would think.

2274
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,120
That has something to do with that.

2275
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:45,000
I've noticed that a lot of conspiracy thinkers tend to ignore that that happened because

2276
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,520
it helps make sense of why people would have been talking about terrorists attacking the

2277
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,160
World Trade Center before 9-11.

2278
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:55,480
Yeah, it would be like, oh, so this guy already tried it?

2279
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:59,040
It would make sense for him to give it another go if he failed the first time.

2280
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,040
Yeah.

2281
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:06,400
They need for these conversations to be devoid of the context of the first bombing because

2282
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,160
otherwise it's like, yeah, of course.

2283
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,160
Yeah.

2284
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:10,480
That's a reasonable explanation for this.

2285
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:15,080
I find this really weird, because Alex is talking about, like, okay, so this caller's

2286
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:20,080
saying that there's a John Birch Society magazine from, like, 1998, it's talking about bombing

2287
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:24,160
of the World Trade Center, and Alex is like, yeah, and how the government will blame bin

2288
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:25,160
Laden.

2289
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,160
Yep.

2290
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,160
That's supposed to be his prediction.

2291
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,160
Yeah.

2292
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:32,440
So wait, now he's saying that the John Birch Society stuff from 1998 was making that prediction

2293
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:36,640
that he made in 2001 that also he stole from Bill Cooper.

2294
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:37,640
Yes.

2295
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,640
Yeah.

2296
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:43,960
He doesn't seem to be so eager to take credit as some kind of a prophetic person in terms

2297
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,960
of this at this point.

2298
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,960
Yeah.

2299
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:49,920
I would imagine the reason that he didn't make it to the four-year university was he

2300
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,760
couldn't keep himself from plagiarizing anything and everything in his sight.

2301
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,120
Yeah, it's possible.

2302
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,720
It feels like more of an individual at this point, though.

2303
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,720
I'll say that.

2304
01:45:58,720 --> 01:45:59,720
It does.

2305
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:00,720
That is true.

2306
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,720
Yeah.

2307
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:02,720
I was not-

2308
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,720
I mean, despite the Rush Limbaugh impression, they're very clear.

2309
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:05,720
Yeah.

2310
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:13,280
Well, I remember at that time, my dad had all the Limbaugh books and I was inundated

2311
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:18,000
with right-wing talk news radio, and I wasn't hearing this shit.

2312
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
That's for sure.

2313
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,720
I definitely wasn't hearing this.

2314
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:27,740
Some of this is a little weirder, but also I'm fascinated by how some of it is so one-to-one

2315
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:33,660
similar to the present, the way he deals with SARS, the way he's saying that they intentionally

2316
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:37,680
released foot and mouth from port and down.

2317
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:40,160
It's hauntingly similar.

2318
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:44,800
Those who learn to exploit in the past refuse to change anything so they can continue exploiting

2319
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,800
in the future, Dan.

2320
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,200
So I have one last question for you.

2321
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,320
What do you think about apples?

2322
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,460
They're pretty good.

2323
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:53,680
So what do you think about them apples?

2324
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:54,680
That's the real question.

2325
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,680
I'm fascinated.

2326
01:46:55,680 --> 01:47:02,520
I'm loving the past, and I can't wait to keep listening to this.

2327
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,520
Yeah.

2328
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,960
I can't wait to see how, as the Iraq war is clearly not over, how Alex deals with that.

2329
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:09,960
Yeah.

2330
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:13,200
The 2004 election, it's just nuts.

2331
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,800
We haven't done monthly investigations for a long time.

2332
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,320
I feel like this might be open-ended.

2333
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,960
This could be forever.

2334
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,960
Yes.

2335
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:22,800
But be not afraid.

2336
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:26,840
I will still also be keeping up on the present day, and I promise on our next episode we

2337
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:30,160
will check in and see what Alex is up to, whatever his dumb ass is talking about in

2338
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,160
the present.

2339
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:32,160
No kidding.

2340
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,160
See if it mirrors this.

2341
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:34,160
I know.

2342
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:35,160
Somehow.

2343
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,160
We'll see.

2344
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,880
But anyway, we'll be back.

2345
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,880
Until then, we have a website.

2346

Indeed we do.

01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:40,880

iTunes.

2356
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,440
And if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2357
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,640
doing God's work right now.

2358
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,640
Yep.

2359
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,640
We'll be back.

2360
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:56,640
But until then, I'm Neo.

2365
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,320
Cindy in Kansas, you're on the air.

2366
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,320
Thanks for holding.

2367
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,320
Hello Alex.
