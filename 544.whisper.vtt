00:00.000 --> 00:24.200
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

00:24.200 --> 00:31.200
fight, knowledge fight, I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are

00:31.200 --> 00:36.200
the bad guys, knowledge fight, Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight, Rattle Earth, Rattle Earth,

00:36.200 --> 00:42.200

00:47.200 --> 00:49.200
you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:49.200 --> 00:53.200
Hello Alex, I'm a person calling with your Japan, I love your word, knowledge fight,

00:53.200 --> 00:59.200
knowledge fight, knowledgefight.com, I love you.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.200
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.200
I'm Jordan.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.200
We're a couple dudes, like sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Alex Jones.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.200
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Jordan.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Dan.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
Jordan.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
Quick question.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
What's up?

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
What's your bright spot today?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
My bright spot today, Jordan, I think that one of the early bright spots when I moved

01:15.200 --> 01:18.200
into this apartment was that I had a junk drawer.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.200
Yes, that's true, yes.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.200
And to check back up on that, I'd like to make my bright spot today that I had my first

01:24.200 --> 01:26.200
real junk drawer moment.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.200
Where you were like, what the fuck did I put in here?

01:29.200 --> 01:32.200
No, I was like, of course I've got AA batteries.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.200
Oh no, not the junk drawer batteries moment.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.200
They've gotta be in there.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.200
You never win.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
I'm sure.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
You never win the batteries moment.

01:39.200 --> 01:45.200
So I was looking through the junk drawer and I found AAA batteries and no AA's it turns

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
out.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.200
You are issued AAA's whenever you move in somewhere and nothing fits AAA's.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.200
They always, like AAA's just come in a pack that's too big.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.200
You don't need as many as you think you do.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.200
Yeah, we'll give you 30 AAA's for one remote control.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.200
Yeah, I was going through there, there's like pencils, pens.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.200
I'm like, oh, I got a deck of cards in here.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
How about that?

02:02.200 --> 02:03.200
Yeah, why not?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
Great.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.200
It's your old timey Batman forever deck of cards.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.200
You remember those?

02:08.200 --> 02:10.200
It was a nice moment.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.200
It really felt like it's complete.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
You're home.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.200
I don't know if I feel home, but the drawer is fun.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.200
That's fair enough.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.200
How about you?

02:19.200 --> 02:23.200
Dan, my bright spot today is my support structure.

02:23.200 --> 02:28.200
My partner and you and the many people who helped me.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.200
It has been a very difficult few days between me and my brain.

02:33.200 --> 02:38.200
A week or so and not a good place to be.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.200
Sometimes my brain has been downright abusive towards me.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
Sure.

02:41.200 --> 02:47.200
So it is nice to have these amazing people in my life.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.200
Spoiler alert for the audience.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.200
I didn't talk to you at all yesterday.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
No, I know.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
I don't know what I did.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.200
You didn't do anything this year.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.200
Look, I mean, our employee boss relationship, I feel is strong.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.200
A rump.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.200
So it is nice to have that.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.200
It's a huge bright spot for me because there have been times

03:08.200 --> 03:12.200
in my life where that support structure was not around and

03:12.200 --> 03:14.200
I was teetering on a knife's edge.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.200
So it is a huge bright spot.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.200
Well, I love you, buddy, and I'm glad that you're feeling

03:19.200 --> 03:20.200
better now.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200
A little bit better, I assume.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.200
Let's do the show.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.200
Okay.

03:24.200 --> 03:28.200
And to sort of reverse the sort of, just because I'm

03:28.200 --> 03:31.200
uncomfortable by you saying such positive things, you know,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
you've really helped me a lot too as a support structure.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.200
So thank you.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.200
It's great.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.200
It's nice to be able to be in that position.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
Yeah, it's huge.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.200
Yeah.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.200
So Jordan, today we are going to, this is sort of like what

03:43.200 --> 03:46.200
we're doing today is also even kind of like my support.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
Okay.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
Self support.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Okay.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
All right.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.200
As Open Mic Eagle would say, what the fuck is self care?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.200
This may be self care for me.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.200
And we'll get to it here in a moment.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.200
But before we do, we've got to take a little moment to say

03:58.200 --> 04:01.200
hello and shout out to some new wonks.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.200
So first, Jason B. also had a birthday recently.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.200
Thank you so much.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.200
You are now a policy wonk.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
I'm a policy wonk.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
Thanks, Jason.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.200
And happy birthday to you.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.200
Also, BB.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Thank you so much.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
You are now a policy wonk.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.200
Also, BB just had a birthday recently.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
Turned 20 years old.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
How about that?

04:19.200 --> 04:20.200
Oh, my God.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.200
You're too young to listen to this show.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.200
Do you remember being 20?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
Oh, man.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
I don't.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.200
I mean, I literally don't.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.200
Congratulations, BB.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.200
You are now a policy wonk.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
I'm a policy wonk.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
Thank you, BB.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.200
Next, Jared spelled J-A-R-O-D.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
BS.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.200
That's two initials, not bullshit.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.200
That's Jared B to the S.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.200
Yeah.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.200
You're now a policy wonk.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.200
I'm a policy wonk.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
Thanks, Jared.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.200
Unclear when his birthday is.

04:45.200 --> 04:50.200
If you are a policy wonk, please put your birthday in there just so we can give you

04:50.200 --> 04:52.200
a happy birthday whether you like it or not.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.200
Next, greetings from the city formerly known as Portland's anarchist jurisdiction.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.200
Thank you so much.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.200
You are now a policy wonk.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
I'm a policy wonk.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.200
Thank you very much.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
Yeah.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.200
All of you, I suppose.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.200
Next, this is another person who had a birthday.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.200
On the 23rd, just missed it.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.200
Oh, that's close, though.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.200
But happy birthday, Cillian.

05:11.200 --> 05:16.200
You are now a policy wonk, as well as Janie, who is also now a policy wonk.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.200
But I don't know what Janie's birthday is.

05:18.200 --> 05:22.200
Anyway, Janie got in touch with us and wanted us to wish you a happy birthday, Cillian.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.200
Policy wonkery all around.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.200
I'm a policy wonk.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.200
Thank you very much to all of you.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.200
And while we're here, Killian Murphy, too.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.200
I think he had a birthday sometime.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.200
At some point.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.200
Yeah.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.200
And finally, Prop Comic Sans, thank you so much.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
You are now a policy wonk.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
I'm a policy wonk.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.200
Thank you very much.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.200
Prop Comic Sans.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
Good times.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
Yes.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.200
Now, Jordan, what we're doing today is...

05:44.200 --> 05:47.200
I've got a question for you.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
What's that?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.200
Do you like apples?

05:49.200 --> 05:50.200
Um...

05:50.200 --> 05:52.200
So what do you think about them apples?

05:52.200 --> 05:53.200
Okay.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.200
All right.

05:54.200 --> 06:01.200
Today, Jordan, what we got on our plate is I have found these old Alex Jones episodes.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.200
I've found episodes dating back to 2003.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.200
All right.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.200
And I have...

06:06.200 --> 06:10.200
So, how do you like them apples was relevant at the time, is what you're saying.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.200
Well, it was still out of date.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.200
It's a little bit late.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.200
It's still out of date, but okay.

06:14.200 --> 06:20.200
I found episodes going back to 2003, and I find Alex almost insufferable and very boring

06:20.200 --> 06:21.200
in the present day.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.200
Yeah.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.200
I don't want to ignore him in the present day, but I also don't want to be doing a show

06:26.200 --> 06:29.200
that is constantly just looking at him in the present day.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.200
Yeah.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.200
Because I find that to be dumb.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.200
I think it's worthwhile as a sort of social thing.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
Totally.

06:36.200 --> 06:41.200
But as an intellectual exercise, I don't really care all that much about listening to a guy

06:41.200 --> 06:43.200
constantly say he's fighting the devil.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.200
Totally.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.200
And then I'm supposed to take it seriously and be like, well, actually the devil started

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
as an idea.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
Right.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.200
Right.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.200
Right.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.200
I have no interest.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.200
I imagine that the audience does get a little bit bored with, I didn't listen to the third

06:56.200 --> 06:57.200
hour.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.200
It was too boring.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.200
So yeah.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.200
And a lot of times I did listen to it and I just say, okay, who cares?

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
There's nothing in there.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.200
Get the fuck out of here.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
Yeah.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.200
We will obviously still be talking about the present day, but for today I needed to go

07:09.200 --> 07:12.200
back as far back as I could.

07:12.200 --> 07:16.200
So today we are going to be talking about May 1st, 2003.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.200
Ooh.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.200
Is that when Christopher Lloyd guested?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.200
No.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.200
Christopher Lloyd, no guests on this episode.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.200
No guests.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.200
Okay.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.200
This episode is amazing for a number of reasons.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.200
There's a couple of things that blew my mind.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.200
Okay.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
I am convinced I'm a witch now.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.200
All right.

07:32.200 --> 07:39.200
And also I just, I, it's, it's a new day.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.200
It's a new day from 20 years ago.

07:43.200 --> 07:49.200
I find myself like getting these reinvigorations through like whenever I can find these old

07:49.200 --> 07:51.200
time frames to look back on.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.200
It really is recharging of my batteries and it's, it's, it's man.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.200
I like it.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.200
So Jordan, we start May 1st, 2003.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
Do you remember 2003 much?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.200
Do you remember what was going on in May?

08:02.200 --> 08:06.200
No, I told you, I don't remember.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.200
The Iraq war had just ended.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
Oh boy.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
Did we just mission accomplish?

08:10.200 --> 08:11.200
That was that day.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.200
That was that day.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
You are a witch.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.200
May 1st.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.200
You are a witch.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.200
May 1st, 2003 was the day that George Bush landed on the, uh, the aircraft carrier with

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
the mission accomplished banner.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.200
VI day as we all know it now.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.200
Yes.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.200
Victory was upon us.

08:28.200 --> 08:33.200
Um, and so, Hey, here's Alex and the, we're going to find out a number of things.

08:33.200 --> 08:38.200
Some of the things that are really interesting to me and I'm most excited to learn about

08:38.200 --> 08:44.200
are things like how is Alex Jones's opposition to Bush and the Iraq war?

08:44.200 --> 08:47.200
How does it exist when Bush is in office?

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
Right.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.200
How can we look at that through the prism of history in the context of knowing how he

08:52.200 --> 08:58.200
behaves in more generally as a pattern, how can we apply that to this source of material?

08:58.200 --> 09:00.200
And so it's interesting anyway.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.200
I believe you.

09:01.200 --> 09:06.200
Did you know that the new world order has a plan?

09:06.200 --> 09:11.200
It's how many years behind 18 years ago, it's coming into play.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
Okay.

09:12.200 --> 09:21.200
We are now following the exact model used by dictators to intensify their hold on population

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
on populations.

09:22.200 --> 09:29.200
Whether it was bill Clinton or George W. Bush, the agenda of the new world order is spiraling

09:29.200 --> 09:32.200
out of control.

09:32.200 --> 09:38.200
Years ago, I read a Pensacola news journal article that is on info wars.com.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.200
And one of our press releases about how during a red alert, you won't be able to leave your

09:42.200 --> 09:43.200
house and have any rights.

09:43.200 --> 09:51.200
You have a link to it in that story, the Marines took over the school and announced, this is

09:51.200 --> 09:52.200
Marshall law.

09:52.200 --> 09:56.200
Bill Clinton wants you to know what Marshall law is about.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.200
Bill Clinton wants you to know what Marshall law is about.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
I don't care.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.200
Immediately.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.200
I'm listening to this and I'm like, this dude is doing a voice.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.200
Yeah.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.200
I, I wanted to, I wanted to, he's performing.

10:11.200 --> 10:16.200
This is so weird because I was, I was literally writing down, like, I don't know how to describe

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
it, but he sounds fatter.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.200
I think it has something to do with the way he's filling up his arms with air.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.200
I think he's doing a bit of a rush Limbaugh impression.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.200
Oh yeah, totally.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.200
And I think that rush Limbaugh has a sound better.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.200
Yeah.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.200
I, I, it's just, it's remarkable.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.200
It sounds like a guy who thinks he's, you know, he knows he's doing radio totally.

10:37.200 --> 10:41.200
And, uh, God, it just, it's refreshing.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.200
Somebody trying.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.200
It's amazing.

10:43.200 --> 10:47.200
But apparently the, the globalist plan was falling apart back then to constantly falling

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
apart.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.200
It's like when you're, it's like when you're on a ship, you're constantly rebuilding the

10:51.200 --> 10:53.200
ship as you sail.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
That's how it's always worked.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.200
Is it?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.200
Yeah.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.200
Oh, I don't want to sail.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.200
Don't sail.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
It's really hard.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.200
So I can't find the original article that Alex is talking about from the Pensacola news

11:02.200 --> 11:06.200
journal, nor can I find articles about it on info wars and their archives.

11:06.200 --> 11:11.200
However, I did find a geo cities level website that's copied and pasted what's supposedly

11:11.200 --> 11:12.200
this article.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.200
So I'm going to go off of that.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.200
Okay.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.200
Reading the article, you can tell that what was going on there was a situation where this

11:18.200 --> 11:22.200
school called Hobbs middle school, it was part of a partnership with Whiting field,

11:22.200 --> 11:23.200
Naval air station.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.200
And, uh, the, uh, enlisted people coming to the school.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.200
It was part of them volunteering to help teach for a day.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.200
Yeah.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.200
They did this very basic presentation as if the military was in charge of the school to

11:34.200 --> 11:38.200
help the students better understand the issues that were facing the civilians in Kosovo at

11:38.200 --> 11:44.200
the time, as is clearly laid out as being effective in the article quote, one of Whitfield

11:44.200 --> 11:48.200
students, Julie McCool said the presence of the military personnel in her school made

11:48.200 --> 11:52.200
the news she'd been watching from Yugoslavia seem a little more real.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Sure.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.200
Which is great.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.200
It achieves an impactful lesson for the students.

11:56.200 --> 12:02.200
I mean, personally, I don't think any military should go anywhere near a middle school, but

12:02.200 --> 12:04.200
that's, that's just me.

12:04.200 --> 12:08.200
I mean, I assume that they weren't like, Hey, let's become fascist, but you know, what are

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
you going to do?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.200
Right.

12:10.200 --> 12:15.200
I mean, the idea of making the news real, uh, or helping the students understand it.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.200
Totally.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.200
There's a value to that.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.200
Totally.

12:18.200 --> 12:22.200
If you were growing as far as like hitting the kids with the butt of a gun, then I'm

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
out.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
Yeah.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.200
I don't want to, I mean, I, yeah.

12:26.200 --> 12:31.200
And I think that there also to sort of what you're saying, I think that, you know, I wouldn't

12:31.200 --> 12:36.200
be in favor of things that are basically like PR work for the armed forces directed at schools.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.200
That would kind of be a huge thing for me.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.200
I don't like that.

12:39.200 --> 12:44.200
I've been a Miyazaki fan for a long time and the military teaching children it's okay to

12:44.200 --> 12:46.200
be in the military is a big deal.

12:46.200 --> 12:52.200
I, from, from the article I, what I was getting from it is not so much that they were teaching,

12:52.200 --> 12:56.400
uh, that it's cool to be in the military, but it still has the effect of rubbing off

12:56.400 --> 13:00.200
and like maybe turning these people into icons that you look up to.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
Totally.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
Yeah.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.200
I can also see though, like how this kind of an activity could be a really positive,

13:05.200 --> 13:07.200
uh, as an educational tool for the students.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.200
So I'm kind of, I don't really have a position on it.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.200
On the one hand, it could have the effect of making these youths think that the army

13:13.200 --> 13:17.200
is super cool, but on the other hand, it also has the potential to open up the students

13:17.200 --> 13:20.200
to things they wouldn't have the chance to experience otherwise.

13:20.200 --> 13:25.200
For instance, from this article quote, last year, students from Hobbs and SS Dixon primary

13:25.200 --> 13:29.200
school communicated via email with a coast guard Lieutenant on a cruise bound for the

13:29.200 --> 13:34.200
South Pole and had a video teleconference with their friend once she got there.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.200
That could be a really neat opportunity for students to learn directly about all sorts

13:38.200 --> 13:42.200
of things in a way that's much more real than reading about the South Pole in a book.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.200
And that could be a positive thing.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.200
Yeah, sure.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.200
What's it like on the boat?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
Have you ever seen a man die?

13:48.200 --> 13:49.200
We have to keep rebuilding.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.200
You've never seen a man die before.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.200
I've seen two men die in my arms.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.200
Also, it's important-

13:55.200 --> 13:56.200
I don't know where that voice came from.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.200
That was a weird voice.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.200
Yeah, that was a weird voice.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
My bad.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
That's a 2003 voice.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
Sorry about that.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
Also, it's important to keep in mind that these are middle school students.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.200
I would be opposed to this being done with an elementary school since I don't know how

14:07.200 --> 14:09.200
well second graders could process any of this.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.200
Totally.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.200
That's how you get Alex Jones.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.200
Yeah, but by middle school, the kids should be exactly at the point where this could be

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
a great experience for them.

14:16.200 --> 14:21.200
They're not too young to process it and not too old to think that it's really dumb once

14:21.200 --> 14:22.200
they're in high school.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
Yeah.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.400
I think this is an article from March 1999, so it's nice to see that even in 2003, Alex

14:28.400 --> 14:29.920
doesn't deal with new news.

14:29.920 --> 14:36.440
I kind of was thinking it's 2003 and we're listening about Clinton and Kosovo, and while

14:36.440 --> 14:42.200
I do think that that is a very important historical thing for us to learn, it's the Iraq War!

14:42.200 --> 14:43.200
Yeah, yeah.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
Yeah.

14:44.200 --> 14:48.520
And if you're talking about militarization of police post 9-11, obviously, certainly

14:48.520 --> 14:53.260
a topic worth conversing about, but if one of the things that you're leading the show

14:53.260 --> 14:58.840
with is like the military coming into a school in Pensacola, like that was pre-9-11.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.240
You just need to, there's better ways to do this.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.640
You used to be able to just walk on a plane.

15:04.640 --> 15:09.080
Whenever the military was at this school, you could walk onto a plane.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.080
Yeah.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.080
Yeah.

15:11.080 --> 15:16.600
So that story from the past is being woven in with a new headline Alex has read about.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.520
Now I have this article, Fox News.

15:18.520 --> 15:23.520
Young Marines teach kids discipline integrity, and it turns out it's an anti-drug, anti-gun

15:23.520 --> 15:30.120
program, and they teach the kids if they join the globalists they get to have guns, if not,

15:30.120 --> 15:31.120
it's over.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.080
It's all part of pure evil.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.880
So this doesn't really relate at all.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.420
No, it doesn't sound like it.

15:37.420 --> 15:41.540
That four-year-old story was about a day when military, uh, volunteers, they created an

15:41.540 --> 15:43.880
educational experience at a middle school.

15:43.880 --> 15:49.160
This is more or less just a press release about a youth program run by former Marines.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.400
The Young Marines is basically a more discipline-focused version of the Scouts, and it's run by the

15:53.400 --> 15:57.360
Marine Corps League, which is a social organization for former Marines.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.260
They basically put kids in boot camp-like conditions and have them eat MREs in order

16:01.260 --> 16:03.320
to build strength and discipline.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.240
From everything I can tell, it's definitely an anti-drug program, but I did not get the

16:07.240 --> 16:08.440
sense that it's anti-gun.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.300
I would have hated being in this group, and I think it seems kind of fucked up, but the

16:13.300 --> 16:17.560
only way anyone's going to go to it is if they and their parents agree to take part

16:17.560 --> 16:20.760
in it, so I'm not going to spend too much time complaining about their choices.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.280
Yeah, you guys do what you do.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.920
I don't have time for it.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.640
The Iraq War is just going on.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.200
It's frankly, the Iraq War is just beginning.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.040
When that Mission Accomplished sign up was the beginning of the Iraq War.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.240
No it did not.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.680
No it did not.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.040
That was way back when.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.040
Yeah, yeah.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.920
Oh man, we really thought we were going to get out of there, Dan.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.320
I don't know if I thought that back then.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.520
I absolutely did not.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.060
I thought these guys were going to fuck everything up and we were all going to die.

16:48.060 --> 16:51.520
So Alex is above the political divide, the left-right paradigm.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.520
Sure.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
All this stuff.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.520
Talking about Clinton in 2003.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.800
He's above the left-right paradigm.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.800
48's Bush too.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.800
True.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.880
Now, here's where things get a little muddy.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.960
Oh, I got news of conservative states gun-grabbing all across the country.

17:04.960 --> 17:11.880
Wait until you hear about this, again, conservatism now is a byword for big government, no freedom,

17:11.880 --> 17:12.880
condoms, abortion, everything.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.880
Everything?

17:13.880 --> 17:22.640
They are ultra-liberals, they are winning the war, destroying America because the liberals

17:22.640 --> 17:24.800
learned how to dress up like conservatives.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.680
It happened, folks, it happened.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.520
It's pretty illuminating to me because it's really the core of Alex's fake presentation

17:30.520 --> 17:32.600
of being above two-party shit.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.220
He's presenting a position where the conservatives out there are actually secret liberals, which

17:36.220 --> 17:40.880
is why the two parties don't matter, because they're both not far enough to the right.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.720
Therefore they're actually the same thing.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.440
That's what his being above the two-party system is.

17:46.440 --> 17:51.880
Yeah, I'm above the two-party system because I want to destroy them and institute a theocracy.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.600
What don't you understand?

17:53.600 --> 17:57.720
It would be fine for Alex to just openly advocate that he feels alienated by politics because

17:57.720 --> 18:01.960
he's way far to the right of anything that exists in polite society.

18:01.960 --> 18:06.340
But even in 2003, he knows that's not going to appeal to a wide audience, so he plays

18:06.340 --> 18:11.060
the game of being like, oh, the left and the right is a lie, and you know why?

18:11.060 --> 18:15.920
If you actually are conservative, you've got to be an extremist to the right because these

18:15.920 --> 18:19.760
really hardcore right-wing people are actually secret liberals.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.440
That makes sense.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.640
Great.

18:25.640 --> 18:33.580
So, at this point, there was talk of the need for the provisional government in Iraq sorting

18:33.580 --> 18:40.140
out how to set up a system there once we were to withdraw, which as we know from living

18:40.140 --> 18:42.520
in 2021 didn't go great.

18:42.520 --> 18:49.480
Well, it turns out that crony capitalism combined with colonialism does not work out well for

18:49.480 --> 18:50.480
anyone.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.480
Isn't that crazy?

18:52.480 --> 19:01.440
U.S. reported to push for Iraqi government with Pentagon prevailing, and they are appointing

19:01.440 --> 19:06.840
the members of the Ba'ath Party, the torture lords and others trained in the U.S. in the

19:06.840 --> 19:11.800
80s and the 70s, all CIA, of course.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.680
They are another easy victory for them.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.800
They're going to be running things.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.160
And we'll get to that for you as well.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.280
I don't know how to read Alex's tone there.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.600
I really don't know what, he's being facetious, or?

19:23.600 --> 19:24.600
Yeah, I was going to say.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.160
There's kind of a smugness to it more than a facetiousness.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.720
I mean, they hadn't really announced de-Ba'athification at that time, did they?

19:30.720 --> 19:31.720
That's what I'm talking about.

19:31.720 --> 19:32.720
Did they?

19:32.720 --> 19:33.720
No, no.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.720
It's a couple weeks after this.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.720
Oh yeah, that's what I was saying.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.240
But yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.

19:38.240 --> 19:42.880
I was like, does Alex not know that that's a major thing that ends up happening?

19:42.880 --> 19:47.880
And it's a major thing that ends up contributing to the massive destabilization in Iraq.

19:47.880 --> 19:53.240
So is he being facetious in such a way that these idiots are trying to get rid of the

19:53.240 --> 19:58.040
Ba'ath Party, or is he actually thinking that the Ba'ath Party is what's going to continue

19:58.040 --> 19:59.040
going on?

19:59.040 --> 20:02.760
Well, I think that based on the context that I've gleaned from listening to the rest of

20:02.760 --> 20:08.640
this episode, I believe that Alex thinks that the CIA is running the Ba'ath Party and all

20:08.640 --> 20:14.440
the people with Saddam and all this, like Saddam was allowed to get away to some island

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
somewhere.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.440
Okay, okay.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.000
How did that work out?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.600
How did that prediction work out?

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
Didn't go great.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
Didn't go great?

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
Didn't end up correct.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.800
He was in a hole.

20:23.800 --> 20:29.920
But he, Alex, I think he thinks that the Ba'ath Party loyalists and folks who the CIA were

20:29.920 --> 20:34.400
trained up and all this will pretend that they weren't part of the Ba'ath Party or whatever,

20:34.400 --> 20:40.160
and then they will become the people who are the puppets for the US within Iraq moving

20:40.160 --> 20:41.160
forward.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.880
Okay, so he didn't assume that the CIA would betray them like they always do?

20:44.880 --> 20:48.240
I think that that's where he's going.

20:48.240 --> 20:51.320
And that actually is one of the things that I, when I was listening to this, I'm like,

20:51.320 --> 20:53.800
that's actually something I really want to track.

20:53.800 --> 20:58.560
I'm interested to see how Alex's tone goes during the Ba'athification.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.420
Yeah, that is interesting.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.360
Because should he be for or against it?

21:03.360 --> 21:04.360
I don't know.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.480
That's a really good question.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.760
That requires a nuance that Alex is absolutely incapable of now.

21:09.760 --> 21:14.120
2003, Alex, I think is still incapable of it, but I'm interested to find out.

21:14.120 --> 21:19.800
Because at this point, it seems like he's opposed based on this to the Ba'ath Party

21:19.800 --> 21:21.600
members being allowed in the government.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
Yes, right.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.200
But then, based on his political ideology, he should be super against how the blanket

21:26.200 --> 21:30.520
banning of Ba'ath Party members from all sorts of positions of influence went down.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
Yeah.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.440
It just seems like he can't possibly be for either.

21:34.440 --> 21:35.440
Yeah.

21:35.440 --> 21:40.080
What would, what could possibly, oh, oh, I know what could, the only thing that Alex

21:40.080 --> 21:46.400
could be for is like, we forced all of them to believe in Jesus as their Lord and Savior

21:46.400 --> 21:47.400
now.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.840
I'm not coming at this with too much of a 2021 Alex Jones.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.640
You're right, but I'm bitter and angry.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.640
What am I supposed to do, Dan?

21:53.640 --> 21:59.360
I understand, but we have to look at this through, like, obviously you can't have perfectly

21:59.360 --> 22:00.360
naive eyes.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.360
Sure.

22:01.360 --> 22:04.600
But you have to, you have to look at this as like a different, a different time frame.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.800
As a different person.

22:05.800 --> 22:06.800
It's a different person.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
Well, it's the same person.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.800
Well, it's the same person.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
And you'll see a lot of similarities.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.600
Okay, well see, now this is why I'm bitter and angry.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
Sure.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
Yeah.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.800
One of the things I noticed while I was listening to this is that he is definitely way more

22:18.800 --> 22:24.440
doing a radio show and he goes to calls and then he'll get back to a story and then later

22:24.440 --> 22:25.960
get back to some calls.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.240
Like he jumps around like a lot of normal talk radio shows do.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.240
It's a radio show.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.040
And he, he's just doing a fucking rush impression.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.760
Like this is outrageous.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.440
You go to places where you can't go and buy a gun and have one in your house legally and

22:38.440 --> 22:39.440
lawfully.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.440
You got a lot of crime.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.440
Crime!

22:41.440 --> 22:47.000
Now that's a fact, ladies and gentlemen, that cannot be ignored or avoided.

22:47.000 --> 22:55.200
And we know that when a state has a low threshold of gun control, where you have more liberty

22:55.200 --> 23:01.880
and some semblance of a second amendment left, you have the lowest crime rates.

23:01.880 --> 23:09.000
Because even a crackhead or junkie won't invade your home when you're there because they know

23:09.000 --> 23:13.600
there's a 50-50 chance they're going to get killed.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.200
So I just, I heard that and I was just like, this is just Alex doing an impression of right-wing

23:17.200 --> 23:18.200
talk.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
That's not Alex.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.200
That's brutal.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.200
Yeah.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.600
And that sort of more guns is less crime kind of thing.

23:22.600 --> 23:26.000
That's a talking point we've covered exhaustively because he talks about it all the time throughout

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
all of his career.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Yeah.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
It's not true.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.560
But when I was listening to this, I felt like I can see how someone would hear that and

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
believe it.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
Yeah.

23:35.560 --> 23:41.560
And it kind of intuitively makes sense that why, if I were a criminal, why would I risk

23:41.560 --> 23:44.840
going somewhere where someone has a gun as opposed to somewhere where someone doesn't

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
have a gun?

23:45.840 --> 23:46.840
Sure.

23:46.840 --> 23:47.840
That makes intuitive sense.

23:47.840 --> 23:52.400
And if you have someone like Alex saying this authoritatively and almost sort of mocking

23:52.400 --> 23:56.920
the alternative, why wouldn't you just assume, why this guy knows what he's talking about?

23:56.920 --> 23:57.920
It makes sense.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.920
Yeah.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.880
But you know, sometimes intuitive things are incorrect and this is one of them.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
Yeah.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.160
And I mean, it's the same way that people think about the death penalty of like, well,

24:07.160 --> 24:13.000
if the consequence is so high, then that should act as a deterrent in the same, you know,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.480
it's it makes sense to the macro where it's like, well, obviously we're not getting into

24:16.480 --> 24:19.960
a nuclear war because of mutually assured destruction.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.320
So that's a deterrent against doing that.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.720
But they, you know, you're fucking hungry, man.

24:25.720 --> 24:30.200
You know, like that's, that's a bigger deal than whether or not you're researching the

24:30.200 --> 24:34.920
possibility that this home you need to do it, you know, like that kind of thing.

24:34.920 --> 24:35.920
Yeah.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.920
It doesn't make sense in the micro level.

24:36.920 --> 24:37.920
No.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.920
Yeah.

24:38.920 --> 24:39.920
That's a, that's a good way to put it.

24:39.920 --> 24:40.920
Yeah.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.920
So, uh, George Bush, how would you describe his politics like on the spectrum of right

24:44.920 --> 24:45.920
to left?

24:45.920 --> 24:55.560
Um, ooh boy, I would put him in the, the, the like, not far right, not center, right.

24:55.560 --> 25:00.160
That sweet spot of like, yeah, I want to kill everybody, but I want them to think I'm nice

25:00.160 --> 25:01.240
while I do it.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.200
Would you call him conservative?

25:03.200 --> 25:05.800
Uh, compared to now?

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
Yes.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.880
Well, you're wrong on all counts.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.880
Oh, okay.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
Bush isn't conservative.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.440
His cabinet isn't conservative.

25:12.440 --> 25:18.400
They are the most socialistic creatures ever seen in U S history, but they're just puppets

25:18.400 --> 25:20.040
carrying out the agenda.

25:20.040 --> 25:24.220
If you had Al Gore in office, things would be worse than it was under Clinton and whoever's

25:24.220 --> 25:29.560
in office next, it's going to be worse than under George W because of their puppets, their

25:29.560 --> 25:30.560
front man.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
Yeah.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.560
So he's a super socialist.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
Yeah.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.560
He's a super socialist.

25:34.560 --> 25:39.600
He's the most socialistic creature in history and all of Bush's cabinet too.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.600
Okay.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
All right.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.600
All right.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.680
Uh, Oh boy, that's not good.

25:44.680 --> 25:45.680
That cabinet.

25:45.680 --> 25:49.920
See now that's, that's a cabinet filled with pure psychopaths.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.760
That's the thing about George W. Bush.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.680
I don't think he gave a shit.

25:53.680 --> 25:57.800
I think he just filled this cabinet with a shit ton of psychopaths who wanted to murder.

25:57.800 --> 26:00.160
Let's see if we can surround this team.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.720
Just get it full of weirdos.

26:01.720 --> 26:02.720
Yeah.

26:02.720 --> 26:07.640
Four out of at least at least four of the people in George Bush's cabinet had personally

26:07.640 --> 26:12.720
strangled a person, you know, like that kind of level of psychopathy excited to see the

26:12.720 --> 26:15.600
2004 election happen.

26:15.600 --> 26:21.800
Anyway, this next clip I think is, is, is wild because Alex is talking about how he

26:21.800 --> 26:27.080
doesn't feel bad for Saddam, which obviously I guess that means that he doesn't feel bad

26:27.080 --> 26:30.720
that Saddam's missing or out of power.

26:30.720 --> 26:35.440
It's hard to feel bad for Saddam, but Alex, based on things he says later, I think he

26:35.440 --> 26:37.620
thinks he's on an Island somewhere.

26:37.620 --> 26:39.320
So I mean, obviously don't feel bad for him.

26:39.320 --> 26:44.000
Well, I mean, it's not like Saddam was Napoleon where they're like, okay, we got to exile

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
you.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.680
That's our solution to this problem.

26:46.680 --> 26:51.160
And then Alex gives a voice to some stuff that I can actually get, you know, appreciate

26:51.160 --> 26:57.120
that is that he feels bad for the citizens in Iraq, the people in the, on the ground

26:57.120 --> 27:00.360
who are being affected by this stuff.

27:00.360 --> 27:05.620
But if you pay attention to this, this, this is one of these indications that you can get

27:05.620 --> 27:12.160
that Alex, even this empathetic kind of vibe that seems really grounded and decent is actually

27:12.160 --> 27:17.160
rooted in just fervent anti-government sentiment.

27:17.160 --> 27:22.560
Of course, Saddam is a bucket of trash, of course, he's evil.

27:22.560 --> 27:27.060
The CIA hired him folks in 58 as a hit man, told him to invade Kuwait.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.880
I mean, yeah, he's a bad guy, folks.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.540
So I'm not sad for Saddam.

27:31.540 --> 27:36.040
I am sad for the Iraqi people that are being mowed down in large piles by the hundreds.

27:36.040 --> 27:42.200
If they dare to protest and one child throws a rock, I am sad for the US citizen, the young

27:42.200 --> 27:45.300
college girl unarmed, run over by a bulldozer.

27:45.300 --> 27:51.560
He then savagely backed back over her in the giant armored army bulldozer.

27:51.560 --> 27:56.200
I am sad for the AP and Reuters cameramen that are being shot by Israeli snipers in

27:56.200 --> 27:59.480
the head as they wear vests that say press.

27:59.480 --> 28:04.600
I am sad for the police officers killed by their own SWAT team members.

28:04.600 --> 28:11.480
I am sad for the people being shot down by corrupt cops and having guns planted on them.

28:11.480 --> 28:17.680
I am sad, ladies and gentlemen, for the people being abused by government worldwide.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.960
It's all in service of just strong anti-government positions.

28:21.960 --> 28:27.760
Yeah, I don't see him caring as much now about the hundreds of millions that were slaughtered

28:27.760 --> 28:30.100
by the United States government.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.840
But you know, what are you going to do?

28:31.840 --> 28:35.560
No, I can't expect him to continue caring about these people.

28:35.560 --> 28:36.920
It's over after today.

28:36.920 --> 28:40.600
Yeah, and that's part of the reason that I think it's really interesting, because he's

28:40.600 --> 28:44.760
saying a lot of the things that are right, but it doesn't feel like it comes from a place

28:44.760 --> 28:49.120
of any solid center to it.

28:49.120 --> 28:54.400
It doesn't feel like it's based on intrinsic belief as much as it is on... well, I guess

28:54.400 --> 28:57.360
it is, but the intrinsic belief is opposition to government.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:58.960 --> 29:04.200
I'm a little bit taken aback because it seems like I want to say that this is a slicker

29:04.200 --> 29:05.200
show already.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.200
A little bit.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.840
I mean, that's because I was just completely out of control in the present day.

29:09.840 --> 29:17.880
Exactly, but it's hard to like, oh, well, see, just because he's...

29:17.880 --> 29:22.800
I would say it's almost more disingenuous by being a slicker show.

29:22.800 --> 29:28.360
Yeah, I agree with that, and I think that that's part of the reason why I feel reinvigorated

29:28.360 --> 29:32.320
by this, because I can see how someone would believe it.

29:32.320 --> 29:36.740
I can see how someone listening to a clip like that could be like, yeah, this guy gets

29:36.740 --> 29:37.740
it.

29:37.740 --> 29:38.740
He does get it.

29:38.740 --> 29:43.060
That is fucked up that US troops are killing civilians overseas.

29:43.060 --> 29:45.160
That is fucked up.

29:45.160 --> 29:52.080
And that is the way that Alex baits the hook to get people to fall into his anti-government

29:52.080 --> 29:53.080
shit.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.080
Totally.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.080
No, it seems reasonable.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.080
It's fascinating.

29:56.080 --> 30:07.920
It's so disingenuous and so evil, just evil, you know, to hide your like, I'm a Joan Bircher

30:07.920 --> 30:13.040
behind like, hey, it's wrong to kill civilians, because his answer is, yeah, it's wrong to

30:13.040 --> 30:15.920
kill civilians until I want to.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.760
You know, it's that kind of situation.

30:17.760 --> 30:23.720
And he just leaves out that last part, which in the present day, he kind of leaves it in.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.160
Yeah, he mostly leaves it in.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.120
Yeah, he mostly leaves it in now.

30:27.120 --> 30:32.360
So we'll get to a lot more of this like overt trickery, because I think you see some pretty

30:32.360 --> 30:35.240
stark examples of it later on.

30:35.240 --> 30:39.020
And actually, the John Birch Society comes up later in an interesting way.

30:39.020 --> 30:41.480
But before we get there, Alex has another headline.

30:41.480 --> 30:49.360
This is about Tom Ridge, Homeland Security, wanting to institute an ID system for livestock

30:49.360 --> 30:58.240
due to a concern largely about the vulnerabilities within the food chain, the ability to know

30:58.240 --> 31:02.760
if there's a diseased cattle somewhere that causes blah, blah, blah.

31:02.760 --> 31:07.360
So Alex reads this headline, and apparently it's all about like more taxes or something.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.800
Ridge favors national ID system for livestock.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.980
Do you know how bad this is?

31:11.980 --> 31:18.680
A whole layer of government bureaucracy in your life, harassing you, taxing you, oh yes,

31:18.680 --> 31:21.600
a whole new bureaucracy knowing everything you've got.

31:21.600 --> 31:30.640
Your cats, your dogs will be pigs, sheep, goats, cows, horses, a whole layer of tax.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.880
You'll have a registration fee every year on your animal.

31:32.880 --> 31:38.480
Why don't you keep the homeland and the food supply safe?

31:38.480 --> 31:43.040
Seems to be mocking the idea of protecting the food supply.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.440
Now that's interesting, because that does fit the tone of some of the rest of his coverage

31:46.440 --> 31:47.600
throughout the show.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.940
But what it doesn't fit is the tone of one of his commercials.

31:51.940 --> 31:52.940
Are you prepared?

31:52.940 --> 31:55.800
Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.480
Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
America.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.960
Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.360
An attack on our food supply would be devastating.

32:06.360 --> 32:10.120
Jerry Guadetti from the ARC Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility

32:10.120 --> 32:11.120
for years.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.240
Yeah, so it's so weird.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.720
Okay, all right.

32:14.720 --> 32:21.280
I can see how conflicting messages would cause problems for early listeners to the show.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.300
I was listening to this and it seemed very bizarre.

32:23.300 --> 32:27.640
It's like, okay, your editorial's out of sync with your advertising at this point.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.780
That's why you're not raking in the cash.

32:29.780 --> 32:30.780
That could be an issue.

32:30.780 --> 32:31.780
Yeah.

32:31.780 --> 32:32.780
That could be a problem.

32:32.780 --> 32:33.780
Very weird.

32:33.780 --> 32:37.920
Ted Anderson is still selling crap to his show.

32:37.920 --> 32:42.800
That's a survival seed company, so obviously it would be in their best interest from an

32:42.800 --> 32:49.520
advertising perspective to drum up the fears of the damage to the food chain and the food

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
supply.

32:50.520 --> 32:55.840
Meanwhile, Alex has an interest politically in painting that as more government and more

32:55.840 --> 32:56.840
taxes.

32:56.840 --> 32:57.840
Of course.

32:57.840 --> 32:58.840
They're going to tax your cat.

32:58.840 --> 33:02.400
He says, loving ice.

33:02.400 --> 33:05.340
So I don't know, man.

33:05.340 --> 33:10.000
When you were in school, do you like playing games at recess?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Yeah.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Did you ever play foursquare?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Sure.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Foursquare was great.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.760
No black magic, no cherry bombs.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.240
No black magic.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.340
If you threw a cherry bomb, you're out.

33:19.340 --> 33:21.880
You're kicked out because then you have to chase after the ball.

33:21.880 --> 33:26.080
I don't even remember what any of that means, but I remember exhaustive conversations.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.680
There were a lot of rules.

33:28.680 --> 33:34.860
That was the beginning of when you first find out about the kid who's like, oh no, he's

33:34.860 --> 33:36.360
going to take his ball, isn't he?

33:36.360 --> 33:37.360
He's going to take his ball.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.360
Oh shit.

33:38.360 --> 33:39.360
Now we don't know how.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.360
Now we have nothing to play with.

33:40.360 --> 33:45.560
I remembered the conversation of rules more than I remember foursquare itself.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.560
Totally.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.560
Well, here's the good news.

33:47.560 --> 33:48.880
Foursquare is still legal.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.600
However, dodge ball has been banned.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.600
All over?

33:52.600 --> 33:56.200
Maybe you haven't heard, but it's been on television.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.560
I know schools right here in Texas, parents right here in Texas that have called in on

33:59.560 --> 34:00.560
the show about it.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.360
It's been in the news.

34:02.360 --> 34:06.520
Dodge ball has been banned almost nationwide.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.400
I remember our favorite game.

34:08.400 --> 34:13.720
In fact, the girls, the, you know, the kids that weren't that big, the runts, everybody

34:13.720 --> 34:14.720
loved dodge ball.

34:14.720 --> 34:18.200
I mean, everybody would hooray to play it.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.200
Everyone loved it.

34:19.200 --> 34:22.720
And you know, if somebody didn't like it, that's the way sports are.

34:22.720 --> 34:27.840
That's the way PE should be when you're six years old, seven year old, eight year old,

34:27.840 --> 34:31.960
10, 12, usually play, I guess when you're about 10 or 12, they banned it.

34:31.960 --> 34:36.320
And then I read a report about a month ago where they arrested kids, two or three of

34:36.320 --> 34:41.720
them, criminal charges of assault because they would meet before school.

34:41.720 --> 34:47.160
I remember doing stuff like this, but we would, we would wrestle, we would wrestle and knock

34:47.160 --> 34:51.880
our teeth out and break our noses and the coaches would come around and go, you guys

34:51.880 --> 34:52.880
watch it.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.880
You're going to get hurt.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.160
Do that on the mats with your head gear.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.160
Get in here.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.720
I'm giving you a SWAT.

34:57.720 --> 35:04.680
You know, you'd, they'd take you to the nurse and fix your lip and you'd get a pop for wrestling

35:04.680 --> 35:05.680
without head gear.

35:05.680 --> 35:11.880
But the point is now the kids will secretly get behind the school with their dodge balls.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.960
Just a little bit of freedom.

35:13.960 --> 35:21.800
I can't find any stories about students getting arrested for pre-school hours, dodge ball

35:21.800 --> 35:22.800
games.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.200
That's such a, I hate those.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.740
I hate that shit so much.

35:26.740 --> 35:32.560
Like one, it seems silly now not to realize that dodge ball at that age is essentially

35:32.560 --> 35:34.720
a way to facilitate bullying.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.720
Yes.

35:35.720 --> 35:39.280
It's like, I'm happy playing a dodge ball as an adult.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.280
That makes perfect sense.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.400
We all know the game.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.320
We're all doing a great job as a kid.

35:43.320 --> 35:48.240
You're just like so many guys just picked on the smallest, like Alex is like, everybody

35:48.240 --> 35:49.400
loved to play the game.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.520
He wasn't the runt.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.520
Yeah.

35:52.520 --> 35:59.400
I think it is a game that can get abusive and I understand people not wanting to play

35:59.400 --> 36:01.320
it and they shouldn't be forced to play it.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.320
Totally not.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.480
But I guess if people want to play during recess, I don't, I don't believe, I can't,

36:06.480 --> 36:09.880
I don't believe that it's been banned almost nationwide.

36:09.880 --> 36:13.500
There aren't arrests happening if you play dodge ball, but I do think it's interesting

36:13.500 --> 36:19.520
the different way that Alex is talking about his school days violence here in 2003, very

36:19.520 --> 36:23.080
less dark, much less dark.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.480
At no point in time did I hear him say he stomped a guy's guts out.

36:26.480 --> 36:31.320
Yeah, no, if we take the present day understanding of Alex's former violent tendencies where

36:31.320 --> 36:32.920
he murdered a couple people.

36:32.920 --> 36:33.920
Yeah.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.920
A little bit different.

36:34.920 --> 36:38.040
It seems weird that he'd be sitting here in 2003 laughing whimsically about.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.040
Come on.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.120
We used to have little scrapes back in the day.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.240
Now granted I murdered.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.440
I did kill him.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.960
I did kill him.

36:44.960 --> 36:49.800
I hate those fucking stories so much of like, Oh, when I grew up, we used to go out back

36:49.800 --> 36:53.640
and we'd get hit with a switch if we got in trouble and we turned out fine.

36:53.640 --> 36:57.360
And you're like, you guys are all legitimately insane.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.400
Everything you believe is nonsense.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.360
You did not turn out fine.

37:01.360 --> 37:06.200
Do not tell me that story and then not connect it to your violent present.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.140
And that's why they're banning dodge ball.

37:08.140 --> 37:09.140
Of course.

37:09.140 --> 37:13.240
Now, do you think anyone has been arrested for this is going to, this is, this is a trivia

37:13.240 --> 37:15.120
question that is a very important, all right.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.480
Do you think anyone's been arrested for musical chairs?

37:17.480 --> 37:18.480
Yes, absolutely.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.880
30 to 40 people at a time daily.

37:21.880 --> 37:22.880
You've probably heard.

37:22.880 --> 37:25.640
They're making a musical chairs.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.080
You can't play musical chairs.

37:27.080 --> 37:32.560
Now there haven't been a rest made for musical chairs for secretly playing dodge ball or

37:32.560 --> 37:33.560
tag.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.560
I forgot.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.520
Tag too has been banned.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.520
Tag you get arrested for playing tag.

37:38.520 --> 37:42.400
Then why the hell did you bring?

37:42.400 --> 37:43.400
Bring up tag!

37:43.400 --> 37:44.400
You did!

37:44.400 --> 37:45.400
Yeah, I know.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.400
But why did you bring?

37:46.400 --> 37:49.320
No arrests for musical chairs.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.320
I would like statistics on that.

37:51.320 --> 37:55.200
Does the FBI publish musical chairs related arrests?

37:55.200 --> 37:59.200
Yeah, it's from the Bureau of Statistics.

37:59.200 --> 38:03.280
Does the ATF also take care of that?

38:03.280 --> 38:04.280
Yeah.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.280
I don't know.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.800
I mean, I feel like as I recall musical chairs can get a little bit physical, but it's not

38:08.800 --> 38:10.120
supposed to.

38:10.120 --> 38:14.560
Like if some kid is fighting with somebody over a chair, that's a behavioral issue.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.280
Everybody goes, okay, well we gotta deal with this now.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.280
This was unintended.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.720
This is not part of the game.

38:21.720 --> 38:25.740
So Alex is pretty deep into a conversation about what you can and can't do at schools

38:25.740 --> 38:27.360
and how the government is cracking down.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.360
Oh, that government.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.120
Now they have gone too far.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.120
Well here it is.

38:31.120 --> 38:37.440
Banned on campus, boys talking to girls, World Net Daily, elementary students protest restriction

38:37.440 --> 38:44.320
after showing public signs of affection, sixth grade girls protest, photo heralded news newspaper,

38:44.320 --> 38:50.440
and it shows dozens of young sixth grade girls with signs saying, allow us to talk to boys.

38:50.440 --> 38:57.760
Smiling, attack on the shoulder, could lead to criminal charges.

38:57.760 --> 39:01.300
Okay, everything's criminal now.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.000
So that's a good story.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.280
How are we still doing this?

39:06.280 --> 39:10.240
So this is a story out of Portland, a Peterson Elementary School in specific.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.800
What happened was that there was a teacher at the school who witnessed some non-specified

39:13.800 --> 39:18.160
public displays of affection at recess and decided as a preventative measure that they

39:18.160 --> 39:22.960
needed to disallow girls and boys from talking during recess.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.620
Obviously this is taking things a little bit far, but also Alex is completely blowing this

39:26.620 --> 39:30.720
story out of proportion, pretending that if a boy talked to a girl he'd get arrested on

39:30.720 --> 39:32.600
criminal charges.

39:32.600 --> 39:36.160
That's totally made up, because I suspect even Alex knows that talking about this story

39:36.160 --> 39:39.800
on the merits of it might come off as a little desperate in terms of trying to make your

39:39.800 --> 39:40.800
audience outraged.

39:40.800 --> 39:41.800
Little silly.

39:41.800 --> 39:45.820
Honestly, he's missing the forest for the trees here, and there's a much, much better

39:45.820 --> 39:48.240
story to be told.

39:48.240 --> 39:53.080
That is the story of Sarah Maines and Hannah Guerrero, two 12-year-old girls at the school

39:53.080 --> 39:56.920
who took issue with the rule that got made and protested against it.

39:56.920 --> 40:01.000
Sarah and Hannah straight up formed a student committee, studied the school's rules, and

40:01.000 --> 40:03.720
figured out the proper steps to get a complaint heard.

40:03.720 --> 40:07.660
They got all the protesting student's parents to sign off on letting them demonstrate, then

40:07.660 --> 40:10.520
held a protest to have their complaint heard.

40:10.520 --> 40:14.500
Sarah's mother puts it so well in this article from the Herald and News, quote, I'm so proud

40:14.500 --> 40:15.500
of my daughter.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.720
The hardest part was to walk into that school after protesting like that.

40:18.720 --> 40:19.880
She stood up for herself.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.360
I think she learned something important.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.560
It's heartwarming.

40:22.560 --> 40:28.300
Yeah, it is nice to know that no matter what era we're in, it is a universal rule that

40:28.300 --> 40:32.200
children are way better people than adults by a wide margin.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.880
Also, the principal of the school said, quote, no disciplinary action would be taken against

40:35.880 --> 40:40.280
the protesters, and he's willing to hear any complaints from students and parents.

40:40.280 --> 40:45.360
What you basically have here is a situation where a teacher possibly and probably over-reacted

40:45.360 --> 40:48.160
to something that they were right to be concerned about.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.980
This led to an overly broad rule being put in place, which got students to become active

40:51.980 --> 40:53.480
in opposition to it.

40:53.480 --> 40:57.040
These kids learned how to appropriately and effectively have their voices heard, how to

40:57.040 --> 40:59.740
present an argument through proper channels to power.

40:59.740 --> 41:02.480
It's honestly an amazing story, and I'm so impressed by these kids.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.820
Yeah, it really is an amazing story.

41:04.820 --> 41:06.520
What a bunch of dicks.

41:06.520 --> 41:11.120
This story that is really inspirational is absent from coverage in places like Infowars

41:11.120 --> 41:13.640
because the story isn't real to Alex.

41:13.640 --> 41:17.440
It's a prop, and for this to be an effective prop, he has to distort details to make it

41:17.440 --> 41:21.960
something the government was doing to these kids, as opposed to an iffy administrative

41:21.960 --> 41:22.980
decision.

41:22.980 --> 41:26.560
It makes me kind of sad because the Infowars audience is deprived of hearing this story

41:26.560 --> 41:31.680
about students getting involved in direct civic action solely because focusing on that

41:31.680 --> 41:36.480
too much makes it clear that this whole thing about flirting becoming a criminal act is

41:36.480 --> 41:40.520
complete bullshit, and that bullshit is how he keeps the audience engaged and outraged.

41:40.520 --> 41:48.300
Well, I mean, the story is essentially a microcosm of the people taking on the government exactly

41:48.300 --> 41:54.520
like Alex would want them to do theoretically, however, that would be bad for his audience

41:54.520 --> 41:59.240
to actually take civic action to change things because then he would run out of money.

41:59.240 --> 42:05.240
Yeah, the students who were protesting here didn't try and change the government by sending

42:05.240 --> 42:09.040
money to a blowhard student in the class.

42:09.040 --> 42:12.600
There wasn't one student in the class who yelled a whole bunch.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.360
Yeah, exactly, and then they were like, I'll take care of it for you.

42:16.360 --> 42:19.160
I'm the tip of the spear going against this teacher here.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.160
Send me money.

42:20.160 --> 42:26.000
If one student had written a pamphlet that it was selling, yeah, that would be who Alex

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
is.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Behold the teacher's horse.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Yeah, exactly.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.280
Oh, she's just in it for the apples.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.560
How does this still work?

42:32.560 --> 42:39.480
I think that's why I'm a little depressed about going back to 2003 because how do adults

42:39.480 --> 42:42.120
still get caught up in this bullshit?

42:42.120 --> 42:43.120
Look at this.

42:43.120 --> 42:45.600
It's the same story that we're hearing about now.

42:45.600 --> 42:46.600
Yeah, it is.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.600
It's the same story.

42:47.600 --> 42:54.840
It's the same shit, and adults are still, at no point in time, are they like, oh, have

42:54.840 --> 42:58.560
I heard this exact same thing 20 years ago and I'm fine?

42:58.560 --> 43:01.000
Well, yeah, but I think that you forget.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.760
The war on Christmas happens every year.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.200
Sure, sure, that's true.

43:04.200 --> 43:05.960
I think it's one of the evergreen things about-

43:05.960 --> 43:07.760
The Iraq war happens every year.

43:07.760 --> 43:12.160
I think it's one of the evergreen things about the right-wing media ecosystem.

43:12.160 --> 43:19.400
These complaints that somehow all the kids are being softened at school or whatever,

43:19.400 --> 43:23.480
it's just something that will never not elicit a reaction from that audience.

43:23.480 --> 43:28.200
Yeah, no, of course, because if they were to hear that the kids weren't fighting at

43:28.200 --> 43:34.120
all, they were learning, using their words, organizing, and then making a real change

43:34.120 --> 43:39.560
in the world, that would not fit in with their, these kids are soft argument.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.040
That would be difficult for them.

43:41.040 --> 43:47.760
It would actually make you look like an idiot for fighting instead of learning and organizing

43:47.760 --> 43:48.760
and making change.

43:48.760 --> 43:54.120
Yeah, and those girls who started that protest, who got the committee going, studied the rules,

43:54.120 --> 43:56.920
they accomplished what they set out to accomplish.

43:56.920 --> 44:01.940
Yes, and they both grew up to be Michelle Obama.

44:01.940 --> 44:05.520
That's one of the important lessons, I think, is being deprived from the audience, and I

44:05.520 --> 44:08.360
think that's just unfair, but that's how it's supposed to be.

44:08.360 --> 44:12.760
Anyway, Jordan, if you want to get more depressed about thinking about the past and the present,

44:12.760 --> 44:17.520
and about how I'm a witch, I would ask you to put your mic down for this next clip.

44:17.520 --> 44:22.880
The British government actually released foot and mouth.

44:22.880 --> 44:27.760
In fact, two months before the outbreak, they had to admit, they had contacted people, the

44:27.760 --> 44:33.280
agriculture departments in the counties, and said, get pyres ready, get lots of wood ready

44:33.280 --> 44:35.600
to burn piles of dead animals.

44:35.600 --> 44:40.440
They said, why, and they said, oh, well, you'll see, and then they admitted the foot and mouth

44:40.440 --> 44:43.840
got released from porting down Bio Weapons Lab.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.480
They said by accident, someone released it or someone stole it.

44:47.480 --> 44:52.560
By the way, that's a level four Bio Weapons Lab that has stuff that'll kill specific races

44:52.560 --> 44:56.640
of people, wipe out all whites, wipe out all blacks.

44:56.640 --> 44:57.640
Just amazing.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.560
So many similarities to the present.

44:59.560 --> 45:00.640
Wow.

45:00.640 --> 45:05.120
There's no truth to what Alex is saying, but interestingly, in the aftermath of the 2001

45:05.120 --> 45:09.120
foot and mouth outbreak in the UK, there were a ton of rumors flying around about how it

45:09.120 --> 45:10.120
started.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.920
Subsequent investigations have shown that it started on a farm that was feeding its

45:12.920 --> 45:17.040
livestock untreated waste, but that didn't stop theories from flying around in the days

45:17.040 --> 45:19.120
immediately after the outbreak.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.660
One of the popular theories was that there was a vial of this specific strain of foot

45:22.660 --> 45:27.840
and mouth that had been stolen from or accidentally released from porting down, a biological lab

45:27.840 --> 45:28.840
in England.

45:28.840 --> 45:29.840
Sure.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.860
This is an interesting story, and it follows essentially the same path as Alex's present

45:32.860 --> 45:35.480
day theories about the novel coronavirus.

45:35.480 --> 45:39.400
At various points in the early days of the 2020 outbreak, Alex has suggested that it

45:39.400 --> 45:43.760
was intentionally or accidentally released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and

45:43.760 --> 45:48.680
he's also discussed the use of race specific bio weapons to bolster his claims.

45:48.680 --> 45:49.680
Jesus.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.720
This is like looking into a funhouse mirror of the past.

45:51.720 --> 45:52.720
This is so awful.

45:52.720 --> 45:55.120
I'm trying to torture you with this.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.080
I mean, because why would you...

45:57.080 --> 46:03.640
Like, okay, I get that we're evil as a species or whatever, and people are going to do...

46:03.640 --> 46:07.320
Just because something shouldn't exist doesn't mean it's not going to, right?

46:07.320 --> 46:10.000
But you can't possibly think it's a good idea.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.040
Even if you could make a race specific bio weapon, you can't think it's a good idea to

46:14.040 --> 46:17.380
leave it anywhere.

46:17.380 --> 46:23.260
You have to have that in a safe, inside of a safe, inside of another safe surrounded

46:23.260 --> 46:28.060
by people who've lost their hands, who can't open it, like that kind of shit.

46:28.060 --> 46:32.800
If you would ever endeavor to make something so stupid and destructive, you would have

46:32.800 --> 46:34.600
to keep it in a parody of security.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
Yeah.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.600
It's something that's a hoax.

46:36.600 --> 46:37.600
Yeah.

46:37.600 --> 46:41.440
I mean, it's literally like you're one whoops away from all white people gone.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.680
That's not okay.

46:42.680 --> 46:43.680
Yeah.

46:43.680 --> 46:45.640
And also race specific bio weapons are real.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.640
It's bad.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.480
So The Guardian looked at the various theories about the foot and mouth outbreak, and the

46:49.480 --> 46:52.280
port and down one was one of the ones that got their attention.

46:52.280 --> 46:56.040
Unfortunately for the conspiracy, they spoke to a representative at port and down who said,

46:56.040 --> 46:58.960
quote, we have never worked on foot and mouth.

46:58.960 --> 47:02.860
That doesn't sound like folks admitting that it was released from there, but yet Alex is

47:02.860 --> 47:04.840
on air saying that it's been admitted.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.240
It's about what they don't say.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.240
That's weird.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.240
It's really weird.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.260
Kind of like how he always acts.

47:10.260 --> 47:14.400
This Guardian article also discusses the revelation that months before the outbreak, people from

47:14.400 --> 47:18.520
the Ministry of Agriculture were calling around getting quotes on the price of timber in order

47:18.520 --> 47:20.120
to burn diseased animals.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.120
That is true.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.120
Yeah.

47:22.120 --> 47:26.000
They're reporting this as them sneakily and cryptically telling farmers to prepare piers,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.520
but that's about the level of accuracy you should expect from Alex.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.520
Yeah.

47:29.520 --> 47:34.780
It's kind of close to something that's real, but according to The Guardian, quote, Stratfordshire

47:34.780 --> 47:39.840
Animal Health Office, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, rang around merchants in the

47:39.840 --> 47:44.360
autumn asking for quotes for timber for piers as part of an animal contingency plan on how

47:44.360 --> 47:47.920
to deal with swine fever and foot and mouth outbreaks.

47:47.920 --> 47:50.360
This is a requirement of all EU countries.

47:50.360 --> 47:51.960
It happens every year.

47:51.960 --> 47:55.600
So it's not something that's suspicious at all, but Alex has built it into a foot and

47:55.600 --> 47:58.920
mouth was intentionally released from a level four bioweapons lab.

47:58.920 --> 47:59.920
Of course.

47:59.920 --> 48:00.920
In order to...

48:00.920 --> 48:01.920
Oh, boy.

48:01.920 --> 48:09.220
That's a story that's more about how England was like, remember when we threw dead bodies

48:09.220 --> 48:13.720
in the Thames and then there was disease?

48:13.720 --> 48:15.040
We don't do that anymore.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.520
It was a smart move on our part.

48:17.520 --> 48:23.320
So another sort of mirror glimpse to the present and the past comes in this next clip.

48:23.320 --> 48:26.200
Just stylistic, though, instead of content.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.520
And I haven't even scratched the surface.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.120
I've covered some of the important news.

48:29.120 --> 48:34.800
The news is so insane today that I will cover all 100 articles.

48:34.800 --> 48:35.880
I'm going to do it.

48:35.880 --> 48:40.800
I'm going to do it in the next two hours, and we're going to get to all your calls immediately

48:40.800 --> 48:42.320
after this break.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.320
That's just...

48:43.320 --> 48:44.320
Wow.

48:44.320 --> 48:45.320
Wow.

48:45.320 --> 48:47.040
He's always about to get to it.

48:47.040 --> 48:52.360
If you say that, there should be a ticker that appears just by magic.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.360
Like 100 stories?

48:54.360 --> 48:55.760
It's a countdown clock.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.500
It just appears.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.320
Every day the show ends at 98.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.320
If I had...

49:00.320 --> 49:01.680
Got to two stories.

49:01.680 --> 49:04.120
That's my wish.

49:04.120 --> 49:07.480
My genie's wish is just like, I don't want money.

49:07.480 --> 49:08.640
I don't want happiness.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.840
I want purely just...

49:10.840 --> 49:15.080
If you make a claim like, I'm going to do 100 things, a ticker appears.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.080
The end.

49:16.080 --> 49:20.720
So Alex does end up going to take some calls, and he gets a call from a guy, and the conversation

49:20.720 --> 49:26.560
drifts into talking about the government tracking children via cell phone.

49:26.560 --> 49:27.560
Sure.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.800
Or tracking people by cell phone and then using the excuse that it's to protect the

49:30.800 --> 49:31.800
kids.

49:31.800 --> 49:32.800
Right?

49:32.800 --> 49:33.800
Yeah.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.320
And then Alex says something weird.

49:35.320 --> 49:38.720
But now that they're announcing that we're about to be tracking you, the government says

49:38.720 --> 49:42.960
that, oh, the police locally are watching the FEMA command center they built.

49:42.960 --> 49:44.560
Now it's, oh, it's for the children.

49:44.560 --> 49:45.560
See how they introduced it?

49:45.560 --> 49:46.560
It's for the children.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.840
It's for the criminals.

49:48.840 --> 49:49.840
It's for the minority.

49:49.840 --> 49:52.520
See, it's always for that other group.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.520
Go ahead.

49:53.520 --> 49:58.400
So that's interesting to me because that's right on the line.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.800
That's right on the line.

49:59.800 --> 50:03.900
It's always for a minority.

50:03.900 --> 50:07.040
That's the kind of thing that if you were really uncharitable and ungenerous to him

50:07.040 --> 50:12.380
you'd be like, okay, what minority groups are you talking about here?

50:12.380 --> 50:15.200
Is that coded language?

50:15.200 --> 50:19.640
But it's also, if you are charitable, you could be like, well, he's just saying that

50:19.640 --> 50:24.320
groups that aren't the majority, so criminals are a minority of the population.

50:24.320 --> 50:25.780
It's right there on the line.

50:25.780 --> 50:29.640
It's always, and it's rich for you to be like, oh, see how they do that?

50:29.640 --> 50:31.280
They say it's for the children.

50:31.280 --> 50:36.160
And then the next breath is like, I only care about the millions of aborted babies.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.880
It's about the aborted babies.

50:37.880 --> 50:41.120
It's not about controlling women's actions at all.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.120
Sure.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.120
Yeah.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.440
That's bad financial advice to give.

50:45.440 --> 50:51.200
Although I will say that he's not saying this as just solid financial advice.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.200
Sure.

50:52.200 --> 50:56.140
There's an ethical component to it, but his audience would have missed out on some money

50:56.140 --> 50:58.240
if they took this advice.

50:58.240 --> 51:02.400
You've got to be preemptively down at your county commissioners, your state legislature,

51:02.400 --> 51:03.400
calling Washington.

51:03.400 --> 51:08.200
You've got to preemptively find out if any of the mutual funds you own, own speculative

51:08.200 --> 51:09.880
tech stocks like Applied Digital.

51:09.880 --> 51:12.800
If you've got Motorola, they're involved in the biochip.

51:12.800 --> 51:13.800
IBM.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.080
IBM is a, you know, so-called good stock.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.840
Well, yeah, it's like buying a piece of Satan.

51:17.840 --> 51:21.360
You need to go ahead and dump that stock.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.960
It's up from where it was in 2003.

51:23.960 --> 51:25.840
I would argue.

51:25.840 --> 51:29.640
It's not hugely up, but you'd make a nice bit of money.

51:29.640 --> 51:36.720
If you'd bought stock in it in 2003, you'd make maybe a good, more than 50% profit.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.720
Not bad?

51:38.720 --> 51:39.720
No.

51:39.720 --> 51:43.600
But the reason that he wants you to get out of it is, apparently, IBM owns the Chinese

51:43.600 --> 51:44.600
military.

51:44.600 --> 51:45.600
I did not know that!

51:45.600 --> 51:48.160
I would add an addendum to that.

51:48.160 --> 51:52.960
IBM owns, or the Communist Chinese military, owns Applied Digital Solutions, their front

51:52.960 --> 51:53.960
company.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.920
They don't want to take the heat of being involved with this product, but they are the

51:56.920 --> 51:57.920
owners.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.920
You know, their financial statements, 2000, 2001.

51:59.920 --> 52:03.880
I think 2002 is out yet, I haven't read it.

52:03.880 --> 52:09.840
There's a Chinese plant that's being built for the implantator, ejector, and the chip

52:09.840 --> 52:10.840
itself.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.320
It's all part of hell on earth.

52:12.320 --> 52:17.240
So yeah, apparently there's a Chinese plant that's being built to get the implantator

52:17.240 --> 52:20.840
and the implants for the chip that they're going to put in everybody.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.080
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

52:22.080 --> 52:25.800
And IBM owns the Chinese government's military.

52:25.800 --> 52:31.040
That is an interesting way to diversify your business, your revenue streams.

52:31.040 --> 52:35.680
Yeah, it's like, okay, well we did pretty good, but that almost suggests that the computer

52:35.680 --> 52:40.640
thing was just a way for them to make enough money to buy the Chinese military.

52:40.640 --> 52:44.720
It also introduces a lot of questions that I want answers to, like, has it been sold

52:44.720 --> 52:45.720
since?

52:45.720 --> 52:46.720
That's a good question.

52:46.720 --> 52:47.720
Does IBM still own the Chinese military?

52:47.720 --> 52:48.920
Also a good question.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.960
What say does the Chinese government have about military decisions, do they have to

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
check with IBM?

52:53.960 --> 52:54.960
Sure.

52:54.960 --> 52:59.520
I think one of those shared office space companies wound up buying it, yeah, I think they wound

52:59.520 --> 53:00.520
up buying it.

53:00.520 --> 53:06.120
They don't have a solid business plan, so they were like, well we might as well buy

53:06.120 --> 53:08.280
a military while we've got the cash.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.280
Yeah.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.320
So Alex takes another call, and this guy made me really sad.

53:11.320 --> 53:16.040
I mean, I just can't sleep, I'm going to be honest with you, I spend probably about 15

53:16.040 --> 53:19.360
hours a day studying, reviewing articles you put out.

53:19.360 --> 53:24.360
That's because you're normal, you're sane, when you read about giant FEMA cams and execution

53:24.360 --> 53:25.640
centers it upsets you.

53:25.640 --> 53:32.080
I can't imagine reading for a number of hours about things that Alex suggests people read

53:32.080 --> 53:34.240
and not realizing, oh, this guy's a dumb-dumb.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.240
Oh, this is full of shit.

53:35.240 --> 53:36.240
Yeah.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.240
All of this is terrible.

53:37.240 --> 53:40.080
I find that really difficult, I don't know what this guy is reading.

53:40.080 --> 53:44.460
I don't think he is, I think he's probably reading message boards or something and calling

53:44.460 --> 53:45.460
it research.

53:45.460 --> 53:50.280
It almost seems like you would learn about how much bullshit it is by osmosis, just by

53:50.280 --> 53:56.000
repetition of just like, I've heard this before, I've heard this before, I've heard this before,

53:56.000 --> 53:57.200
this guy might be full of shit.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.360
Wait, this doesn't say what Alex says.

53:59.360 --> 54:00.360
Yeah.

54:00.360 --> 54:03.000
Yeah, it just bums me out.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.160
And I think it is indicative of how a lot of his listeners and how a lot of people who

54:08.160 --> 54:12.360
get into this world, their experience of it is compulsive.

54:12.360 --> 54:16.600
What he's describing is such a compulsive relationship with this information.

54:16.600 --> 54:20.320
I read what you write 15 hours a day, because you're normal, man.

54:20.320 --> 54:21.320
You're normal, bro.

54:21.320 --> 54:25.440
Because you're a normal dude, that's how people react to the things that I say.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.440
Yeah.

54:26.440 --> 54:28.840
So Alex at this point needs to make a programming note.

54:28.840 --> 54:29.840
Okay.

54:29.840 --> 54:35.880
And that is actually kind of revealing in as much as he is clear, even in 2003, that

54:35.880 --> 54:37.600
tragedies bring traffic.

54:37.600 --> 54:45.080
I made a comment last weekend that after every time there's a terror event, the listenership

54:45.080 --> 54:46.840
peaks, it spikes.

54:46.840 --> 54:51.960
Well, obviously, all news, newspaper sales go up, radio listenership goes up for news

54:51.960 --> 54:52.960
talk.

54:52.960 --> 54:53.960
That always happens.

54:53.960 --> 55:01.080
And I made the comment that right after the so-called Iraq war ended, that listenership

55:01.080 --> 55:02.080
dropped.

55:02.080 --> 55:07.360
And then that gets picked up, and another host says it, another host says it, and basically

55:07.360 --> 55:09.520
it ends up we don't have any listeners.

55:09.520 --> 55:10.520
That's ridiculous.

55:10.520 --> 55:11.520
A little defensive.

55:11.520 --> 55:12.520
Yeah.

55:12.520 --> 55:17.600
But I think that this is interesting, because at this point he does understand that dynamic

55:17.600 --> 55:22.340
of tragedies lead to more people viewing my shit.

55:22.340 --> 55:25.880
Which is a lesson, obviously, he should have learned from 9-11, and he should know that

55:25.880 --> 55:27.680
by now pretty well.

55:27.680 --> 55:33.840
But I question whether he understands at this point fully that obsessing about the immediacy

55:33.840 --> 55:38.640
of another tragedy happening soon will also spike his ratings.

55:38.640 --> 55:42.280
I think he learns that pretty quickly, but it doesn't feel like it at this point.

55:42.280 --> 55:43.760
It just feels like a radio show.

55:43.760 --> 55:44.760
Yeah.

55:44.760 --> 55:51.400
So he gets another caller, and this guy sent me down a nutso rabbit hole, insane, too much

55:51.400 --> 55:52.400
of my time.

55:52.400 --> 55:53.400
Okay.

55:53.400 --> 56:01.360
I was wondering if I may take this opportunity to see if we can get any signatures on the

56:01.360 --> 56:06.040
site that I talked to you before about, if you want to go ahead and announce it.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.040
What site is that, Eric?

56:07.040 --> 56:08.040
You've got a site signature.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.040
Is that a petition?

56:09.040 --> 56:10.040
Yeah.

56:10.040 --> 56:13.320
It lists over about 300 grievances.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.880
Oh, yeah, I read that.

56:15.880 --> 56:16.880
You sent that to me.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.680
Yeah, a lot of good grievances there.

56:18.680 --> 56:20.560
What's the website address?

56:20.560 --> 56:21.560
Redeclarationofindependence.com.

56:21.560 --> 56:25.600
And then I would imagine it.com, yeah.

56:25.600 --> 56:26.600
You bet.

56:26.600 --> 56:31.640
2003 is an interesting time for followers of conspiracy culture and the communities

56:31.640 --> 56:32.920
surrounding it.

56:32.920 --> 56:38.280
In the present day, extremely far-right tendencies have almost entirely absorbed that space,

56:38.280 --> 56:40.400
but it wasn't always like that.

56:40.400 --> 56:43.600
So back then, I would be willing to bet that I'd probably agree with some of this caller's

56:43.600 --> 56:46.840
suggested new grievances in his post about the government.

56:46.840 --> 56:47.840
Okay.

56:47.840 --> 56:51.320
Luckily, the Wayback Machine exists, and I was able to find this caller's redeclaration

56:51.320 --> 56:56.200
of independence, and perhaps unsurprisingly, I did in fact find some common ground with

56:56.200 --> 56:57.200
this guy.

56:57.200 --> 56:58.200
Okay.

56:58.200 --> 57:02.100
For instance, his first complaint reads, quote, we demand the abolishment of engaging our

57:02.100 --> 57:06.600
military in unconstitutional activities, spreading them out as the police of the world while

57:06.600 --> 57:08.880
leaving our borders wide open and unprotected.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.440
I might have left out the part at the end about the borders, since it has nothing to

57:12.440 --> 57:15.960
do with the main point of unconstitutional engagements of the military, but leaving that

57:15.960 --> 57:19.240
aside, we agree that the government's got to stop this war stuff.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.240
True.

57:20.240 --> 57:22.000
A little bit later, we find even more agreement.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.880
Quote, we demand the abolishment of all instances of murdering citizens completely within their

57:26.880 --> 57:30.880
rights and destroying and refusing to disclose evidence in these crimes.

57:30.880 --> 57:34.320
I would even expand that language to include non-citizen residents, but we're on the same

57:34.320 --> 57:35.320
page.

57:35.320 --> 57:36.320
Cop shouldn't be killing people.

57:36.320 --> 57:37.320
Yeah.

57:37.320 --> 57:40.760
It's important to remember that that's where those people were, and now they're at Blue

57:40.760 --> 57:42.080
Lives Matter.

57:42.080 --> 57:43.080
You know?

57:43.080 --> 57:44.080
You don't know what this guy's up to.

57:44.080 --> 57:45.080
Sure.

57:45.080 --> 57:48.480
So this whole agreeing thing falls apart pretty quick, since it immediately dovetails into

57:48.480 --> 57:53.000
complaints about UN treaties and calling for abolishing, quote, the post office, public

57:53.000 --> 57:54.280
education, and Amtrak.

57:54.280 --> 57:56.240
Oh, so we're Ron Pauling it.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.240
A little bit.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.240
Okay.

57:58.240 --> 58:01.740
This document completely goes off the rails with words like treason starting to pop up

58:01.740 --> 58:03.280
in all capital letters.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.280
There.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.280
That's where we get into trouble.

58:05.280 --> 58:07.920
In all caps a word, you are, yeah.

58:07.920 --> 58:11.680
Apparently part of the re-declaration of independence is charging any individual or

58:11.680 --> 58:17.160
industry that traded with North Vietnam, China, Russia, Iraq, or any of their satellite countries

58:17.160 --> 58:18.540
with treason.

58:18.540 --> 58:23.220
This extends to literally everyone who worked in things like steel or petroleum industries,

58:23.220 --> 58:27.640
but also to everyone who's been in elected office in Congress or the executive branch

58:27.640 --> 58:30.200
or the Supreme Court dating back to the Korean War.

58:30.200 --> 58:34.960
Yeah, you might as well just rewrite that to say, we got to clean house and get rid

58:34.960 --> 58:36.240
of all these guys.

58:36.240 --> 58:37.240
And past.

58:37.240 --> 58:42.020
Let's, yeah, let's begin at the 16th century and we'll start over.

58:42.020 --> 58:45.960
The document demands, quote, all who served in these political positions during any of

58:45.960 --> 58:50.640
the times of armed conflict in question from the Korean War to this date be stripped of

58:50.640 --> 58:53.080
any retirement or other compensation.

58:53.080 --> 58:55.040
I'm guessing that's in addition to the treason charges.

58:55.040 --> 58:58.320
What about people who supported the civil war?

58:58.320 --> 59:00.160
The South, huh?

59:00.160 --> 59:02.120
Do they get treason charges?

59:02.120 --> 59:05.120
Yeah, it's before the federal reserves.

59:05.120 --> 59:06.200
Okay, well, that's fair.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.400
The thing is, this is nuts.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.400
This document is nuts.

59:09.400 --> 59:13.520
And it's hilarious for Alex to pretend that he's read it trying to humor this caller.

59:13.520 --> 59:17.360
I'm certain that Alex didn't read it, but honestly, it's so much funnier to imagine

59:17.360 --> 59:20.880
that he had and was still giving this guy a glowing review.

59:20.880 --> 59:25.440
You see, here's how the new Declaration of Independence ends with a suggestion of what

59:25.440 --> 59:31.240
they should do next, quote, we hereby petition for renewal of government removed entirely

59:31.240 --> 59:35.440
from Washington D.C. and reconstituted in another region of the land.

59:35.440 --> 59:39.800
And at least temporarily at first, during its beginnings, this new government for and

59:39.800 --> 59:44.640
of the people will be situated and redeveloped from Austin, Texas, the birthplace of the

59:44.640 --> 59:49.080
new people's house with an initial mailing address of bleep, I'll just bleep it out.

59:49.080 --> 59:50.080
Okay, okay.

59:50.080 --> 59:54.160
A new government will be birthed for the free world, led initially and temporarily by the

59:54.160 --> 59:56.920
following patriots of this new age.

59:56.920 --> 59:57.920
Alex Jones.

59:57.920 --> 59:58.920
Names?

59:58.920 --> 59:59.920
Oh, no.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920
Oh, no.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.920
Top of the list?

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.920
Yep.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920
Oh, shit.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:11.600
Alex Jones, Eric Rainbolt, Mike Hansen, George Humphrey, Chris Athanas, Kevin Smith, and

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.280
Robert Dassey, in order to retain our original forefathers declaration of our God-given rights

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.160
and framework for the lasting legitimate republic promoting global freedom under God's laws,

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.400
not a select group of men's laws, and the complete dismantlement of all forms of tyranny

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
hereafter.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.000
This wasn't that much farther after Mallrats, so I can see Kevin-

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Wrong Kevin Smith.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
What?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.080
It's not the view askew, Kevin Smith.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.740
This guy wants to overthrow the government, reconstitute it in Austin, and have Alex and

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.880
some of Alex's friends temporarily rule this new blossoming government.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880
That's amazing.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880
Yeah.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.360
In case you don't know those names, Mike Hansen was Alex's longtime cameraman and producer.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.720
Kevin Smith worked at Info Wars, and George Humphrey and Bob Dassey were regular Info

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.720
Wars guests.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.280
The new Politburo is just employees of Info Wars.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.080
Yeah, except for Chris Athanas, I don't know who that is, and Eric Rainbolt.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.000
I was like, who the fuck is that?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.760
And then I realized, it's this caller.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.040
Well you're not gonna not insert yourself into the Politburo.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.180
So if you Google the address that he lists as the temporary address of the new government

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:23.960
of America, you'll find that it's listed as the publishing address for a 2005 book titled

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.280
The Freemasonic Architecture of History, self-published by Eric Rainbolt.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.680
It's Eric Rainbolt's house.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.680
It's Eric Rainbolt's house, isn't it?

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.680
Well, hold on.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.920
It's definitely the address of the publishing of this book that was written and self-published

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.920
by Eric Rainbolt.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920
Uh-huh.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.960
He was also the proprietor of 911exposed.com.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.880
The real mystery here, though, is that the name of the person listed as the owner of

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.360
that house doesn't match with Eric Rainbolt, so I felt like I was at a dead end, but my

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.640
curiosity was itching too strongly.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.880
Was this caller the person who wrote the new Declaration of Independence, imagining

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:59.520
a new government forming at his house in Austin where he gets to rule alongside Alex?

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.440
It's really complicated, but I looked into the phone numbers and addresses listed for

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.520
the publishing endeavor, and I'm pretty certain that it is this dude.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.760
It was actually written under Eric Thunderwater.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.320
I found the phone number that's associated with it.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.080
It's someone else's phone number, but also it's a house phone.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.360
It's associated with someone named James Rainbolt.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.000
But Eric Rainbolt has published multiple...

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Still living with his dad.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
No.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I don't know.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Maybe.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Okay, maybe.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.560
Eric Rainbolt has written a couple of other books under the name Eric James Rainbolt.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.840
So anyway, I'm pretty sure it's him.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
All right.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Yeah, that would probably be him.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.340
This is a stupid long road for me to wander down, but the reason I still think it's important

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.680
is because there are some fairly critical things that me and this guy would totally

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.680
agree about.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.120
We would both want to end the Iraq War, and we both want greater oversight on police,

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.720
but it's pretty crucial to recognize that despite our differences, we aren't even close

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.160
to allies, nor could we ever be.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.440
Ultimately, I want to create a world that operates better and more fairly for everyone.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.240
And ultimately, this guy wants to be on Alex Jones' small council.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240
Yeah.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.480
Also, this guy ended up with 75 signatures on his petition at the point of the last screenshot

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.760
in the Wayback Machine, available...

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.120
This date was from July 2010, so I'm not sure exposure on Alex's show did much to help that

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
petition.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
I would argue that maybe...

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
75 signatures.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120
That's not good.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.540
They might have read it and got to the part where it's like, what the fuck?

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.680
Alex is in charge of the government, along with the guy who wrote this?

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.680
Yeah.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:32.200
The enemy of my enemy is not my friend if they also want to establish a fucking Game

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.160
of Thrones style, I'm the Hand of the King for Alex Jones situation.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:43.060
Yeah, a bizarro religious extreme libertarian nonsense fantasy land where Alex and some

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.760
of his guests rule the roost.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.760
I don't think so.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760
I don't think so.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760
Yeah.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.240
I don't think so anymore, but I will choose other people to work on that issue with.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240
Yeah.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.320
Anyway, this was kind of what...

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.480
I was like, I'm sure that's this guy.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480
And then...

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.240
Let's talk to Eric in Texas.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.320
Eric, you're on the air.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320
Go ahead, sir.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320
That was the beginning of the call.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320
It is Eric.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320
Oh, it is Eric.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320
Yeah.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.320
Okay.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.480
So anyway, Alex gets another call, and this guy is kind of interesting.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.440
This fellow has a plan for dealing with some of the media that he doesn't like, folks like

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.440
Hannity.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440
Yeah.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.800
These folks who are not conservative, apparently.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.200
I'll make them put the lotion in the basket.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.200
Nope.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.200
We need to dig up dirt.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.200
Okay.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.340
You're listeners who are very intelligent and very capable people.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:36.320
Many of them have, I'm sure, computers and know how to use them very well.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.320
You can access a lot of public domain information.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.160
It's all quite legal.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.720
And I think that we should start a campaign of accessing as much public domain information

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.400
about all these suspect broadcast individuals as we can.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.400
Case in point, I don't know if you or your listeners are aware, but Sean Hannity was

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.160
a troublemaking adolescent who came from a Long Island, New York community.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.960
That's a very interesting thing.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.860
Maybe that needs to be looked into further, and it tells you something about what the

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.240
real makeup of this man is.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:13.160
Michael Savage, who you mentioned, the guy used to hang out in the late 50s in beatnik

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.960
bars in Greenwich Village, New York.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.800
That's one of the major articles.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.840
He's a beatnik communist.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840
That's invented.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.360
So Michael Savage is a beatnik communist.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360
Wow.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360
Yeah.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360
All right.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360
Here's what we do, guys.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.600
We got to blackmail Hannity and Michael Savage with their child records.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600
Yeah.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600
It's really interesting.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.440
You think that that's a potent way to attack these figures on the right that you don't

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.160
like and apparently aren't on the right.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:45.400
I found out public records that Sean Hannity got a D in his civics class.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.960
Is that the type of person we want on the radio, Dan?

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.000
It is over for him.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.800
He's hashtag canceled.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.800
He's toast.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800
He's toast.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.800
This is cancel culture.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Yeah.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800
This is cancel culture.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.800
That's literally what the right does.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.800
Oh, man.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.720
Anyway, I just think it's really weird to hear this kind of ploy being suggested by

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.720
this caller.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.720
Yeah.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720
Alex being like, all right.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.560
And then also the political framing is so important.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.600
We have George Bush in all of his cabinet.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.960
They're super socialists.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960
Sure.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:20.600
You have Michael Savage as a beatnik commie.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:26.120
These very right wing people are being presented as left.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.400
Yeah.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.200
So they're not even moderate.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.040
Or maybe they're supposed to be the moderate left or whatever.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.040
Sure.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.040
Rhinos, if you will, Dan.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.340
That was a big talking point in 2003 and ever and always forever.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:43.280
But it makes it okay for whatever really, really hard right wing thing you want to be

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.520
like, oh, no, this is just actually normal conservatism.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520
Right.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.520
Right, right, right.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.520
I don't know about that.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520
Jesus.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.920
Maybe sovereign citizenism is even just normal conservatism.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.920
Sure.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920
Hello, Ida.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.920
Yes.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920
Thank you for taking my call.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.840
The reason I'm calling is I listen to you almost every day.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:05.160
And I understand we've got 250 million of the happiest slaves in the world living in

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.160
this country.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.640
And that's why they'll never revolt.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.440
I have revolted.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.000
I have been thrown in jail five times.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.160
I am now looking at a year and a half in jail plus a $1,500 fine simply because I refuse

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.120
to go down the road without a driver's license.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.120
Yeah.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.240
And the federal law actually says that and the court really say that you don't have to

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.720
have a license for the generally accepted conveyance, but that's a horse and buggy still.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.960
Hey, Alex, I've used every definition coming down the pike in court and the judge turns

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:46.320
around, the prosecutor objects and the judge turns around and he says it's okay to object.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320
I can't use it.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.800
And the next thing I know I'm getting paraded off to jail.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.660
You need to go ahead and appeal it up to a higher court.

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:57.680
But yeah, these courts, even federal judges have said are just rubber stamp kangaroo courts

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.680
now.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.680
Oh yeah, for sure.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.680
For sure.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.680
You don't need a license for sure.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.680
For sure.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.680
Your honor, objection, silly bullshit.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.680
Sustained.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:08.760
Yeah, this isn't true.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.240
What Alex is saying isn't true.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:17.400
They arrested me simply because I refuse to go down the road without a driver's license

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:22.220
is an interesting way of putting I've been driving without a driver's license and I don't

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.220
give a shit.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.960
Also, Alex later in the call says, I've driven without a license for years, so I think they're

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960
targeting you.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.080
Yeah, that sounds right.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.080
That sounds right.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.080
It's weird.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.080
It's weird.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.240
But that's like a bedrock of sovereign citizen shit.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.360
It's just a misunderstanding of rules.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280
Yeah.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.640
Or almost like an oppositional defiance toward the concept of rules that aren't self-generated.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.640
Yep.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.640
Yeah.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.840
So in the present day, Alex Jones loves one Tucker Carlson.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840
Sure.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.840
He's got enough of him.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.840
Loves the guy.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840
Yeah.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840
Didn't like him so much before.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840
Yeah, I was going to say.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840
Yeah.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840
Obviously we've heard he doesn't like Hannity.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.320
He thinks that Michael Savage is a commie.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.880
Coincidentally more important figures than him.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.000
What do you think he thinks about Fox, Fox News?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.800
Oh, I think he thinks that they are just a left-wing outlet giving out propaganda for

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.520
an Obama that hasn't even been elected to the Senate yet.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.260
Do you think that the average Marine or Army that's on the ground today know what's going

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.260
on?

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.260
Do they even have any idea?

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.260
They just don't know.

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:32.120
No, they just have Fox, the ultra commie channel that calls itself conservative beamed into

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.120
them.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.120
Oh, everybody loves you.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120
Oh, it's great.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120
Oh, you're the greatest heroes ever.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.600
By the way, we're cutting all your benefits right now, but as so what, you know, that's

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.760
the system.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.720
Ultra commie channel, Fox News.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.960
We're cutting all your benefits right now is not a thing that is acceptable for Alex

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.320
to say in a negative way.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.960
He should be like, yeah, they're cutting all your benefits because you don't deserve them.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.560
You lazy pieces of shit.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560
You know what?

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560
I quit this show.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.880
I got to leave.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.120
I got to leave.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.680
Ultra commie Fox News.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.200
Ultra commie Fox News.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.200
Yep.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.200
Oh boy.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.200
Yeah.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.200
That wasn't quite what I expected.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.640
I mean, it's, it's, it's all, it's a lot to see.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.340
Like when I, when I first turned on the episode, I was like, I think I'm going to have like

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.680
some really subtle things to try and sift through.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680
Yeah.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.560
Instead it's just like, Michael Savage is a commie, Fox News is ultra commie, everyone

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.560
are communists.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.120
Like, oh wait, this is, this is great.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120
Yeah.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.120
That's, that's so, cause we've talked about this for years of like, if you just abandoned

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.720
Trump, you could carve out that space of like, I don't trust Fox News.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.320
They're a bunch of liberal commie bullshit, you know, like listen to that.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.860
Like you, it's so easy.

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:50.680
You could just be like, oh, there's Biden's giving a speech on CNN and they're whining

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.440
about some nonsense five-year-old who's got a problem.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.360
Perhaps the proof of the pudding is in the eating as it were.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.360
That's true.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.040
I mean, like look at where he was in his career in 2003 and look where he is now.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.120
Like obviously signing up with Trump has massively exposed him.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.480
It's gotten him a far greater space in the public sphere.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:19.680
He's made, it's made him relevant to the point where people like at least jokingly make his

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680
name trend.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680
True.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680
Sometimes.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680
True.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.280
Back then in 2003, he had like a position of defiance against the right and the left.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.280
Right.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.080
He could pretend that it was because he's above the divide, but it's really, he's extremely

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.080
far to the right.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.080
Exactly.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.200
But you can see the, it didn't work.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200
It didn't work.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200
No, that's true.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200
That's true.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200
You're not wrong.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.840
I, but, but it, you know, I'm, I'm still of the opinion of like carving out that comfortable

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.000
space is so much better than being like, well, if I hitch my wagon to Trump's train, I can

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.360
become world famous.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.360
Yes.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.420
No, I think it would be healthier and better if he had carved out that space.

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.760
But clearly he lusts for the sun, like Icarus.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760
That's true.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760
That is true.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.240
And maybe that's just, uh, he could never do that while maintaining whatever it is that

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
he's doing back then.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.480
Yeah, it is.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.640
It is one of those situations where were the actions and context completely different.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.080
I would be like, man, I got to give it up to you for seeing an opportunity and shooting

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080
your shot.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.720
And it has not worked out for you, but within the context and his actions, uh, he's an idiot

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.240
and I hate him forever and I want to throw baseballs at him.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.960
I don't know if you know this, but 2003, in addition to seeing the end of the Iraq war,

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.600
um, we also were, uh, in the middle of SARS.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600
Okay.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:47.280
Now, some people may remember the COVID-19 is originally SARS coronavirus two, uh, the

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.680
sequel to, uh, what's going on in 2003 SARS.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.400
Let's see how, let's see how we handled it differently.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.360
Reuters money may be the root of all evil, but China is trying to make sure it won't

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.200
be a source of SARS.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.440
Now they already have public service announcements here in this country of how quote cash is

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:12.880
dirty and how we need to get rid of it to the safe cashless society.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.960
Well the central people's bank of China was putting more new cash into circulation and

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.700
holding used bank notes for 24 hours before putting it back on the people's hands.

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:26.000
The people's daily newspaper said on its website on Tuesday, the communist party mouthpiece

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.320
at some banks or even sterilizing grimy bills and showering them with ultraviolet radiation

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.680
trying to kill the SARS virus, which has killed 148 people and infected more than 3,300 in

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.680
China.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:44.480
Like 300 globally, not even that many folks, this thing, millions die every year from flu.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480
This is nothing.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.000
They can't even isolate the virus.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
It's hysteria.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.320
As the Toronto star said, it is a UN power grab.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.320
I didn't say it.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:58.080
Toronto starred in so weird to see how the past echoes with the present.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.840
Like you can dip back into 2003 and hear Alex Alex making the exact same nonsense claims

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.560
about SARS that he would eventually make about the novel coronavirus.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.760
It's remarkable, almost like the actual facts in front of him don't matter.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.360
And the particular details of a story are just decorations on top of his underlying

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.360
preexisting reality denying narrative.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.360
SARS was a big deal.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.020
It was real and it was not a UN power grab.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.560
At this point, scientists hadn't been able to concretely isolate the SARS virus, but

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.900
they did achieve that this same month, on March 22nd, 2003.

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:32.640
At this point when Alex is making the episode, it's only been a few weeks since China reported

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.640
the outbreak of cases to the World Health Organization, and the situation is very much

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.180
in its infancy.

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:42.240
The international community jumped into action and quickly identified and isolated the virus,

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.880
and cautionary steps were taken to prevent the spread.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.200
Because of collaborative action, and probably somewhat because the right-wing conspiracy

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.200
movement hadn't grown to the size it has in the present day, only 774 people in the world

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:59.260
ended up dying during the outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003.

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:03.320
The Toronto Star article Alex is referencing is something I can't find, but I would bet

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.000
anything it was an editorial article presenting the opinion that Toronto's response to SARS

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.680
has been hysterical.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:16.260
You can find some people still, you know, some existing websites that express that sentiment.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:20.200
It's hard to say if people there overreacted, but the Greater Toronto Area saw the fourth

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:25.640
largest outbreak of SARS cases in the world, behind China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, so it

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.760
really does kind of make sense that the matter there would be taken seriously in a way that

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:34.880
might look like hysteria, but if you didn't act that way, who knows what the end result

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.880
would have been.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.080
You know, I've always been, like, especially, you know, obviously now when you're thinking

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.800
about it, but it always kind of, like, messed me up when people say, oh, you're reacting

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:53.760
hysterically to this virus, and it feels like the entire human race should be so hysterical

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.800
about viruses and bacteria, considering...

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.000
Especially really new ones.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.440
Yeah, considering disease has killed almost all of us.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.300
You know, like, we talk about, oh, I'm so scared of war and all that shit.

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.840
Of all the people who have ever lived, most of them have died because of some disease

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.080
or another.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.080
And I think that...

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:15.320
Like, we should all be hysterical, you know, like, that's what I would say.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.240
And I think that the conversation largely has been, like, in times when we're not dealing

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:25.080
with outbreaks and infections and stuff, people in medical communities talk about the unknown

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.080
unknowns.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080
Exactly.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.440
About, you know, like, all the conversation about Disease X or whatever, about this thing

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.400
that we don't know about that we may have to deal with.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.640
It's really a terrifying prospect, because you have to figure out how it spreads, what

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.920
its characteristics are, and while you're figuring that out, it's spreading.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.920
Or it could be spreading, or it might be spreading faster than you think.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.920
Yeah.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.920
It's a terrifying thing.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.920
Yeah.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.920
I agree with you.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:54.320
Like, almost levels of hysteria become more rational the more you think about it.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.320
Yeah.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:01.200
And I remember some people that I knew were going through some steps that I would say

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.120
were maybe a little bit further than I would have, even, at the beginning of dealing with

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:13.160
the 2020 situation, and I kind of was like, hey, you guys are going a little far with

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160
this.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:21.240
And their response was, you know, I'd rather do this and look stupid later than not do

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:27.040
it, and feel like, oh, I could have taken preventative measures.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.160
And I think that that's a compelling argument, and I felt stupid afterwards.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.160
Yeah.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:36.240
And it's also just, but I mean, part of it is just the very fact that so many fucking

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.520
people don't not just not understand evolution, but believe in it entirely.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:48.560
It's just like, you realize that if a virus spreads, it's going to reproduce billions

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:55.040
of times in a very short period of time, which exponentially increases the possibility of

01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.200
mutation and adaptation to our measures against it.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.360
Like it is not, it is a constant battle.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:09.960
It is not a, like, even now, if we defeat COVID-19, to the extent that we would all

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.020
love it, if we don't completely eradicate it, it is going to mutate and it can come

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.720
back any time.

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.620
You know, like it's a real terrifying reality.

01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.120
And most people are like, eh, it's probably witches.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.720
Like that's where we are.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.720
Yeah.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.560
Or, you know, witches that work for the UN.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.560
Totally.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.560
It's a UN power grab.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.560
Yeah, it's a UN power grab.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.560
It always is.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.560
Always.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:37.520
And I think if, you know, I don't know, I guess if Trump was president and the conspiracy

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:43.120
community existed the way it does now in 2003, SARS might've been a much bigger problem.

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.120
Oh, totally.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.120
Well, I mean, you think about...

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.120
It's weird to think about it.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.680
You think about so many of the, you know, like you think about Ebola outbreaks.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.960
You see, you think about those things that happened in the past that in retrospect you

01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:01.440
realize were handled by people who understood and were serious about the problem instead

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.960
of actively exacerbating it.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.400
And the people who are causing problems should be held responsible in the courts.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400
So what you gonna do?

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.920
Hey, you know, Alex, at this point, you know, he's getting towards, you know, the end of

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920
the show.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.840
You know, we're getting deep into it.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.880
He still hasn't covered the news.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:21.880
How many of those?

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.320
In the next hour, I'll get more into this and what life will be like under the new world

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
order.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.320
We have covered about a third of it.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.640
I'll have to just jam it all in calmly in the third hour.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.400
I don't know what's been wrong with me this week, but I've been more fired up than usual.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.880
Before I end this segment, you want to find out what really happened with 9-1-1.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:50.880
You want to see all the information, the globalists admitting it, the documents, the news articles

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.920
in a professional package.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:58.000
Get Road to Tyranny, get part two of That Matters a Terror, my two films.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.120
That's the ad pivot back then.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.160
There's no pills to sell, no wellness supplies.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.160
Get my films.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.440
Yeah, he's just trying to sell his documentaries.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.800
I'm looking for exposure.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:12.000
If you get three of them, price goes down by three films.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
What about shipping?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.440
Is shipping still expensive at the time?

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.440
I don't remember.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.440
Could be free.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440
Probably prohibitive.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.160
Yeah, might be.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:25.000
So Alex has an epiphany when he comes back from the commercial, and this just made me

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.920
want to throw something.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.520
I'm frankly starting to panic on air.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.520
I'm going to be honest with you.

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.520
Stuff's getting so bad.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.480
I see the plan coming together.

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.600
Now I know my analysis has been dead on all along.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:40.120
Worse than I thought, frankly, and it's freaking me out.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:47.880
I know the nature of the globalist, watching serial killer control freak demons build a

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:57.400
cage for humanity is very energizing, just energized to resist them.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.540
I've asked God to make me a vessel to fight the New World Order, and sometimes I just

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.440
think there's too much.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.720
I mean, I'm just too energized.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.720
I've got all the information.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.720
I know what they're doing.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.320
I know what their plans are, what their operations are, and like my mouth, my speech centers

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:18.760
can not, I don't think, articulate the globalist program properly to you.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.040
It's just horrible.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.960
Anyone who listens to our show with any regularity has heard that speech.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:29.360
It's one that Alex gives pretty frequently when he gets in a wistful, contemplative mood.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.400
Yesterday he was confused, but today all the pieces have come together, and he's more certain

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:38.040
than ever that his analysis has been right all along, and it's worse than he thought.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.400
That's an interesting experience to imagine having when something groundbreaking happens,

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.480
but to go back to a random episode of his show from 18 years ago and see him pretending

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:51.560
to have the same epiphany that he does regularly on his show nowadays, it's a little annoying.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:55.540
Also, another reason I pulled this clip is because Alex makes a reference to God and

01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:01.120
to demons, but I think you can tell how much different that feels than how he acts and

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.920
speaks in the present day.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:08.040
To my ears, listening to this, it kind of comes off like a man who has religious inclinations

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.580
but isn't a zealot.

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:14.340
It feels like a person calling his enemies demons as a pejorative insult, not as a description

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.560
that's meant to be taken literally.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.520
It's weird to think about, but maybe Alex meant it to be heard as literal all along,

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.080
and people were just giving him an unasked-for benefit of the doubt.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:29.200
There's no way he could think demons were real, and they were just Democrats.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.580
That seems crazy.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:35.080
So we'll assume that he's being metaphorical in this sense.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.220
I don't think that's the case, but it's fun to think about.

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:42.120
Like the possibility that, nah, he's been pretty upfront about it.

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.680
He's talking about demons.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:50.320
Dan, I hate time travel episodes sometimes because you're like a Mr. Peabody who refuses

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.600
to let me get into the time machine.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.000
You just make me watch a movie of the past, and you're like, oh yeah, if we used this

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.600
time machine, we could fix it all, but too bad, asshole, we're just gonna watch.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.600
Well, that'd be a more interesting cartoon.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.660
Ah, could be.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:11.640
So Alex gets to another call, and boy, he has some pretty anti-immigrant sentiments

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640
back in 2003.

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.640
Unsurprising.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:19.180
You know, I have a lot of friends that are Mexicans, but I don't have too many immigrant

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.920
friends, but you kind of wonder how in the world they got their driver's license in the

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.920
first place.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.920
Look it up.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:29.840
You know, if they do have one, and they really do not have a driver's license because they

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.840
do not know the law.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.920
They're there for big companies to work because they do work.

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.840
Yeah, and the big companies have said, these people are here to vote our rights away because

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:44.840
they don't even know what they're doing, and they can't speak any language, they're just

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.640
the tall what to do with their local bosses, local little bosses, barrio boss, who works

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:54.760
for the government, and they're here to deindustrialize and to give us cheap wages.

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.520
Don't arrest them, don't mess with them, and it happens.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.200
You on the other hand are middle class and got some money, you're to be fed on, pushed

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.240
around, they're going to let you know to keep in line.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.240
Okay Alex, you know what you're doing, that's for sure.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.800
I would have the exact same response as that caller, you know what you're doing, Alex.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.640
Yeah, you lying piece of shit, you know what you're doing.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.640
Yeah, jeez.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:21.000
This is the same show where just an hour ago we were told you do not need a driver's license.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Right, with that caller.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.120
Sovereign Citizen shit.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.000
So there's a difference, I would say, between who gets to not have a driver's license and

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
who...

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
You're not meant to remember that.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Fair enough.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.400
On that same show we had Alex talking, you know, I was talking about that, like, if you're

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.640
uncharitable you could hear him saying the minority, and you could hear that as him talking

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.540
about, you know, minorities, non-white folk in his mind, or you could look at it as like

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:48.520
criminals are a minority of the population and that's what he's talking about.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.960
This is not the same thing.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960
Nope, nope.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960
That's not this.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.960
This is explicit.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.960
Yeah.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.600
These guys aren't talking about undocumented immigrants or people who came here through

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:01.400
improper channels or people who overstayed a visa, they're just talking about the blanket

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.160
category of people who are immigrants, and this conversation is outrageously white nationalist

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.160
at its core.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160
Oh yeah.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.080
This caller is puzzling over how immigrants managed to get driver's licenses, which is

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:15.280
a bit silly, and then Alex shoots the moon by arguing that immigrants are coming to be

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.880
controlled by, quote, barrio bosses and instructed to take, quote, our rights away.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880
You got it.

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.880
The coded language is almost comically transparent here, and this walks hand in hand with the

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.880
white nationalist ideas about the great replacement that get thrown around in more recent times.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.420
This is the way that conversation was had back then, and it's basically indistinguishable

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.560
from white supremacist positions on immigration.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.560
Yeah.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.560
It's outrageous.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.760
I just see like a six year old Harrison Smith being like, man, I want to be worse than that

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.760
someday.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.960
I want to be more explicit about exactly what I know he is saying.

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.480
I want to take this game and push it a little farther.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.360
Yeah, let's go a little bit further to the racist.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.420
Oh boy.

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:59.760
So Alex, uh, he gets to, he has this big point that he keeps making and that is that he can

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:06.640
go on any show on any conservative, well, there's, there's a more to it.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:07.640
Okay.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.840
He could go on any show, conservative, liberal, normal, whatever, right in the middle center.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840
Who gives a shit?

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.960
He can go on any of these shows.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.300
They can take 30 calls.

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.340
They all agree with him.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:16.340
Of course.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:20.080
They all agree with because he's so ideologically consistent and because everyone knows that

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.480
Bush did nine 11.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.480
That's true.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.320
So he gets, he ends up role playing a little bit as some callers that he's fantasizing

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.880
about talking to on these radio shows.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.280
And then I can be on some other station and take 20 calls and then one guy will call and

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:40.520
he'll go, you're a liar, Bush isn't trying to take my guns and I'll go, well, actually

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.760
the bill numbers, that's 22 Republicans are supporting it.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.760
And you're a line coming.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.720
I tell you, you liberals come up with some plans to confuse us and get us off track.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.520
George Bush would never, he's a Christian conservative and you've, and then the hustles

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.000
say, well, actually he is supporting that and the gal go, Oh, well I still don't like

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
this guy.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Get him off here.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.160
I just want to turn my guns in.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.160
I mean, they don't say that, but they say everything else up to that.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:14.120
So they're in a delusional world and I can be on Pacifica radio or something with all

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.360
the, what you would call liberals and they're all calling in a green, making good points

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.080
admitting the Democrats are corrupt too because if you're not hypocritical, they'll wake up.

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.240
You got liberals calling in going, yeah, I see what you mean about owning guns.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.240
It makes a lot of sense.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.960
You know, the government's tyrannical.

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.400
Why should we give our guns up?

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.440
I'm going to realize what you're saying and I did hear Australia's crime rate exploded

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:40.160
once they took the guns and then one person will call in and go, I bet you're racist,

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.160
Mr. Jones.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.160
Aren't you?

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160
Yes.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.640
New World Order is a code word for some type of racial group you're a member of.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.480
And I go, no, actually the government's calling for New World Order and I'll go, wait a minute.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:56.000
You work for the government, don't you work in intelligence or for the FBI or for the,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.760
or do you work for some federal program where I work?

01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.760
Does it matter?

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760
I'll go, just answer the question.

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.480
Well, yes, I work for the government.

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.120
Well hey, whoa.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:11.080
This was one of the moments in the show where I was like, this is kind of feeling like the

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.080
present.

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.240
This is imaginary nonsense.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.240
This one's good.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:20.200
So I've heard that narrative arc of these callers discussed by Alex throughout his career.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.560
That's sort of, it's very normal.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.660
These seem to be archetypes of callers that he's imagined arguing with that he uses as

01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.640
examples for decades as dumb people he has to talk to.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.620
These people are used as caricatures of straw man arguments presenting things that are valid

01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.160
complaints about Alex.

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.120
He uses these imaginary dumb callers as puppets to introduce these ideas like that he's a

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.520
racist because then it's a lot easier to mock and discredit those ideas like that he's a

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.520
racist.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.520
Yeah.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:51.120
You can hear Alex essentially laying out that him arguing that the Republican Party is corrupt

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:54.960
is a way to get liberals who can admit that the Democrats are corrupt to wake up.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960
Yeah.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:01.240
If you lie about him being hypocritical, they'll wake up and they won't know you're lying because

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.660
you're not a malicious figure yet.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:08.040
This is a strategy and it's meant to make Alex look closer to the middle where this

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.060
hypothetical Democrat is.

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:13.820
The idea is for him to paint a picture where he and this liberal have more in common than

01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:18.140
they think and they only don't think so that they're more in common because these two corrupt

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.640
political parties have told them that they're not similar.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.280
This is not true.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.620
Alex is light years to the right of the GOP.

01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:29.700
So what he's actually doing is trying to pull disaffected people of either party towards

01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:31.320
the extreme right.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:36.120
For people already in the Republican Party, this could mean becoming extremely right wing.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.360
For Democrats, this might mean becoming a jaded political nihilist, maybe embracing

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.200
the GOP or just not voting for Democratic candidates.

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.560
Ultimately, the political end result of the project Alex is engaging in is this.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.200
It's always about dragging people to the right while pretending there is no right or left,

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.720
which serves the political interests of whichever viable political entity is furthest to the

01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.720
right.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.720
Yeah.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.720
That's what he's doing.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.820
I am above the left right divide, Dan.

01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:10.520
They want to do all these taxes and things, and I just want to drink blood from the skulls

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.360
of my enemies.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.120
What doesn't everybody get about that?

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.120
Wake up, people.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.960
I'm above the left right divide.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:17.960
Right.

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:23.740
I mean, if he was truly opposed to the left right divide or whatever, and someone was

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.200
like a Democrat and they were like, oh, you know what?

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.640
The Democratic Party does suck.

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.120
I'm going to start exploring further left options.

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.040
He should be just as into that, right?

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.040
I mean.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.040
That's what I think.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.040
Yeah.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.040
Oh, no, he's not.

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.040
Because the socialists are...

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.040
There you go.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.040
Well, I mean, George Bush is a socialist.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.040
They're demons.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.040
Everybody's a socialist at this point.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.760
In the present day, he's a socialist of demons.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760
We're not sure about that.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.760
That's fair.

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.760
Could be a metaphor in 2003.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.160
Is he...

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.520
He's anti-Reagan at this point, too, right?

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.440
I haven't heard him bring up Reagan on this episode.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.440
Oh, that's true.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.440
I can't speak to that.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.440
That's true.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.440
Fair enough.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440
He doesn't like anybody, from what I can tell.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.440
It does sound like that.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.160
That is like, you look back and you're like, ooh, gross, conservative.

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.160
They were communists.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.520
Which I can...

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.620
But you can totally see that kind of being attractive, especially at that time, whenever

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:19.720
you look at the fact that both political parties are like, war is great, and let's do it all

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:20.720
the time.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.440
And you're like, what's the fucking point of having either of these political parties

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:28.720
if we're just going to wind up with a mission accomplished banner?

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.720
Right.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.720
And I think that that is why something like Alex is super potent back then.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.720
Totally, totally.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.920
Because there are a lot of people who are right in the exact place that they need to

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:42.400
be to hear a message like that and get sent down a road they don't know they're going

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:43.400
down.

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:52.040
I would say it's hard to argue that, you know, Osama bin Laden didn't destroy an entire country

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.520
by himself.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.520
It's kinda...

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.520
He had compatriots.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.520
It's kinda a little...

01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:02.220
No, he had tons of compatriots, of course, but it's a little bit like, you know, 9-11

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:05.840
really did defeat America.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:10.040
Alex does talk a bit about 9-11 on this episode, but not in a way that I felt like this is

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.680
where we're gonna start picking into it.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.680
Sure.

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.600
So as I look through the 2003 stuff, when he gets into more of it, I'll definitely...

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.600
We'll see some more 9-11.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:23.480
Yeah, 9-11 will definitely be more of a topic than it has been in our show in the past.

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:28.560
But I can't talk about it today because Alex, as he's talking about these callers that he

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:34.000
gets on radio stations, he ends up talking about being on a show out in the UK, right?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And this...

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.920
He got a call from a warden, a jail guard, and this is when...

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.580
This is evidence that this show used to be a family show.

01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:50.560
I was on in England, and big national show, the James Whale Show, and it covers the whole

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.560
country.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.560
We're getting calls from Scotland, Ireland, wherever.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.560
It's a big transmitter.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.560
A couple transmitters.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:55.560
Actually, there's a big one in London.

01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:01.520
They can have like, you know, 500,000 watt AMs there.

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:06.640
And I'm on the show, and they take like 20 calls.

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.280
Everybody agrees with me.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:14.620
And one guy calls in, and he goes, I'd love to get you in a jail cell.

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.480
I'd love to get you in there.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:21.000
And well, actually, the guy's threatening me, saying, yeah, you're gonna be...

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
You're a traitor.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
You're a idiot.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
You're this and that.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.720
Don't talk about how my queen's German, because I pointed out their royal family isn't even

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.720
there.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.040
You know, it isn't even British.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.040
And I said, wait a minute.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.840
You work for the government, don't you?

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.280
He's like, yeah, I'd like to get you.

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.280
I'd like to get you.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.560
And he hadn't even said yet that he was a jail guard.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:40.080
I go, you're a jail guard, aren't you?

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.080
He goes, huh?

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080
Huh?

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080
I go, yeah, aren't you?

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.520
And he goes, yeah, I'd like to get you in the cell, and I'd like to urinate on you.

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520
He's another word.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.520
I said, oh, oh.

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:49.520
And the host was amazed.

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:52.040
He goes, how'd you know that?

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.480
I can just tell.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480
Family show.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.480
I don't say piss on this show.

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.480
Not back then.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.280
We're gonna adhere to these FCC rules.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280
Yeah.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280
No piss.

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.480
I would say, I don't know, I haven't heard this radio interview, but I would guess that

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.520
either this caller was like, yeah, I'm a jail guard.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.520
You did.

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.520
Sure.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.520
I'm a jail guard.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.520
Fine.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.520
Or this didn't happen, and Alex is imagining it.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.520
Yes.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.460
It's interesting, though, Alex goes to spending five minutes talking about how he knew this

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:22.460
guy was a jail guard.

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.320
He's like, he had this tone of his voice where he's saying, I want to get you locked up.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.400
I want to get you locked up.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.540
And people only have this tone when they really want to do it.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:36.640
So I heard this guy's voice, and I knew that he either, either was a serial kidnapper or

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.640
a jail guard.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.640
That was only two options.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.400
Most people who are smart kidnappers just become jail guards, because then they can

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.140
do all that stuff, and it's legal.

01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:45.140
That sounds right.

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:47.280
That makes intuitive sense.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:50.920
And this is how I read this guy's voice and knew that he was a jail guard.

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:54.480
People who kidnap illegally just don't know what they're supposed to be doing, right?

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.840
They just haven't found the right kidnapping job.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:02.000
It's a little annoying, but also kind of trivially fun.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.080
Like Alex is just wasting his time.

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:09.760
It's such an annoying habit of so many people to tell you a story where somebody is acting

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:15.060
so over the top, unreasonably, that it's impossible to believe.

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:19.040
And you knew before he even started he was full of shit.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.040
Yeah.

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:21.040
It's like, why am I here?

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:25.840
So Alex gets back to calls, and this caller unfortunately has a terrible story of being

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.840
canceled.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.920
And I'm calling you today because my local FM talk station has banned me from asking

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.960
any questions concerning the Warren Commission because they say it was 40 years ago and it's

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:41.600
so full of holes that they deny its even existence.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:47.400
It was all a big television drama, like when Ruby shot Oswald.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.400
But you know-

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:53.000
Anybody who believes that Oswald acted alone, fine, I got a bridge, I want to sell you.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.280
This is like my favorite thing.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.720
I love going back to this time in the past, and the callers are fucking callers.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:04.960
They're not like sycophant nonsense, I love your brain force now.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.880
It's a weirdo who can't call the local FM station anymore because he talks too much

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.440
about the Warren Report.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:17.680
I'm not allowed there anymore because I refuse to discuss anything but 50 year old news.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:19.360
That's what I do here.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.480
I love that.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:27.200
That's a vibe I could listen to, like, I could listen to that forever.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:31.440
I'm not allowed on C-SPAN anymore because I won't stop talking about Fort Sumter.

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.920
And it's bullshit, Alex, it's bullshit.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.400
The cancel culture is out of control.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.520
It's out of control.

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:44.040
They won't let me harangue them for no reason about Fort Sumter.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.720
It's infuriating, Dan.

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.720
I love it.

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.760
Love it!

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.320
So he gets another call, and this guy brings up the John Birch Society, which I teased

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.200
would come up.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.320
Alex believes that the John Birch Society is mostly good.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:00.320
Yes.

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:04.880
He's pretending that so much of his ideology isn't based on people who were in and adjacent

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.880
to the John Birch Society.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:06.880
Unrelated.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.880
Unrelated to the John Birch Society.

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.880
Very good.

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880
No.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:10.880
Unrelated.

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.880
I learned everything separate from the John Birch Society.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:16.000
I did my own research, I definitely wasn't raised in a household filled with John Birch

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
or literature.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.240
It was mostly John Birch Society stuff and sci-fi that he thought was real.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.240
That's mostly-

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240
Wow!

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.800
That really does explain everything, doesn't it?

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800
Not everything, but a lot of it.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800
It explains too much.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800
Yeah.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800
For a human.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.880
So, this made me laugh so fucking hard.

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.080
If you get what he's talking about, don't yell it out.

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.600
Just let this play out.

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:44.960
There is an Oklahoma family who are begging oil and a bunch of other stuff who are actually

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:48.200
involved in the founding of the John Birch Society, but the John Birch Society overall

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200
is good.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:54.920
Certainly, early on, not the Birchers, but other conservative groups have been used by

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.120
the bankers.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.480
They'll tell some good conservative military man, that guy's a communist, go take him out,

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.520
and they'll go do it and later take him out for plausible deniability.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.920
So many of our troops over there in Iraq now really are risking their lives and living

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.920
in a third world cesspool bombed out stone age system because they really believe in

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.920
this country.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.920
Yes, sir.

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.620
But it is evil.

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:18.840
Does that mean the troops are evil?

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:19.840
No.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.840
It means they're ignorant.

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:21.840
Thanks for the call, Spencer.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.840
I appreciate the call.

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:23.840
Yeah.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:24.840
I should have gotten into that.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.680
Man, I had an article, big mainstream article on that family, how they funded the John Birchers

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.640
and all the different things they do and how they are big supporters of Bush.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.040
I need to dig that back up and cover that.

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.040
Hmm.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.880
I wonder who he's talking about.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:40.880
Is he talking about the Candyman?

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:41.880
No.

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:42.880
He's talking about Fred Koch.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.000
Oh, that's who he's talking about.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Son of a bitch.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Yeah.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
He's talking about the Koch family.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
That's right.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
They're in...

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Oh my God.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I didn't think of them because of the Kansas thing.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Yeah.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.240
They started in Kansas, but Fred Koch eventually, you know, he'd go on to help Hitler build

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.240
some oil refineries.

01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.240
Well, sure.

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.560
And then he started a crude oil interest in Duncan, Oklahoma called Rock Island Oil and

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.360
Refining Company.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360
It's just amazing.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.880
Like in 2003, hearing Alex like, oh yeah, I heard about this big family that they fund

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.360
to the John Birch Society and they support Bush.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.360
He doesn't know the name.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.000
He doesn't know anything about this.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Unreal.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.480
He's bathed in John Birch Society nonsense and he doesn't know the name of Fred Koch.

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.480
So infuriating.

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:26.480
Yeah.

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.720
And then, you know, you think maybe if Citizens United had gone another way, none of us would

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.160
be able to instantly pull Koch brothers names.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160
Wouldn't that be lovely?

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.160
Yeah.

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.160
I don't know.

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:42.320
I don't know if that's true, but certainly it made it worse.

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:48.320
I think it's really interesting that like, I'm, you know, obviously I'm fascinated by

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:56.240
particularly that era of anti-communist propaganda and sort of ideology.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.780
And so the John Birch Society is something that looms large and like obviously I've looked

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:05.680
into it a bit and I know about the first meetings and the people and like, yeah, obviously Fred

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.440
Koch was one of the founding members.

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:13.740
Like, it's weird to me to think that Alex came from a family that clearly was Bertie.

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:17.520
Maybe not full on members, but associates of members.

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:22.120
And he doesn't, he doesn't understand like who the, who some of these players are.

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:27.400
I mean, weren't they supposed to be cells that weren't necessarily connected to each

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.660
other originally.

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:33.520
So it's not like they had a hero worship of their founding members.

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.840
No, but you would know.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.840
You would think.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.840
You would hope.

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.840
But then again, Fred Koch didn't stay in it for all that long.

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.840
Yeah.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:42.840
He was too busy with the Nazis.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:43.840
He's got shit to do.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:49.440
But then again, the Koch brothers were pretty involved with like Ron Paul.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.640
Yeah, that's true.

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.640
I don't know.

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.640
It's weird.

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:55.360
It's weird that he would, he'd have this non-awareness.

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.320
What an ignorant asshole.

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.520
How dare he tell me that he knows anything.

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.880
It does feel like he's not feigning ignorance.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:11.240
He does seem like he's frustrated that he doesn't know the name of this big Birch family.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.240
It's strange.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.240
Wild.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.240
Anyway, he gets another call.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:17.560
This is where we learned that Saddam Hussein may be on a beach.

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560
Hey Alex, my name is Nick.

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:22.840
I was in the water about 22 years.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.520
Just some full information about Saddam Hussein.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:32.440
On the 14th of this past month, the Gulf News out of Dubai and the Iranian News Service

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:38.320
both reported that the U.S. reached an agreement with Russia for $5 million cash in credit

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.800
to get Saddam and 100 of his closest followers out.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.240
This past Thursday on Univision, one broadcast in the middle of the day said that Saddam

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.920
Hussein had been spotted in Cuba with his family.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920
Sounds about right.

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:55.920
Okay.

01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:56.920
All right.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.920
Yep.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:58.920
Sounds about right.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920
He's probably in Cuba.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920
Yep.

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920
That makes sense.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.920
You know what I would do?

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.120
Possible other explanation.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.680
Someone who looks like Saddam Hussein was seen in Cuba.

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.520
You know what I would do if I was Saddam?

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.280
Get closer to the United States.

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:11.280
Good idea.

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.640
That's a good plan.

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.640
He'll never look.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:16.900
I'll take a boat from North Korea to Maine.

01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:23.560
We have one last clip here because Alex takes another call, and this person is into the

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.440
Birch Society, and so there's a little bit more conversation about that.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.560
I think this is kind of interesting.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:34.760
First, let me say something about the John Birch Society.

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.880
I was a member when I lived in Utah.

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:43.040
I'm not a member now, but I do get the magazine, and they put out wonderful information.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.040
So you're still a member.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.680
I was going over some old ones the other day that go back into 98, and here they were telling

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:59.080
about this threat of the World Trade Towers being bombed, and this is all a connection

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:04.680
with Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and on and on and on.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.440
And how the government's going to blame that for it.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.440
Right.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:13.480
But the one thing I want to make clear, and this is for everybody, there's people that

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:20.040
say things about Alex Jones and put out information about Alex Jones or John Stattmiller or somebody

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.040
else.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.320
And this is a ploy.

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:29.920
I remember back in the 50s and 60s, the Communist Party put out a propaganda.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.920
Divide and conquer.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:31.920
Right.

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.920
And the same thing with MacArthur.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:38.040
I even hear conservatives talk about MacArthurism as though that was something evil.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.040
No, McCarthy was right.

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.640
No, he wouldn't do what the human wanted, so he's bad, yeah.

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.640
McCarthy was right.

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.800
Well, McCarthy was right.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.120
The KGB files got released five years ago, and it turned out it was twice as bad than

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.120
he thought.

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.120
But it was okay when he said it was, hold on, let me say something.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:53.120
Hold on a second, ma'am.

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.000
It was okay, ma'am, ma'am, it was okay when he said that it was just communist.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.200
When he figured out that, he said, wait, the army runs the communists, our army's giving

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:05.400
them nukes and funding them, boom, he was out of there like that.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.400
Go ahead.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.840
So Alex has made up a fun story to try and pretend that Joseph McCarthy was right and

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.760
his insane communist witch hunt, but that's all just bullshit.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760
Yeah.

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.240
Also, I love the moment there where he almost yells at her.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.720
Yeah, yeah, that is nice.

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:20.200
That's a really polite, angry Alex.

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.560
Yeah, yeah, that's better than now.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.560
Mm-hmm.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.560
Fuck off!

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.560
Yeah.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.560
Look!

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.040
Buy my shit!

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.600
I would assume that those issues of the John Birch Society magazine that the caller's referring

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:37.720
to, I think they have to do with the other time the World Trade Center was bombed back

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:38.720
in 1993.

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.720
You would think.

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.120
That has something to do with that.

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.000
I've noticed that a lot of conspiracy thinkers tend to ignore that that happened because

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.520
it helps make sense of why people would have been talking about terrorists attacking the

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.160
World Trade Center before 9-11.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:55.480
Yeah, it would be like, oh, so this guy already tried it?

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:59.040
It would make sense for him to give it another go if he failed the first time.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.040
Yeah.

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:06.400
They need for these conversations to be devoid of the context of the first bombing because

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.160
otherwise it's like, yeah, of course.

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.160
Yeah.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.480
That's a reasonable explanation for this.

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.080
I find this really weird, because Alex is talking about, like, okay, so this caller's

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:20.080
saying that there's a John Birch Society magazine from, like, 1998, it's talking about bombing

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.160
of the World Trade Center, and Alex is like, yeah, and how the government will blame bin

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.160
Laden.

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.160
Yep.

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.160
That's supposed to be his prediction.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.160
Yeah.

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:32.440
So wait, now he's saying that the John Birch Society stuff from 1998 was making that prediction

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.640
that he made in 2001 that also he stole from Bill Cooper.

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640
Yes.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.640
Yeah.

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.960
He doesn't seem to be so eager to take credit as some kind of a prophetic person in terms

01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:44.960
of this at this point.

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.960
Yeah.

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:49.920
I would imagine the reason that he didn't make it to the four-year university was he

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.760
couldn't keep himself from plagiarizing anything and everything in his sight.

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.120
Yeah, it's possible.

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.720
It feels like more of an individual at this point, though.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.720
I'll say that.

01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.720
It does.

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:00.720
That is true.

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:01.720
Yeah.

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:02.720
I was not-

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.720
I mean, despite the Rush Limbaugh impression, they're very clear.

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:05.720
Yeah.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:13.280
Well, I remember at that time, my dad had all the Limbaugh books and I was inundated

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.000
with right-wing talk news radio, and I wasn't hearing this shit.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
That's for sure.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.720
I definitely wasn't hearing this.

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:27.740
Some of this is a little weirder, but also I'm fascinated by how some of it is so one-to-one

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:33.660
similar to the present, the way he deals with SARS, the way he's saying that they intentionally

01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:37.680
released foot and mouth from port and down.

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.160
It's hauntingly similar.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:44.800
Those who learn to exploit in the past refuse to change anything so they can continue exploiting

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.800
in the future, Dan.

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.200
So I have one last question for you.

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.320
What do you think about apples?

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.460
They're pretty good.

01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:53.680
So what do you think about them apples?

01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:54.680
That's the real question.

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:55.680
I'm fascinated.

01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:02.520
I'm loving the past, and I can't wait to keep listening to this.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:03.520
Yeah.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.960
I can't wait to see how, as the Iraq war is clearly not over, how Alex deals with that.

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:09.960
Yeah.

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:13.200
The 2004 election, it's just nuts.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.800
We haven't done monthly investigations for a long time.

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.320
I feel like this might be open-ended.

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.960
This could be forever.

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.960
Yes.

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:22.800
But be not afraid.

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.840
I will still also be keeping up on the present day, and I promise on our next episode we

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.160
will check in and see what Alex is up to, whatever his dumb ass is talking about in

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.160
the present.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:32.160
No kidding.

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.160
See if it mirrors this.

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:34.160
I know.

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:35.160
Somehow.

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.160
We'll see.

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.880
But anyway, we'll be back.

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:38.880
Until then, we have a website.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:39.880
Indeed we do.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:40.880
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:41.880
Yep.

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.880
We're also on Twitter.

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:43.880
We are on Twitter.

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:44.880
It's at Knowledge Underscore Fight and at Go To Bed Jordan.

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.880
Yep.

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:46.880
We're also on Facebook.

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:47.880
We are.

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:48.880
iTunes.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:52.440
And if you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.640
doing God's work right now.

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.640
Yep.

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:55.640
We'll be back.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.640
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:57.640
I'm Leo.

01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:58.640
I'm DZX Clark.

01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.640
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.920
I am super socialist Paul Wolfowitz.

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.320
Cindy in Kansas, you're on the air.

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320
Thanks for holding.

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.320
Hello Alex.

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.320
I'm a first time caller.

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.320
I'm a huge fan.

01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.320
I love your work.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:09.320
I love you.

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:38.040
I love you too.
