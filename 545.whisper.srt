N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,040
Damn and Jordan, I am sweating

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,280
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,840
I have great respect for knowledgefight

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,040
Shang, we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,200
Damn and Jordan, knowledgefight

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,000
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,360
Need, I need money, rattle her, rattle her

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,840
Andy in Kansas, Andy in, Andy in, stop it

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,120
Andy in, Andy in Kansas, Andy in, Andy in, it's time to pray

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,760
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,000
I love your work

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
knowledgefight

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,400
I love you

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,040
Um, Jordan

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,200
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, drink novelty beverages

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
and talk just a little bit about Alex Jones

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,360
Oh, indeed we are, Dan

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,760
Jordan

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,160
Dan

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,640
Jordan

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,560
Quick question for you

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,000
What's up?

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,120
What's your bright spot today?

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,240
My bright spot today, it might be the same as yours and that is

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,280
Oh, I bet it's not

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Okay, well in that case, thank you to the Godawful Movies podcast

32
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,760
Oh yeah, yeah

33
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,640
Our episode came out with them on Tuesday

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,240
and it was a lot of fun to see the response that people had

35
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,200
I think we have a lot of crossover between audiences

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,120
and it was so fun hanging out and talking about a dumb

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,960
Chuck Norris fighting demons movie

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,920
It was a blast

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,200
I was so terrified when we recorded that

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
that none of it would make sense

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,120
Like, the plot doesn't make sense if you watch the movie

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,960
and then hearing the five of us try and

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,480
piece it together, yeah, no, no

44
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,320
I've never done a podcast where you just like

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,080
break down the plot of a movie before

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,040
Yeah, yeah

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,200
And so for me, I was very self-conscious of like

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,240
there's no connective tissue here, this does not make sense

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,120
Oh, but everybody seemed to enjoy it, so thanks to them

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,480
and if you haven't checked that out, you should give it a whirl

51
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,600
Yes, very much so

52
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,080
I gave it a little bit of a listen and

53
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,280
they told us many times, you know, like

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
hey, I'm just trying to move along

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
don't worry about it if you keep talking and we're both like

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,800
man, if you don't literally tell us to shut up

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
we're gonna keep talking

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
We can't stop

59
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,000
No, I was literally listening to that like

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
I missed at least a half hour of stuff that I wanted to put in there

61
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Yeah, yeah, I know, that's definitely true

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
There were more thoughts

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,800
Yeah, we could have done so much longer

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,680
Could have been like one of our Rogan episodes

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,880
At a certain point, I was half expecting them to leave

66
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,840
and just be like, hey, you guys finish it out

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,720
Yeah, we'll be back

68
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,640
Yeah, yeah

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
So what about you, what's your bright spot?

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,320
My bright spot, Dan, I will guarantee it's not the same as yours

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
because it is

72
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,760
Opening Day Baseball, baby!

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,360
Okay, yeah, that is different

74
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,280
Yeah, that's different

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,560
I was gonna say you could guarantee because you already know what mine is

76
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,400
Yeah, well, obviously

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
So that's a stupid bet for me to take at that point

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Well

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
Congratulations on the sticks

80
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,440
Yeah, Opening Day Baseball

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,760
Don't congratulate me, it's not like I'm getting my cup of coffee this year

82
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,280
You enjoy watching these guys get out there and play the game America's past time

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,440
I do, I do

84
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Um

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,400
You know, I think the Ricketts family should have been burnt at the stake for many reasons

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,520
but what they're doing to the Cubs is now at least number three on the list

87
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,560
Who's looking good this year? What teams are in, who are you keeping your eye on other than the Cubs?

88
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,960
Uh, other than the Cubs? Well, I mean, I'm looking at Los Angeles

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,480
The LA Angels because Shohei Otonori is my favorite baseball player

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,080
Sure

91
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,200
By far, he can throw a 98 mile an hour fastball

92
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,320
He can hit 500 foot dingers, Dan

93
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,680
It doesn't get better than that

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,200
How are the Expos looking?

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,960
The Expos are looking dead, uh, non-existent

96
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,320
Uh

97
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,040
The Expos are looking like a Blockbuster franchise right now, how do you feel?

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Uh oh, I gotta call my booking, I made some bad bets

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,480
Uh, well, you'll get there in 1999

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,000
Um, who's that, uh, is Johnny Damon still around?

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,760
He looking good this year?

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,680
What else you got?

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,320
I don't know

104
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I want, I want more names from you

105
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,440
Albert Pujols?

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,880
Uh, actually Albert Pujols is on the Angels and he is still around

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,560
All my buddies used to love, uh, Pujols because he was on the, of course, he was on the St. Louis

108
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,400
He was on the Cardinals, yeah

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,680
And he had that weird stance, he would stand there real weird

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,120
Still does, still does

111
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,040
One of the best hitters in the history of the game

112
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,960
Yeah, he's very good

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,920
He seems like a good guy too, from everything I can tell, right?

114
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,200
Uh, yeah, that's what I've heard

115
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,640
I don't know

116
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,040
He seems like a nice dude

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Seems like a, I don't know

118
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,400
Nobody's ever been, like, gone out of their way to be like, hey Jordan, have you heard how much of an asshole Albert Pujols is?

119
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,440
How's, uh, how's Roberto Clemente looking this year?

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Not as good as you might hope

121
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,360
I've got bad news for you, Dan

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,640
Oh, no

123
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,440
So, Jordan, um, today we got an interesting episode to go over

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,320
As I promised, we're back in the present day

125
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,720
Indeed

126
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,200
So today we're going to be talking about March 30th and 31st, 2021

127
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,640
Blackjack

128
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,440
So what do you think about them apples?

129
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,160
Oh, no

130
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,760
He's thinking about, nah, it's not going to work

131
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,040
That bit's not going to, that's not going to fly

132
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,400
No, but I do love that drop

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,280
I have to use it for something

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,240
No, it is good

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,040
I think you can tell me, you can use it whenever you have something

136
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,640
shitty to say to me instead

137
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
How do you like them apples?

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,120
Exactly

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,240
Alright, Blackjack

140
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,160
Anyway, it's interesting, couple of days, infuriating in many ways

141
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Kind of bizarre in another way

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,880
There's something that I think is really interesting

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
that I think bears talking about

144
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,160
but it also, Alex's position on it almost doesn't matter

145
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,680
So this is my way of, as is tradition, underselling what we're about to talk about

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,000
Right, right, right, right

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
In advance, this doesn't matter

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,480
Nope

149
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,200
But before we get down to business, let's do something that does matter

150
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,680
which is name some new wonks

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Oh, that's a good idea

152
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,720
So first, I'm Dan and it's 2020

153
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,560
One Blackjack, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm a policy wonk

155
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
Thank you very much

156
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,400
Next, Knowledge Fighting God Awful Movies is my kink

157
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,440
Give me more please, sirs, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

158
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm a policy wonk

159
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,120
Thank you very much

160
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,520
Thank you

161
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,320
Next, William K.W. III, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

162
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,360
I'm a policy wonk

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,440
Thank you, Billy Kay

164
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,920
Thank you

165
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,440
Next, Spider Leadership, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

166
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm a policy wonk

167
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,600
Thank you very much, Spider Leadership

168
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,280
Thank you

169
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
About time they started pulling their weight around here

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,480
Looking at you, mercantile dogs and archaeologist cats

171
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,120
Yeah

172
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Next, I sold Dan weed, not guns, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm a policy wonk

174
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
Thank you very much

175
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
Did I say that someone sold me guns?

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,760
Was there a possibility?

177
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,000
No one sold me guns

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,080
No, was this like an old friend of yours in high school?

179
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,480
Maybe

180
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,360
Who were like, you had the opportunity and in the left hand I have a gun

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,760
I don't

182
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,680
And in the right hand I have some weed, you can only choose one

183
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,320
I don't recall that, I know that I have bought weed from a lot of people over the course of my life

184
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,000
And I do know that there was one person that I knew

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,640
I don't think it's this person, because I have no, I don't know

186
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,880
But there was one person that I knew who shall go nameless

187
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,720
Who did sell me weed for a while

188
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,120
And then later I found out that he was also selling guns

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,800
Oh

190
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,440
But I didn't know that at the time

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,800
Well, I think we know it now

192
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,880
I don't think that that's this person, it would be bizarre if it was

193
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,120
That would be bizarre

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,200
But anyway, thank you so much, you're a policy wonk

195
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,520
Are there any people who have been with the same weed dealer for like 30 years?

196
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,400
You know, like some people who are like, I just only go to this one store for my, like I'm a Kohl's person

197
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,080
Do you have like a, I'm a Kohl person

198
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
I wouldn't be surprised

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,520
I mean, you know, I think you have a bond that's formed

200
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,880
I think Kohl's gets arrested less

201
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,040
And that disrupts relationships sometimes

202
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,880
Their loyalty program is a little bit better

203
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,000
So finally, I'd like to say thank you to somebody who is now a technocrat

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Thank you so much, Neve C. You are now a technocrat

205
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm a policy wonk

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,080
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

207
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,560
How's your 401k doing, bro?

208
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,360
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

209
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,560
Let's just get down to business

210
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,640
We ain't making that money off that heroin

211
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,360
Why are you pimps so good?

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,320
My neck is freakishly large

213
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,920
I declare info war on you

214
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank you so much, Neve

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,760
Yes, thank you very much, so much

216
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,680
Yeah, so Jordan, today we have a fun out of context drop

217
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,960
Alex is violent towards animals

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,400
Sure

219
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,560
And this is right in that line

220
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,600
Sometimes you gotta hit a mule upside the head with a 2x4

221
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,320
Whoa

222
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,560
That doesn't sound true

223
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,040
Sometimes you have to, sometimes you are left with no choice

224
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,720
I would like more context on the situation where I have no choice but to hit it with a 2x4

225
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,400
Well, if this wasn't an out of context drop, I could give you the entire context

226
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,280
Because Alex spends about 10 fucking minutes on this show

227
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,800
Talking about how sometimes if there's like a cow that's being eaten by fire ants and it's pregnant

228
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,320
And you gotta get it to safety, you gotta hit it with stuff in order to get it to move

229
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,160
I was gonna go with pure zombie situation

230
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,360
But I will accept that if there is a cow being eaten by fire ants

231
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,200
You need to get this cow away from the fire ants

232
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
You gotta hit it with a board

233
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,080
Sure

234
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,320
And the liberals would tell you, no, don't hit it with a board

235
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,640
I'm still gonna go with maybe try getting rid of the fire ants first

236
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,400
Maybe try a hose

237
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,880
He spends probably two segments talking about that

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,800
That seems right

239
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,440
It's outrageous

240
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,080
That seems right

241
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,960
Does he have enough time to get to the big news?

242
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
No

243
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh, okay

244
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,200
So here we start on the 30th and I'm gonna give you a spoiler in advance

245
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,920
I turned this episode off

246
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,880
It got very boring

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,760
But here's how it starts

248
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,360
Wow, it is official mainstream news

249
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,520
That the COVID lockdowns are designed to make us live in our houses and be prisoners

250
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,800
To quote, save the earth from carbon

251
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,400
You know, Debo said it years ago

252
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,000
They had a plan a few months ago

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,600
They said how great the lockdowns are, have them permanently to save the earth

254
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,440
Have robots deliver us all our food, making us obsolete, depopulating

255
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,920
Sure

256
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,960
But now the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Associated Press

257
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,480
Without me even looking today

258
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,960
Wait, what?

259
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,480
Just everywhere are saying

260
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,120
What?

261
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,640
We need to be prisoners and never leave our homes again

262
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,160
I mean, they are just going for full Stockholm syndrome

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,880
I was like, oh, wow

264
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,000
How could this not have turned out to be a banger of an episode, Dan?

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,760
I was like, wow, this is gonna be something he's really gonna need to substantiate

266
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,800
Without even looking, I saw these things that didn't happen

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
How amazing is that, Dan?

268
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,000
I think that one of the things about our show that I enjoy is that you'd hear something like that

269
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,680
And most people would be like, no, it didn't

270
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,360
Yeah

271
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,240
I'll dig into things, but today I just felt like, no, no

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,120
The media did not say, did not announce that they want you to be prisoners in your home

273
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,480
I'm fine, we've been over this territory so many times that this is just one I'm gonna be like, no

274
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,000
Absolutely not, go fuck yourself

275
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Listen, I give you more than the benefit of the debt, and you have broken me, sir

276
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,880
I don't feel broken, I just don't care

277
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,520
I'm gonna choose my battles, and this is one I'm just gonna be like

278
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,720
Wise, that's wise

279
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,800
Tell me what you're talking about, and then maybe we'll get into it, but probably not

280
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,200
Because I know the only citation that he ends up giving in the first 40 minutes of the show

281
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,800
Is a fucking editorial that doesn't say what he says it says

282
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,720
There's a problem with that

283
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,800
So I don't care

284
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,600
Anyway, this is where we get really misogynistic

285
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,160
Sure

286
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
You heard him bring up Stockholm Syndrome there

287
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,520
I thought it was the moment he started speaking is when we get really misogynistic, but here we go

288
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,840
Whoo-nelly

289
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,440
They are just going for full Stockholm Syndrome takeover

290
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,680
Because they know at least 30% of the public, mainly women, will go under Stockholm Syndrome

291
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,000
Because it's so authoritarian, they can't believe it's actually happening

292
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,640
And they are going to submit to the tyranny, nothing against women

293
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,920
But it's known in every psychological study in Rome and Babylon that

294
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,760
When an army would take over the city

295
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,280
Most of the women within minutes would start fighting for the enemy

296
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,880
As soon as it was clear that the enemy had taken over

297
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,120
And they would rat out their husbands, rat out their children, help execute them

298
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,080
If they thought it was for the good of the community

299
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,600
That's why when the country is conquered or the place is conquered

300
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,800
You don't kill the women

301
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,480
That's why, who was the house slave in Rome?

302
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,200
In Africa, who were the house slaves?

303
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,160
Africans had as many slaves as anybody

304
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,040
You brought women in the house

305
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,480
You kept the men out in the fields

306
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
And that's the system

307
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
Wow, that's something else, man

308
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,600
I don't even know where that begins

309
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,960
Yeah, it's a lot of thoughts and a lot of them are dumb

310
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,840
Okay, okay, alright

311
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,040
So then, okay, okay?

312
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,560
Mm-hmm

313
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,920
Okay, Dan, we have historical records

314
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,160
Of so many cities that were conquered

315
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,240
We have psychological studies from Rome

316
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,880
Yes, we've got so many psychological studies, double blind studies

317
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,320
Rome did a lot of double blind studies back then

318
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,240
Whenever invading armies will show up

319
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Women will immediately start fighting, within minutes

320
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,840
Start fighting for the enemy

321
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
Women are traitors

322
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,320
I'm confused as to whether or not he knows the

323
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,200
Severe number of underground, boy, I don't know

324
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,960
Resistance movements that were started, helmed

325
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,320
Almost like a locomotive, maybe, that went underground

326
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,880
I think there's one big one that it's hard to put back

327
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,840
So first thing to clear up, Stockholm Syndrome, as Alex understands it, isn't real

328
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,240
It's something that's depicted in dramatic movies a lot

329
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
But in terms of real life instances of someone exhibiting the signs of Stockholm Syndrome

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
It's exceedingly rare to find a real case

331
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,760
Yeah, what it really is, is that the cops are bad and reasonable people are like

332
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,240
Oh yeah, you guys are bad

333
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,560
And you can find some similarities to the behaviour within domestically violent situations

334
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,200
Some people will make those parallels, but that's not what we're talking about

335
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,480
That's not what the depiction of Stockholm Syndrome is

336
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,280
Second, the image of history that Alex is presenting is also not real

337
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,120
In movies, perhaps, invading groups don't kill women when they killed all the men in a particular town

338
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,160
But that's not how things have gone generally

339
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,320
No, they killed all the women, it wasn't hard

340
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,200
Always, but sometimes, a lot of the time

341
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,000
And the exception generally is when these invading groups would take the women as property

342
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,880
After conquering a particular group

343
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,000
And it wasn't because these women just decided it would be a good idea to join the other team

344
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Oh shit, now it's time to be property!

345
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,440
Guys, it's time, woo!

346
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,520
Let's get enslaved!

347
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,720
Let's do it, concubine me, baby!

348
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,880
Also, it may be the case that most depictions of persons enslaved inside households in the media are often women

349
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,000
But that's also historically not something that was universal

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,360
For instance, William Wells Brown and Lewis Clark are both examples of enslaved persons in the American South

351
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,720
Who were men whose duties were in the house

352
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,680
Both of whom wrote books about their experience that Alex could learn from, if he'd like

353
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,640
Alex's understanding of history is based almost entirely on movies and vague feelings he's gotten about history from media

354
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,760
Literally nothing he's saying is based on reality at all, but it feels like it if you just kind of assume fiction and reality are the same

355
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:14,960
And that's all that's going on here, man, and it is grim, his vision of what, like, that's a painfully chauvinistic view of

356
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,040
Yeah, yeah, you know, and it's not like, you know, movies aren't entertaining and stuff

357
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,720
But I think the fact that most movies have been written by white men over the years has probably ruined a bit of our good historical interpretation

358
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,760
I think that might have something to do with his ridiculous beliefs

359
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,200
Could be, could be, could be, you know, but no, no, Aaron Zurgen's good, yeah, never mind

360
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:46,400
Alex has this deep historical knowledge, and I shouldn't be poo-pooing him so much because, like, I mean, he's got a stack of papers

361
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,160
I have a stack of just unbelievable COVID-19 news, but just look at this stack, ladies and gentlemen

362
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,200
Look at this that dovetails with it

363
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,040
Your radio listener, you can just search into anything I'm saying and pull it up, what the crew does

364
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:08,680
Look at this, AP, Dear Normal, were you really that great in the first place? By a Sophie Rosenbaum, this reads like the darkest satire ever written

365
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,080
So this is nonsense, and we'll get to this here in a second, but here is Alex sort of talking about the editorial a little bit

366
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:26,200
Look at this, AP, Dear Normal, were you really that great in the first place? By a Sophie Rosenbaum, this reads like the darkest satire ever written

367
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:35,760
But it's real, and I'm gonna take the time out, even though this is four nightmare pages of evil, and I'm gonna read the damn thing on air, bottom of the hour

368
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:46,480
And it says, we're gonna lock you in your house, and you're gonna love it, and you're only gonna leave when we say you can, and it's not about the COVID, it's about the Earth

369
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,640
Doesn't say any of those things

370
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,240
That sounds right

371
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,640
This is an article that's an editorial presenting an opinion held by this writer

372
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:01,160
Alex is getting mad at an editorial and pretending that it somehow is the globalist admitting that they don't want anything to go back to normal, and it's all about climate, COVID's not even real

373
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,240
Furthermore, it was not addressed to Alex

374
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,880
No, it was addressed to Normal

375
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,080
Yeah, he's very abnormal

376
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,120
So Alex has nothing to do with this

377
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,640
If you read this editorial, it's not dark satire, and it's not advocating that we stay in lockdown forever

378
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:20,080
It's this writer expressing that as the world goes back to what we're looking at as normal, we run the risk of not living as ambitiously as we can

379
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:28,840
A better world is possible, and the urge for things to go back to some idea of normal might get in the way of achieving things that, you know, are good

380
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,680
From the article, quote, without normal, the path forward is more open, the opportunity is perhaps broader

381
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,080
What if there's a whole lot of amazing that stands to be lost if normal returns?

382
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,400
What if instead of banking on normalcy, we focused on that one-of-a-kind ability to adapt and evolve?

383
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,440
Maybe that's the way forward, instead of simply reconciling with what was and trying to recreate something that's already had its day

384
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,440
It's an interesting position that this author brings up, and it's not a unique perspective in terms of things that I've read, certainly

385
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,160
Yeah, yeah

386
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,320
But it's absolutely not what Alex is lying about, but it is a good headline for him to riff off of

387
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
Sure, yeah, yeah

388
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,680
But it's just nonsense, and if he's read it, this is embarrassing for him to be worked up about it

389
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
He has absolutely not read it

390
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,640
Yeah

391
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,280
Not a chance

392
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,760
Did he read it on air?

393
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,320
I don't know, probably, maybe after I turned it off

394
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,800
I told you, I turned off this episode

395
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,440
That's fair, that is fair

396
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,160
And part of the reason that I turned off this episode was, like, that misogyny at the beginning was pretty wild

397
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,400
That's astonishing

398
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
Yeah

399
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:40,760
But, because it's not a direct attack, you know, we're so used to misogyny being directed at women in the present

400
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:49,240
But to create a weird fictional, like, Adam and Eve story out of all women throughout history when being conquered

401
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,640
Well, all psychological studies have shown that within minutes they start fighting for the enemy

402
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,640
See, I feel like this is not true

403
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,760
This is just not true

404
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
What psychol-

405
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,920
Hmm, how would you even take that psychol-

406
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,640
Is there a psychologist that's in there on the ground, like, oh shit, somebody just got conquered, we gotta get there fast

407
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,800
Otherwise they're gonna turn before we've studied it properly

408
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,240
I don't know

409
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,360
But it was kind of interesting in a, you know, like, oh, you seem weird today

410
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,000
And I kind of got interested in, like, oh, is this gonna continue?

411
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,640
And it didn't, and it just became this aggressively long, protracted, boring stretch of immigrant bashing

412
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,240
Sure

413
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
In such a way that really, really is, like, unacceptable

414
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Un-okay, yeah

415
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,600
And I'll play a little clip and then, you know, we'll sort of discuss why I needed to turn this off

416
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,800
And then we saw a Daily Caller report saying, oh, there are hundreds of illegals with their children and others

417
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,920
And unaccompanied children at the airport in South Texas

418
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Loading onto planes with no ID

419
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,200
Loading onto planes with bags of cash and envelopes of cash

420
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,560
Controlled by the Democratic Party being sent all over the United States to disappear into God knows what

421
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,880
Encounterment of federal and state law, which Biden hadn't signed an executive order

422
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,880
They could be overturned by courts, they haven't changed the federal law

423
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,240
This is all lawlessness

424
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,240
So he goes on and just on and on, beating up and saying, like, just horrendous things

425
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,040
About anybody who may be an immigrant

426
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,200
And, you know, the effect of this isn't something that is positive

427
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,120
It's not something that's even interesting

428
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,920
This is just an incitement

429
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,440
Yeah

430
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,520
I think when he's talking about these people who are alleged to be undocumented folks

431
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,600
Who are being given bags of money and then sent to disappear into the-

432
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,560
That's only going to make the audience suspicious of everybody that they see

433
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,560
That they might deem to be possibly an immigrant who might have a bag of cash

434
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,480
And just disappeared in the middle of America

435
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,000
If he said-

436
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,240
It's irresponsible as hell

437
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,280
Yeah, if he said Jew, we'd just be like, oh, okay, cool, you're a Nazi, now stop speaking forever

438
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,080
Because that's what he's- he's doing that

439
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,520
He's Nazi-ing

440
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,160
It's not something that can really be interestingly discussed outside of rebuke

441
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,440
Yeah

442
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,800
It's not something that I have much to bring to the table other than, fuck this, this is unacceptable

443
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:26,440
We've talked a ton about, like, specific narratives and things that he deploys against, you know, immigrant populations and what have you

444
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,000
But this was just, like, it just should be turned off

445
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,240
Yeah

446
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,080
It's not even, like, I don't know how else to say it

447
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:42,920
We should have a drop that's just a big, like, stamp sound and then it says Protocols of the Elders of Zion

448
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,200
And then we just move on, like, yup, boom

449
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,840
And so there was one more thing that I heard, and this is, like, I was in that place

450
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,280
And I think I still needed something else to kick me over the, like, turn this off

451
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,440
And this is where I turned it off

452
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:03,640
And then the FBI announces two days ago they're waiving all background checks for the people at the facilities and the foster homes where they're sent

453
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,360
So they're coming in, no ID, not with their parents in many cases, as young as two years old

454
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,320
They're being put on buses and airplanes and flown to be picked up by random people and never to be seen again

455
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,400
But then separately you'll hear National Amber Alert, 12-year-old girl grabbed out of her backyard

456
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,320
Massive man hut shuts down two counties as they search the grid for the kidnapper

457
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,160
But then you've got massive death, massive numbers of dead women and children found by the thousands on the border

458
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,960
Look it up, and it's just, oh, that's not going to be a news item, that's not going to be a story

459
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,960
So here's the headline right here, out of town hall, FBI waives background check requirements for those housing unaccompanied minors

460
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:58,600
So Alex is talking about people at emergency intake centers, the FBI waived part of the background check that needs to be done for people working at those centers

461
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,960
He's lying about this story, but what he brings up is still an actual issue

462
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,200
And that's where also I feel really like I hate him, because this is a real issue

463
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah

464
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,680
And I'm not going to agree with him, but I'm also not going to disagree fully, but he is still lying

465
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,640
Right, right, right, right

466
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:24,520
So it's true that the FBI has waived fingerprint-based background checks for people who are being employed to work at emergency intake sites run by the Department of Health and Human Services

467
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,400
That is not a good thing, and I don't support that, but it is not what Alex is suggesting

468
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,400
This doesn't apply to people who are taking people into foster care, it's just for people who work at those sites who are quote

469
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,040
Supervised by federal employees or others who have passed fingerprint-based background checks

470
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:45,320
Again, not what I would say is a great idea, but it's not what Alex is saying

471
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,880
Also, Alex is claiming that they've waived all background checks for these individuals, which is not true

472
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,960
They still have to pass public records background checks, but they're not using fingerprinting

473
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,280
The reason to do this is to expedite the process, which makes some sense, but again, I would probably prefer that they err on the side of caution

474
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,000
Sure

475
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,640
I was really curious about this story, so I dug around a little more and I found this story in the Associated Press

476
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,280
Quote, US waived FBI checks on staff at growing teen migrant camp

477
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,880
That story was from November 2018 under Trump

478
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,760
Beyond the background checks waiver, Trump also reduced the access to mental health professionals for people at the camp, which was a mess

479
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Even worse, in December 2018, the AP reported on news from an emergency detention center in Florida called Homestead

480
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:33,480
Where quote, the staff isn't being screened for child abuse and neglect at the Miami-based emergency detention center

481
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,160
Alex wasn't mad about any of these things because Trump's administration was doing it, and there was no ability to score points off it

482
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,240
He doesn't care about the well-being of immigrants, and when it's a Democrat president in charge

483
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,480
He just uses the mismanagement of immigration as a prop to attack his enemies

484
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,200
When his hero Trump is the one mistreating these people, Alex isn't okay with it, he supports it

485
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:01,240
And I don't want to bring these cases or these instances up of Trump and his administration doing this as a what about thing

486
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,440
I absolutely don't want to do that, and I'm not trying to score points on Alex

487
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,360
Wow, there's no point in, I mean, not, you know

488
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,440
I'm discussing my frustration with like, this is a problem and it's still a problem

489
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,880
It's not something that is okay now because Biden is in charge, we need better solutions to these things

490
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,800
Yeah, no, it's still monstrous

491
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:25,320
Yes, and the FBI background check thing, the aspect of it, I understand the explanation that's being given

492
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm not sure that explanation is acceptable

493
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,800
Right

494
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,520
I don't know, but I would be, I would have that exact same response in Trump's instance and now

495
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:34,920
Yeah

496
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,680
And it's just offensive to see Alex spend half an hour demonizing immigrants in such a way

497
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:48,520
that it stands to potentially put people in danger and then to use them and mismanagement of

498
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:56,840
immigration intake centers like this as a prop for him to use to attack Democrats

499
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,800
No, I absolutely don't care what face or what party affiliation you have

500
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,160
If I am anywhere near those people, I was screaming their faces

501
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,080
This is the best you fucking have, this is what you're gonna do

502
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,480
Yeah

503
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,680
Fuck off

504
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,240
And so, you know, I just got kind of fed up and I turned it off

505
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
So now we'll jump to the 31st

506
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,680
Because I thought like, there's probably more interesting stuff to talk about

507
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,240
We've heard him talk about this kind of thing a lot

508
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,560
Sure

509
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,000
It's very kind of worn out territory for Alex

510
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,720
Totally

511
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,960
So there is some news and thankfully Alex has got some big bombshells on the 31st

512
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,280
Okay, all right

513
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,280
Working on the weekend like usual, down in the deep end like usual

514
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,640
Wow, we're in the center of the zeitgeist

515
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,840
I barely just slid into my chair here because we've got so many big breaking news stories

516
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,520
that we're working on right now that are so exclusive and so important

517
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,440
Big bombshells

518
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,760
Okay

519
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,840
So exclusive

520
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,200
Big old bombshells

521
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,200
So exclusive, so I assume, and when he says so exclusive

522
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,840
Uh huh

523
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,360
I put this story at between one and six years old

524
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,560
No, it's current

525
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:07,960
Okay

526
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,080
I can tell you I've talked to the highest levels of the media food chain about the congressman Matt

527
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,680
Gates situation, I've also talked to his good personal longtime friend and confidant Roger Stone

528
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,520
I have made a lot of phone calls and ascertained exactly what's going on with the whole Matt Gates

529
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:31,000
extortion deep state takeover, Roger Stone joins us coming up in the second hour today

530
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,880
and he's still getting all the details together right now but it definitely Matt Gates is telling

531
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,440
the truth

532
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,240
This is weird

533
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,080
Yeah, Roger Stone's coming on to talk about a sex trafficking incident he's definitely

534
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,720
never engaged in in his life before

535
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,880
It broke this weekend that the justice department began investigating representative Matt Gates

536
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,040
about the possibility that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with a 17 year old girl

537
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,720
and possibly had paid her to travel or paid to travel with her which would possibly constitute

538
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,520
sex trafficking

539
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,160
Yeah

540
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Gates claims that this is part of an elaborate plan to extort him and as far as I'm concerned

541
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,680
I hate Matt Gates and I think he's a real piece of political shit but I need to see

542
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,040
more about this investigation before I can come to any conclusions on the matter

543
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,720
The claimed actions are too severe and I don't want to do a disservice to the alleged crime

544
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,840
by using an accusation to score points against a politician I don't like

545
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,400
Totally

546
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,080
According to the New York Times this investigation began under the Trump administration so it's

547
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,240
going to be hard to allege this is a plot from the left

548
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,600
Deep state

549
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,520
It's said that this has to do with a Florida politician who had been an ally of Gates's

550
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,600
named Joel Greenberg who is the former tax collector of Seminole County

551
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,760
This guy is currently facing charges quote including sex trafficking of a child and

552
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,880
financially supporting people in exchange for sex at least one of whom was an underage girl

553
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,960
We will see what happens with this as more information comes out but even if he's telling

554
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,720
the truth and this is all part of an extortion plot against him Matt Gates is still a pile

555
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,680
of garbage

556
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,800
Also like if it is an elaborate plan I really hope that whoever is doing this

557
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,280
extortion against him is arrested

558
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,780
Yeah

559
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,800
The thing that I don't want is neither of these things to get prosecuted

560
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,080
I am fine with whatever crime is handled here

561
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,680
Some crime is the problem

562
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,600
Something's up and you got

563
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Yeah and I don't need an extra layer of crime to hate the shit out of Matt Gates

564
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:20,920
Right

565
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,760
If he's guilty of a crime then I hope he's prosecuted and taken care of

566
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,160
But I'm gonna hate him either way Dan

567
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,120
And we'll see

568
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,720
Also Roger might not be the best source of information for Alex on this one since he's

569
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,160
been photographed at Mar-a-Lago with Gates and Joel Greenberg

570
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,280
Come on what's a little sex trafficking between friends

571
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,600
And according to the Times websites run by Roger's associates had published articles

572
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,560
favorable about Greenberg's candidacy for tax collector

573
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,960
Shocking

574
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,080
This is a mess

575
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,640
Shocking

576
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,880
The tangled web but we'll see

577
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,400
Anyway there's other news

578
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,320
We lost Rush Limbaugh not too long ago

579
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,960
Hooray

580
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,000
And oh no

581
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We had another tragedy befall the right wing

582
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,560
Oh no

583
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,080
I've got so much to cover G. Gordon Liddy died a great guy

584
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,640
Great patriot, great talk show host, great American

585
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,040
Really?

586
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,520
The FBI was like him today we wouldn't be in this problem

587
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,080
That we're in with these communists and globalists we've got that

588
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,480
Yikes

589
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,120
Doesn't eulogize him much

590
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,040
Can't just mentions G. Gordon Liddy's dead wishes the FBI was more like him

591
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,360
Boo

592
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,080
Oooh big pass although I think maybe our problem is the FBI is a lot like him

593
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,000
Yep

594
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,240
Yeah

595
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,960
So Alex has one of his big narratives on this episode is that a lot of the prosecutions against

596
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,400
people who broke into the Capitol and stormed everywhere and what have you

597
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,680
A lot of them are falling apart

598
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh that was years ago though the right wing has moved on from that we're talking about

599
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,680
culture war stuff Dan we don't need to worry about that because that happened years ago

600
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,520
Well we got to turn around and mop it up a little bit

601
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:46,760
Okay

602
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,560
And now the prosecutions are falling apart and there's a Politico article that Alex can't

603
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,400
seem to find that goes over this

604
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,000
I mean we are witnessing incredibly historic times you know in fact guys there's an Infowars

605
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,320
article about the case falling apart and feds shocked that they're gonna have to drop all

606
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,640
the cases but I actually want the Politico article that's linked in that I forgot to

607
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,560
tell you about that so give me that Politico article that they're gonna have to not get

608
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,800
jail times these people on the left's totally panicking because I can't find that now in

609
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,320
my stack and I just had it

610
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,360
People aren't panicking this Politico article does talk about how it might be a bad look

611
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,640
for you know Biden's administration to end up having to not prosecute or give plea deals

612
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,400
to a lot of the people who weren't the insiders they weren't the people who were you know

613
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
actually planning violence

614
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:45,240
So I understand that and I think that you know in terms of reality that kind of makes

615
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,120
sense and as somebody who isn't in favor of over incarceration I do understand that and

616
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:59,640
I kind of don't think it would be in society's greater interest to lock up everybody who

617
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,560
went into the Capitol in the same way that I think that you know drug offenders should

618
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,760
be released from prison

619
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,400
Right right I think I think that there should be less people in prison

620
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:17,640
Yeah I mean I ultimately functionally it's like when you're going after the fucking mafia

621
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,840
like cool you arrested a bunch of fucking low level meatheads who are going around looking

622
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,960
for protection money it doesn't matter it doesn't do anything we're not doing anything

623
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,160
to the people who fucking orchestrated it and incited it

624
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,200
So I kind of don't give a shit about these people at all

625
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,520
Well the people who you know might have just been along and went in I can completely understand

626
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,160
the idea of like getting probation or time served or something if you've been held without

627
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,320
bail yeah I don't know but I understand that and I think that maybe it would be unsatisfying

628
00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:00,840
to some like folks who are trying to maybe run for office on retribution

629
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,240
Sure sure sure sure um but that doesn't mean that people who are like the people who planned

630
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,000
the the stuff like yeah yeah keepers and totally they're not gonna get like sentences

631
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,640
No you planned it yeah that's the part that's the people who are coordinating and like yeah

632
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,640
Stuart Rhodes's friends yeah they're still in deep shit

633
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,840
That's what I'm saying I just don't care about because all too all too many of those people

634
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,000
are really borderline just infected with this terrifying brain virus that has destroyed them

635
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,040
through right-wing propaganda since they were fucking six years old right yeah and Alex is

636
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,200
trying to pretend that this is everybody even all the oath keepers and stuff who had like

637
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,480
communications plans and no Alex's buddies are going down he's trying to pretend that like this

638
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,440
Politico article is about everybody sure and it's not it's mostly about people who are just like

639
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,080
what are you gonna do they just walked in yes it's trespassing yeah but what are you gonna give them

640
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,320
six months in prison for that is that right yeah that and and I think that that's a sensible

641
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,040
conversation to have sure in terms of like what what gives us the best outcome possible as a

642
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,560
society and well I mean as a society does giving somebody who uh you know passively stormed the

643
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,160
Capitol six months do anything for the problem probably not it could make things worse yeah it

644
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:27,160
doesn't like to act as a deterrent no and now I wish that we would treat all offenders with the

645
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:33,960
same kind of uh I think that's kind of the bigger issue yeah that is the problem is not uh the

646
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:41,800
treatment it's the unequal treatment beyond all recognition here here yeah yeah so apparently one

647
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,800
of Elon Musk's rockets blew up um but hey man still don't care about Elon Musk don't call it

648
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,200
a little bit you can't call him a loser because he's trying he is a loser though and this is this

649
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,400
is interesting Alex seems to be taking comments about Elon Musk a little personally another

650
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,440
SpaceX spaceship prototype explodes during high altitude flight test and the media is calling him

651
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:09,400
a loser as usual no uh the losers are the people that point their fingers at people that are doers

652
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,600
and say that we're the losers no you are the losers so Alex is lumping himself in with Elon

653
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,280
Musk and saying the people who criticize the doers like me and Elon Musk sure they're the losers no

654
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,240
what I want to do is put myself in the same sentence as somebody whose wealth is based

655
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,640
entirely upon apartheid Dan that's what I want to do people talk about how me and Elon Musk

656
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,640
are losers just because we exploited a population to make untold amounts of wealth and then the

657
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,880
moment it looked like it was going to go bad for us we ran away to the United States face

658
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,080
no punishment for our crimes whatsoever and then got even more wealthy based off of stock

659
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,120
manipulation for no fucking reason I mean to be fair like like Alex used to hang out with Bob

660
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,520
Chapman who made all his money on like that's what I'm saying you gotta defend people who

661
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:07,080
run apartheid scams lived in Rhodesia yeah exactly yeah oh boy yeah so we get to defending Matt

662
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,520
Gates now and it's interesting because the only way that Alex can ever do these things is like

663
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,000
revealing he himself committed a crime no just pointing to other people but he's built up as

664
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,600
villains totally okay let me break this down for you if congressman Matt Gates son of a big

665
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,760
successful billionaire wasn't well spoken wasn't pro-constitution didn't have courage wasn't a

666
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,880
fighter I would not give a damn about him he'd like an old shoe I'd throw it away and if any

667
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,040
evidence of him screwing kids came out I would absolutely come out against him and say he should

668
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,120
be put in prison but he's not just Scarborough found with a dead girl in his office with their

669
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,960
brains bashed out who then is a good globalist who gets a show on msnbc with the daughter of a

670
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,880
famous war criminal Zbigniew Brzezinski Mika yeah so there's like ah yeah he's not Joe Scarborough

671
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,960
let's lie about his his past yeah it's it's it's weird because I don't know what that has to do

672
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,520
with oh it doesn't have anything to do with this no no no it seems like that's the strategy is

673
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,920
just distract yeah red red sheet over here have the bowl the bowl that is the audience's attention

674
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:25,400
charge over there despite the fact that of his descriptions of people who would drink adrenochrome

675
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,120
the only difference so far in description between Gates and everybody else is just an R

676
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,720
next to his name yeah he's the son of a billionaire he's in the government he's but it's also like

677
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,520
he's a weird Republican exactly it's not just that he's a Republican he is weird yeah yeah

678
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:53,320
he's an asshole yep so Alex lies a little bit about the allegations uh and man it's one thing

679
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:58,280
for Alex to take insults against Elon Musk personally sure that's that's one thing right

680
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,560
Alex seems to be taking this a little personally that sounds right too trying to claim there were

681
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:09,960
women saying they were 25 years ago who were really 17 at a party that he was at is not enough

682
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,240
for me to turn against Gates especially when the Democratic party's doing this and especially

683
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,160
I'll reveal for the first time here I went to the FBI a few years ago when somebody tried to

684
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,240
extort me who I hadn't had sex with and I talked to the experts I said you got to go report it

685
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,120
I once said hey I'm being extorted here's the here's the text messages

686
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,520
they had five agents in the room I mean let me tell you try to extort my ass I know the FBI's

687
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,400
corrupt point is I go right to them so it's on record that you tried to set me up you tried to

688
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,040
let me tell you they got people they got the media will give people money to say anything

689
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,440
they paid people twenty thousand dollars to say I walked around the office and grabbed a goldfish

690
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,120
out of a fish tank at the office and ate it this is a reference to Josh Owen's article from 2019

691
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,000
in the New York Times in the article Josh doesn't allege that Alex ate a goldfish that's the fake

692
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,320
version of the claim that Alex uses as a straw man to not talk about the actual complaint

693
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,880
from the article quote once a co-worker stopped by the office with a pet fish he was taking home

694
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,000
to his niece it swam in circles in a small transparent bag when Alex saw the bag balanced

695
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,880
upright on a desk in the conference room he emptied into a garbage can I don't know if

696
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,960
Josh's claim is accurate or not but it's very clear that Alex is making this claim that Josh

697
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,920
was paid twenty thousand dollars by the New York Times to say this about Alex the reason Alex is

698
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,160
using the specific of quote eating a goldfish is so he's less likely to get in trouble if Josh were

699
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,120
to demand Alex prove that the Times paid him to say what he did Alex could then pretend he was

700
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,720
talking about a different claim made about him but it's very clear this narrative is the one

701
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,600
that he's built in response to Josh's article if I were Josh Owens I would probably threaten

702
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,200
to sue Alex for this yeah that'd be worthwhile yeah I don't know I don't know if Josh Owens is

703
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:55,560
a public figure I don't know what Alex has no ability to demonstrate that Josh got paid to lie

704
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,080
about him or to say anything about him this this seems like slander quite frankly and I think it's

705
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,800
clearly malicious in intent totally absolutely this person said something I don't like

706
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,880
and so I will say that they were paid to say it Alex saying hey how are you sounds malicious in

707
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:26,440
intent there's no middle ground so apparently Alex got extorted sure sure sure sure sure sure sure

708
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,480
he's he's defending Matt Gaetz a little bit like he's about to say what's next are we

709
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,960
going to investigate everybody who's did exactly what but not that I didn't do it

710
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:45,640
you know it's it's interesting the way that Alex decides to do this defense too because his defense

711
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,560
seems to be like hey man Gaetz likes to party that's what I was thinking it would be but I've

712
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,800
made some calls and uh what you're hearing about Gaetz is pure bull he doesn't even know if he

713
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,320
from wild parties he was at over the years if he doesn't know who this woman is um and I had the

714
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:08,920
same damn thing is that there's 30 people at it you don't even kiss anybody and then you got

715
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,680
somebody saying you give me a hundred thousand dollars or I'm gonna say what you did to me and

716
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,120
I'm like hey FBI will speed dial hey I'm coming in right now but I'm telling you man this is what

717
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,960
happens when you're successful and you're famous and it's crap you try to extort me

718
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,600
I'm gonna try to get the FBI arrest your ass because it's not true ladies and gentlemen

719
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,640
you're supposed to be talking about Matt Gaetz why do you keep talking about yourself you keep

720
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,680
talking about you an awful lot an awful lot also do not sell me on you being a tough guy

721
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,800
ever again I'm gonna call the FBI I've got them on speed dial also I'm a revolutionary who's

722
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,840
fighting against the American government well I think it's an interesting approach to be like

723
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,440
Matt Gaetz goes to wild parties and he doesn't remember who's gonna remember who you fucked

724
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:04,040
come on you go to the party you fuck it's not a names thing then it's really strange

725
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:12,280
I just I think that on the one hand it's a strange defense of something that I don't know if anybody

726
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,760
can know what the reality is about the investigation at this point at these parties

727
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,960
you go and then Matt Gaetz puts on his eyed wide shut mask and then you don't know who's there

728
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,280
it's weird but I think the reason that I'm most interested in it is it just keeps coming back to

729
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:32,920
Alex like he keeps bringing himself back up as like there's a proxy that he feels as almost as

730
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,800
if there's some sort of lingering guilt somewhere I don't know about that but I it's just weird it's

731
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:48,600
just weird anyway Alex wants to give Gaetz some advice there is so much more that we're going to

732
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,520
be discussing when we get into Matt Gaetz and we're going to use this to make it about the

733
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:59,640
Clintons and to make this about Bill Gaetz and the minute Matt Gaetz talks about Bill Gaetz

734
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,800
and the minute he talks about Epstein they're going to drop this like a hot hand grenade

735
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:14,280
I don't know I don't know if that's true um I do think later on Alex lays out like what he's saying

736
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,800
and it's like you know what Gaetz needs to be like talk about Bill Gaetz but you got the wrong Gaetz

737
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,960
ah you get it how fun who's the new Gaetz gate yeah and so Alex also even lays out that he's

738
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,320
like Bill Gaetz runs the media he controls all this sure if Matt Gaetz starts talking about

739
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Bill Gaetz he'll call off the dogs oh boy what I am I am really excited to see just how fast and

740
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,320
how brutal the right wing machine will destroy Gaetz the moment he threatens the grift like the

741
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,080
whenever he was talking to Tucker on that interview and he's like you know you know

742
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Tucker how you've done this too uh it's like uh oh man you're going to be destroyed if you think

743
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:00,520
that you're gonna get loyalty gates you are making the same mistake a lot of you idiots make yeah

744
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,880
you're gonna end up burning like the bridge with Tucker and you'll be left hanging out with Roger

745
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,680
and Alex yep oh yeah yeah it's gonna be brutal and it's gonna be fast yeah it's kind of convenient I

746
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,920
think I read a headline the other day that he like before all this came out that he was planning

747
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,680
on possibly retiring from congress yeah he's gonna make a move you know nothing interesting

748
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:29,320
is gonna happen in between that article and when he moves to Newsmax I'm sure of it OAN probably

749
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:36,360
okay um so in this next clip uh we get Alex bestowing uh the mantle of the future of the

750
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,200
GOP on somebody and you'd be hard-pressed and surprised to find out that it is not Matt Gaetz

751
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:48,600
oh okay after all of this oh surprising no we have a new leader okay so here he is Marjorie

752
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:55,320
Taylor Greene the future of the Republican party voted in 75 of the vote on vaccine passports

753
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,960
talking about Hillary's religion and Biden's religion being the mark of the beast I kind of

754
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,560
do agree with Alex though that she is the future of the GOP yeah she is absolutely going to be one

755
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:13,000
of their elder statesmen uh screeching into the atmosphere upon her babel tower as the rest of

756
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,760
the world burns around her Alex takes this to be like a a good thing whereas I would say it's a

757
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,200
cautionary statement to say that she's the future of the GOP I would I would argue that's that's

758
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:33,400
probably a correct assessment of the biggest problem any people have ever had so we get to

759
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,760
talking a little bit more about Ms. Greene uh and here's what Alex has to say they have a perfect

760
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:45,880
example of why they hate Marjorie Taylor Greene she's dumb she's a listener of this show she's

761
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,320
mean she saw her others and they're educated about how the world works and they can see it

762
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,040
themselves and they see the corporate communism how they've created monopolies for themselves

763
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,080
and now the big corporations want tyranny for all the rest of us and they're using

764
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:05,640
classical forms of tyranny with technocracy to dominate us now the republicans are told oh be

765
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,000
afraid of her stay away from her because if they adopt what she's saying when she won by 75

766
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,480
percentage points the highest record in years for a republican to be elected to congress the

767
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,640
past record was like 69 she topped that by six points what was she saying there's a new world

768
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,880
order a chai comm takeover corporate communism they're coming for your guns they're destroying

769
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,920
the border they're the enemy let's do something that's what you do when you're under attack

770
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,000
i definitely think Alex could be right that Marjorie Taylor Greene listens to info wars

771
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,080
of the times he said that about elected officials this is the first time i'm not gonna argue with

772
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,160
yeah no that sounds right that said Alex is completely making up everything he just said

773
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,800
about her election win first let's remember that she was running essentially unopposed since her

774
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,600
opponent had withdrawn from the race prior to the election Alex is claiming that she won by a record

775
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,920
margin because he wants to create the impression that she was just saying info wars stuff and that

776
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,800
stuff is so popular that it wins elections by record amounts so everyone should adopt the most

777
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,000
popular stuff which is info wars stuff this is something that he is pulling out of thin air

778
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:17,800
uh green won her race 74.7 percent to uh 25.3 percent she didn't win by 75 percentage points

779
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,280
as Alex is claiming he just doesn't know the actual details or doesn't care to be accurate

780
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,040
that's fine though since i think you could be generous and assume he just meant that she won

781
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,680
with 75 i would say that's probably what he's close enough and i don't expect him to actually

782
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,680
know what he's talking about or be accurate yeah what's more egregious is him trying to say that

783
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,680
the previous record for republican running for congress had just been 69 margin or the vote who

784
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:46,920
knows yeah either it's completely insane just in the 2020 election for the u.s house in florida's

785
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,640
second district neil dunn won a seat against independent kim o'connor by a 97.9 to 2.1

786
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:00,520
percent difference that's a margin of 95.8 percent far higher than margery taylor green's margin

787
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:07,720
that's like if he ran against a half-finished game of hangman green's official margin of victory was

788
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,400
49.4 percent which is the 18th highest margin of victory among republican house election winners

789
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,200
hey that's not bad hang your head high you know nothing wrong with that sure left it all out on

790
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:23,400
the field alex desperately craves uh being seen as smart and having a ton of information at his

791
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,480
disposal but in order to create that perception he generally just makes shit up knowing that no

792
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,440
one listening will even care he'll probably just believe him it's because he's a con man yeah that

793
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,640
would be why also just because it's fun in the 2018 election republican tom graves won the same

794
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:44,360
district seat that green did with 76.5 of the vote which is more than she got yeah his opponent

795
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,800
received 23.5 of the vote so that means his total vote and his margin of victory were both higher

796
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,280
than margery taylor green's were she's actually less popular than the previous republican who

797
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,560
won that house seat that is the future of the republican party and it's what you get when you

798
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:07,080
use infowars that would happen yeah yeah yeah we should kill half of the constituents is usually

799
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,680
less popular than you might expect half of the constituents are gonna have a problem with that

800
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,960
yeah the other half usually so uh we get back to defending matt gates and it just does seem to be

801
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:22,520
like dude parties man come on roger stone is gonna have the inside scoop i've got from my angles

802
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,680
my sources that talk to gates gates has been on the show but i haven't talked to him in years

803
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,200
and uh we got a pretty good picture of what happened and what's unfolding this is deep

804
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,960
state globalist extortion uh is he a playboy was he at some parties with wild girls years ago

805
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:45,080
um maybe he truthfully does not remember or does not know but this is extortion this is a dirty

806
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:53,160
trick okay this is not strong i i would say i would say that's uh that's a road to conviction

807
00:49:53,160 --> 00:50:00,440
if that's your defense hey i got drunk and partied i don't remember yeah i would say

808
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,200
that i went into this episode like the the sort of the way that i explained it like i don't know

809
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:12,360
enough about this case i read the times article i read what the people who are you know the sources

810
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,880
who are familiar with the investigation sure uh we're saying and we'll wait and see what comes

811
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,000
out of this sure i don't know like yeah yeah yeah the more i listen to this episode the more i'm

812
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,640
like what are you doing this is a terrible defense if this is your damage control like spin that

813
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,560
spin that you're doing i gotta think he killed people at those parties like yeah yeah i don't i

814
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,720
feel like he's trying to soften the blow of something worse that's how it feels yeah and

815
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:47,480
i don't know if that's just because it's how alex like operates or or what look have you ever seen

816
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,040
the movie bachelor party he went to one donkey show so not that big a deal and that like this

817
00:50:54,040 --> 00:51:00,280
is this is like don't don't let alex anywhere near the court if if this happens your honor

818
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,720
it doesn't matter if he doesn't remember your honor i uh would like to say well i made some

819
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,320
calls well i actually got some calls and i made some calls people that know gates well

820
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:16,360
some big big big people and they said no gates is a playboy gates doesn't like underage women gates

821
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,240
has never hid this that he's single and young uh and he's not even he doesn't even know if any of

822
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:26,760
this is true he doesn't didn't fly with some underage woman that's made up this is a shakedown

823
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,200
but the question is do they have some woman who can claim that well she was younger now she's you

824
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,320
know 20 something that she went out with him three years ago uh but but definitely he went to the fbi

825
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:43,560
definitely it's a shakedown um so you're saying that he might have dated a 17 year old a few years

826
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:49,080
ago that is kind of what he's saying isn't it it's not specifically what he's saying

827
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:56,360
oh can you call a character witness for the prosecution and tell him to defend

828
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,600
this is a mess man hey hey alex we want you to really defend the shit out of matt gates

829
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,600
that's how confident we are that you're right alex we're gonna put you as the prosecution

830
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:16,760
yeah that's how we're tying one hand behind our back alex hey look fucking dated a 17 year old

831
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,680
three years ago she's 20 now come on that's the same thing as being 20 back then it's matt he

832
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,880
doesn't remember what what in the god's name is holy shit let's see if roger can do better

833
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,360
what is the inside poo-poo

834
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:40,040
back i mean if you had to name the single most effective uh member of the house in terms of

835
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,880
fighting for the america first agenda it would have to be matt gates it's not insolent incidental

836
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:53,240
that right here on this show only weeks ago i mentioned him very realistically as a presidential

837
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:00,760
contender so this is a search and destroy mission i know matt gates to be a person of extraordinary

838
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:08,120
integrity he was a playboy coming from you that means a lot to a wonderful woman ginger who i've

839
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,720
met several times they're very much in love this is not the matt gates that i know this is a

840
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:19,880
cheap political trick this is an effort to derail his career folks don't know this but

841
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:26,120
matt gates his family is among the wealthiest families in florida therefore the yes that makes

842
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:33,720
it less suspicious blackmail is a very realistic one i'm getting so suspicious the more this goes

843
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,800
suspicious why are they doing this they don't have to they don't they don't their audience does not

844
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:45,080
demand it alex could have legitimately just said this is all bullshit hey matt gates is he's come

845
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,720
out on tucker and he said that he's being set up see let's move forward done now let's get to the

846
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,080
big news of the day why are they doing this i'm not going to give this story the time that they

847
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:04,360
want me to that's how integrity i spent over an hour on it yeah absolutely wow that broj ban

848
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,400
the only thing worse than having alex defend me in court would be having roger defend me in court

849
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,600
there's nothing wrong with it i'm roger stone i've done it all these two unsavory fucks like

850
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,040
being like yeah he's great makes me think this person is not great and i understand that maybe

851
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:27,400
that's that's a bias of mine yeah you know not everybody who's beloved by villains is a villain

852
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:35,640
is a villain themselves sure sure i mean if i was going to uh put money on it i mean i would say

853
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,760
that the fbi should get some text records and i would imagine the moment that new york time story

854
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,720
came out roger stone got a text saying i did it what do i do that would be the most likely

855
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:54,920
situation for me so um the the narrative now becomes with roger on board um that they're

856
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:02,760
they're trying to get rid of gates because he's the heir apparent to trump sure in the 2024

857
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:09,560
election basically the guy has enormous cojones he's got huge courage you know usually when you're

858
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:15,240
young and you first get to congress they tell you to to us oh yeah he has incredible charisma he's

859
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:21,080
super smart definitely they sense the alpha male they're scared yeah because he has many the same

860
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:27,240
traits as trump he's audacious he's bold he's a brawler they don't want to take another beating

861
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:34,200
like they took in 2016 so this is kind of what they're doing i think they see their neck i i

862
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,240
think the the sense that i get like it's still weird they're trying to brett kavanagh this

863
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:47,320
yeah perhaps but i think it's even more than that yeah i i think that they feel an absence of their

864
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:54,200
uh sort of i idol basically sure there isn't a figurehead uh for them to coalesce around and i

865
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,640
think that they're feeling the pressure of that there's a crunch that trump is absent in terms of

866
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,680
being there um you know they can still like say hey we're trump supporters he's still the real

867
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,840
president right right right but they still need somebody to be the face yeah it's the fall of

868
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,560
stalin they're all jockeying for position and i think that i the sense that i get from the

869
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,840
conversation they're having because they keep making reference to like off-air conversations

870
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,640
that they've had and the sense that i get is that alex really thinks that matt gates should be the

871
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:29,800
next person that gets the mantle of the weirdo conservative version god king wow um and so i

872
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,480
guess he's interpreting this as a preemptive attack on the part of the globalists again and

873
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:40,360
you know what i don't believe any of that's real and i don't believe that's true sure if alex does

874
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,680
believe that's true then it kind of does make sense why he would spend an hour on this story

875
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:51,400
yeah but still his defense is terrible no it's not good it's not good i mean ultimately his defense

876
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,800
is like why can't white men do whatever they want why can't why can't uh gates party yeah what whoa

877
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:03,640
what are you gonna judge him he's he's white and he's a man come on now you're you just let him do

878
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:09,240
what he wants to do also he's rich what are you gonna punish him for what if like i don't know

879
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:15,640
beto what if it came out that beto had dated a 17 year old how do you you know or are there

880
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,320
allegations of that how do you think alex will respond to that i mean we'd go ape shit yeah and

881
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,920
that's but that's the point of not giving a shit about what about ism we're not going to beat them

882
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:32,040
at what abouting no they're there they're it's like they're bread and butter no it's just kind

883
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,480
of something that can be a little bit funny to imagine how much you would freak out totally yeah

884
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:46,360
but hey look the reality is based on the claims that are being made um uh gates says that there

885
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,480
are tapes that prove his innocence that the fbi has okay and if that's the case then those should

886
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,200
be able to come out and you know resolve this whole thing fine i still hate you for all the

887
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:03,880
other shit you do yeah yeah roger demands the tapes most importantly let's hear the tapes we

888
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:09,320
need to hear the tape that's right the key is he went to the fbi they had a sting up they were

889
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,280
about to bust him yesterday somebody in the fbi leaked that info to the new york times for damage

890
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,960
control gates was about to have a devastating victory i think that's exactly right by retiring

891
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:27,800
from congress so the idea that they're presenting now is basically that there was this guy who by

892
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:34,280
the way matt gates said by name accused by name on tucker carlson's show yeah uh this guy who was

893
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,880
a former justice department official sure he's trying to extort uh uh gates and his family for

894
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,160
money sure there's the allegation that they'll come out with if he doesn't pay up or whatever

895
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,960
of course and so his dad had been wearing a wire in order to entrap this person as you do and

896
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:56,840
because they were just about to nail this uh this extortionist sure the new york times got leaked

897
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:03,880
this information right about the allegations that were the threat right to matt gates's extortion

898
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:09,640
and and to to be honest i don't i don't know if i believe all that it seems like a defense that's

899
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,600
being made and you know i if if that's the case it should be very easy to clear this up oh yeah

900
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:19,000
not hard at all it should be incredibly easy and then that person who used to work at the justice

901
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,680
department should go to prison yeah it's not hard no it's like it's like these people don't

902
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:32,200
understand that the that law if it's to function at all is to be applied equally otherwise it is

903
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:39,080
not law that is a struggle yeah so uh the new york times reporter who covered this story they

904
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:44,840
reached out to roger sent roger an email and i think part of that is because roger was hey roger

905
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:51,240
did he do it hey level with me hey buddy look this is off the record just tell me if he did it or not

908
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:13,160

909
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:19,160
times that wrote this story today i'm going to be releasing my response because it is quite

910
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:25,080

914
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,840
touch it up a little bit because the more i read it the angrier i get and then alex is like uh

915
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,760
yeah when you uh when you get a chance to touch that up could you uh go in the war room and uh

916
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,240
war room and talk about it yeah yeah roger's response is yeah if i'm awake

920
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,680
traffickers can you be in before people start look dude at a certain point you got to let that go

921
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:28,280
because they congregate at mar-a-lago yeah that's true you know if you go there there's probably a

922
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:34,200
picture of you with a perv now that's probably another thing we should put a red flag up about

923
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,400
right you know but i mean like it's not you know you go to you go to most easily cantina you're

going to get a picture taken sure it's going to be a home of skyman bility yes i get that yeah

925
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,120
that doesn't mean that you're a smuggler just because he took a picture of you with

926
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,120
right right you just like to hang out at the place where smugglers go and i get and i get that but

927
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:58,200
how many pictures do you get to be like look i get it one or two and then you see that picture

928
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:04,120
and you go oh that's not going to look good later on when you're at five then it's just too many

929
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,640
you sound like the fucking left guilt by association all over the place and it's not

930
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:16,040
good i'm just saying there's just too many of them anyway uh look on our first episode that we ever

931
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:23,160
did we learned that it was time to pray uh because benjamin netanyahu was the canary in the coal mine

932
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:31,320
was that what it was jesus five goddamn years later it's time to pray we're still praying i

933
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,480
have to tell you it is still time to pray yeah roger roger i know for real because i've talked

934
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,840
to you privately i see the tears in your eyes when we've been in person when you were saying

935
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,040
pray with me you start crying you were always a christian but you didn't let us pray none of us

936
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,800
are perfect god feels all get a little bit of partying here and there none of it was wrong

937
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,720
in god's eyes because you repented of it like king david but but let's pray we got a minute

938
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,360
and a half left to break but lead us in prayer for for congressman matt gates please right you've

939
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:00,600
got to imagine roger's like you motherfucker you son of a bitch how dare you you are getting you're

940
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:08,840
begging me to pray how dare you first off you're telling this bullshit about me crying while prayer

941
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,280
get the fuck out of here i think that's good for the all their images though i think i think that's

942
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,200
fine that's that's the version of the story that you'd want to know he's the penitent man who is

943
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:22,920
pardoned by your god king naturally yeah yeah that's what you do yeah and you go overboard

944
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:29,800
with it too yes rending his garments and beating his chest as is alex's sort of style yes uh but

945
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:37,720
yeah it i mean look it's rude to be like will you lead us in prayer i on my dumb conspiracy theory

946
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:42,280
show where we're saying that matt gates may have dated a 17 year old years ago but who knows he

947
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:47,800
doesn't remember his wild parties whatever i would be mad if you asked me to pray the day before

948
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:55,800
let alone five minutes on the spot yeah so i was like is roger gonna pray i want to hear it mic

949
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:01,480
down okay uh look i'm not i'm not the most articulate but i'll give it a try dear lord

950
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:08,440
those the you who created both heaven and earth yo you who stand for justice and hate injustice

951
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:14,520
please watch over matt gates in this struggle for his freedom he is a good man he is a godly man he

952
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:21,000
is an innocent man he is a man of great promise do not let the left wing hate machine that sought

953
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,160
to destroy me sought to destroy general flint now destroy this great american patriot oh man

954
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,680
and by the way that's another topic for you to come back we're trying to get flint to run we're

955
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:36,840
begging them on our knees okay weird okay all right man just go back to when like he was a

956
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,520
young operative working with like nixon yeah and be like hey in 2021 you're gonna be hanging out

957
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,760
with alex jones and praying on air he would have hit you with a two by four like you're a mule

958
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:56,840
yeah yeah he is a sad piece of shit this is wild just this is bad just like i don't understand why

959
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:02,040
this isn't something that like would have more media coverage like this this to me seems like

960
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:10,200
so bizarre roger stone preys on air i know but like like they roger stone still has to be a

961
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:18,840
big bad in the media he can't they can't just portray him as this sad i mean just real pathetic

962
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:24,440
a nonsense man i think also too as i as i say that out loud i think i kind of realize that were you

963
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:30,040
to cover something that way you might run the risk of offending people who are christian or religious

964
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:36,360
like the idea the it's not it's not mocking prayer no it's mocking the idea that one it's roger

965
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:42,440
stone two it's on alex jones's show uh it's more that and i think that that tone might not be able

966
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:48,040
to be properly conveyed so that makes sense the right wing machine would turn it into a massive

967
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:57,000
deal but i can't like if you are by any stretch and adherent to uh the the intent of the bible

968
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:03,640
um i would argue that that prayer is way more offensive to christians than any article being

969
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:09,320
like roger stone is an asshole don't let them do what they did to me yeah that that like not even

970
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:15,080
god is above the left right paradigm is that what we're doing not well he is your god is pathetic

971
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,800
and shitty that's what that's my alex's god is above the left right paradigm and that means that

972
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:24,280
he's super to the right super to the right yeah so alex at the end there was talking about how

973
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:29,960
we want to draft mike flinn uh general flint sure uh to run for president they talk about this a

974
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:37,080
little bit the him and him and roger are not quite on the same page let's draft uh general flint to

975
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:41,880
get going what do you think roger uh look i think i've made it as clear as i can that if the

976
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,280
president runs i'm for the president and he has the right to make that decision and he has the

977
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:51,640
luxury to make it in his own time but if the president doesn't run it's absolutely vital that

978
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,920
we have a candidate a man or a woman who really understands and supports and completely is

979
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:02,840
committed to hold on five more minutes exactly on flint we need a stand-in and i get you're being

980
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:06,840
delicate here we're not against trump if trump ain't gonna do it we have to fire up flint and

981
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,920
we were firing up gates behind the scenes we have to have them ready in case trump doesn't do it

982
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,280
look right back hey alex you dumb fuck uh trump pardon me i have loyalty to him for life i'm gonna

983
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:23,000
say trump yeah forever yeah forever we can have hypothetical uh conversations about anybody else

984
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,520
but you have to understand that i will always give a proviso that trump is technically still

985
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:34,680
president even if gates were president trump should be yeah yep yep but i mean it just becomes

986
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,760
all too apparent there the way that they're conversing that like we're looking for a stand-in

987
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:44,920
yeah yeah we need somebody to get uh the dumb dumbs as excited as trump did and it's not gonna

988
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:49,880
happen and matt gates is the kind of shithead who would wear a gas mask right and then get covid

989
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:58,120
right but they they just don't have any of it like it's it's very abundantly clear now that nobody

990
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:07,880
but trump has the stuff that the like total uh attributes that are necessary to pull off a trump

991
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:13,560
campaign you know like gates isn't going to be able to because he doesn't have that image of

992
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:18,440
being a successful billionaire he's kind of a piece of shit yeah he's an asshole yeah and he

993
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,880
can't pull off any kind of sexual impropriety scandal because he's too young and not enough

994
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:29,480
people want to back him in order to run interference for him so we're probably going to wind up with

995
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:36,360
trump is the republican candidate and it's going to be so sad and miserable for everybody so long

996
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:43,560
as the media learns any lessons from 2016 and 2020 so i imagine that we're gonna have trump in 2025

997
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:52,280
yep but it's okay dan if the democrats pull it together and govern effectively there's no way

998
01:08:52,280 --> 01:09:05,880
that a right-wing uh let's move on so uh alex has uh he lets roger go and uh who very confusing um

999
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:13,160
very very very confusing i think i get generally what they're doing but it's still like

1000
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:18,280
i can't imagine having any time to prepare and thinking like this is the defense that

1001
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:25,400
we're gonna spend like half of the show on yeah that is bizarre have a better defense tomorrow

1002
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,680
yeah that makes the most sense yeah be like hey we know these allegations are terrible and we're

1003
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,960
gonna look into it and we'll have more rogers not available today he'll be on tomorrow to talk about

1004
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:41,320
it yep roger could be asleep who knows who cares yep it just doesn't matter really silly take your

1005
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:47,800
time um but uh alex has also built up this entire story about the uh everyone who stormed the

1006
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:53,080
capital is getting off scot-free sure and the libs are really mad about it so stewart roads is on

1007
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:02,520
along with his lawyer i was gonna say you better have a lawyer present um i don't know if this

1008
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,760
lawyer is gonna be helpful stewart should have his lawyer next to him at all times his lawyer might

1009
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:13,400
need a lawyer oh boy as an ex-prosecutor what do you think of the fiasco uh i actually is kind of

1010
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,400
how it's been since the beginning i think thought that they were overreaching they seem to

1011
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:23,400
have an agenda that they wanted everything to fit into but the facts just don't support that i don't

1012
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:30,040
know if it was something they had planned because i believe that that event was funded somehow with

1013
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:39,000
antifa but um i think they wanted patriots to act up more than what happened and then they have

1014
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,840
continued to try to push a narrative that the facts don't fit into you were here over a month

1015
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,040
ago that's what you said in the green room you weren't on air you said it looks staged we're not

1016
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:52,200
sure yet but so stewart roads his lawyer that he brings along thinks antifa paid to do something

1017
01:10:52,200 --> 01:11:01,160
with the yeah yeah yeah i you know i think i think the past few years have really taken a lot of

1018
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:09,560
shine off of uh the legal minds of our country this lawyer seems insane yeah i think most lawyers

1019
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:15,160
now are starting to sound a lot more and more insane yeah yeah him and him and stewart alex

1020
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:20,920
and stewart and this lawyer they they just talk about how like ah everybody on the right is good

1021
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:26,440
of course yes yes we're all angels over here and everybody on the left drinks adrenochrome and it's

1022
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:31,800
kind of dumb and it's not really all that interesting or or uh you know uh it doesn't

1023
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:37,400
bring much to us but stewart does have a prediction that we've got to put on the record

1024
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:42,280
so we can you know okay all right uh we're looking at the summer of rage they're speeding your time

1025
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,680
table up that's why it's important for us to understand what's coming you should expect them

1026
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:52,760
to decouple the dollar from the world currency and kill the dollar this summer and what you're

1027
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,320
going to have to do is become strong this they want us divided and weak you got to unite to

1028
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:03,480
become strong that means food and fuel and ammunition the clean water the ability to

1029
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:09,960
self-sustain so you can resist the compulsory taking of the vaccine in order to eat and i

1030
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,320
totally agree with you so yeah the dollar is going to be destroyed this summer look for that

1031
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:21,720
everybody who believes that take your stuff and just go into the woods create a splinter society

1032
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:27,640
and leave the rest of us alone or if you believe that take the dollar that still has some value

1033
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:33,480
okay pay your internet bill sure download an episode of alex jones from last year saying

1034
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,640
this year will be the summer of rage ah that might be too expensive download a couple years back when

1035
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:43,400
he did it every year now 5g is how they get you now i'll go back to like years and years in the

1036
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,520
past should say tomorrow they're going to devalue the dollar while he's conveniently selling gold

1037
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:56,200
it helps it helps to sell gold it's outrageous i i mean we'll see oh no this summer oh man i'm

1038
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,920
really worried i'm really worried so stewart's whole big thing is that the government is going

1039
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:06,520
to starve everybody that's his uh that's his new thing um that he's pushing pretty hard it's going

1040
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,480
to be tough to win votes on a platform of uh starve everyone but we'll see how they pull it

1041
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:18,040
off dan counterpoint yeah here's a great uh here's a great uh electoral strategy okay hey do you miss

1042
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:24,600
food here is food here is food yeah i will vote for food sir i think that's what stewart is trying

1043
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,280
to uh trying to get uh trigger in people's minds anyway um yeah come to the end of this and it's

1044
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:37,080
it's weird because you know i i think i think um obviously i'm more interested in non-present-day

1045
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:42,680
alex jones he's very he's a very dumb uninteresting person but this this defense

1046
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:51,240
of gates really did interest me in as much as like i hate matt gates and i'm not interested in piling

1047
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:59,240
on him sure until we know more naturally alex his defense makes me suspicious it really makes me

1048
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:05,560
think that alex knows something that we don't know and it's bad and it's real bad that's what

1049
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:10,600
it makes me think it's hard to get any other impression obviously we don't know that now it's

1050
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:16,200
good just be you know knee-jerk protect your own right kind of thing and and you know maybe there's

1051
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:22,040
something and i would say that if this is his knee-jerk reaction that's probably just as

1052
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:27,160
illuminating as if he does know something that we don't know because his knee-jerk reaction is like

1053
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:33,720
come on sexual assault's fine you know like it's it's kind of weirdo conservatives exactly yes it

1054
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:38,680
is it is that basic kind of feel to it so if that's your knee-jerk reaction i think we know

1055
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:44,120
how you're going to react to just about everybody yeah yeah it doesn't it doesn't uh it was not an

1056
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:50,120
enjoyable uh bit of time to listen to this show it's confusing yeah um so yeah i don't know we'll

1057
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,560
check back in we'll see how things are going of course and uh but uh until then we have a website
