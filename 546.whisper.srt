N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,320
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
I love you.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm going to get you.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Knowledgefight.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
I need money.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Andy and Kansas.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Andy and Kansas.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Stop it.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Andy and Kansas.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Andy and Kansas.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
It's time to pray.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

19
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Thanks for holding us.

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
Hello Alex, I'm a fifth-time caller, I'm a huge fan.

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,240
I love your work.

I love you.

25
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,520
in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
Hello, Alex, I'm a big fan color, I'm a huge fan.

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,080
I love your work.

28
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Knowledge Fight, knowledgefight.com.

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,440
I love you.

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

31
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm Jordan.

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,240
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around,

33
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,800
drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit

34
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,120
about Alex Jones.

35
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,520
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,360
Indeed.

37
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,200
Dan?

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,020
Yes, sir.

39
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,860
Quick question.

40
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,700
Jordan.

41
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,520
What's your bright spot today?

42
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,360
My bright spot today, Jordan, I had a realization

43
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,840
that I've been listening to a fair amount

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,960
of some podcasts for entertainment.

45
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,800
Sure.

46
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,240
Decompressing that high stress week or so,

47
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,200
and I realized that one of the things

48
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,000
that I really gravitate towards,

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,200
there's a through line through a lot of them,

50
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,540
and that is Matt Gourley.

51
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Matt Gourley's great.

52
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,340
I think he adds so much to a podcast.

53
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,180
He's great.

54
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,360
And his vibe is so gentle and friendly.

55
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Underrated.

56
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,600
As a counterweight to my listening

57
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,380
to Alex Jones all the time,

58
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,360
it really feels like that's like a balm

59
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,820
that I can, Matt Gourley's a balm I can put on my hand.

60
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,240
Matt Gourley's a classic glue guy, you know?

61
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,640
He's like a Phil Hartman.

62
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,960
He's got that Dave Foley kind of like

63
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,580
straight man energy to him,

64
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,440
but he's also incredibly hilarious.

65
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Very sharp.

66
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,360
Really, really funny.

67
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,580
And also I want to try and exploit my platform

68
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,160
to now be like, if we're big enough.

69
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,960
Hey, Matt Gourley, get over here.

70
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,760
Come on, Matt Gourley, come on now.

71
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,320
Hit a player up, Matt Gourley.

72
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,560
I like it, I like it.

73
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
Let's see if that works.

74
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,560
Let's abuse our privileges.

75
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,680
Yes, let's see.

76
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
Jordan, how about you?

77
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
Dan, I have the rare double Blight Spot.

78
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,600
Double Blight Spot.

79
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,920
No, the inverse of Double Blight Spot.

80
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,160
The Double Blight Spot.

81
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,360
That's a follow up to two Bright Spots.

82
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Yeah.

83
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,080
This is unprecedented.

84
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,800
First, we're going to go in chronological order.

85
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,380
If you will recall, Dan, a while back,

86
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,000
I told you about a pear that I ate.

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Sure.

88
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
It was a delicious pear.

89
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Oh, I got some pears for you in the other room, by the way.

90
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,400
Of course, I'm going to enjoy those.

91
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,880
But my partner's moms both decided

92
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,960
that we got to do something for this.

93
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,720
So they ordered me a pear.

94
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Wait, they realized they had to do something about you?

95
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,420
They had to do something about this pear thing.

96
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,600
They were inspired into action.

97
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,200
So they ordered me a pear from a place that has great pears.

98
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,020
Sure.

99
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,040
To the point where I can't eat it.

100
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,080
It looks too much like the pear.

101
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,400
It's like a platonic pear.

102
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,220
Yeah, it's like a platonic pear, where you're like,

103
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,920
I don't know what to do with this pear.

104
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,560
I'm going to eat it.

105
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,320
It's going to be amazing.

106
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,200
Yeah, of course you're going to eat it.

107
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,820
You got to.

108
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,120
And then you'll recall that I said something about how

109
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,360
my brain was functioning.

110
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,860
Yeah.

111
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,560
And Black Dragon Queen Christy sent me

112
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,720
an incredibly kind card.

113
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,760
Artistic pear?

114
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,440
Yeah, well, I wish it was a pear, always.

115
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,600
All things should be pears.

116
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,400
But she really touched me.

117
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,120
And it was very kind of her.

118
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
That is great.

119
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,120
Double bright spot.

120
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,160
Hey, things are looking real bright.

121
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,200
And I actually got to say, I may have another bright spot.

122
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,720
Oh, no.

123
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
And if you're going with two, I'm going to give another one.

124
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
We're going to do a quadruple bright spot?

125
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,320
I may.

126
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,560
And that is that I really got into today's episode.

127
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,040
You did.

128
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,440
You know, it's an Easter miracle.

129
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,880
I found something.

130
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,040
I was not expecting Alex to be at all kind of like, oh,

131
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,000
I can talk about this.

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
This is interesting.

133
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,520
So you would say that Alex has risen.

134
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
He's risen indeed.

135
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,400
He's risen indeed.

136
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,880
He's risen indeed.

137
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,760
And we will get down to business on all that.

138
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,400
But before we do, Jordan, let's take a little moment

139
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
to say thank you to some new wonks.

140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Oh, that's not a bad idea at all.

141
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,520
So first, Scroton the Strong, thank you so much.

142
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,800
You are now a policy wonk.

143
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
I'm a policy wonk.

144
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,720
Thanks, Scroton.

145
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,220
Thank you.

146
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,720
Next, Melissa Kay, thank you so much.

147
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
You are now a policy wonk.

148
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm a policy wonk.

149
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,200
Thank you very much, Melissa.

150
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,700
Thank you.

151
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,360
Next, oh, man, I remember when I first

152
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,960
realized that Missy was short for Melissa.

153
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
It's a weird day.

154
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,920
Anyway, sorry, Melissa.

155
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,880
Next, Trek With Tyler, thank you so much.

156
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,140
You are now policy wonk.

157
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm a policy wonk.

158
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
Thank you very much, TWT.

159
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,180
Next, Owen but not the Dumb One.

160
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,920
Thank you so much.

161
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,000
You are now a policy wonk.

162
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,880
I'm a policy wonk.

163
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,780
Thank you very much.

164
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,340
There are a surprising number of competitions.

165
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,840
Troyer.

166
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,680
For Dumb Owen Tea, I was going to say.

167
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,000
Next, Kathleen Y. Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk.

168
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,040
I'm a policy wonk.

169
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,180
Thank you, Kathleen.

170
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,680
Thank you.

171
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,100
Next, pretty quick for a Canadian.

172
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,960
Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk.

173
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm a policy wonk.

174
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,220
Thank you very much! Pretty quick.

175
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,700
And we've got a couple of special things going on here over the weekend.

176
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,200
Alright.

177
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,780
We had a couple birthdays that I'd like to give a little shoutout to.

178
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,300
It's our April birthday shoutout that we're gonna do probably three or four more times this one.

179
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,980
First, Alexander reached out and wanted to wish Iris a happy birthday.

180
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,340
Oh, a happy birthday, Iris.

181
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,140
Happy birthday, Iris.

182
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,700
Yeah, of course.

183
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,380
Hope you have a good one, or had a good one, I guess,

184
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,540
because since this is coming out probably after your birthday.

185
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Don't worry about it. Deal with it, Iris.

186
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,180
Now, this next one's very special. It goes out to a cat.

187
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,680
Okay.

188
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,380
It was a birthday cat.

189
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,340
Well, then we do birthday cats on command.

190
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,840
Yes.

191
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,860
On command!

192
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,360
Yeah.

193
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,140
No birthday months for cats.

194
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,100
That's the loophole.

195
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,980
Yeah, exactly.

196
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,300
And this is a cat named Pleiades.

197
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,580
Oh, well, shit!

198
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,420
How do you not wish Pleiades the cat a happy birthday?

199
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,700
I don't know, because the light from Pleiades takes several hundred thousand years to get to us.

200
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,300
Well, it just got here.

201
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,800
Oh, okay.

202
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,020
Happy birthday.

203
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,740
Nicely done.

204
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,500
So, Jordan, today we're going to be going over April 1st through 3rd 2021 Blackjack.

205
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,580
Ah! I never had a chance on that one.

206
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,940
No, I really sped up.

207
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,580
You were too good for that one.

208
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,300
Through the home stretch.

209
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

210
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,300
Um, so this is Thursday and Friday of last week,

211
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,940
and then Saturday Alex fucked around and went into studio and recorded a special thing.

212
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,820
Oh, sure, why not?

213
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,660
And once we get going, you'll understand why I had to cover that Saturday thing.

214
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,260
No, no, of course, of course.

215
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,420
But first, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

216
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,340
The devil ain't cool, man.

217
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,260
He's not what gives you the hot cheerleaders and the partying and the fun.

218
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,020
Oh. Hmm.

219
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,620
Actually, I thought that was the...

220
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,660
I thought that's what he specifically tried to tempt you with.

221
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,940
Every depiction in media.

222
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,380
I was gonna say, he's the one who gets you that stuff.

223
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,260
God is the one who gets you eternal happiness by forgoing those specific things.

224
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,700
Yep, that's always been my understanding.

225
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,940
Every chick tract that I've ever seen.

226
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,140
Almost entirely like, hey, that hot girl, you gotta avoid her.

227
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,180
And the fun and the partying.

228
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,220
It's terrifying.

229
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,500
Don't do the fun and the partying.

230
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,300
Jesus hates it.

231
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,860
Yeah.

232
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,700
So, my man.

233
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,200
Yeah.

234
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,340
I want to preface this really quick.

235
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,740
Sure.

236
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,860
I want to set this up.

237
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,660
All right.

238
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:17,060
This April 1st episode, if it was an April Fool's episode, I would admire the hell out of it.

239
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,220
Because there's a number of things that go on that you could interpret as being like,

240
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,500
yeah, he's fucking around.

241
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,780
Sure, but it's not.

242
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,580
Like this, this could be an April Fool's gag.

243
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,780
And I've been doing a lot of studying the last few weeks on a particular subject that

244
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,940
Rob Doob brought to my attention and that the rest of the crew kept basically pestering

245
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,420
me about.

246
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,100
And I finally, last night and today, read it.

247
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,780
And it is the smoking gun of smoking guns of smoking guns.

248
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,660
This is green eggs and ham.

249
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,580
And I'm the type of guy that always gets on air.

250
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,220
And I tell you, next hour, I'm going to cover this big story.

251
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,620
And then I'll start telling you what the big story is right away.

252
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,020
Right.

253
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,540
The tactic and media, as I say, coming up.

254
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,580
So you keep listening.

255
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,300
I don't do that.

256
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm bad at my job.

257
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:10,180
If you just put out the big news and don't have some fanfare, like a 20th Century Fox

258
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,820
intro, which is not how it goes.

259
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,380
A rip off of old British newsreels.

260
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,460
People don't care.

261
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,220
And it just becomes part of the background ambient noise.

262
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,020
And they actually get conditioned to the tyranny.

263
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,460
You actually become a tool of evil.

264
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,060
You know, I almost just go off air for a month and just shut info wars down.

265
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,900
And then if I came back and covered this, we might be able to save the planet.

266
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,340
I hate you so much.

267
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,220
You see what I mean?

268
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,940
April Fools.

269
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,140
I hate you so much.

270
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,020
That should have ended with, should I be saying any of this?

271
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,980
Perhaps not.

272
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,900
I have the gun, the smoking gun to end all smoking guns and...

273
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,300
See you in a month, assholes!

274
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,420
Yeah, I'm gonna disappear for a while.

275
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,620
This is your fault.

276
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,220
You don't get this smoking gun.

277
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,380
So that's an interesting idea for Alex.

278
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,660
The idea of disappearing like he's Sting going to the rafters.

279
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,460
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

280
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,180
Not fighting for WCW or NWO.

281
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,860
If you love something, let it go.

282
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,540
I do like the idea of Alex coming back with just face paint.

283
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,420
Crow face paint.

284
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,620
A brooding Alex Jones.

285
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,380
I'm Bruce Lee's grandson.

286
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,740
So he doesn't disappear for a month, but he does do what I would say is the next best thing.

287
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,340
What have I told you?

288
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,860
I have the document from John Hopkins where they plan the whole attack,

289
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,020
plan the SARS attack, planned the Ebola attack, planned the COVID-19 attack,

290
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,820
and then have a plan through vaccines to brain damage you and give you Alzheimer's

291
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,940
and sterilize you.

292
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,260
And then how they're even going to blame the politicians

293
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,100
and how they even set up President Trump to do it.

294
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,860
I would be interested in that.

295
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,820
Imagine having that smoking gun.

296
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,980
I'm imagining it.

297
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,580
In your hand.

298
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,220
Mail it to me.

299
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,060
Word for word, admitting the whole thing.

300
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,900
And then you'd ask, why would they write such a thing?

301
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,700
Well, I know why.

302
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,660
I can explain it.

303
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,700
But you know what?

304
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,740
I'm not going to cover it.

305
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,780
I'm going to put together graphics and I'm going to put all the different pieces together.

306
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,980
And I'm going to come in here Saturday and I'm going to tape for one hour at noon.

307
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,460
Make sure it's all perfect.

308
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,780
Yeah.

309
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,580
And then at 2 p.m. central, we should have it ready.

310
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:38,260
We will stream it back to back hour after hour until I go live Sunday on Easter at 4 p.m.

311
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,860
Central Standard Time, as I always do on Sundays.

312
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,500
What a dick.

313
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,100
That's amazing.

314
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,580
I've got smoking gun proof, but I'm not going to talk about it.

315
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,700
Not until Sunday.

316
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,740
That's some Dom sub shit.

317
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,860
I can't handle that.

318
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,260
I'm not into this type of relationship, dude.

319
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,060
I'm sorry.

320
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,460
Yeah.

321
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,580
I mean, unfortunately for me, I was like, wow, that is ridiculous.

322
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,340
You can come on Saturday.

323
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,820
No!

324
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,380
That kind of...

325
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,180
Disagree.

326
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,900
That kind of presentation is ridiculous.

327
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,900
If you're listening in the audience, you have to ask yourself, why?

328
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,100
What kind of real person would do this?

329
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,900
What possible news organization would be like, we have proof of everything that is going

330
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,340
on and they're trying to kill everybody.

331
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,860
We're going to wait two days to reveal it to you.

332
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,660
You know what?

333
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,060
And news organizations do wait with information that they're not 100...

334
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,740
They don't tease it like this, though.

335
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,700
But they don't go... the New York Times doesn't have like a, hey man, we got some bombshell

336
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,340
shit.

337
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,700
We're going to see it in a couple weeks.

338
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,060
We're working on something that will...

339
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,340
This will change the game.

340
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,900
No.

341
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,540
No, no, no, no.

342
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,340
Dumb.

343
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,300
Absolutely not.

344
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,260
So the document that Alex is talking about is a 2017 scenario exercise called the SPARS

345
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,020
pandemic 2025 to 2028, a futuristic scenario for public health risk communicators.

346
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,940
Oh, that sounds like the smoking gun.

347
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,260
This document is essentially very similar in structure to the Rockefeller one Alex erroneously

348
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,060
calls Operation Lockstep in that the Johns Hopkins exercise began with the selection

349
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,300
of two important variables that could dictate what challenges could arise in a possible

350
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,700
future.

351
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,900
Is Alex real or is Alex not real?

352
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,100
In this exercise, the two variables were quote, varying degrees of access to information technology

353
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,500
and quote, varying levels of fragmentation among social, political, religious, ideological

354
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,460
and cultural lines.

355
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,540
Whereas the Rockefeller document explored all four of the possible futures that were

356
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,300
based on the variables they chose, this document focuses instead on just the one that the preparers

357
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,660
thought would present the most challenge in terms of medical communication.

358
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,900
Okay, so there are more positive simulations that could happen.

359
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,300
With those two variables creating a matrix of four scenarios.

360
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,700
But this paper is entirely about the worst possible scenario.

361
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,740
Maybe not the worst possible scenario because they don't lay out what the other ones are,

362
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,100
so I don't really know what they are.

363
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,700
It's a real bummer of a scenario.

364
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,260
Well, it's a scenario that is for an exercise for medical communicators.

365
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,580
Okay.

366
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,900
And so the one that would raise the most challenges, or they decided would raise the most interesting

367
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,540
challenges.

368
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:07,940
Perfect.

369
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,060
Is the one that they used.

370
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,380
Excellent.

371
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,900
Sorry, I just wanted a clarification.

372
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,740
That's an important clarification.

373
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,980
This was the possible future that they called the echo chamber, which represented a scenario

374
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,100
where there was widespread access to information technology and quote, isolated and highly

375
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,300
fragmented communities.

376
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,260
Reading over this document, it's really fascinating how there are a number of similarities between

377
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,540
the real world and the scenario that was laid out in this exercise.

378
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,300
The real world novel coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2, whereas the scenario illness is

379
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,660
called SPARS-CoV.

380
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,140
Ultimately, these similarities are all things that make sense, given that the possible future

381
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,140
was laid out by public health experts who would be trying to make as realistic a scenario

382
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,540
as possible so participants could best explore the communication challenges that could arise

383
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,020
in the event of a public health emergency in a world where everyone was online and large

384
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,620
segments of the population lived in a slightly different reality from each other.

385
00:13:59,620 --> 00:13:59,860
Yeah.

386
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,100
One of the problems that we keep running into with these scenarios, like this document and

387
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,940
the Rockefeller one, are that they're well written and engaging.

388
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,620
They contain a ton of details that flesh out the world they're trying to depict and as

389
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,420
such seem like more of a prediction than they intend to be.

390
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,780
This Johns Hopkins scenario relies on a template laid out by J. Ogilvy and Peter Schwartz in

391
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,980
their 2004 paper titled Plotting Your Scenarios, published by the Global Business Network.

392
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,380
In this paper, Ogilvy and Schwartz try to help businesses and organizations understand

393
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,260
how to best structure a scenario-based exercise in order to maximize its impact in terms of

394
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,740
the participants being able to learn about how to deal with new circumstances and manage

395
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,380
change.

396
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,380
Okay, so these guys are dungeon masters.

397
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,620
Yes.

398
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,380
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

399
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,580
Yeah, that's what these guys do.

400
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,660
The strategy of using a scenario matrix is explained in this paper.

401
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,980
This is what both the Johns Hopkins and Rockefeller exercises used, where the planners come up

402
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,580
with a big list of key factors they think could affect the possible futures they want

403
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,660
to explore, then that list is whittled down to two central factors.

404
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,540
These factors are plotted on a matrix, which could go in one of two directions, and that

405
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,580
creates four distinct combinations of factors, each representing a scenario that can be explored.

406
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,140
Right.

407
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,700
An example that's given in this paper is about looking at possible futures for education,

408
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,300
where they choose to use hierarchy versus participation and inclusion versus exclusion

409
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,660
as the two main axes that were the most relevant to their exploration.

410
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,060
This created four scenarios, hierarchical and inclusive,

411
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,980
hierarchical and exclusive, participatory and inclusive, and participatory and exclusive.

412
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,860
Each of these possible realities looks vastly different from the others, so it's not too

413
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,060
hard to jump from there to scenario building and creating evocative narratives that characterize

414
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,780
each of these so participants can more easily relate to the challenges that each possible

415
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,980
future would present.

416
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,020
Totally, of course.

417
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,180
That's exactly what Ogilvy and Schwartz discuss in their introduction to this paper.

418
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,980
To be an effective planning tool, scenarios should be written in the form of absorbing,

419
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,540
convincing stories that describe a broad range of alternative futures relevant to an organization's

420
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,020
success.

421
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,460
Thoughtfully constructed, believable plots help managers to become deeply involved in

422
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,260
the scenarios and perhaps gain new understanding of how their organization can manage change

423
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,500
as a result of this experience.

424
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,420
The more involved managers get with scenarios, the more likely it becomes that they will

425
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,020
recognize their important but less obvious implications.

426
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,540
Moreover, scenarios with engrossing plots can be swiftly communicated throughout the

427
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:35,220
organization and will be more easily remembered by decision makers at all levels of management.

428
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,700
And if the CDC rolls an 18 or higher, then we defeat the pandemic.

429
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,660
Saving throw.

430
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,420
That makes perfect sense to me.

431
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,380
Ogilvy and Schwartz are business consultants, and this technique, using scenario-based exercises,

432
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,020
is a very common one among organizations that want to explore how prepared they are to face

433
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,780
potential challenges that could come up expectedly or unexpectedly.

434
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,580
Yeah, war games.

435
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Yeah, these scenarios work better if they're written as compelling and engrossing stories,

436
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,820
and as we've learned, Alex has an incredibly hard time differentiating between reality

437
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,460
and fiction.

438
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,860
Yeah.

439
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,900
To compound the problem, these guys, they recommend that people, quote, invent catchy

440
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,780
names for the scenarios, saying, quote, when your managers feel the hot breath of crisis,

441
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,820
they should be able to recall the appropriate scenario by name.

442
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,260
Dan, if you recall, I have suggested to scientists that they need to rename things better.

443
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,100
Now, here's the problem, though.

444
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,820
I have also suggested they go outside of scientists for naming.

445
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,460
Yeah, but then Alex also talks about how, like, THX 1138 or whatever is-

446
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,020
Sure.

447
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,220
That's not a catchy name.

448
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,860
But I mean, we could come up with some catchier names.

449
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,700
What's this one called?

450
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,940
Well, this one is called the echo chamber.

451
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,660
The echo chamber.

452
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,220
Yeah.

453
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,780
Okay, I'll call it the shitty room.

454
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,980
Okay, all right.

455
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,500
You won't forget the shitty room.

456
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,300
No, that's true.

457
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,100
That might work.

458
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,980
That might work.

459
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,380
So this technique, though, creating these names that you remember, it's a good strategy

460
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,420
for scenario-based planning, but the flip side, like you have pointed out, is that these

461
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,740
names could be exploited very easily.

462
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,540
Lockstep is a perfect example of that.

464
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,340
It's just a catchy scenario name, which is apparently so catchy that Alex has built a

465
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,460
gigantic conspiracy around it.

466
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,860
See?

467
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,260
Now I rename it Bummertown.

468
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,020
One, you remember it.

469
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:23,060
Two, nobody's like, oh, they're using Bummertown to defeat the globalists.

470
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,020
It's a classic Bummertown.

471
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,020
Yeah, this is the Bummertown scenario all over again.

472
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,180
Anyway, the bottom line here is that this document is none of the things Alex claims

473
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,140
that it is, and it doesn't prove any of the shit he's pretending it does.

474
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,620
Also, it's 89 pages long, so there's no way, I believe, for a second that Alex has read

475
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:39,700
it.

476
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,820
Absolutely not.

477
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,020
He talks a little bit more about it here, although he said he was going to wait until

478
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,420
Saturday.

479
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,260
Of course he did.

480
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,100
He actually doesn't talk much about it, because I think he actually hasn't read it at all.

481
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,740
Right, right, right, right.

482
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,660
He's just got no clue.

483
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,060
No.

484
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,540
No, okay.

485
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,060
Basically, anyone taking these vaccines, they're all designed to the same thing, is going to

486
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,700
have neurological disorders within one year, most of the people taking the vaccine will

487
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,580
be dead within 10, and this John Hopkins says it all right here.

488
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,100
That is not in the Hopkins report.

489
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,580
That would be a very strange thing for Johns Hopkins to release.

490
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,140
Yeah, the scenario is written from the standpoint of someone who lives in 2030, so there's not

491
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,380
even 10 years depicted in the exercise since the outbreak begins in 2025.

492
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,100
Sure, sure.

493
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,460
Alex is just making shit up because he knows no one's going to read it, and he's got all

494
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,380
the elements there that he needs to lie about.

495
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,420
It's 89 pages, it's got the name.

496
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,300
Yeah, you're golden.

497
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,700
Yep.

498
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,580
Just riff.

499
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,780
So every now and again I like to point out when Alex makes it abundantly clear that he

500
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,180
thinks that he's fighting literal demons, because everyone needs to keep that in the

501
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,660
front of their mind.

502
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,140
It's really nice to recall that this man thinks he's fighting the devil.

503
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,460
Right.

504
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,980
You know who authored this report?

505
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,820
It wasn't the Center for Public Health at Johns Hopkins.

506
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,500
It was Lucifer the Morningstar.

507
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:54,900
You bet.

508
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,540
Yeah, okay.

509
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,540
He's a master of public health, actually.

510
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,340
Got a degree.

511
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,300
Honorary.

512
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,020
Well.

513
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,420
Obviously this is not a human intelligence running this, and I just go back to that over

514
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,980
and over again.

515
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,660
I tell top generals that, top former head of intelligence agencies, senators, you name

516
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,940
it, at secret meetings, and they nod their head and agree with me, because everybody

517
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,340
knows.

518
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,660
Everybody knows.

519
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,620
I'm talking about fake low res of flying saucers here.

520
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,100
I'm talking about interdimensional entities.

521
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,580
Sure.

522
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,180
Hell-bent to destroy us.

523
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,820
Naturally.

524
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,540
And they are influencing humans on Earth to do this, and this is not a human plan.

525
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,900
It is a satanic fallen angel operation.

526
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,540
Sounds right.

527
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:41,300
I honestly might have more respect for low res pictures of UFOs.

528
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,860
I'd definitely rather talk to that guy than Alex.

529
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:52,260
Yeah, I would say that I am more convinced by the Loch Ness Monster photo than I am by

530
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,140
why interdimensional beings are controlling the plan that's not even happening.

531
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,460
Yeah, yep.

532
00:20:59,460 --> 00:20:59,780
Yeah.

533
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,940
So Alex lies a little bit more about this Hopkins report, which again, he's not going

534
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,420
to talk about until Saturday.

535
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,220
No, of course not.

536
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,860
Hell on Earth is going to be released.

537
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,260
The total collapse is being engineered.

538
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,700
I mean, giant John Hopkins plans that are operational.

539
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,020
John Hopkins runs the whole thing.

540
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,060
Hee hee hee, I'm John Hopkins.

541
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:29,300
All spelled out says here, just like I surmise by 2030, you did not surmise the population

542
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,140
is dead or living dead.

543
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
Totally brain damage, totally gone.

544
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,100
And then we're going to have to, we won't be able to take care of people.

545
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,140
Then the good people to survive will have to join the globalist in exterminating who's

546
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,380
left because things will be so out of control.

547
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,700
Whoa.

548
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,180
Alex is making that up.

549
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,060
Yeah, no.

550
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,700
Big no.

551
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,740
Big pass on that one.

552
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,940
Yeah, so here's kind of the passage that I guess most closely resembles what he's talking

553
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,340
about.

554
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:54,900
Okay.

555
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,740
Quote, while the federal government appeared to have appropriately addressed concerns about

556
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,060
the acute side effects of Corovax.

557
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,780
That's the vaccine that comes up.

558
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,180
The vaccine for scars.

559
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,740
SPARS.

560
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Scars Guard Cove 9.

561
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,420
The long-term chronic effects of the vaccine were still largely unknown.

562
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,900
Nearing the end of 2027, reports of new neurological symptoms began to emerge.

563
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,660
After showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year, several vaccine recipients

564
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,740
slowly began to experience symptoms such as blurry vision, headaches, and numbness in

565
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,940
their extremities.

566
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,700
Due to the small number of these cases, the significance of their association with Corovax

567
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,060
was never determined.

568
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,780
As of this writing in 2030, longitudinal studies initiated by the NIH at the beginning of the

569
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,380
vaccination program have not reached the next round of data collection.

570
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,820
So formal analysis of these symptoms has not yet been conducted.

571
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,500
Furthermore, these cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients.

572
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Those in high-risk populations, including those with underlying health conditions, making

573
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,500
it increasingly difficult to determine the extent to which these symptoms are associated

574
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,540
with vaccination.

575
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:53,860
Yeah.

576
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,340
See, that's good dungeon mastering, but I would expect Alex would have added a little

577
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,340
more fire.

578
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,820
They're all dead.

579
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,540
We're all dead.

580
00:22:59,540 --> 00:22:59,780
Yeah.

581
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,860
Just like, they're coming.

582
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,300
Those of us who haven't been vaccinated will be forced to kill the rest of everybody.

583
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,780
Totally.

584
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,620
You need a little bit of flair there.

585
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,580
That's all I'm saying.

586
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,580
The imagined scenario involves a small number of possible unforeseen side effects from a

587
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,820
vaccine that's just deployed to fight the pandemic.

588
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,060
And Alex has turned that into the clip that we just heard.

589
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,380
Sure.

590
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,300
He's claiming that John Hopkins is saying that by 2030, everyone will be dead or walking

591
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,620
dead.

592
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,500
That's a leap.

593
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
It's a complete fiction that he's just created out of thin air from his imagination.

594
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,580
The story that he's telling literally has no connection to the primary source that he's

595
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,380
pretending to cover.

596
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,780
That sounds correct.

597
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,260
But I can't wait until we get to Saturday.

598
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,780
They had days, and it's one of the most incompetent displays that I've ever seen.

599
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,940
There's no way that you heard, I'm going to get to this Saturday, and weren't like,

600
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,340
well, we're going to handle this Saturday.

601
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,100
That's when I'm like, all right.

602
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,220
All right, we'll see you then.

603
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,220
All right, I'm going to stretch.

604
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,820
Yeah, exactly.

605
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,580
You crack your knuckles a little bit, you do a little, all right, here we go.

606
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,500
And I got to say, I don't know who he's got for this Saturday show.

607
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,100
It's him, Rob Dew, and some dude named Mike.

608
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,860
I don't know who this Mike dude is, but he is a weirdo.

609
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,980
Okay, all right.

610
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,340
He is a sleepy weirdo.

611
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,700
All right, we're going to bring Mike into this.

612
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,580
Holy shit.

613
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:14,900
Okay.

614
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,220
Not to be believed, this guy.

615
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,780
Okay, all right.

616
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,420
So anyway, Alex is fighting Satan.

617
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,980
Sure.

618
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
And maybe he just wants to quit.

619
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,740
That's fair.

620
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,980
Satan's got infinite resources and is it a million years old or whatever?

621
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,460
I don't think Satan's interested in an information war.

622
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,180
That's probably true.

623
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,300
Yeah, it's time for the information war against heaven.

624
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,660
Did you know what you missed?

625
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,540
In the 40 days and 40 nights that Satan tempted Jesus in the desert, most of what they talked

626
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,420
about was Alex.

627
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,060
Well, when...

628
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,540
Dude, do you know what we're going to eventually have to deal with?

629
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,060
You have no fucking clue.

630
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:57,460
When Satan got all the angels turned against God or whatever, it really was information

631
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:57,860
warfare.

632
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,500
Yeah, it was. I mean, it's like you had to first convince them that their freedom was

633
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,660
stolen by an infinite creator.

634
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,100
It was mostly about vaccines.

635
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,060
Yeah, pretty much.

636
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,100
Anyway, Alex is fighting against Satan.

637
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:17,540
And we have now entered the operational shutdown of the planet as we know it.

638
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,660
And the decision has been made to overwrite every genetic system on the earth.

639
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:31,700
And the earth is to be completely sacrificed in the attempt to become God.

640
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,780
Sure.

641
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,940
In fact, their main mission, they say, is to destroy the earth.

642
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:47,220
And then only out of that metamorphosis can this new creature emerge.

643
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,740
That's what they've been told.

644
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,540
It is their universal code.

645
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,580
It is their ethos.

646
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,540
It is their religion.

647
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,300
And they've signed on to it.

648
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,020
And they've rebelled against God that made us.

649
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,900
And so I really don't even know if I can keep doing the show.

650
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,180
And I'm not kidding.

651
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,660
I think I'm going to have to just hand this over to somebody else.

652
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,580
This stuff's too big to even talk about on there.

653
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,460
If people don't know about this now, they're not going to figure it out.

654
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,380
I just need to get ready with my family.

655
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,740
I can't believe this, man.

656
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,060
Almighty, it's so horrible.

657
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,100
That didn't seem sincere.

658
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,220
Oh, I had a dream about the space baby from 2001 Space Odyssey.

659
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,380
And I just don't know if I can do this anymore.

660
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,540
It's just too big for me.

661
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,420
Oh, no.

662
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,140
So terrible.

663
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,060
The time baby is out there.

664
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,940
It's going to grow into a thing.

665
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,420
This is just big stuff, though, man.

666
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,060
Sure.

667
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,620
The globalists are trying to give birth to Satan to walk on the Earth.

668
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,180
Right.

669
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,860
This is too big.

670
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,620
No, I mean, that's a real bummer.

671
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,340
I kind of understand wanting to go to the woods.

672
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,820
But then again, in the best of times, I want to go to the woods.

673
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,540
That's true.

674
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,100
That's true.

675
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,620
Maybe I'm not the person to talk about this.

676
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,500
I don't know.

677
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,180
Wouldn't the woods be a bad place?

678
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,940
Because Satan's all about the fire.

679
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,740
He does love fire.

680
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,220
Yeah.

681
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,820
You want more like a blacktop.

682
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:15,940
Sure.

683
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,620
Go move into a parking lot.

684
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,260
Desert.

685
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,740
Yeah.

686
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,940
A desert would be great.

687
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,180
And then whenever he burns it all, you've got glass to make really great windows.

688
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,060
This could be a good plan.

689
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,940
This is a plan.

690
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,180
Yeah.

691
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,740
We're going to make it through this apocalypse, Dan.

692
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,180
So anyway, back to lying about this document that he's not going to cover until Saturday.

693
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,740
Okay.

694
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,180
And they all know it's bull.

695
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,060
It's just every part of it is a lie.

696
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,220
And you're wearing a death shroud.

697
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,660
You're wearing this diaper.

698
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,340
And they even admit in the John Hopkins report that it gets an added bonus.

699
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,780
The bacterial pneumonia of the mask wearers is going to really increase their death toll.

700
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,700
The word mask does not appear once in the John Hopkins document.

701
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,220
That sounds right.

702
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,700
Yeah.

703
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,220
In the scenario, bacterial pneumonia is a condition that appears to be connected to the

704
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,060
invented virus spars.

705
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,740
But Alex is completely making up everything he's saying here about this document.

706
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,140
Wow.

707
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,860
Pretty great.

708
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,140
That's lovely.

709
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,020
I do like whenever you can toss in something that isn't even mentioned obliquely.

710
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,380
That's always good stuff.

711
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,100
Pretty solid.

712
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,500
Yeah.

713
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,980
So as someone who's fighting the devil, Alex has covered himself in the armor of God.

714
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,300
Sure.

715
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,700
And that means talking about the Bible.

716
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,340
Naturally.

717
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,140
And...

718
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,860
Gotta get into it.

719
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,460
And it's also Good Friday, right?

720
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,140
No, this is Thursday.

721
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,620
Oh, okay.

722
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,660
It's Maundy Thursday.

723
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,220
Apologies.

724
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,380
Right?

725
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,180
Isn't that what it is?

726
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,900
No idea.

727
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,260
I can't remember what the...

728
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,660
There's Good Friday.

729
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,140
Right.

730
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,260
Palm Thursday.

731
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,140
Palm Saturday.

732
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,260
Palm Wednesday.

733
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,140
Ash Wednesday.

734
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,020
Ash Wednesday.

735
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,300
But that's way different.

736
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,140
Don't worry about it.

737
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,380
We're doing great.

738
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,340
I don't know the week.

739
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:46,900
We're doing great.

740
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,460
I'd forgotten.

741
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:47,860
Yeah.

742
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,780
Anyway, Alex also has forgotten some things about revelation.

743
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,660
If you believe the Bible, no flesh would be spared unless God intervened.

744
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,100
No flesh would have been spared.

745
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,680
None.

746
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,880
Sure.

747
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,520
And it says the rich men will sit under the mountains in their

748
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,280
fortresses under the mountains, beating themselves in the head.

749
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,720
So angry that they serve Satan and begging God to forgive them.

750
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,800
So like Trump, right?

751
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,400
And at that point they've come into the ultimate sin.

752
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,520
There will be no Holy Ghost.

753
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,400
There will be no forgiveness.

754
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,160
You have now chosen your side.

755
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,360
Yeah, like Trump, right?

756
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,860
Wow.

757
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,580
Wow. That's just a chance.

758
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,580
Weird.

759
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:37,980
Wow.

760
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,460
That's an intense thought, but it's also a delicious thought.

761
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,780
So weird.

762
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,900
So if the Bible did, in fact, say that rich people would live

763
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,540
under mountains, that kind of does sound like Alex's whole

764
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,180
thing about the elite globalists having underground bases.

765
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,300
Isn't he rich?

766
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,020
Yeah.

767
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,820
Unfortunately, Alex is leaving out a very critical part of

768
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,820
the verse that he's poorly referencing.

769
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,860
This is from Revelation 6, verse 15.

770
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,060
Quote, then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals,

771
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,500
the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free,

772
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,660
hidden caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

773
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,580
Oh, so everybody hidden caves.

774
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,020
It wasn't just the rich people.

775
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,740
No, it was a whole plethora of folk.

776
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,140
Yep.

777
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,460
Gotcha.

778
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,380
It's pretty much everyone trying to hide from the opening

779
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,780
of the sixth seal.

780
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,140
So it's pretty much everyone.

781
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,380
Yep.

782
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:22,780
Gotcha.

783
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,180
Anyway, much like Alex just writes fan fiction about the

784
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,980
nefarious documents he covers as news, he does the same thing

785
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,860
with the Bible, even like religious texts.

786
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,020
Everything is just a prop for him to use.

787
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,140
It really seems like that should be way more important.

788
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,860
You know, you want to know it word by word, really.

789
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,180
Yeah.

790
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,060
If you were fighting the devil, that is.

791
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,540
It's even like that would be your best weapon against the

792
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,460
devil is knowledge of the Bible.

793
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,020
Sure.

794
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,620
I've seen that in various Chuck Norris movies.

795
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,700
Yes, indeed we have.

796
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,500
So Roger is coming in again.

797
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,220
Great, great.

798
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,740
Which we saw on our last episode.

799
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,020
Yeah, it's time to pray.

800
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,380
It's interesting, though.

801
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,540
I got really weirded out by this.

802
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,780
Roger Stone has talked a lot about trying to draft Flynn to

803
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,500
get him ready to lead a national movement to run for

804
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,740
president or to support Trump for running for president.

805
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,820
But regardless, instead of overthinking it, I agree with

806
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,660
him, Flynn's got to launch it now.

807
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,820
And I'm going to leave it at that.

808
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,340
And obviously I've been talking to Flynn, and I just need

809
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,220
to we need to draft him here on this show.

810
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,820
We can't wait for Trump.

811
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,740
We can't wait for DeSantis.

812
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,260
We need General Flynn, who is a good man and a patriot

813
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,460
understand what's going on.

814
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,740
We need him to do this.

815
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,420
So Roger is at a dental appointment.

816
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,220
He's a little bit late.

817
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,380
He'll be popping in sometime next hour.

818
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,300
So on our last episode, the conversation was about trying

819
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,060
to draft Flynn or Gates.

820
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:55,180
Sure, sure, Gates might not be around for much longer.

821
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,220
We've gone a day, and Alex is just pretending that that

822
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,540
wasn't the whole conversation that they had.

823
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,500
Never happened.

824
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,100
No, we never defended that guy.

825
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,220
He's a real criminal.

826
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Now, I mean, not to his credit, but Roger is still like,

827
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,860
he's innocent.

828
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,740
He's being set up.

829
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,660
Yeah, that sounds like a good Roger move.

830
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,860
Boy, has it deflated.

831
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,980
It is not like they spent over an hour on the last episode

832
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,180
incriminating themselves in order to defend the Gates.

833
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,380
Look, he just likes to party.

834
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,900
Hey, guys, we had a post debriefing on this one,

835
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,100
and we decided you guys should not commit any crimes

836
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,620
in the defense of someone.

837
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,980
Hey, everybody out there in the Infowars land, shit got bad.

838
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,020
Shit kept going the way it looked like it was going to go.

839
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,620
And we should have seen it coming.

840
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,740
Yep, yep.

841
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,500
I can walk away from this at this point.

842
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,140
Not hard.

843
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,700
Gunna.

844
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,260
Gunna bye.

845
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,100
Yeah, so I listened to this next clip,

846
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,660
and I kind of got the sense that, like, Roger is fucking

847
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,820
with Alex a little bit, which I can kind of enjoy.

848
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,540
Well, he just got back.

849
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,980
Roger Stone has been trying for a week to send me a report,

850
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,220
a secret report.

851
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,340
It's not a classified report.

852
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,380
It's a secret report.

853
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,500
My email doesn't work.

854
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,300
He can't send it to any of our emails.

855
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,500
They're in his email blocking it.

856
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,620
They're in our email.

857
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,500
Oh, no, it really is.

858
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,300
It's a total take over, folks.

859
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,980
The full weight of the government works against the country

860
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,260
to implode it and destroy it.

861
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,540
All right.

862
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,340
They're in his email.

863
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,020
My email doesn't work.

864
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,660
Roger can't send me emails, but he can't send me this secret

865
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,300
document.

866
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,500
I don't know why Outlook isn't working right now.

867
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,540
Yeah, I think Occam's Razor tells me Roger is fucking

868
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,180
with Alex.

869
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,380
Yeah, that would make sense.

870
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,020
So we get another headline here, and this is important.

871
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,220
This is really important stuff.

872
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:35,900
Breaking.

873
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,900
That's right.

874
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,820
The Alex Jones show there's a war on for your mind.

875
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,900
High school to re-educate students.

876
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,980
That's a quote who refused to wear COVID mask in Clearwater,

877
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,540
Florida.

878
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,820
Even a conservative city, conservative state.

879
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,180
They're the leftist are teaching their critical radical

880
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,900
race theory.

881
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,020
Teaching America sucks.

882
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,260
The high school in Clearwater, Florida, says it will re-educate

883
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,100
students who do not wear a mask when required.

884
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,660
Naturally.

885
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
This is a story about Clearwater High School.

886
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,900
And honestly, if I were involved, I would have just told

887
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,820
them to use a different word than re-educate.

888
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,980
That seems very easy.

889
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,780
Yeah, it says, quote, students who do not wear a mask when

890
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,980
it is required or refuse to do so should first be re-educated

891
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,660
on the importance of wearing a mask.

892
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,380
If after the re-education occurs, they do not comply, the

893
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,620
student administrator should be contacted.

894
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,340
The importance of wearing a mask should be reinforced.

895
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:23,740
Yes.

896
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,340
If not done so, if behavior has not changed, and then this

897
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,260
whole thing goes away.

898
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,420
The word re-education is something that means a lot of

899
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,420
different things in different contexts.

900
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,300
For Alex, the word means commies taking kids to camps and

901
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,740
doing that thing from Clockwork Orange.

902
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,220
Naturally.

903
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,700
In this context, it's really clear that what they mean is

904
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,020
that if a student is refusing to wear a mask, they should be

905
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,820
given a chance to better understand why a mask is important

906
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,620
in a schoolroom setting before any kind of disciplinary

907
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,820
action is even considered.

908
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,220
Right.

909
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,940
This is essentially what it's basically saying like the

910
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,900
kids get a warning.

911
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,700
The right wing blogs that are covering the story use this

912
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,660
quote, but seem to leave off what comes immediately after

913
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,900
it in the school's plan for the new academic year.

914
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,780
Oh, that's harder.

915
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,420
Quote, not wearing a mask when it's required is not a

916
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,620
disciplinary matter, but rather a health and safety concern.

917
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,940
Administrators will contact the parent or guardian for

918
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,660
support.

919
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,460
If the refusal continues, the principal must contact the

920
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,340
area superintendent to discuss options, which include

921
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,740
administrative placement into one of the other learning

922
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,460
options.

923
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,860
This placement is a non-disciplinary placement and

924
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,940
is based on the health and safety needs of all students

925
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,420
and staff.

926
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,540
So this same document literally says that students who refuse

927
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,100
to wear masks won't get in trouble, and if it's something

928
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,740
that can't be resolved, then accommodation will be made to

929
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,220
allow them to continue to go to class remotely.

930
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,540
That seems like going above and beyond to cater to people

931
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,780
who refuse to wear masks in public gathering settings.

932
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,340
Yeah.

933
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,660
But of course they use the word reeducation, so this is

934
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,060
somehow about critical race theory or something.

935
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,100
Yeah, that sounds right.

936
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,380
It's ridiculous.

937
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,860
Their plan is really well thought out and kind of

938
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,780
considerate and perhaps overly sensitive, you know, but it

939
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,900
is better than my plan of if a kid decides not to wear a

940
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,620
mask, you go to his house and scream in his parents face

941
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,140
until they leave you alone forever.

942
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,260
It's tougher to codify into a rule.

943
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,220
It's better that I wouldn't use the word reeducation.

944
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,260
Give less meat for Alex.

945
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,740
There you go.

946
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,380
Yeah.

947
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,220
So Roger comes on after the dentist and, you know, like I

948
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,380
said, they do not talk about Matt Gaetz much.

949
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:18,620
Sure.

950
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,220
It's much different than the day before.

951
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,020
Unsurprising.

952
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,660
The entire interview is about how Alex wants General Flynn

953
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,980
to announce that he's running for president and Roger trying

954
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,460
to explain to Alex that there's a game they need to play.

955
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,420
Roger is saying that if they're going to do this, the first

956
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,220
thing they need to do is gather massive amounts of data about

957
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,700
the people who would support Flynn, and then they need to

958
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,100
somehow get around all the social media bans that all these

959
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,820
shitheads like Alex have that limit their reach.

960
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,460
Right.

961
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,860
It's a farce of an interview, and it seems pretty clear to

962
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,940
me that there's going to be some attempt coming down the

963
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,580
line to try to replace Trump with Flynn as the figurehead

964
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,100
of the Infowars idol cult.

965
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,620
Roger is trying to subtly implant the idea that Flynn is

966
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,820
like Eisenhower.

967
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,780
He's a military hero who the people need to coerce into

968
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,340
running for office because it's his duty to the country.

969
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,620
See, Roger seems to realize that the only thing that's going

970
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,340
to work for someone like Flynn is a fully realized storyline

971
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,980
to push as a campaign, and his character works with that

972
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,620
kind of archetype, regardless of how disconnected from

973
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,900
reality it is.

974
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
It's the same thing they did with Trump, pretending that he

975
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,140
was a successful businessman who had never had any interest

976
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,460
in politics who won the presidency on his first try.

977
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,340
When compared to reality, that's bullshit, but it's a

978
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,740
compelling storyline for the base to enjoy.

979
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,780
Flynn being a reluctant candidate would have a similar,

980
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,420
you know, complete bullshit narrative thing if it were to

981
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,340
get off the ground, but could be effective.

982
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,140
I am wilded out by the idea that anyone would want anyone

983
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,860
who had any command during the Iraq war.

984
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,860
Oh, yeah, that's weird.

985
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,460
Also somebody who pledged allegiance to QAnon.

986
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,660
Yeah, shouldn't that be immediately disqualifying?

987
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,780
Like, I don't even care what your politics are.

988
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,500
You were involved with commanding in the Iraq war.

989
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,860
You are already a failure before you even began.

990
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,060
Yeah, you should maybe take a seat.

991
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,340
You should go away.

992
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,620
So Roger wants to build up to this subtly and softly,

993
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,860
whereas Alex is a little bit less patient.

994
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,260
They're just going back and forth about how Flynn needs to

995
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,460
go on the attack immediately.

996
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,740
That's what Alex is saying.

997
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,940
And then Roger comes back with, who knows what will happen?

998
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,860
And then finally, Alex has just had enough.

999
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,540
Here's the deal.

1000
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,660
He's got to do it.

1001
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,300
He knows it.

1002
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,940
And the amount of money he can raise is staggering.

1003
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,780
And so he's going to run for president.

1004
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,460
I'm drafting him right now.

1005
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,980
And so are the American people.

1006
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,380
And as he does these quiet events to 10,000 people here,

1007
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,940
10,000 people there, 1,000 there, everybody that goes to

1008
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,580
these things he quietly has that are packed out need to

1009
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,540
tell him you're doing it.

1010
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,220
And I'm not being presumptive here.

1011
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,340
Listen, they want you and I in jail because they know we

1012
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
helped light the fire with Trump.

1013
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
They know that we're not afraid and they know we've got

1014
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,020
lightning in a bottle and they know that lightning does

1015
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,460
strike the same place repeatedly.

1016
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,100
That's how Will and Zeitgeist and.

1017
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,660
Wait, what?

1018
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,220
Yes.

1019
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,180
So obviously I could sell off of the sunset right now.

1020
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,260
The globalists are ready to buy me off like that.

1021
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,540
I could snap my fingers, $100 million, private jets,

1022
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,700
everything, but I'm not selling humanity out.

1023
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,900
So and he's not either.

1024
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,580
He just keeps overthinking it.

1025
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,260
He needs to listen to you.

1026
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,100
He needs to announce soon.

1027
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,260
Alex is sick of the bullshit and he wants a hero figure to

1028
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,620
get behind and it's the best thing out right now out of

1029
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,460
options for God King.

1030
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,940
It turns out without his inimitable platform, Trump's shit

1031
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,220
talking doesn't work.

1032
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,700
Yeah, I am not really all that good as the center focus.

1033
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,100
Exactly.

1034
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,140
Me, Alex Jones, not good as center focus.

1035
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,220
Need to be someone else's hype man.

1036
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,860
Totally.

1037
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,820
That person I'm hyping is absent now.

1038
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,620
Not gone.

1039
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,660
This does not work.

1040
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
I'm really flailing.

1041
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,900
I need a dad.

1042
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
You are 100% correct.

1043
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,140
Yeah, that is exactly what's going on.

1044
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,780
So this clip means nothing, but I just thought it was kind

1045
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,420
of interesting to hear Alex describe the plot of Romeo and

1046
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,980
Juliet.

1047
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,620
I think he gets some of the beats right.

1048
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:00,940
Okay.

1049
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,140
I'm really, really interested in this.

1050
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,860
I'm going to be honest.

1051
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,980
This is the first time in a while I've been like, I'm going

1052
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,260
to be on the edge of my seat.

1053
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,180
Alex's literature recap.

1054
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,340
Like reading a William Shakespeare play that you've already

1055
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,900
read before.

1056
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,860
You know, you turn the page and Romeo and Juliet meet, tell

1057
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,940
me you love and their parents are mean to them.

1058
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,820
They have their problems.

1059
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,660
And by the end, they commit suicide.

1060
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,100
You know, you know the play.

1061
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,700
All right.

1062
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,940
Well, I mean, he's not wrong.

1063
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,980
He's not wrong.

1064
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,180
It didn't exist as a venerated play for hundreds of years

1065
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,340
because of that plot synopsis.

1066
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,300
I mean, look, look, look, look, the skeleton is there.

1067
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,260
There's a thing.

1068
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,700
Their parents are mad at him.

1069
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,740
They kill themselves.

1070
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,180
And it's a great play.

1071
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,300
The parents are mean.

1072
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,820
You've read it before.

1073
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,860
It does not sound like you've read it before, sir.

1074
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,580
Oh, God.

1075
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,260
It sounds like you saw half of the Leonardo DiCaprio version

1076
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,620
and then woke up at the end.

1077
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,780
You're one of these literature major types, though.

1078
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,300
Like from where?

1079
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,580
I'm from the streets, right?

1080
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,060
Sure.

1081
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,620
Sure.

1082
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,100
No, no, no.

1083
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,580
I'm with you.

1084
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,100
For someone like me, I hear that.

1085
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,340
And I'm like, yeah, that is what Romeo and Juliet is about.

1086
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,220
Because it is.

1087
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,260
Yeah, but even if you're watching West Side Story,

1088
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,140
there's more to it than that.

1089
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,940
I disagree.

1090
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,300
OK, well, that's fair.

1091
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,860
That's fair.

1092
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,740
You could cut out a lot of those songs.

1093
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,500
A classic tale of people meeting,

1094
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,020
their families being mean, and then they kill themselves.

1095
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,060
I mean, you know, it does have an arc.

1096
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,540
Yeah.

1097
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,020
Yeah.

1098
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,740
So Alex cares about the theater, cares

1099
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,140
about classic literature.

1100
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,460
But what he doesn't care about, money.

1101
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:48,940
OK.

1102
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
And you know why I feel so upset?

1103
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,300
I've never cared about money.

1104
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,860
And back when I could have made a ton of money

1105
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,940
before we were censored, I would make enough money

1106
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,820
to fund the operation.

1107
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,340
And if I had extra money, I'd hire more people

1108
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,980
and expand because my mission was to beat the New World Order.

1109
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,260
I never cared about money.

1110
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,660
But now I can tell you going into the future,

1111
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,980
you'll be able to stave this off a little bit longer,

1112
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,660
but not longer if you do have money.

1113
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,020
I mean, this is a world civilization ending event

1114
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,820
coming up, and it's all right there.

1115
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,180
I mean, man, they are talking about everyone vaccinated

1116
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,420
is going to have Alzheimer's, including children,

1117
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,740
and society is going to collapse and they're

1118
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,260
going to have to have robots clean us all up

1119
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,060
off the streets.

1120
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,500
And I mean, I knew this was all coming.

1121
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,220
I already laid it out.

1122
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,340
But my God, this is scarier than my film Endgame.

1123
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,020
And they were going to be like, oh, well,

1124
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,900
this is scarier than my film Endgame, and they wrote

1125
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,620
the damn thing.

1126
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,820
Oh, God.

1127
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,420
Do they get royalties for that?

1128
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,780
I don't even know what to do at this point.

1129
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,460
Just please save us, God.

1130
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,300
God's like, yeah, well, stop killing all those babies.

1131
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,300
Weird God.

1132
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,940
Weird God.

1133
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,980
So just a quick fact check.

1134
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,300
There's literally nothing in the Johns Hopkins report

1135
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,780
about anything close to what Alex is making up here.

1136
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,580
The robots cleaning up dead body stuff is just from Soylent

1137
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,420
Green, and the word Alzheimer's doesn't even appear

1138
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,060
in the document.

1139
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,100
Now that makes perfect sense.

1140
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,580
The Johns Hopkins document is about public health

1141
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,660
communication challenges that could come up in the event

1142
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,180
of a disease outbreak.

1143
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,260
It's comically stupid for Alex to pretend there's

1144
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,180
a chapter on how everyone's going to be dead and robots

1145
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,380
will clean up our corpses.

1146
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,340
It'd be a really weird flourish for them to just be like,

1147
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,460
oh, and also the vaccine causes Alzheimer's even in children.

1148
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,700
Like, that's a clause.

1149
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,980
Also, Alex loves money.

1150
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,500
Yeah, so much.

1151
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,260
He should be swimming in a Scrooge McDuck style.

1152
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:39,900
Yeah, yeah.

1153
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,780
Also, at the end of the April 1st show, Alex interviews

1154
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,860
James O'Keefe about some footage he apparently got of

1155
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,780
immigrants living in poor conditions.

1156
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,260
This falls under the heading of a subject I care about,

1157
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,220
and it's a political issue that means quite a bit.

1158
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,220
It's something that people should be paying attention to,

1159
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,940
but I do not trust that the person delivering this message

1160
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,220
is acting in good faith.

1161
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:58,860
Oh, no.

1162
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,060
And I don't care.

1163
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:00,380
No.

1164
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,620
I've reserved the right to ignore anything James O'Keefe

1165
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,660
does, so fuck him.

1166
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,420
Let's move on to April 2nd.

1167
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,940
Yeah, 100% fuck James O'Keefe.

1168
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,580
I could have seen that being an April Fools episode, though.

1169
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,220
The way Alex is like, I'm not covering this document until

1170
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:12,700
Saturday.

1171
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,060
Then he lies a bit about it.

1172
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,740
A little touch and go on it.

1173
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,660
James O'Keefe's existence is a joke.

1174
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,100
Has Roger on, and Alex sort of pretends that the conversation

1175
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,540
didn't involve Matt Gaetz the day prior.

1176
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,260
Sure, sure.

1177
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,980
It's very weird.

1178
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,900
Never thought of Matt Gaetz before, honestly.

1179
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,300
So we get to the second, and the tone is completely changed.

1180
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,460
Things are totally different.

1181
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,140
Look at these headlines on Infowars.com.

1182
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,940
Biden infrastructure bill includes $20 billion

1183
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,260
to destroy highways for being racist.

1184
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,300
Now, if you're not aware of this, I'm not joking.

1185
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,380
Here's some of the headlines.

1186
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,300
Here's out of the News Gazette.

1187
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,700
Biden administration may target racist highways.

1188
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,820
That was December.

1189
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,540
A woman called for highway removal in a black neighborhood.

1190
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,660
Oh, my God.

1191
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,420
One person calls for a statue to come down.

1192
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,180
One person calls for a cross to come down.

1193
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,500
One person calls for a highway to come down.

1194
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,860
The White House singled it out in its infrastructure plan

1195
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,620
as racist, and they're announcing the big, giant highway

1196
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,020
that brings all the jobs to the neighborhood,

1197
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,340
and people can get around the town will be destroyed.

1198
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,420
I mean, I shouldn't laugh at this.

1199
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,340
This is so evil, ladies and gentlemen.

1200
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,420
We covered this back in the endgame coverage,

1201
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,100
so I don't want to dwell too much on the subject,

1202
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,780
but in case Alex is listening,

1203
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,740
the history of the placement of highways is incredibly racist.

1204
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,900
The fact that he's laughing at the idea and mocking it

1205
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,660
really only reveals that he has no idea

1206
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,860
about the history of that subject.

1207
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,500
Totally.

1208
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
No one's calling for all highways to be gone,

1209
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,740
so there can't be business or travel anywhere.

1210
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,340
The conversation is about how the ways

1211
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,180
that highways have been constructed in the past

1212
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,420
often has been done with absolutely no regard

1213
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,620
for minority communities and often to their detriment.

1214
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,100
There's tons of primary sources Alex could read up on

1215
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,860
if he's interested in the devastating impact

1216
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,420
that practices like redlining had on communities of color

1217
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,980
in this country in terms of social impacts

1218
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,860
and the destruction of economic power over generations.

1219
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,380
The history of redlining in Chicago is so fucked.

1220
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,940
Yeah, Alex is a stupid, stupid bigot

1221
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,100
who doesn't actually care about reporting accurate information

1222
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,860
or depicting reality to his audience.

1223
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,380
He's just interested in protecting the notions of whiteness.

1224
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:19,660
And I am demanding that Joe Biden destroy

1225
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,380
all of Illinois's portion of Route 66.

1226
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,420
I want it all gone.

1227
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,380
You don't want to get kicks anymore?

1228
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,300
I want it all gone.

1229
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,380
No more historic Route 66.

1230
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,220
I want all the signs taken down.

1231
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,180
I want the asphalt dug up.

1232
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,220
I have no skin in this game, so I'll support you on this.

1233
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,820
Historic mote 66 is what I want.

1234
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,860
Fill it with water.

1235
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,460
Fill it with water and crocodiles.

1236
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,460
I don't want to see that part of the state anymore.

1237
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,460
Does the Dan Ryan survive?

1238
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,260
Well, why not?

1239
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,760
Okay.

1240
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,080
So, tyranny.

1241
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,040
You heard of it.

1242
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,560
I am familiar.

1243
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,880
It's speeding up and has been speeding up over time.

1244
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
That doesn't sound 100% wrong.

1245
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,480
And we're there.

1246
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,400
It's fucking tyranny, man.

1247
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
This is what they like to do.

1248
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,600
And they're doing it to us in an act of raw power and domination.

1249
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,160
And we sit here with our open free society model

1250
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,200
in a daze as it moves so quickly.

1251
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,400
Ten years ago, we were going five miles an hour.

1252
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,280
Five years ago, we were going 50 miles an hour.

1253
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,160
Ooh, that's faster.

1254
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,680
Three years ago, we were going 100 miles an hour.

1255
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,080
Whoa.

1256
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,360
Honestly, though, if you think about the time in between these speeds,

1257
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,160
that is a very slow acceleration.

1258
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,200
Yeah, it's not quite parabolic, is it?

1259
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,920
Two years ago, we were going 200 miles an hour.

1260
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,080
A year ago, we were going 500 miles an hour.

1261
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,400
And now we're going 10,000 miles an hour down the rattle.

1262
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,040
That's a big job.

1263
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,920
That was parabolic.

1264
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,760
And we're going to go a million miles an hour.

1265
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,880
And two million miles an hour.

1266
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,200
That's quick.

1267
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,720
And a billion miles an hour.

1268
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,400
Right into hell, ladies and gentlemen.

1269
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,160
That's how tyranny works.

1270
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,360
It builds up.

1271
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,200
It gets its confidence going.

1272
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,080
People submit.

1273
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,880
And like dominoes, boom, kills everybody.

1274
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,360
OK.

1275
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,400
And John Hopkins, I'll cover it tomorrow, has got it all laid out,

1276
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,600
how the collapse is going to work, how there are going to be so many brain

1277
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,320
damaged people from these vaccines that society will shut down.

1278
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,640
Naturally.

1279
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,040
We're just going to have big mass reclamation centers

1280
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,320
right out of Soylent Green where we're just killing people around the clock.

1281
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,640
Young people, old people, you just sign the paperwork,

1282
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,440
roll your son in, your daughter in, your mama, your daddy.

1283
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,840
20 years old, 30 years old, 60 years old.

1284
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,840
Because they could have just given them something that killed them right away.

1285
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,640
That'd be too obvious you'd fight back or something kills you on the road.

1286
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:45,040
But instantly when you finally die, they want it to be something that wipes you out.

1287
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:53,440
They want it to be something that weighs on everyone.

1288
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,000
They want the sorrow and the pain and the breakdown and have the big medical system

1289
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,760
suck everything out of you, squeezing you dry before they blast you out of the dust.

1290
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,680
None of that is in the document.

1291
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,480
Yeah.

1292
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,000
I like how he describes something from Soylent Green

1293
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,280
and then says that it's in the document like in Soylent Green.

1294
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah.

1295
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,360
Yeah, that's real convenient.

1296
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,760
Yeah.

1297
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,960
It is really helpful for movies to tell you what is in the document you're talking about.

1298
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,200
Yeah.

1299
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,920
Yeah, I could describe any movie and then just claim that it's what a document says

1300
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,440
and be like, it's like The Matrix.

1301
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,160
Sure.

1302
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,040
It doesn't matter.

1303
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,680
Oh man.

1304
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,720
You're not doing anything.

1305
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,400
Dude, the Rockefeller report on 13 going on 30 and body swap issues.

1306
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,120
Holy shit.

1307
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,000
Insane.

1308
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,720
Yeah, that's insane.

1309
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,120
We're all going to swap with our parents.

1310
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,200
I read that document out of the Aspen Institute about body swapping.

1311
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,200
No, we're going to learn important lessons about walking in each other's shoes.

1312
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,560
It's actually going to be great.

1313
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,120
Right.

1314
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,000
But the people who don't learn those lessons, it's going to create a community of-

1315
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,120
Oh no, we're going to be robots in the streets cleaning them up.

1316
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,240
Displaced within other people.

1317
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:04,720
Yeah, yeah.

1318
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,600
Oh, it'd be terrible.

1319
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,320
Terrifying.

1320
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,800
Illegal immigration inside a body.

1321
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,760
Ooh, that's a-

1322
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,360
We're going to have to have a lot of new regulations.

1323
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,240
Oh, it's going to be an issue.

1324
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,280
And the Aspen Institute is working on that and I appreciate it.

1325
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,920
I think it's good.

1326
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,160
Yeah.

1327
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1328
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,520
So I've been saying that Alex isn't really supporting Gates as much.

1329
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:21,760
Right.

1330
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,680
And that is mostly because it was aggressive at the end of March.

1331
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,520
Those last episodes in March, it was over the top.

1332
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,040
I fucked underage women.

1333
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,600
What?

1334
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,240
I didn't mean to say that in defense of Matt Gaetz.

1335
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,080
I meant to say it's okay if you fuck...

1336
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,320
Nope, that's not good either.

1337
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:38,800
Oh boy.

1338
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,760
Wait, you're telling me he dated a 17-year-old three years ago?

1339
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,800
What's the big deal?

1340
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,760
Yeah, she's...

1341
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,960
Yeah, it's fine.

1342
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,120
So, but in total fairness, Roger was still defending him.

1343
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,120
And Alex on the April 2nd episode does sort of support him.

1344
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,200
But you can sense a lack of enthusiasm.

1345
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,400
A little reticence.

1346
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,280
A little bit just like...

1347
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,280
But Matt Gaetz with no proof why he's got to be removed.

1348
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,800
While they're saying he might have given a 22-year-old girl $1,000 one time.

1349
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,760
And maybe she flew on a commercial flight with him.

1350
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,360
So that's sex trafficking.

1351
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,720
Of course, he's not on the Alita Express flying to a Caribbean island.

1352
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,720
And now we're learning it's not a 17-year-old girl, but it's okay.

1353
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
Because Tim Cook runs Death Tamps.

1354
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,040
What?

1355
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,800
They're the moral media.

1356
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,320
They're gonna get that Matt Gaetz.

1357
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,440
Matt Gaetz did something real.

1358
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,360
I'd throw him under the bus just like that.

1359
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,400
But that's not what happened here.

1360
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,320
I've also gotten to experience them doing it to me.

1361
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,760
But of course, I said, go ahead, publish all your lies.

1362
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,640
And of course, they don't.

1363
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,520
Still needing to bring himself into it.

1364
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,480
I know.

1365
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,440
Unnecessary.

1366
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,240
Very strange.

1367
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,960
I want...

1368
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,000
Very strange.

1369
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,440
If he says something like, oh, if it's real, I'll throw him under the bus.

1370
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,400
I want a countdown clock to appear right over his head.

1371
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,720
Sure.

1372
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,200
You know?

1373
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,840
Just like Ted.

1374
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,720
But you can sense the different tone.

1375
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,000
Like, that's very different than he was before.

1376
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,520
This is the dismount.

1377
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,360
So anyway, Alex goes to calls, and he gets this one caller.

1378
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,040
And this is sort of...

1379
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,120
The call wasn't interesting, but he said something that I wanted to play as like,

1380
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,160
this is the type of person who believes in Alex's shit.

1381
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,320
Sure.

1382
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,840
When you think about the UN, the UN was created because of the Club of Rome, basically,

1383
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,840
to give the Antichrist his power.

1384
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,280
That's what the UN was created.

1385
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,240
I'm sorry, what now?

1386
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,160
So the Club of Rome was founded in 1968, and the UN began in 1945.

1387
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,400
Yeah, because they knew the Club of Rome was coming.

1388
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:36,960
Right.

1389
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,200
Yeah.

1390
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,560
I mean, do you understand, like, there's just this...

1391
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,440
This is the sort of thinking.

1392
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,640
No, no, no, no, Dan.

1393
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,760
You're not understanding.

1394
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,120
I believe the Club of Rome he's speaking about...

1395
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,760
Oh, boy.

1396
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,720
Is Romulus and Remus.

1397
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,680
And the wolves.

1398
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,320
Exactly.

1399
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,400
I mean, like, okay, so the Antichrist needs to get its power.

1400
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,120
Sure.

1401
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,800
And that's why they made the UN.

1402
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,280
I'm sorry.

1403
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,480
Yeah.

1404
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,360
13 years later, the Club of Rome is founded.

1405
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,600
It just doesn't make any sense.

1406
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,200
Anyway, Alex in between calls rambles a little bit about how,

1407
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,600
oh, God, wouldn't it be so great if the US and Russia became best friends?

1408
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,400
Oh, that would be great.

1409
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,400
And anybody that studies geopolitics knows that the US links up with Russia geopolitically.

1410
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,720
It's over those two countries could dominate the world for good and a new golden age.

1411
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,080
But alas, we know that's not how it works, right?

1412
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,480
Anybody can read Revelation and the Dragon.

1413
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,120
The whole war that happens, we all know it unfolds.

1414
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,360
What?

1415
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,520
So now the holy war that unfolds is between the United States and Russia.

1416
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,240
I guess so.

1417
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,840
But also, this is a real strong argument of pre-determinism.

1418
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah.

1419
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,040
There's no free will.

1420
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,080
It does seem like that.

1421
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,480
Yeah.

1422
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,080
It does seem like we're dipping into Calvin territory.

1423
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,240
Yeah.

1424
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,320
This is a horrifying view.

1425
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,200
Of course, we all know what happens in Revelation.

1426
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,440
Yeah.

1427
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,360
Geopolitically, if the US and Russia teamed up, they could dominate the world.

1428
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,760
But we know from Revelation that's not going to happen.

1429
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,200
But that's such a fucking cop out.

1430
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:07,680
Fuck you.

1431
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:08,880
Fair enough.

1432
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,440
Fuck you.

1433
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,320
How dare you?

1434
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:10,720
Fair enough.

1435
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,320
The Book of Revelation doesn't also include, like,

1436
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,000
a hundred years of prep time for the Antichrist to rise.

1437
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,040
There is that part in Revelation about how the devil's ten years behind.

1438
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,160
Wow, that was an interesting thing for Jon to add.

1439
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,880
Yeah.

1440
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,280
So we get another caller, and this dude is on every fucking episode.

1441
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,720
He calls in all the time.

1442
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,000
There's a dude named Carlos.

1443
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,320
Okay.

1444
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,360
And he thinks that everything that's going on right now is an attack on Christianity.

1445
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,160
Sure.

1446
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,800
What do you...

1447
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,640
Obviously, I'm going to cover this John Hopkins document tomorrow that admits we're in a simulation

1448
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,280
takeover.

1449
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,200
The vaccines are going to make a lot of people sick.

1450
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,720
It's a society collapsing weapon.

1451
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,840
It's so incredible.

1452
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,200
What is their big end game?

1453
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,800
Why are they so savage?

1454
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,160
Why are they moving ahead with something so incredibly dangerous and committing these

1455
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,200
giant mass crimes?

1456
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,680
Because what people don't realize, and this is Good Friday to think about it, this is

1457
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,560
an Antichristian worldwide movement.

1458
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,200
Sure.

1459
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,960
It is led by individuals who are not Christians.

1460
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,520
Exactly.

1461
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,840
The US is taking more vaccines than anybody else, and predominantly it's Christian countries

1462
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,800
being hit by this.

1463
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,000
You're exactly right.

1464
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,280
I don't know how this dude gets on every day.

1465
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,480
Almost every day.

1466
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,000
It makes me think that either he has a priority number or they don't get that many calls.

1467
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,960
I doubt they get that many calls.

1468
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,680
Because that Carlos dude is on all the fucking time.

1469
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:27,920
Okay.

1470
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,240
And Alex has a bizarre level of deference for him.

1471
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,040
He lets Carlos talk for quite a while.

1472
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,040
Carlos seems like a guy that is in the circle.

1473
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,000
He has some thoughts.

1474
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1475
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,200
I don't know, maybe he's just letting people talk too much now because he gets another

1476
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,600
caller, and I will say that he let this guy talk too long.

1477
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,080
Too long?

1478
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:50,800
A little bit too long.

1479
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,240
Oh, that's unsurprising.

1480
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,680
Not the same kind of problems that Harrison Smith gets when people talk too long.

1481
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,240
Sure.

1482
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,120
This guy just sounds a little bit sovereign citizen-y.

1483
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,840
Oh.

1484
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,040
You know, we have some really big issues.

1485
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,000
Trump owns the original post office, and it's been...

1486
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,120
The original post office?

1487
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,880
The wars are between post office.

1488
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:19,840
And, you know, this whole thing is about the legal fictions that Congress created to our

1489
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,320
birth certificates that were representing that all caps name.

1490
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:25,520
So...

1491
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,200
Is that MF2?

1492
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,640
What you said over and over, we're operating under color of law.

1493
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,320
Color of law.

1494
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:40,720
And until and unless we refute their presumptions and stop representing that all caps name,

1495
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:47,360
now you can find an explanation of that at Adebon Red, Article number 73.

1496
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,160
She really, really gets into it and has sent notices.

1497
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:50,800
Beautiful, brother.

1498
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,880
I got to tell you, everybody, thank you, Steven.

1499
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,360
Beautiful.

1500
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,760
Wow.

1501
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,000
So...

1502
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,320
All caps when you spell the man named, and...

1503
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,920
Do do do do do do do do do.

1504
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,160
Right.

1505
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,320
Right.

1506
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,200
Beyond that, and that's just standard sovereign citizen stuff.

1507
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:05,840
Yeah, naturally.

1508
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,800
Hooray for that.

1509
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,040
All caps, birth certificate, you're great.

1510
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,680
Now, I was unaware that Trump owns the original post office.

1511
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,360
I was surprised to discover that as well.

1512
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,320
And that all wars are wars between post offices.

1513
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,440
Did you not know that?

1514
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,000
I didn't.

1515
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,280
Did you not know that there has been a hundred year secret war between post offices?

1516
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,400
Ever since one guy, his horse knocked over another guy's horse and started the great

1517
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,360
post office war.

1518
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,000
I feel like probably there were, in earlier times, some feuding...

1519
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,960
Sure, of course.

1520
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,400
Between, like...

1521
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,760
Capitalism is capitalism.

1522
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,000
If you're getting paid by the letter, yeah, people are going to fight.

1523
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,680
Oh, these days.

1524
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,400
A little different.

1525
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:44,800
Not sure.

1526
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,920
A little different.

1527
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,600
So this show sucks.

1528
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,040
This episode is not good.

1529
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,400
Sorry, I just got the image of, you know, just a regular post office driver just driving

1530
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,760
on the with the door open on the wrong side.

1531
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,160
And you're like, isn't that cute? You guys are driving.

1532
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,640
They get out and then they're suddenly attacked by another post office guy.

1533
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,840
Throws him into the open window of the car and lights it up on fire.

1534
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,320
The FedEx boys jump UPS boys.

1535
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,040
It's the IRA of post offices.

1536
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,080
Yes, I gotcha.

1537
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,080
So, like I said, this show sucks.

1538
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,040
This episode's bad.

1539
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,640
And in the third hour, Alex has Drew Hernandez on, who's another reporter baby.

1540
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,800
I find this guy's voice incredibly annoying.

1541
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,560
He's on to talk about the border and talk about, oh, everything is.

1542
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,560
Oh, those people from not here.

1543
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,720
They're coming to here and we don't want them here.

1544
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,680
They're from not here.

1545
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,280
But Mike down for this, because this is how the interview started and where I turned it off.

1546
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,780
OK.

1547
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,160
You were saying, yeah, well, let's get into the border, but also some of the culture war stuff

1548
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,760
and some of the things that are going on as they put us onto this virtual economy.

1549
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,480
Tell us about it.

1550
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,840
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure your viewers are familiar with Bad Baby.

1551
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,920
You know, she's the catch me outside girl that was on Dr. Phil and extremely viral,

1552
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,880
totally depraved.

1553
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,800
She made an OnlyFans.

1554
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,440
I got to go.

1555
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,080
I don't know.

1556
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,800
I don't know what good is going to come with this conversation about the cash me outside girl.

1557
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,080
No, we get only fans.

1558
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,360
No, I don't care.

1559
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:16,240
Did you know that somebody in a viral video has an OnlyFans account now?

1560
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,760
Did I know she's a rapper?

1561
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,800
Do I care?

1562
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,440
No.

1563
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:19,920
Goodbye.

1564
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,200
Goodbye, sir.

1565
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:21,600
Yeah.

1566
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,560
I don't I don't care to listen to you, I guess.

1567
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,880
I mean, best case scenario, shame someone for being a sex worker.

1568
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,560
Like, I don't give a I don't I know people with OnlyFans accounts.

1569
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,040
Cool.

1570
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,600
Have fun.

1571
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,480
Yeah, great.

1572
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,320
I hope you supplement your income, I guess.

1573
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:38,800
I don't know.

1574
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,120
Yeah, if he's on to talk about the border.

1575
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,960
But first, we're going to get into culture wars.

1576
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,880
Someone has an OnlyFans account.

1577
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,920
I'm mad about it.

1578
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,880
I have to leave.

1579
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,120
I can't I'm not going to take you seriously.

1580
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,680
No, that's that's a dynasty level offense.

1581
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,480
If I had a glass of wine in my hand, I would throw it in that guy's face.

1582
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,600
How dare you say that.

1583
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,400
The temerity.

1584
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,080
Yeah.

1585
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:03,040
And plus, like, I mean, realistically, Saturday is just right around the corner.

1586
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,520
Of course.

1587
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,160
I'm not going to waste my time with Drew Hernandez.

1588
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:06,640
Yeah.

1589
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,920
I'm not going to waste my time.

1590
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,240
You've got an hour of meat and gristle to really dig your teeth into.

1591
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:12,560
Yep.

1592
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,280
So here we go.

1593
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:20,160
This is where things start off with Alex covering the Johns Hopkins document.

1594
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:20,640
Sure.

1595
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,440
Now, most people that are informed have heard about Event 201.

1596
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,000
They've heard about Operation Lockstep.

1597
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,320
They've heard about Crimson Contagion.

1598
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,200
They've heard about Disease X and the UN Drills.

1599
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:39,520
But have you heard about

1600
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,520
2025, 2028, it is all of those plans together.

1601
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,560
It's not.

1602
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,040
But not set in the near future, like those previous drills were,

1603
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,000
but set out a few more years in the future.

1604
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,200
That's the time we're in now.

1605
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:00,560
So just superimpose 2025 to 2028 with 2020 to 2023.

1606
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,080
And it is exactly what's happening.

1607
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,560
So I love the idea that Alex says the Johns Hopkins scenario depicts things

1608
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,320
exactly as they're happening in real life, just superimposed on a different date.

1609
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,360
Also, nothing funnier than it's not a little bit in the future.

1610
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,160
It's a few years.

1611
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,280
It's not in the near future, idiots.

1612
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,120
It's in the near, near future.

1613
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,080
Alex didn't know where that sentence was going to end when it started.

1614
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,360
That's a bad dismount.

1615
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,200
So when he's talking about things being exactly like real life, just a few years off.

1616
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:31,520
Sure.

1617
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,360
I have a few things to say.

1618
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,320
Okay, toss it at me.

1619
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,880
First of all, one of the main tensions of the Hopkins exercise is messaging issues around

1620
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,440
a drug that was believed to be effective against spars called Calosevir.

1621
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,160
Calosevir.

1622
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,240
There wasn't a drug that the government was trying to push for the treatment of COVID

1623
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,080
in the way that the medical community gets behind Calosevir in this exercise.

1624
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,160
Maybe remdesivir, possibly, but...

1625
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:54,560
Yeah.

1626
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:00,720
I mean, your basic there is like Trump and his messaging campaign pushed

1627
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,000
hydroxychloroquine so hard.

1628
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,560
Yeah.

1629
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,000
The mixed messaging though.

1630
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,640
Yeah, yeah.

1631
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,440
It doesn't fit for this.

1632
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,200
And I don't think that remdesivir does either in terms of the way it's depicted in the exercise.

1633
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,080
So to me, this seems like one really big problem with the scenario matching real world history.

1634
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:22,480
Second, backlash to Calosevir begins in February 2026, four months into the outbreak,

1635
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,680
when a video of a child projectile vomiting after taking a dose goes viral online.

1636
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,200
This did not happen four months into COVID, even metaphorically.

1637
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:31,760
That's fair.

1638
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:38,240
Third, in May 2026, a made up rapper named BZ suffers a public embarrassment when trying

1639
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,160
to promote sparse treatments to his audience when he compares people who volunteer for

1640
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,960
vaccine trials to participants in the Tuskegee experiments.

1641
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,360
This did not happen in the real world.

1642
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,280
Exhibit A in why scientists don't become rappers.

1643
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,640
Our fictitious rapper is named BZ.

1644
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,140
Sure.

1645
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,800
There are plenty of examples of things like this that did not happen in the real world,

1646
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,960
but do in the scenario exercise, because the point of the events that happened in the scenario

1647
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,320
is to create situations where messaging challenges would arise that the exercise participants

1648
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,800
could reflect on how best to respond.

1649
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,040
The inclusion of a situation like this rapper making a public gaffe in this scenario doesn't

1650
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,880
make sense out of context.

1651
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,080
When you don't see this exercise within the context of why it exists, it seems really weird.

1652
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,920
But when you understand that it's designed to assist medical communications professionals

1653
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,480
brainstorm the ways that they might need to respond to various events in a crisis, the

1654
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,000
picture makes far more sense.

1655
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,880
At the same time that BZ makes his comments, the fictional former president, Jacqueline

1656
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,880
Bennett, gives a noncommittal answer about whether or not she would give her grandson

1657
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,080
callous of ear, which creates a similar but slightly different messaging problem for the

1658
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,160
exercise participants to reflect on.

1659
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,040
Sure, sure, sure.

1660
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,840
Anyway, the point is a bunch of things that happen in very differently in this imagined

1661
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,400
scenario than have happened in our real world outbreak.

1662
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,080
Alex is just trying to pretend everything is the same because it's more fun and profitable

1663
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,760
for him, but it's all made up.

1664
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,040
So is this SBZ supposed to be a play on Yeezy?

1665
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,240
I thought Jay-Z.

1666
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,840
Well, I mean, but the very public gaffe would suggest more of a Kanye circumstance.

1667
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,320
Yeah, you're not wrong, but I think that...

1668
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,280
Are they saying that Kanye is going to Taylor Swift COVID-19?

1669
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,840
No, because in the context of the scenario exercise, BZ is one of the people who was

1670
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:31,040
enlisted to help get messaging out about the safety of the treatment.

1671
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,440
And then he said George Bush doesn't care about black people.

1672
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,800
I don't think that Kanye would be enlisted by the medical community.

1673
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,480
Not anymore, not anymore.

1674
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,160
So this document, my friend, is a timeline.

1675
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,360
This is what you need to understand.

1676
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:43,840
Naturally.

1677
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,340
Timeline.

1678
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,280
But a few years off into the near near future.

1679
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:54,000
Basically, you just transpose the beginning of the outbreak to the outbreak in the document.

1680
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,480
Sure.

1681
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,160
You could tell what's going to happen in the future.

1682
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:56,880
That sounds right.

1683
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,000
And unfortunately, we are six months away from something bad.

1684
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,720
Oh, that's bad.

1685
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,080
Now, here's what's devastating.

1686
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,240
We're about 13 months into the simulation that, again, is not really a simulation.

1687
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,720
They're using that to cover their operations.

1688
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,000
In case they get caught with the documents, they just say it's part of the drill.

1689
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,640
That's a classic operation by intelligence agencies, governments, but also health agencies.

1690
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,520
Classic by health agencies.

1691
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,920
Next, they say that within six months to a year of people being inoculated with these

1692
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:33,200
experimental GMO gene therapies, that you will have massive brain damage and spongiform

1693
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,200
encephalopathy, basically, or prion disease, mad cow disease.

1694
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,440
So that's good, good times.

1695
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,640
That's a real bummer.

1696
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,520
That's going to be a really rough six months to a year from now.

1697
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,640
Don't worry, it's bullshit.

1698
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,280
Oh, okay.

1699
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,440
So in the exercise, there's this potential basis for a vaccine discovered in the form

1700
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,640
of an animal vaccine for hoofed mammal respiratory virus developed by a company called GMI.

1701
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,600
This condition was similar in many ways to SPARS, so researchers began looking at whether

1702
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,200
or not it could be effective for humans.

1703
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,720
One of the initial downsides was that, quote, data provided by GMI suggested that the vaccine

1704
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,280
was effective at preventing SPARS-like illness in cows, pigs, and other hoofed mammals, but

1705
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,840
internal trials revealed several worrisome side effects, including swollen legs, severe

1706
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,960
joint pain, and encephalitis leading to seizures or death.

1707
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,800
Right, and cows learning how to talk.

1708
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,520
Sure.

1709
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,120
In this scenario, in May 2027, a group of parents, the size of the group is unspecified,

1710
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,480
they sue the government because they believe that their children got encephalitis from

1711
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,440
the vaccine.

1712
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,240
The claims are not presented as necessarily accurate.

1713
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,640
It's just more detail added to make this a more real scenario, since this mirrors real

1714
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,400
world anti-vax folks, and it's something that presents a challenge to the messaging that's

1715
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,840
required for medical communicators.

1716
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,800
Naturally.

1717
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,960
The scenario does say that, quote, after showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year,

1718
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,720
several vaccine recipients slowly began to experience symptoms such as blurry vision,

1719
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,800
headaches, and numbness in their extremities.

1720
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:59,760
Due to the small number of cases, the significance of the association with Corvax was never determined.

1721
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,000
As of this writing in 2030, longitudinal studies initiated by the NIH at the beginning of

1722
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,320
the vaccination program have not reached the next round of data collection, so formal

1723
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,360
analysis of these symptoms has not yet been conducted.

1724
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,280
Furthermore, these cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients, those in high

1725
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:20,000
risk populations, including those with other underlying conditions, making it increasingly

1726
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,920
difficult to determine the extent to which these symptoms are associated with vaccination.

1727
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,920
I read this earlier, but I wanted to read it again because this brings up an important

1728
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,800
point, and that is that these elements of the scenario, it's left intentionally open

1729
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,040
ended because it exists to pose a question to the participants, not to depict a reality

1730
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,040
that actually exists.

1731
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,960
In that scenario, how does a person in a position of medical messaging respond?

1732
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,880
How do you convey confidence on the medical side of things, while still acknowledging

1733
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,120
certain uncertainties?

1734
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,880
These are the sorts of questions this story arc is meant to bring up.

1735
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,840
Because Alex knows better and he's a psychic, he's realized that this is actually the globalists

1736
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,400
admitting that they're going to give everyone mad cow disease, when the encephalitis is

1737
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:07,680
really just the animal vaccine that GMI created, and it's just encephalitis in animals, and

1738
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:13,240
then there's some parents who allege encephalitis, but it's not actually proven in the case of

1739
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,240
the scenario.

1740
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,360
No, and that's maybe the most important question for the study to ask, which is how is it that

1741
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:26,820
we can tell people, honestly, we don't know, and at the same time reassure them that they

1742
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:27,820
can trust us?

1743
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:32,920
Yeah, and one of the other things that they take great care to point out is exploring

1744
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:39,020
ideas of how to be compassionate about the uncertainty, because it's an understandable

1745
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:44,460
feeling for people to have, and how do you mix that compassion about the uncertainty

1746
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:48,620
with the confidence in medical science?

1747
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,520
It's a challenging thing, but that's why you do exercises like this.

1748
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:57,180
Yeah, my message would probably not be good, it would be more something like, listen, we

1749
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:03,280
know public education has failed you between first and eighth grade, at least.

1750
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,220
You wouldn't make it through the exercise.

1751
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:11,260
So the thing is that Alex is connecting this with the study that he's found, right?

1752
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,640
So they say encephalitis in the scenario, right?

1753
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,820
And that's like the Zika virus, right?

1754
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:23,920
I just mentioned to you spongiform encephalopathy, or prion disease, microbiology infectious

1755
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,260
diseases journal, COVID-19 RNA-based vaccines, and the risk of prion disease.

1756
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:33,760
That was put out in 2021 by prestigious scientists.

1757
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,620
Whenever you hear Alex say that a claim is being made by a prestigious scientist, that

1758
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,580
means he has no idea who the person is.

1759
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:43,020
Yeah, I was going to say that's a huge red flag immediately.

1760
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,940
It's an unknown quantity, but he wants to elevate this claim that they're making because

1761
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,900
it works well for him.

1762
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:53,020
This claim that the COVID vaccine causes prion disease was based entirely on a non-peer reviewed

1763
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,660
paper by a guy named J. Bart Klassen.

1764
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:59,420
No one agrees with his conclusion, and he is not a prestigious scientist.

1765
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:04,060
According to USA Today, quote, in 1999 he claimed the influenza vaccine caused type

1766
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:10,220
one diabetes, a claim disproven by Johns Hopkins University Institute for Vaccine Safety.

1767
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:13,900
He's just an anti-vax weirdo who makes these claims pretty regularly whenever there's a

1768
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,060
vaccine that needs to be smeared.

1769
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,060
Vaccines cause IBS!

1770
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:19,420
Alright, man, okay.

1771
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,660
So now Alex is there.

1772
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,500
He's rolling deep, though, with the crew.

1773
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:23,500
Sure.

1774
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,500
To quote B.Z.

1775
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,620
Nicely done.

1776
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:27,620
He's got Rob Dues.

1777
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,860
It is Easter, so Jesus walks.

1778
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:30,860
Oh.

1779
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:38,260
So Rob Dues is in studio, the corporate representative Rob Dues, and he's just blown away by this

1780
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,260
document.

1781
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,260
Rob Dues.

1782
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,940
Yeah, so the parallels on this are just from a, when you looked at 9-11 and you saw the

1783
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:51,100
parallels that happened, this has got the same thing in it with like massive power outages.

1784
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:57,140
You've got a male and female president, the president who's a male stops after a few years,

1785
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:01,500
the female who's, she's only in for one term and then she leaves and then the male president

1786
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
takes over.

1787
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,540
We kind of have that going on.

1788
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:07,380
So first of all, Biden hasn't stepped down, so this isn't actually a similarity at all.

1789
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,160
No, it's exactly like that.

1790
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,160
It's happening, though.

1791
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,160
You can see it.

1792
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,840
I don't know if the Infowars universe is just so convinced that it's going to happen any

1793
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,100
day now that they've just decided it's already happened, but this is just a similarity in

1794
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,440
Rob's head.

1795
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,600
So in this scenario, the president is named Randall Archer.

1796
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,380
He'd previously been the vice president under Jacqueline Bennett.

1797
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:29,700
She didn't step down, she just decided not to run for a second term after being president

1798
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,060
from 2020 to 2024, at which point Archer ran and won.

1799
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,300
Shouting, fuck you guys, you were shit.

1800
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,360
Bennett is still actively involved in being an advisor, but was not up to seeking re-election

1801
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,900
quote due to health concerns.

1802
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,420
This is the case in the scenario because it creates an interesting dynamic where there's

1803
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:51,220
a new president, but also a fully functioning and intact staff at the Department of Health

1804
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,740
and Human Services.

1805
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:56,580
In terms of what the exercise is designed to explore, this makes total sense.

1806
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,420
Essentially, former President Bennett exists as a prop, so she can be a character that

1807
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,660
makes a media gaffe where she gives that non-committal answer about Calus Avere.

1808
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:05,660
Sure, sure.

1809
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,380
The character that does that should be a beloved public figure, you know, because then it works,

1810
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:12,340
there's a weird dynamic there, but it also shouldn't be the current president because

1811
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,660
that's too weird.

1812
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,240
So a former president works great.

1813
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,420
In order to make that scenario work, she would have to have just had one term, and ideally

1814
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,340
she shouldn't have just lost an election.

1815
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:25,780
Seems like the best way to get to that story beat would be if you just didn't want to seek

1816
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,780
re-election.

1817
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:31,740
Everybody still trusts her, so the gaffe would carry so much weight that they would be influenced

1818
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:36,980
by it, while at the same time, you couldn't lose an election and have everybody be influenced

1819
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:37,980
in the same way.

1820
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,980
It would be weird.

1821
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:44,140
And you don't want it to be the current president because it adds a whole layer to it.

1822
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:49,880
The other specific that Rob uses is this power outage, which I will admit is in the scenario.

1823
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,900
There's a massive power outage in the Pacific Northwest just one week prior to the rollout

1824
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:58,640
of the vaccine, which doesn't match up with what Rob wants it to in the real world, sure.

1825
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,740
He's trying to compare that to the Texas outages, which happened well after vaccination programs

1826
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,460
began and are reality.

1827
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:09,660
Again, it's important to understand why this specific detail is included in the exercise.

1828
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:13,700
This is all about medical messaging in a public health emergency, so this power outage was

1829
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:17,820
added to the scenario so participants could consider what methods they might employ if

1830
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,860
they didn't have access to things like social media.

1831
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:25,420
With a massive power outage, one of the main methods of communications is less effective.

1832
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:28,900
But you need to continue helping the public through, so what do you do?

1833
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:32,460
This is super clear from the exercise if you read it, but if you just want to make random

1834
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,540
connections, I guess you could do what Rob Doo is doing, and it's really embarrassing.

1835
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:41,020
I mean, look, this is what it says in the text, quote, all communication about the vaccine

1836
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:45,140
rollout was published in electronic form, and consequently many individuals in the affected

1837
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:49,660
areas were initially unable to access information provided by state, local, and federal health

1838
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:52,060
authorities regarding CoraVax dispensing.

1839
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,060
Reasonable.

1840
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:57,740
Immediately after this, there are study questions for the participants in the document, like,

1841
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:02,700
quote, while greater use of electronic media opens new opportunities for broad outreach,

1842
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,980
what communications vulnerabilities exist that could impede communication efforts via

1843
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,700
electronic media?

1844
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,700
Or the other question, quote, how can public health communicators remain flexible when

1845
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,060
multiple disasters occur at once?

1846
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,060
Right.

1847
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:20,200
In their paper about designing scenario-based exercises, Ogilvy and Schwartz discuss the

1848
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:25,340
need for stories that follow various plots, and one of the most common archetypes is crisis

1849
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,080
and response.

1850
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,260
This plot element is about introducing a big problem, and then the participants get to

1851
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,260
respond.

1852
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:36,260
The paper discusses an exercise they ran with Shell that followed basically this exact same

1853
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,260
path.

1854
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,060
Quote, first comes the scenario's crisis.

1855
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:44,420
Initial signs of environmental degradation lead reputable scientists to conclude that

1856
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,900
an environmental disaster is fast approaching.

1857
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,900
A few leading governments and companies change the way they do business.

1858
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,460
Disasters begin to occur in countries that could not or chose not to adapt, and there's

1859
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,140
public outcry.

1860
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:01,100
The playing field, the organizational operating environment, is suddenly dramatically altered.

1861
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,940
The innovative firms that learn to make difficult changes in their business practices to avoid

1862
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:09,080
environmental degradation are now positioned to become market leaders.

1863
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,800
In the Johns Hopkins exercise, the outbreak itself is the initial crisis.

1864
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,620
Then things like the power outage in the Pacific Northwest or the video of the kid vomiting

1865
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,920
represent new crises that the participants have to deal with.

1866
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,660
This is the context of what Alex and Rob are lying about, and it makes total sense there's

1867
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:27,700
no way to read that document and not understand that that's what it is.

1868
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:33,580
That's so funny to me that they missed the most important question of having that kind

1869
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:38,940
of power outage a week before the vaccine rollout, which would just simply be like,

1870
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:43,620
okay, an astonishing number of people are going to think that God is punishing us for

1871
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,800
this vaccine.

1872
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,300
How do we deal with that?

1873
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,940
Or are all the Proud Boys accounted for?

1874
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,140
Yeah, is this witches?

1875
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:57,020
People are going to ask us why God punished us with this power outage before the vaccine.

1876
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,020
You know what?

1877
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,820
That isn't in the exercise, but I think...

1878
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:01,820
It's a subtext.

1879
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:06,140
Jordan, to be fair, it was made in 2017.

1880
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,140
That's true.

1881
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:10,580
If it was made today, that might've been a relevant messaging question, but yeah.

1882
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,580
Okay.

1883
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:14,260
People are going to assume meteorologists are witches.

1884
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,140
What do we do about that from a health standpoint?

1885
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:20,340
It's interesting to me that this is how Rob Dues starting it out.

1886
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,180
He's talking about these similarities.

1887
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:27,580
One is not a similarity at all in that Biden hasn't stepped down, and even if he did, it

1888
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,380
doesn't match the scenario that's depicted in the exercise.

1889
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:36,200
And then the other one is that there's a power outage, but they're completely different situations.

1890
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,780
And if you understand what the document is for, it makes total sense that a power outage

1891
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,000
would be in there.

1892
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,120
It creates an important teaching moment about using non-electronic methods.

1893
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:52,460
Every time Dues goes to a diner, he has failed the, what are the three differences picture.

1894
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,460
Oh dude.

1895
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,180
He's never gotten one of those cereal boxes, placemats, it doesn't matter.

1896
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,180
Shut up.

1897
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,180
I just had a great idea.

1898
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,180
Okay.

1899
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,580
Have you ever played Overcooked?

1900
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:02,580
Uh, yes.

1901
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:03,580
We tried one time.

1902
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:07,580
Yeah, it's that game where you have to cook meals, you know, like you're running around

1903
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,580
chopping up an onion.

1904
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,580
You gotta do the thing.

1905
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,140
It's like Burger Boss or whatever it is.

1906
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,140
I have a new idea.

1907
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,140
Okay.

1908
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,140
Dues Diner.

1909
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:16,780
Try and figure out puzzles that are way too easy.

1910
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:17,780
No, no, no.

1911
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,740
It's Overcooked, but the goal is to fail.

1912
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:23,580
You just have to fail interestingly.

1913
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:24,580
Yeah, yeah.

1914
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:25,580
I like that game.

1915
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,140
That's a good open-ended game.

1916
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:30,700
Anybody who can program an app, don't waste your time on that.

1917
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:31,700
Please don't.

1918
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:36,060
Uh, so Alex gets to starting up reading the, uh, the document and this is fun.

1919
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,540
I love this.

1920
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:40,460
Let's go ahead and begin here.

1921
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:43,300
Here is the project team who is on it.

1922
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,660
All these different top eugenicists, top globalist, uh, from around the country.

1923
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,540
John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

1924
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,860
The team, uh, it's top eugenicists, right?

1925
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:58,380
It's five senior associates with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, a professor

1926
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:03,220
from Texas State, and a Masters of Public Health candidate from Columbia University.

1927
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,220
Well yeah.

1928
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,220
Top eugenicists.

1929
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:10,180
How do you get any of those things without a proven track record of top eugenicism?

1930
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:13,220
Alex has no idea who any of these people are.

1931
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,220
Why would you?

1932
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,220
Just making this up.

1933
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,540
Why would you know who they are?

1934
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:19,300
Oh yeah, this Masters student is a fucking top eugenicist.

1935
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:25,060
A sane person who doesn't directly, uh, affect, uh, interact with these people know who they

1936
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,060
are.

1937
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,140
This Columbia University grad student is a sixth generation eugenicist.

1938
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,140
Sure.

1939
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:31,140
Sure.

1940
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,140
Ah.

1941
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,980
So anyway, I warned you earlier that there was a squirrely weirdo coming up named Mike.

1942
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:36,980
Mike.

1943
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:37,980
Mike the squirrely weirdo.

1944
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,340
I honestly don't know who this dude is.

1945
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,380
I think he might be an Infowars employee.

1946
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,940
He might be Harrison Smith's roommate.

1947
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,940
Sure.

1948
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,940
I don't fucking know.

1949
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,940
Could be anybody.

1950
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:46,940
But he is weird.

1951
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,940
Wife's tennis instructor.

1952
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:48,940
He is weird.

1953
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,940
He's a liar.

1954
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:50,940
Okay.

1955
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:55,260
And, uh, this can be found inside of the sparse document word for word after showing no adverse

1956
01:18:55,260 --> 01:19:01,740
side effects for nearly a year, vaccine recipients slowly began to experience symptoms as time

1957
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:07,020
passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated claims of adverse side effects

1958
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,460
began to emerge.

1959
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:14,500
As the investigations grew in intensity, several high ranking officials at the CDC and FDA

1960
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,620
were forced to step down and withdraw from government.

1961
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:21,900
They're setting up the health officials and the politicians to take the fall for this.

1962
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,980
What Mike is reading here, that's definitely from the document, but he's made a classic

1963
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:30,740
Infowars move here and that he's taken two unrelated passages from the text and combine

1964
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:34,540
them, pretending they're about the same thing in order to lie about this document.

1965
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,540
Yeah.

1966
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:39,060
The part about people experiencing side effects after a year is from chapter 17.

1967
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:40,500
It's on page 60.

1968
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,820
The second part about government officials stepping down is chapter 19.

1969
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,500
It's on page 67.

1970
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,740
It's completely unrelated to the previous chapter's conversation about possible side

1971
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,020
effects.

1972
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:55,460
Here is the paragraph about the government officials in full quote after action reports,

1973
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:59,760
government hearings and agency reviews following the pandemic were too numerous to count.

1974
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,060
Emergency funding appropriated by Congress to fight the disease became available partway

1975
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:07,500
through the course of the pandemic, but federal state and local public health agencies struggled

1976
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,220
to manage the procedural requirements to spend it.

1977
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,520
That does sound familiar.

1978
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,900
As a result, significant amounts of emergency funds remained unused as the pandemic wound

1979
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:16,900
down.

1980
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,620
As the investigations grew in intensity, several high ranking officials at the CDC and FDA

1981
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:24,400
were forced to step down and withdraw from government in order to quote spend more time

1982
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,040
with their families.

1983
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:32,560
The investigations that are causing these imaginary officials to step down are not related

1984
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,600
to possible drug side effects.

1985
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,980
It's clearly about mismanagement of funds.

1986
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:41,200
If this guy's read the document as he's presenting himself as having done, then he knows fully

1987
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,480
well that the two passages he just read as if they were one paragraph are actually two

1988
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,040
completely different sections of the document.

1989
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:51,920
If this document actually said what he wanted it to, he wouldn't have to lie like this in

1990
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,200
order to make it look like it met his needs.

1991
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,480
This is bullshit, weirdo Mike.

1992
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:02,140
That is funny that even in the Johns Hopkins report, it's like, listen, we all know at

1993
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:05,640
least 15 to 20 senators are corrupt as shit.

1994
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,160
We're just going to put in that some of them had to quit.

1995
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:17,120
I mean, I think that the scenario paints a very realistic portrait of some of the things

1996
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,000
that you could expect might happen.

1997
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Absolutely.

1998
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,720
We'll deal with another one of them that Rob Dew thinks is maybe wizardry a little bit

1999
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,280
later, but I don't know.

2000
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:30,140
From reading the document, I think there's some pretty fair assumptions that are made

2001
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,920
and then also some ones that are like, that's a little silly, but they're all in service

2002
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,600
of what the document is for.

2003
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,600
Right.

2004
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,600
They're teaching documents.

2005
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,240
They're still focused around this exercise that is how do medical communicators rise

2006
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,280
to various challenges.

2007
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:51,400
Now I think that clip right there where Mike is reading two different sections as if they

2008
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:56,960
were the same, because when he's talking about these side effects, he then says, as investigations

2009
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,360
grow in intensity, and that's meant to lead the audience to think that these investigations...

2010
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:05,560
Very clearly split those quotes, but then combine them together to form a single quote.

2011
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:10,920
Which leads you to believe that the investigations are about drug side effects, and that's how

2012
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,200
they're going to set up the politicians to take the fall for this, has nothing to do

2013
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,200
with that.

2014
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,200
He has to know that.

2015
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:20,760
And this is the point at which any reasonable person would just be like, fuck this.

2016
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,920
You're absolutely misrepresenting the primary document you're talking about, and there's

2017
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,880
no way that that is an accident.

2018
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,840
There's no way you did this accidentally.

2019
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:37,480
Well, I mean, it's somewhat similar to Alex's synopsis of Romeo and Juliet in so far as

2020
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,360
he leaves out a bunch of the middle between those two things.

2021
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,360
No it's not.

2022
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,920
No, no, no, no, no.

2023
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,920
No, I know.

2024
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,640
It would be like if he threw in a little bit of Hamlet.

2025
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:51,440
Yeah, that sounds fun.

2026
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:57,560
So anyway, Mike gets to being weird some more about a passage about vaccine distribution.

2027
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:03,200
To determine how to best distribute limited doses of Corovax to members of priority groups

2028
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:09,240
across the country, the US government resorted to new controversial tactics, notably having

2029
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:14,560
health care providers access patients' electronic health records to determine the number of

2030
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,260
individuals in high-risk populations receiving care in particular areas.

2031
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,520
This passage really undercuts the argument that this document represents the globalist

2032
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,480
plan because they didn't do that.

2033
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,040
Also, while we're on the subject of things that didn't happen in real life that do happen

2034
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,400
in the scenario, we should look at chapter 10 and see one of the big, uh, giant, gigantic,

2035
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:38,800
I'm going to come up with more words, one of the big public messaging crises that come

2036
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,320
up over the course of the exercise.

2037
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,240
Gojira emerged from the ocean.

2038
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,640
No, that's chapter 12.

2039
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,680
Oh, okay, okay.

2040
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,120
In chapter 10 of the scenario, there's a huge public backlash because doctors and nurses

2041
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,520
aren't included in the highest priority group for the distribution of the vaccine.

2042
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,400
Yeah, that would cause a huge public backlash.

2043
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,840
Yeah, they even designed two fake tweets that illustrate the outrage that was happening

2044
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,880
in the medical worker communities.

2045
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,840
There's a strike in Milwaukee among health care providers when they won't go to work

2046
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,680
unless they're made of vaccine priority.

2047
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,680
Yeah.

2048
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:08,680
And none of that happened in life.

2049
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:13,400
Yeah, no, that's a totally reasonable thing for them to do were that unreasonable thing

2050
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,400
to occur.

2051
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,400
Sure.

2052
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,400
Yeah.

2053
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,060
Also in the scenario, there's a groundswell of college activism taking place in the social

2054
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:23,300
media app that's created for this exercise called Unequal.

2055
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:27,560
On the exercise, quote, another group that was not generally affected by the government's

2056
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:32,200
Corovax promotion efforts were college students, especially those attending school on the east

2057
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,020
and west coasts.

2058
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:37,400
Public health officials had no explanation for the lack of vaccine uptake among this

2059
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:42,600
population until protests began at several college campuses, including UC Berkeley, the

2060
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,480
University of Washington, Reed College, Harvard, and the University of Chicago.

2061
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,960
The focus of these protests was the lack of access to Corovax, particularly for populations

2062
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,620
in less developed countries like Haiti, Guatemala, and Cameroon.

2063
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:57,880
The college students involved declared that they would not accept Corovax until it was

2064
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:02,200
made available in terms of both access and expense to everyone in the world who wanted

2065
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,200
it.

2066
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,200
Right.

2067
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,200
This, too, did not happen in the real world.

2068
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,200
Right, right, right.

2069
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,200
Yeah.

2070
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,160
The reason these events are included in the scenario is the same as anything that is in

2071
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,160
there.

2072
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,920
They present an opportunity for the participants to wrestle with challenges in the field of

2073
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,440
medical messaging.

2074
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:18,040
None of it's real, but it portrays situations that are close enough to seeming real for

2075
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,320
them to be effective in role-playing situations.

2076
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2077
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,680
And that's enough for Alex to think that it's all secretly real.

2078
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:35,160
Yeah, I mean, it seems fun whenever these studies predict events that do wind up occurring,

2079
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,600
because you're like, ooh, look at how good those predictions are.

2080
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:43,700
But it's really just based on the shit we've already seen that's going to almost certainly

2081
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:49,680
happen again, because people don't learn lessons from things exactly like the thing that we're

2082
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,680
writing now.

2083
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,120
So Mike is a weirdo, I've decided.

2084
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:02,280
And he reads this passage, and again, normal people would have checked out already, but

2085
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,280
I'm not normal.

2086
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,920
I still want to hear more.

2087
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,080
I mean, this gets worse, Alex.

2088
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:11,480
Severe side effects, including swollen legs, severe joint pain, and encephalitis potentially

2089
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:16,880
resulting in seizures, seizure disorders, or death occasionally occurred word for word

2090
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,520
from the document.

2091
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,720
Something now happening in Max.

2092
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,240
We've got to add all the B-roll to that.

2093
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,120
So what Mike is failing to mention here is the passage he's reading is about the side

2094
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,120
effects.

2095
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,220
It's not for the Corvex human vaccine.

2096
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:32,320
It's from the section about the vaccine for animals.

2097
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,880
There's an added bit of comedy in that he's reading a quote from a fake email that the

2098
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,720
scenario created in order to depict an exchange of information about an animal vaccine, and

2099
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,560
then Mike's dumb ass is pretending it's a document talking about human side effects.

2100
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,560
Just amazing.

2101
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,960
That is real, real bummer town level shit.

2102
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:55,000
Here's what he read in context, what the actual thing says, quote, in 2021 a coronavirus caused

2103
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:01,000
an outbreak in region seven, parenthetically Southeast Asia, in the hoofed mammal populations.

2104
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,120
Our researchers developed and produced in-house an effective vaccine against the infection.

2105
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:09,160
Its subsequent approval and use successfully ended the outbreak in the region.

2106
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:13,120
While largely effective in preventing infection, severe side effects, including swollen legs,

2107
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,200
severe joint pain and encephalitis, potentially resulting in seizures, seizure disorder or

2108
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,280
death occasionally occurred.

2109
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,720
Given the millions of vaccinations required for region seven, this resulted in measurable

2110
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,120
losses in the animal population.

2111
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,880
This is critical to understand.

2112
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,280
If this document actually said what these dumdums were claiming it was, they wouldn't

2113
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,120
resort to tactics like this.

2114
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,460
This is so manipulative, it's nonsense.

2115
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,460
This is bullshit.

2116
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:38,160
If it were truly a smoking gun, they'd just be able to read it.

2117
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:43,520
They wouldn't have to pretend that they were reading this fake email from the document

2118
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,320
as if it's a real thing about a human vaccine.

2119
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:52,400
What's the point of having these things if you're just going to highlight like one paragraph

2120
01:27:52,400 --> 01:28:00,480
from every other chapter and then just combine them into a single double-spaced page?

2121
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,480
You know?

2122
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,480
Why?

2123
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,480
Yeah.

2124
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,480
Fuck off.

2125
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,520
So Mike reads a passage about conspiracy theories that go around.

2126
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,160
And Alex gets so excited that he has to read it himself.

2127
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,160
Oh boy.

2128
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,240
I think it's because he's like, I want to maybe use a cut of me saying this later, like

2129
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:19,600
in a John Bowne report, and I don't want to have this weirdo reading it.

2130
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,560
I want it to be in my voice.

2131
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,380
Conspiracy theories also profited across social media suggesting that the virus had been purposely

2132
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:30,720
created and introduced to the population by drug companies or that it had escaped from

2133
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,180
a government lab secretly testing bio-weapons.

2134
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:41,860
This is in 2017 right after Fauci says a virus will be released.

2135
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:42,860
It's going to happen.

2136
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:43,920
It's going to challenge Trump.

2137
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,480
It's going to be a surprise operation.

2138
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:47,140
Fauci didn't say that.

2139
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:50,120
In the speech that he was given, we've talked about this, he was talking about how every

2140
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,280
administration deals with an unforeseen health crisis.

2141
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:57,640
And he said that conspiracy theories would abound that it would escape from a government

2142
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:02,640
lab just 20 years after Alex started saying that every four months.

2143
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,640
Yeah.

2144
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:04,640
That's interesting too.

2145
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,640
Yeah.

2146
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,440
It's like, we listened to that 2003 episode and now it's just saying foot and mouth came

2147
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,440
out of port and down.

2148
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,440
Yeah.

2149
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,440
The same thing.

2150
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,480
It's like, yeah, of course they would add that scenario in there.

2151
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,740
That's what you do.

2152
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:17,880
That's one of the things that's like, oh, this is giving texture to the world.

2153
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:18,880
Exactly.

2154
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,080
And it's not even a major point.

2155
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,040
That's not even like...

2156
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,040
It's just mentioned.

2157
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,040
Yeah.

2158
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,040
Yeah.

2159
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,040
And it's after the fact.

2160
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:30,440
It's after the entire course of the outbreak happens in terms of the document.

2161
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:35,360
Call me when conspiracy theorists in this paper decide to inspire people to overthrow

2162
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,360
the country.

2163
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:43,980
So Mike, I mean, look, some of this stuff, I don't know.

2164
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:47,760
Like someone who's really generous might be able to say he's just sloppy.

2165
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,760
Sure.

2166
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,720
But there's intention behind the misrepresentations he's presenting.

2167
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,480
I don't believe that he did this by accident.

2168
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,320
Someone incredibly generous, neither of which are we.

2169
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,320
No.

2170
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,640
Also, I think...

2171
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:06,120
I heard this and I got really worried.

2172
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,040
This took me two weeks to read, by the way.

2173
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:11,960
The wording, it weaves everything together so you're like, what is going on?

2174
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:12,960
Is this an exercise?

2175
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,160
Is this real?

2176
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,760
I was just trying to do the best job I can to extract everything.

2177
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:19,480
So if you had five minutes, you could just understand what's happening.

2178
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,480
Oh my God.

2179
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,480
Bad.

2180
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,480
Oh my God.

2181
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,480
Bad.

2182
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,480
Super bad.

2183
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,480
Oh my God.

2184
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,540
Some things require more than five minutes.

2185
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,540
That's a good thing.

2186
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,540
Sure.

2187
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:34,880
I can't imagine taking two weeks and then coming away with that sort of sewn together

2188
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,640
quotation that misrepresents the point.

2189
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:42,920
I don't understand, too, being able to look at this and not be able to understand fairly

2190
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,480
quickly what it is.

2191
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:48,920
I understand if you see it out of context, completely out of context, it could be confusing

2192
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:49,920
for a bit.

2193
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,920
Sure.

2194
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,920
But if you sat down...

2195
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,080
Perhaps you only had five minutes to hear about it.

2196
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,080
Sure.

2197
01:30:54,080 --> 01:31:00,480
If you sat down and actually read a couple pages, it explains the exercise at the beginning.

2198
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,480
Yeah, of course.

2199
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,480
It explains...

2200
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:03,480
I don't know.

2201
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,480
I don't know.

2202
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,760
It starts with, Dear Alex Jones, please, we're explaining the exercise.

2203
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,080
You literally can't use this for your propaganda.

2204
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,760
I really, really don't understand the idea of anyone sitting with this for an hour, let

2205
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:21,080
alone two weeks, and coming away with any confusion about, oh, also there is a disclaimer

2206
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,560
that Alex shouldn't use this.

2207
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,160
Let me read this, quote, this is a hypothetical scenario designed to illustrate the public

2208
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,680
health risk communication challenges that could potentially emerge during a naturally

2209
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:34,640
occurring infectious disease outbreak requiring development and distribution of a novel and

2210
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:39,320
or investigational drugs, vaccines, therapeutics, or other medical countermeasures.

2211
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,320
The infectious pathogen...

2212
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,640
Oh, I just did an Alex.

2213
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:47,440
The infectious pathogen, medical countermeasures, characters, news media, excerpts, social media

2214
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:52,080
posts, and government agency responses described herein are entirely fictional.

2215
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,080
So there is a disclaimer.

2216
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2217
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,960
But that does not stop these dorks.

2218
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:58,960
Doesn't sound like it.

2219
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,840
Dan, it's about what they're not saying.

2220
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:01,840
Mm-hmm.

2221
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:02,840
Yeah.

2222
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,840
It's like jazz.

2223
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,840
Yeah, exactly.

2224
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:05,840
So here's Mike.

2225
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,840
Two weeks of study.

2226
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,200
Two weeks of intense study.

2227
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,960
And now he's going to bring back up this power outage.

2228
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,960
Okay.

2229
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:16,860
A week before Corovax was released for distribution in the United States, the power grid at the

2230
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:22,540
Grand Coulee Dam in eastern Washington state experienced a catastrophic failure.

2231
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:27,640
While the event did not destroy any infrastructure or result in any deaths, it did cause widespread

2232
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:32,560
power outages in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia.

2233
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,500
Though power was restored within a day of the initial outage, blackouts continued plaguing

2234
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,440
these areas over the next three weeks.

2235
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,320
And the resurgence of the banned widespread panic.

2236
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,560
Why would they put that in a vaccine exercise?

2237
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:46,220
Because they're all behind all this.

2238
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:48,120
They're showing off to their people.

2239
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,120
Keep going.

2240
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,120
Yeah.

2241
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:53,680
So Mike seems so confused by why they would include something about a power outage in

2242
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,860
this document about a medical situation.

2243
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,800
But if he'd actually read it, he shouldn't be confused.

2244
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,640
It's literally spelled out in the exercise.

2245
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:05,900
This is very clearly to get participants to consider how to be effective in getting messaging

2246
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:08,700
out in a real non-digital world.

2247
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,440
From the scenario, quote, state and local public health officials scrambled to hand

2248
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:17,560
deliver flyers printed and copied at local emergency operation centers using backup generators

2249
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:21,440
to explain vaccine prioritization and POD information.

2250
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,600
This extremely time-consuming effort exhausted the public health workforce already stretched

2251
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,640
thin by the epidemic response and several years of budget cuts.

2252
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,760
But it was ultimately successful.

2253
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:35,800
Early vaccination rates in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho were very similar to other states

2254
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,060
and in some cases above average.

2255
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:43,320
In spite of this success, the incident underscored the shortcomings associated with relying solely

2256
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,280
on electronic communication strategies.

2257
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,280
That what I just read to you is immediately after the part he was reading.

2258
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,400
Yeah, it makes it very clear.

2259
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,120
Almost impossible to misunderstand.

2260
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,120
Yes.

2261
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,760
There's no way to believe that he took two weeks to read this and couldn't understand

2262
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,040
what the point was.

2263
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:02,680
This is either someone who's deeply disturbed and needs help, needs like mental help, or

2264
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,900
he's a willful liar.

2265
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,800
And I'm more inclined to believe it's the latter.

2266
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:15,080
Yeah, I mean, this is not a generous interpretation, but the idea of these people reading a document

2267
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:19,600
that tells them what it says absolutely does confuse them.

2268
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,080
Like on a deep level.

2269
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,080
Yeah, yeah.

2270
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,760
Because they can't just be like, oh, like that's not a thing they can do.

2271
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:31,400
They can't read an explanation of what's happening and go, oh, well they're being honest with

2272
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,400
me.

2273
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,400
I understand that.

2274
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,400
You know?

2275
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,400
I understand that dynamic.

2276
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:41,400
Now, if they weren't copy and pasting various parts of the document in order to create a

2277
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:46,540
misrepresentation of what it says, if they weren't pretending that side effects and animals

2278
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:51,960
were actually humans, like if they weren't doing stuff like that, then maybe I would

2279
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,520
be like, oh, this is just suspiciousness run amuck.

2280
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,120
But there is work that's been done in order to misrepresent this document.

2281
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,360
Not two weeks' worth, but there has been work done.

2282
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,360
No.

2283
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:15,120
Now, Jordan, Rob, do he's about to have his mind blown, man.

2284
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,120
This doc.

2285
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,120
Okay.

2286
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,120
Okay.

2287
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,120
It's crazy.

2288
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,120
Let's go to the next one.

2289
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:25,240
You look at the similarity to the names, spars, COVID, and then we have SARS COVID two.

2290
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,240
Okay.

2291
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,240
Same.

2292
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:28,240
Almost same exact name.

2293
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,880
And they wrote this three or four years before they added a number and they, and they, and

2294
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,640
they just added a P, they added a P and a V.

2295
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,640
Exactly.

2296
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,640
It's really crazy.

2297
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,820
Where's the V?

2298
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:45,200
It's almost like scientists aren't interested too much in different naming conventions when

2299
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,760
it comes to viruses.

2300
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,840
And instead it's almost a classification.

2301
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,840
Yeah.

2302
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,840
Yeah.

2303
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,560
Spars, it means St. Paul acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which is similar to

2304
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,560
SARS COV-2.

2305
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,160
Yeah, sure.

2306
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:02,000
The reason that this is probably, it's named after the city that it popped up in.

2307
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,920
And the reason that it is that, and we've had this whole thing about not naming things

2308
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:12,480
after places is because that whole thing is a world health organization convention that

2309
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,200
you don't name something after the city or the location where it came up and the world

2310
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,560
health organization isn't involved in this exercise.

2311
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:24,160
Because that would give a massive incentive for people to be like, never fuck with those

2312
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,160
people ever again.

2313
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,160
Don't go to St. Paul.

2314
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,160
Exactly.

2315
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:30,860
Plus this was in 2017, which is fairly shortly after the world health organization changed

2316
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:33,000
its best practices about that whole thing.

2317
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,280
So there may have been some lingering confusion about naming conventions.

2318
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,280
Sure.

2319
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,280
I almost guarantee that if the world health organization had made this scenario, it probably

2320
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:46,600
would have named the condition SARS COV-2 and like Rob Dew would have a heart attack.

2321
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,800
Yeah, no, he would shit.

2322
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:48,800
Yeah.

2323
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,800
He would just shit.

2324
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:50,800
Yeah.

2325
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,800
Fuck it.

2326
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,800
I might shit.

2327
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:53,800
Yeah.

2328
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,800
It is not weird.

2329
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:55,800
No.

2330
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,800
At all.

2331
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,800
No.

2332
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:58,800
It's a convention.

2333
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,800
It's a naming convention.

2334
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,040
It's a fucking taxonomy, you know?

2335
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,160
It's like kingdom phylum, you know, it's yeah.

2336
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:09,520
In terms of like a conspiracy theory, this is the one that rises to the level of, eh,

2337
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,520
eh, eh.

2338
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,520
How about that?

2339
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,160
Their names are, yeah.

2340
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,160
That's how they name stuff.

2341
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,160
Yep.

2342
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,400
There's another connection with the real world though.

2343
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,760
Do they want them to name viruses like they do hurricanes?

2344
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,840
Like this is virus Maria.

2345
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,800
Is that what they would feel better about?

2346
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,800
Maybe.

2347
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,800
Well.

2348
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,040
Let's flip another thing in this, uh, this next clip that, uh, that it is kind of similar

2349
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,320
to real world.

2350
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,920
Then we have the inflated fatality estimates.

2351
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:39,840
Initially they write in the scenario, CDC fatality rate, almost 5%, who fatality rate

2352
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,640
14 and a half percent.

2353
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:44,800
And then the fatality rate of over 64 is 50%.

2354
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,120
This is fair.

2355
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:51,080
The inflated death estimates are in the scenario, but they're there for a few reasons.

2356
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:54,520
The first is that the scenario is supposed to depict reality and the reality of dealing

2357
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:58,560
with a completely new disease is that sometimes you get some things off.

2358
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,920
One of the main reasons is actually spelled out in the document.

2359
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:05,040
If you read it quote at the outset of the sparse outbreak, physician's understanding

2360
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:10,360
of the disease stem primarily from extremely severe cases resulting in pneumonia or hypoxia.

2361
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:14,660
There required hospitalization and extensive medical treatment, mild cases of the disease,

2362
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:18,880
which produced symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, and malaise were often perceived

2363
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:24,040
as the flu by people who had them and consequently often went untreated and undiagnosed by medical

2364
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,040
personnel.

2365
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,800
As a result, early case fatality estimates were inflated.

2366
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:32,160
This is a real dynamic that we've seen play out in the COVID-19 outbreak, but it's been

2367
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,640
true in other past outbreaks as well.

2368
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:37,960
The issue is that you can't always assume that it's going to be the case or else you're

2369
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:42,120
putting yourself in a position to get blindsided by a super deadly condition that you happen

2370
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,160
to underestimate.

2371
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:48,280
It's far better to be over cautious with new diseases than to just let them go and see

2372
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,280
what happens.

2373
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:54,680
Again, this is what we talked about, diseases have killed almost all of us.

2374
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,680
Yeah, be careful.

2375
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,680
We should be crazy.

2376
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,680
Be careful with that.

2377
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2378
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:02,560
So the other reason that this is in the document is because it's made as an exercise for medical

2379
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,680
communicators.

2380
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:08,240
And what could be a greater communication challenge than having been wrong initially?

2381
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:12,360
The study question for this section is quote, how can health authorities best meet public

2382
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:16,920
demands for critical information such as what is the health threat and what do I know about

2383
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:20,960
it when the crisis is still unfolding and not all the facts are known?

2384
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,420
If you understand this in the context it was written and used, all of the things that they're

2385
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:28,360
trying to create paranoia about just sound fucking stupid.

2386
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,360
Yeah.

2387
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,360
It's awesome.

2388
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,360
Yeah.

2389
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,360
It is awesome.

2390
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:36,400
Dude, this next thing that they try and make like a conspiracy out of, holy shit, these

2391
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,400
guys are dumb.

2392
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,400
All right, sell me on it.

2393
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,020
Let's go to the antivirals is the next slide.

2394
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:46,200
In this scenario, they have one called Calosovir, all right?

2395
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:49,880
Teens in an IR, side effects, nausea, headaches, vomiting, and body aches.

2396
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:54,080
There's actually a viral video of a boy in this scenario taking the Colosovir and then

2397
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,840
immediately projectile vomiting everywhere.

2398
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,840
Yeah.

2399
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:57,840
They even have videos of their scenario.

2400
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,840
It's crazy.

2401
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,480
And then, and they go back to it, then three years later, it's Remdesivir.

2402
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,680
And this is not the real name.

2403
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,820
This is the name they gave it later.

2404
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:09,800
It's actually got a different name that they, that it's, that it's made from.

2405
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,040
And remember they said Remdesivir was this new experimental thing they just developed.

2406
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,040
Exactly.

2407
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,040
But they had the damn name three years before.

2408
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,040
Same side effects.

2409
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,040
Nausea, constipation, vomiting.

2410
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,040
They only changed a few letters.

2411
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,040
It's all about rubbing in their faces.

2412
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,040
It is.

2413
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,040
They really do.

2414
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,200
This is smoking gun.

2415
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:28,040
If these dudes cared at all, they could learn why these drugs have similar names.

2416
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,600
They could learn so much.

2417
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,600
Yeah.

2418
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,640
These are generic names for the drug, which is to say they're not brand names.

2419
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:34,640
Right.

2420
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,640
The convention for naming generic drugs is to have the suffix of the word indicate what

2421
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,720
the drug is.

2422
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:43,680
For instance, antiviral drugs generally end in the suffix V-I-R for viral.

2423
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:48,080
This isn't universal, but most of them end up with this, uh, this, and that's why these

2424
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,080
two do.

2425
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,080
Sure.

2426
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,440
You know, you can go down the list of antiviral, and then also like penicillin derived drugs

2427
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,280
have cillin, like a box of cillin.

2428
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,280
Right, right, right, right.

2429
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,280
It's how drugs are named.

2430
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,280
It's very simple.

2431
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:04,080
It's, and it's done that way on purpose to be simple so people don't have to, yeah, no.

2432
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,440
The people making the scenario were striving to fill it with realistic details, so they

2433
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,360
followed accepted conventions for naming the drug they made up in it.

2434
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:16,800
Alex and Rob Dew are so stupid and so addicted to thinking coincidences mean something, that

2435
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,400
they take that as a sign that the document is mocking them.

2436
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,400
This is nuts.

2437
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,400
Yeah.

2438
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:30,280
It's, it's like just such a, just don't talk and just scream repeatedly, I refuse to learn

2439
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,280
anything!

2440
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:32,280
Yeah, it's outrageous.

2441
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,840
Oh, they both end in I-O.

2442
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,160
I refuse!

2443
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,320
I refuse to read the first page of Google!

2444
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,320
No!

2445
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,920
They just changed a few letters.

2446
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:47,040
You could type any of these questions into Google and the first result would tell you

2447
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,040
what.

2448
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,680
Yeah, it's really easy to understand these things.

2449
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,680
It's so easy.

2450
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:54,880
So this, this clip is just where everything turns to parody.

2451
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,200
Rob is in the middle of complaining about like medical ads and stuff.

2452
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,200
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

2453
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,780
Yeah, and then, and then you have the native ads, which are put out by the vaccine companies

2454
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:04,800
saying the vaccine is safe and effective.

2455
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,800
And that's all they do.

2456
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:12,280
Vitamin Mineral Fusion is a remarkable product and it's back in stock 40% off at infowarsstor.com

2457
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,280
right now.

2458
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,280
Don't.

2459
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,280
Don't do that to me.

2460
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,280
It's almost like whoever edited this did that as a joke.

2461
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:19,280
Did it on purpose, yeah.

2462
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,280
That's, that's just too much.

2463
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,320
He's complaining about like medical ads.

2464
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,320
That is too much.

2465
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,800
And then in the middle of it.

2466
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,900
It's safe, they, these people, all they do is put out these ads that say things are safe

2467
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:29,900
and effective.

2468
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:34,360
Anyways, let's go to a commercial of Alex saying that his stuff is safe and effective.

2469
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,360
Oh wow.

2470
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:42,440
So yeah, they, they've, they've gone, gone a while now and Alex realizes.

2471
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,440
We did it.

2472
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,040
We, we, we have not done it.

2473
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,040
Oh no.

2474
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:47,040
We're all humans.

2475
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,240
We're all people that care about freedom.

2476
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:50,240
I get upset.

2477
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:51,240
Rob gets upset.

2478
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:55,020
As we spend weeks studying this, we finally get on air and it's just, it's so upsetting.

2479
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:57,800
We've covered 10% of what's in front of us.

2480
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,400
Every bit of this is just as insane or more insane.

2481
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,160
I haven't even gotten to the part where they admit they're doing this to kill you and get,

2482
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,160
and save the earth.

2483
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:06,000
I mean, they admit they're doing this.

2484
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,480
That part is not, not in the document.

2485
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,480
They specifically say they're not doing this.

2486
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:18,160
Although that would introduce a very interesting medical messaging challenge.

2487
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:23,720
That would be an interesting medical, okay, let's say in this scenario, our secret plan

2488
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:33,040
has gotten out and gotten into the hands of the least reliable and credulous person.

2489
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,360
Now what do we do?

2490
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,480
You can have, what do we do?

2491
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:37,480
Let it go?

2492
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,480
I guess.

2493
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,480
Yeah.

2494
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,680
Hit the panic button.

2495
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:45,440
So yeah, I, I, this is, this is where I checked out.

2496
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,360
Yeah, that's a good place to check out.

2497
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:48,640
Well, no, this next clip.

2498
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,640
Oh, okay.

2499
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,640
Okay.

2500
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:56,600
I should have checked out whenever Weird Mike was doing that stuff about the cut and

2501
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:57,600
paste job that he did.

2502
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,600
Naturally.

2503
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,640
That's when you have like, all right, your credibility's out the window, I got to get

2504
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,640
out of here.

2505
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:02,640
Gone.

2506
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:03,640
That's what I'm talking about.

2507
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:04,640
This show is about giving too many chances.

2508
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,640
Okay.

2509
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:08,000
Um, and here's where I was like, Alex, go fuck yourself.

2510
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,840
Spend a few minutes just in summation of, of the bombshells that have been released

2511
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,840
here.

2512
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:19,120
I mean, to me, the strongest thing is the drug name's the same before a drug even exists.

2513
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:21,560
The virus name the same before they release it.

2514
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,560
Them running the lab.

2515
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:27,560
I mean, this is smoking gun one in 85 trillion quadrillion.

2516
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,560
Wow.

2517
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:34,560
So the, the, the thing that, that is so convincing for Alex is that there's similarities in the

2518
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:43,000
name of Spars Cove and SARS-CoV-2 and the, uh, the name of two antiviral drugs end in

2519
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
the same suffix.

2520
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
This is nothing.

2521
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Yep.

2522
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
This is outrageous.

2523
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,120
Alex started promoting this on Thursday and this is the best he can do on Sunday or on

2524
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,120
Saturday.

2525
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,120
Wow.

2526
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,120
It's, it's offensive to my professionalism.

2527
01:44:56,120 --> 01:45:03,080
What blew me away was that naming conventions can be used in a fictitious scenario also.

2528
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,080
Yeah.

2529
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,720
I never would have imagined that these people would have done something so insane as to

2530
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:16,440
stick to basic borderline universally standardized naming conventions.

2531
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:21,600
I'd listened to over an hour of this Saturday thing that they were doing and then Alex said

2532
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:22,600
that.

2533
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:28,240
And then Abdu brought up, oh, also, uh, they use some of the same hashtags and fake tweets

2534
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:30,480
that they have on there that people used in real life.

2535
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,720
I said, I gotta go.

2536
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,720
Nope.

2537
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:33,720
Nope.

2538
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,720
Don't care.

2539
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,720
Nope.

2540
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:36,720
Throwing things.

2541
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,720
No.

2542
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,720
Immediate throwing of things.

2543
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,720
That means nothing.

2544
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:40,720
Immediate throwing of things.

2545
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:41,720
Yeah.

2546
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:46,660
So anyway, I got really excited because, um, you know, I think after our last present day

2547
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:49,200
episode I was, I was in the doldrums.

2548
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,200
I felt bad.

2549
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,200
Sure.

2550
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,200
Sure.

2551
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,800
It was a very weird, uh, defense of Matt Gaetz.

2552
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,160
And this was a promise of a primary source.

2553
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,320
And, and no, no, I mean, that's what we found eventually.

2554
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,320
Yeah, of course.

2555
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:05,440
But, but Jordan, I mean like we were, you know, we talked over the weekend and I was

2556
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:10,320
telling you, like, I really think that, you know, I, we've got to stay in the present

2557
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,320
for Sunday.

2558
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:14,880
I think Alex is probably going to have some, uh, some, something.

2559
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:15,880
Yeah.

2560
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,880
He's going to have something.

2561
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,980
I thought for sure this Matt Gaetz thing would continue.

2562
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:24,920
Because Matt Gaetz has had more information come out, it looks worse and worse.

2563
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:30,240
I thought that Alex would either have to double down and triple down or he'd have to cut bait.

2564
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,340
I didn't know what he was going to do.

2565
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:37,080
And so I was like, well, I think in the interest of keeping people up to date on the, the goings

2566
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:44,920
on of this, this, and then I dig in and here we are, we got, we got a new lockstep document.

2567
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:50,200
And it's nice because, you know, I think, I think sometimes one of the things I enjoy the most

2568
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:56,320
about doing this show is the opportunity to understand something like this document that's

2569
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,880
called, it causes such fear for people.

2570
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,880
Yeah.

2571
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:07,000
Like to be able to, to see this, uh, Freddy Krueger on paper and understand it for what

2572
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:12,120
it is and understand like some of the very interesting lessons that actually could have

2573
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,560
been learned and, and, and, you know, that, that people are doing these, these kinds of

2574
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,840
exercises that they probably did pay dividends.

2575
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:26,080
Like we probably didn't see enough of the lessons learned, but on a, on a granular level

2576
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,920
in terms of some people being able to better deal with the challenges that came up over

2577
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:34,880
the course of this, this pandemic, this probably helped a lot.

2578
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,880
Right.

2579
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,880
Yeah.

2580
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,880
And I appreciate that.

2581
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,880
I like getting that glimpse.

2582
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,880
Yeah.

2583
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,800
It was a little bit like if, uh, Jamie Lee Curtis was running away from Michael Myers

2584
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,800
the whole time.

2585
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:50,480
And then at the end it was like, lady, I've been trying to deliver you this letter from

2586
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,480
15 years ago.

2587
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:52,480
You've been served.

2588
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:53,480
I've been hanging onto it.

2589
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,480
Yeah.

2590
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:59,040
That whole thing of just like, this was a complete waste of time for everyone involved.

2591
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,040
Why are we here?

2592
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:06,600
I honestly enjoy having my time wasted like this far more than I enjoy most of present

2593
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,900
day Alex Jones though.

2594
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:11,600
At least you're having fun running away from Michael Myers, you know, you're not just sitting

2595
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,760
at your home being like, this is a waste of time.

2596
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,760
I'm getting a jog in.

2597
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,760
Yeah, exactly.

2598
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,040
I'm getting some calories burning.

2599
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:19,040
Yeah.

2600
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,040
I'm getting that cardio.

2601
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,040
Yeah.

2602
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,040
It's good stuff.

2603
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,040
So thank you, Alex.

2604
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:26,720
I don't look forward to him constantly bringing up this document.

2605
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:27,720
Nope.

2606
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,720
Nope.

2607
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:29,720
Uh, cause it's a big old zero.

2608
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:30,720
Yeah.

2609
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:33,480
Uh, but you know, Hey, whenever these things happen, it's often good for us to spend time

2610
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:36,120
looking at it before it gets too out of control.

2611
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,120
Too boring.

2612
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,120
Yeah.

2613
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:40,720
Cause I think, I think that this is something that definitely could have, could stand to

2614
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:44,800
have traction in other communities or conspiracy spaces.

2615
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,800
Possible.

2616
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:46,800
Yeah.

2617
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,800
Hopefully Tucker covers it.

2618
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:48,800
Yeah.

2619
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,800
That'd be funny.

2620
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:50,800
That would be funny.

2621
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,800
Oh boy.

2622
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,800
Anyway, we'll be back Jordan.

2623
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:55,800
Will we?

2624
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,800
Yeah, we will.

2625
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:57,800
But then we have a website.

2626
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,800
We do have a website.

2627
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,800
It's knowledgefight.com.

2628
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:00,800
You bet.

2629
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,800
We're also on Twitter.

2630
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:02,800
We are on Twitter.

2631
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,800
It's at knowledgefight.com.

2632
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:04,800
Go to bed Jordan.

2633
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,420
We're also on the fake social media app from the scenario unequal.

2634
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:07,420
We are on unequal.

2635
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:12,440
And if you'd like to tell us an equal, and if you could please find a local charity or

2636
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:16,120
bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now, we'll be back.

2637
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:17,120
But until then I'm Neo.

2638
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,120
I'm Leo.

2639
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,120
I'm DZX Clark.

2640
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:20,120
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2641
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,160
So what do you think about them apples?

2642
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,160
Andy in Kansas.

2643
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,160
You're on the air.

2644
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,160
Thanks for holding.

2645
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,160
Hello Alex.

2646
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,160
I'm a first time caller.

2647
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:28,160
I'm a huge fan.

2648
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,160
I love your work.

2649
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:36,680
I love you.
