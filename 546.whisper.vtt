00:00.000 --> 00:12.880
N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.320
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.320
Knowledgefight.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.240
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.240
I love you.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
I'm going to get you.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
Knowledgefight.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.240
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.240
I need money.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.240
Andy and Kansas.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
Andy and Kansas.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
Stop it.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.240
Andy and Kansas.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.240
Andy and Kansas.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.240
It's time to pray.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.240
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.240
Thanks for holding us.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.240
Hello Alex, I'm a fifth-time caller, I'm a huge fan.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.240
I love your work.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.240
Knowledgefight.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
Knowledgefight.com.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.240
I love you.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.520
in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.840
Hello, Alex, I'm a big fan color, I'm a huge fan.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.080
I love your work.

00:53.080 --> 00:57.080
Knowledge Fight, knowledgefight.com.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.440
I love you.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.160
I'm Jordan.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.240
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around,

01:03.240 --> 01:04.800
drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit

01:04.800 --> 01:06.120
about Alex Jones.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.520
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.520 --> 01:08.360
Indeed.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.200
Dan?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.020
Yes, sir.

01:10.020 --> 01:10.860
Quick question.

01:10.860 --> 01:11.700
Jordan.

01:11.700 --> 01:12.520
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.520 --> 01:13.360
My bright spot today, Jordan, I had a realization

01:13.360 --> 01:15.840
that I've been listening to a fair amount

01:15.840 --> 01:17.960
of some podcasts for entertainment.

01:17.960 --> 01:18.800
Sure.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.240
Decompressing that high stress week or so,

01:22.240 --> 01:24.200
and I realized that one of the things

01:24.200 --> 01:26.000
that I really gravitate towards,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.200
there's a through line through a lot of them,

01:28.200 --> 01:29.540
and that is Matt Gourley.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.280
Matt Gourley's great.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.340
I think he adds so much to a podcast.

01:35.340 --> 01:36.180
He's great.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.360
And his vibe is so gentle and friendly.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
Underrated.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.600
As a counterweight to my listening

01:42.600 --> 01:44.380
to Alex Jones all the time,

01:44.380 --> 01:46.360
it really feels like that's like a balm

01:46.360 --> 01:49.820
that I can, Matt Gourley's a balm I can put on my hand.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.240
Matt Gourley's a classic glue guy, you know?

01:52.240 --> 01:53.640
He's like a Phil Hartman.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.960
He's got that Dave Foley kind of like

01:55.960 --> 01:57.580
straight man energy to him,

01:57.580 --> 01:59.440
but he's also incredibly hilarious.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.280
Very sharp.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.360
Really, really funny.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.580
And also I want to try and exploit my platform

02:03.580 --> 02:05.160
to now be like, if we're big enough.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.960
Hey, Matt Gourley, get over here.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.760
Come on, Matt Gourley, come on now.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.320
Hit a player up, Matt Gourley.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.560
I like it, I like it.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.400
Let's see if that works.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.560
Let's abuse our privileges.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.680
Yes, let's see.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.360
Jordan, how about you?

02:19.360 --> 02:23.760
Dan, I have the rare double Blight Spot.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.600
Double Blight Spot.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.920
No, the inverse of Double Blight Spot.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.160
The Double Blight Spot.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.360
That's a follow up to two Bright Spots.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.200
Yeah.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.080
This is unprecedented.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.800
First, we're going to go in chronological order.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.380
If you will recall, Dan, a while back,

02:38.380 --> 02:40.000
I told you about a pear that I ate.

02:40.000 --> 02:40.840
Sure.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.680
It was a delicious pear.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.280
Oh, I got some pears for you in the other room, by the way.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.400
Of course, I'm going to enjoy those.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.880
But my partner's moms both decided

02:48.880 --> 02:51.960
that we got to do something for this.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.720
So they ordered me a pear.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.480
Wait, they realized they had to do something about you?

02:55.480 --> 02:58.420
They had to do something about this pear thing.

02:58.420 --> 03:01.600
They were inspired into action.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.200
So they ordered me a pear from a place that has great pears.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.020
Sure.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.040
To the point where I can't eat it.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.080
It looks too much like the pear.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.400
It's like a platonic pear.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.220
Yeah, it's like a platonic pear, where you're like,

03:15.220 --> 03:16.920
I don't know what to do with this pear.

03:16.920 --> 03:17.560
I'm going to eat it.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.320
It's going to be amazing.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.200
Yeah, of course you're going to eat it.

03:19.200 --> 03:19.820
You got to.

03:19.820 --> 03:24.120
And then you'll recall that I said something about how

03:24.120 --> 03:25.360
my brain was functioning.

03:25.360 --> 03:25.860
Yeah.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.560
And Black Dragon Queen Christy sent me

03:28.560 --> 03:30.720
an incredibly kind card.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.760
Artistic pear?

03:31.760 --> 03:34.440
Yeah, well, I wish it was a pear, always.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.600
All things should be pears.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.400
But she really touched me.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.120
And it was very kind of her.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.080
That is great.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.120
Double bright spot.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.160
Hey, things are looking real bright.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.200
And I actually got to say, I may have another bright spot.

03:46.200 --> 03:46.720
Oh, no.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.560
And if you're going with two, I'm going to give another one.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.720
We're going to do a quadruple bright spot?

03:50.720 --> 03:51.320
I may.

03:51.320 --> 03:56.560
And that is that I really got into today's episode.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.040
You did.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.440
You know, it's an Easter miracle.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.880
I found something.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.040
I was not expecting Alex to be at all kind of like, oh,

04:05.040 --> 04:06.000
I can talk about this.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.760
This is interesting.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.520
So you would say that Alex has risen.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.360
He's risen indeed.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.400
He's risen indeed.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.880
He's risen indeed.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.760
And we will get down to business on all that.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.400
But before we do, Jordan, let's take a little moment

04:16.400 --> 04:18.000
to say thank you to some new wonks.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.400
Oh, that's not a bad idea at all.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.520
So first, Scroton the Strong, thank you so much.

04:21.520 --> 04:22.800
You are now a policy wonk.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.840
I'm a policy wonk.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.720
Thanks, Scroton.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.220
Thank you.

04:25.220 --> 04:26.720
Next, Melissa Kay, thank you so much.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.920
You are now a policy wonk.

04:27.920 --> 04:28.960
I'm a policy wonk.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.200
Thank you very much, Melissa.

04:30.200 --> 04:30.700
Thank you.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.360
Next, oh, man, I remember when I first

04:32.360 --> 04:34.960
realized that Missy was short for Melissa.

04:34.960 --> 04:35.960
It's a weird day.

04:35.960 --> 04:36.920
Anyway, sorry, Melissa.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.880
Next, Trek With Tyler, thank you so much.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.140
You are now policy wonk.

04:40.140 --> 04:41.280
I'm a policy wonk.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.440
Thank you very much, TWT.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.180
Next, Owen but not the Dumb One.

04:45.180 --> 04:45.920
Thank you so much.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.000
You are now a policy wonk.

04:47.000 --> 04:47.880
I'm a policy wonk.

04:47.880 --> 04:48.780
Thank you very much.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.340
There are a surprising number of competitions.

04:51.340 --> 04:51.840
Troyer.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.680
For Dumb Owen Tea, I was going to say.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.000
Next, Kathleen Y. Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.040
I'm a policy wonk.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.180
Thank you, Kathleen.

05:00.180 --> 05:00.680
Thank you.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.100
Next, pretty quick for a Canadian.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.960
Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.980
I'm a policy wonk.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.220
Thank you very much! Pretty quick.

05:07.220 --> 05:11.700
And we've got a couple of special things going on here over the weekend.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.200
Alright.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.780
We had a couple birthdays that I'd like to give a little shoutout to.

05:15.780 --> 05:21.300
It's our April birthday shoutout that we're gonna do probably three or four more times this one.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.980
First, Alexander reached out and wanted to wish Iris a happy birthday.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.340
Oh, a happy birthday, Iris.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.140
Happy birthday, Iris.

05:27.140 --> 05:27.700
Yeah, of course.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.380
Hope you have a good one, or had a good one, I guess,

05:29.380 --> 05:31.540
because since this is coming out probably after your birthday.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.540
Don't worry about it. Deal with it, Iris.

05:33.540 --> 05:36.180
Now, this next one's very special. It goes out to a cat.

05:36.180 --> 05:36.680
Okay.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.380
It was a birthday cat.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.340
Well, then we do birthday cats on command.

05:40.340 --> 05:40.840
Yes.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.860
On command!

05:41.860 --> 05:42.360
Yeah.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.140
No birthday months for cats.

05:43.140 --> 05:44.100
That's the loophole.

05:44.100 --> 05:44.980
Yeah, exactly.

05:44.980 --> 05:47.300
And this is a cat named Pleiades.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.580
Oh, well, shit!

05:48.580 --> 05:50.420
How do you not wish Pleiades the cat a happy birthday?

05:50.420 --> 05:55.700
I don't know, because the light from Pleiades takes several hundred thousand years to get to us.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.300
Well, it just got here.

05:57.300 --> 05:57.800
Oh, okay.

05:59.220 --> 06:00.020
Happy birthday.

06:00.020 --> 06:00.740
Nicely done.

06:00.740 --> 06:06.500
So, Jordan, today we're going to be going over April 1st through 3rd 2021 Blackjack.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.580
Ah! I never had a chance on that one.

06:08.580 --> 06:09.940
No, I really sped up.

06:09.940 --> 06:10.580
You were too good for that one.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.300
Through the home stretch.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.300
Um, so this is Thursday and Friday of last week,

06:15.300 --> 06:19.940
and then Saturday Alex fucked around and went into studio and recorded a special thing.

06:19.940 --> 06:20.820
Oh, sure, why not?

06:20.820 --> 06:24.660
And once we get going, you'll understand why I had to cover that Saturday thing.

06:24.660 --> 06:26.260
No, no, of course, of course.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.420
But first, here's an out of context drop from today's show.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.340
The devil ain't cool, man.

06:30.340 --> 06:34.260
He's not what gives you the hot cheerleaders and the partying and the fun.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.020
Oh. Hmm.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.620
Actually, I thought that was the...

06:37.620 --> 06:40.660
I thought that's what he specifically tried to tempt you with.

06:40.660 --> 06:41.940
Every depiction in media.

06:41.940 --> 06:45.380
I was gonna say, he's the one who gets you that stuff.

06:45.380 --> 06:50.260
God is the one who gets you eternal happiness by forgoing those specific things.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.700
Yep, that's always been my understanding.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.940
Every chick tract that I've ever seen.

06:53.940 --> 06:57.140
Almost entirely like, hey, that hot girl, you gotta avoid her.

06:57.140 --> 06:58.180
And the fun and the partying.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.220
It's terrifying.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.500
Don't do the fun and the partying.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.300
Jesus hates it.

07:01.300 --> 07:01.860
Yeah.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.700
So, my man.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.200
Yeah.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.340
I want to preface this really quick.

07:06.340 --> 07:06.740
Sure.

07:06.740 --> 07:07.860
I want to set this up.

07:07.860 --> 07:08.660
All right.

07:08.660 --> 07:17.060
This April 1st episode, if it was an April Fool's episode, I would admire the hell out of it.

07:17.060 --> 07:21.220
Because there's a number of things that go on that you could interpret as being like,

07:21.220 --> 07:22.500
yeah, he's fucking around.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.780
Sure, but it's not.

07:23.780 --> 07:26.580
Like this, this could be an April Fool's gag.

07:26.580 --> 07:31.780
And I've been doing a lot of studying the last few weeks on a particular subject that

07:31.780 --> 07:35.940
Rob Doob brought to my attention and that the rest of the crew kept basically pestering

07:35.940 --> 07:36.420
me about.

07:36.980 --> 07:40.100
And I finally, last night and today, read it.

07:41.380 --> 07:45.780
And it is the smoking gun of smoking guns of smoking guns.

07:45.780 --> 07:46.660
This is green eggs and ham.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.580
And I'm the type of guy that always gets on air.

07:48.580 --> 07:53.220
And I tell you, next hour, I'm going to cover this big story.

07:53.220 --> 07:55.620
And then I'll start telling you what the big story is right away.

07:55.620 --> 07:56.020
Right.

07:56.020 --> 07:57.540
The tactic and media, as I say, coming up.

07:57.540 --> 07:58.580
So you keep listening.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.300
I don't do that.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.460
I'm bad at my job.

08:02.500 --> 08:10.180
If you just put out the big news and don't have some fanfare, like a 20th Century Fox

08:10.180 --> 08:14.820
intro, which is not how it goes.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.380
A rip off of old British newsreels.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.460
People don't care.

08:19.460 --> 08:23.220
And it just becomes part of the background ambient noise.

08:23.220 --> 08:28.020
And they actually get conditioned to the tyranny.

08:28.020 --> 08:29.460
You actually become a tool of evil.

08:32.340 --> 08:37.060
You know, I almost just go off air for a month and just shut info wars down.

08:37.060 --> 08:40.900
And then if I came back and covered this, we might be able to save the planet.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.340
I hate you so much.

08:42.340 --> 08:43.220
You see what I mean?

08:43.220 --> 08:43.940
April Fools.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.140
I hate you so much.

08:46.980 --> 08:50.020
That should have ended with, should I be saying any of this?

08:50.020 --> 08:50.980
Perhaps not.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.900
I have the gun, the smoking gun to end all smoking guns and...

08:55.620 --> 08:57.300
See you in a month, assholes!

08:57.300 --> 08:58.420
Yeah, I'm gonna disappear for a while.

08:58.420 --> 08:59.620
This is your fault.

08:59.620 --> 09:01.220
You don't get this smoking gun.

09:01.220 --> 09:03.380
So that's an interesting idea for Alex.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.660
The idea of disappearing like he's Sting going to the rafters.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.460
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

09:07.460 --> 09:10.180
Not fighting for WCW or NWO.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.860
If you love something, let it go.

09:12.740 --> 09:15.540
I do like the idea of Alex coming back with just face paint.

09:15.540 --> 09:16.420
Crow face paint.

09:16.420 --> 09:21.620
A brooding Alex Jones.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.380
I'm Bruce Lee's grandson.

09:23.380 --> 09:28.740
So he doesn't disappear for a month, but he does do what I would say is the next best thing.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.340
What have I told you?

09:31.220 --> 09:35.860
I have the document from John Hopkins where they plan the whole attack,

09:35.860 --> 09:42.020
plan the SARS attack, planned the Ebola attack, planned the COVID-19 attack,

09:42.020 --> 09:46.820
and then have a plan through vaccines to brain damage you and give you Alzheimer's

09:46.820 --> 09:47.940
and sterilize you.

09:47.940 --> 09:50.260
And then how they're even going to blame the politicians

09:51.380 --> 09:54.100
and how they even set up President Trump to do it.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.860
I would be interested in that.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.820
Imagine having that smoking gun.

10:00.100 --> 10:00.980
I'm imagining it.

10:01.940 --> 10:02.580
In your hand.

10:04.580 --> 10:05.220
Mail it to me.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.060
Word for word, admitting the whole thing.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.900
And then you'd ask, why would they write such a thing?

10:08.900 --> 10:09.700
Well, I know why.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.660
I can explain it.

10:10.660 --> 10:11.700
But you know what?

10:11.700 --> 10:12.740
I'm not going to cover it.

10:16.500 --> 10:21.780
I'm going to put together graphics and I'm going to put all the different pieces together.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.980
And I'm going to come in here Saturday and I'm going to tape for one hour at noon.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.460
Make sure it's all perfect.

10:27.460 --> 10:27.780
Yeah.

10:27.780 --> 10:30.580
And then at 2 p.m. central, we should have it ready.

10:30.580 --> 10:38.260
We will stream it back to back hour after hour until I go live Sunday on Easter at 4 p.m.

10:38.260 --> 10:41.860
Central Standard Time, as I always do on Sundays.

10:41.860 --> 10:42.500
What a dick.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.100
That's amazing.

10:44.660 --> 10:48.580
I've got smoking gun proof, but I'm not going to talk about it.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.700
Not until Sunday.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.740
That's some Dom sub shit.

10:52.740 --> 10:53.860
I can't handle that.

10:53.860 --> 10:56.260
I'm not into this type of relationship, dude.

10:56.260 --> 10:57.060
I'm sorry.

10:57.060 --> 10:57.460
Yeah.

10:57.460 --> 11:02.580
I mean, unfortunately for me, I was like, wow, that is ridiculous.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.340
You can come on Saturday.

11:04.340 --> 11:04.820
No!

11:04.820 --> 11:05.380
That kind of...

11:05.380 --> 11:06.180
Disagree.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.900
That kind of presentation is ridiculous.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.900
If you're listening in the audience, you have to ask yourself, why?

11:14.340 --> 11:16.100
What kind of real person would do this?

11:16.100 --> 11:20.900
What possible news organization would be like, we have proof of everything that is going

11:20.900 --> 11:22.340
on and they're trying to kill everybody.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.860
We're going to wait two days to reveal it to you.

11:25.860 --> 11:26.660
You know what?

11:26.660 --> 11:31.060
And news organizations do wait with information that they're not 100...

11:31.060 --> 11:32.740
They don't tease it like this, though.

11:32.740 --> 11:37.700
But they don't go... the New York Times doesn't have like a, hey man, we got some bombshell

11:37.700 --> 11:38.340
shit.

11:38.340 --> 11:39.700
We're going to see it in a couple weeks.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.060
We're working on something that will...

11:41.060 --> 11:42.340
This will change the game.

11:42.340 --> 11:42.900
No.

11:42.900 --> 11:43.540
No, no, no, no.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.340
Dumb.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.300
Absolutely not.

11:45.300 --> 11:50.260
So the document that Alex is talking about is a 2017 scenario exercise called the SPARS

11:50.260 --> 11:56.020
pandemic 2025 to 2028, a futuristic scenario for public health risk communicators.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.940
Oh, that sounds like the smoking gun.

11:57.940 --> 12:02.260
This document is essentially very similar in structure to the Rockefeller one Alex erroneously

12:02.260 --> 12:07.060
calls Operation Lockstep in that the Johns Hopkins exercise began with the selection

12:07.060 --> 12:11.300
of two important variables that could dictate what challenges could arise in a possible

12:11.300 --> 12:11.700
future.

12:12.260 --> 12:14.900
Is Alex real or is Alex not real?

12:14.900 --> 12:20.100
In this exercise, the two variables were quote, varying degrees of access to information technology

12:20.100 --> 12:24.500
and quote, varying levels of fragmentation among social, political, religious, ideological

12:24.500 --> 12:25.460
and cultural lines.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.540
Whereas the Rockefeller document explored all four of the possible futures that were

12:29.540 --> 12:35.300
based on the variables they chose, this document focuses instead on just the one that the preparers

12:35.300 --> 12:38.660
thought would present the most challenge in terms of medical communication.

12:38.660 --> 12:42.900
Okay, so there are more positive simulations that could happen.

12:42.900 --> 12:47.300
With those two variables creating a matrix of four scenarios.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.700
But this paper is entirely about the worst possible scenario.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.740
Maybe not the worst possible scenario because they don't lay out what the other ones are,

12:54.740 --> 12:56.100
so I don't really know what they are.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.700
It's a real bummer of a scenario.

12:57.700 --> 13:02.260
Well, it's a scenario that is for an exercise for medical communicators.

13:02.260 --> 13:02.580
Okay.

13:02.580 --> 13:06.900
And so the one that would raise the most challenges, or they decided would raise the most interesting

13:06.900 --> 13:07.540
challenges.

13:07.540 --> 13:07.940
Perfect.

13:07.940 --> 13:09.060
Is the one that they used.

13:09.060 --> 13:09.380
Excellent.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.900
Sorry, I just wanted a clarification.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.740
That's an important clarification.

13:12.740 --> 13:16.980
This was the possible future that they called the echo chamber, which represented a scenario

13:16.980 --> 13:22.100
where there was widespread access to information technology and quote, isolated and highly

13:22.100 --> 13:23.300
fragmented communities.

13:23.300 --> 13:28.260
Reading over this document, it's really fascinating how there are a number of similarities between

13:28.260 --> 13:31.540
the real world and the scenario that was laid out in this exercise.

13:31.540 --> 13:37.300
The real world novel coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2, whereas the scenario illness is

13:37.300 --> 13:38.660
called SPARS-CoV.

13:38.660 --> 13:43.140
Ultimately, these similarities are all things that make sense, given that the possible future

13:43.140 --> 13:47.140
was laid out by public health experts who would be trying to make as realistic a scenario

13:47.140 --> 13:51.540
as possible so participants could best explore the communication challenges that could arise

13:51.540 --> 13:56.020
in the event of a public health emergency in a world where everyone was online and large

13:56.020 --> 13:59.620
segments of the population lived in a slightly different reality from each other.

13:59.620 --> 13:59.860
Yeah.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.100
One of the problems that we keep running into with these scenarios, like this document and

14:04.100 --> 14:07.940
the Rockefeller one, are that they're well written and engaging.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.620
They contain a ton of details that flesh out the world they're trying to depict and as

14:11.620 --> 14:14.420
such seem like more of a prediction than they intend to be.

14:15.060 --> 14:19.780
This Johns Hopkins scenario relies on a template laid out by J. Ogilvy and Peter Schwartz in

14:19.780 --> 14:24.980
their 2004 paper titled Plotting Your Scenarios, published by the Global Business Network.

14:25.540 --> 14:29.380
In this paper, Ogilvy and Schwartz try to help businesses and organizations understand

14:29.380 --> 14:34.260
how to best structure a scenario-based exercise in order to maximize its impact in terms of

14:34.260 --> 14:38.740
the participants being able to learn about how to deal with new circumstances and manage

14:38.740 --> 14:39.380
change.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.380
Okay, so these guys are dungeon masters.

14:41.380 --> 14:41.620
Yes.

14:42.420 --> 14:43.380
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.580
Yeah, that's what these guys do.

14:44.580 --> 14:48.660
The strategy of using a scenario matrix is explained in this paper.

14:48.660 --> 14:52.980
This is what both the Johns Hopkins and Rockefeller exercises used, where the planners come up

14:52.980 --> 14:56.580
with a big list of key factors they think could affect the possible futures they want

14:56.580 --> 15:00.660
to explore, then that list is whittled down to two central factors.

15:00.660 --> 15:05.540
These factors are plotted on a matrix, which could go in one of two directions, and that

15:05.540 --> 15:10.580
creates four distinct combinations of factors, each representing a scenario that can be explored.

15:10.580 --> 15:11.140
Right.

15:11.140 --> 15:15.700
An example that's given in this paper is about looking at possible futures for education,

15:15.700 --> 15:21.300
where they choose to use hierarchy versus participation and inclusion versus exclusion

15:21.300 --> 15:24.660
as the two main axes that were the most relevant to their exploration.

15:25.220 --> 15:29.060
This created four scenarios, hierarchical and inclusive,

15:29.060 --> 15:34.980
hierarchical and exclusive, participatory and inclusive, and participatory and exclusive.

15:35.620 --> 15:39.860
Each of these possible realities looks vastly different from the others, so it's not too

15:39.860 --> 15:45.060
hard to jump from there to scenario building and creating evocative narratives that characterize

15:45.060 --> 15:49.780
each of these so participants can more easily relate to the challenges that each possible

15:49.780 --> 15:50.980
future would present.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.020
Totally, of course.

15:52.020 --> 15:56.180
That's exactly what Ogilvy and Schwartz discuss in their introduction to this paper.

15:57.220 --> 16:00.980
To be an effective planning tool, scenarios should be written in the form of absorbing,

16:00.980 --> 16:05.540
convincing stories that describe a broad range of alternative futures relevant to an organization's

16:05.540 --> 16:06.020
success.

16:06.660 --> 16:11.460
Thoughtfully constructed, believable plots help managers to become deeply involved in

16:11.460 --> 16:16.260
the scenarios and perhaps gain new understanding of how their organization can manage change

16:16.260 --> 16:18.500
as a result of this experience.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.420
The more involved managers get with scenarios, the more likely it becomes that they will

16:22.420 --> 16:26.020
recognize their important but less obvious implications.

16:26.020 --> 16:29.540
Moreover, scenarios with engrossing plots can be swiftly communicated throughout the

16:29.540 --> 16:35.220
organization and will be more easily remembered by decision makers at all levels of management.

16:35.220 --> 16:39.700
And if the CDC rolls an 18 or higher, then we defeat the pandemic.

16:39.700 --> 16:40.660
Saving throw.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.420
That makes perfect sense to me.

16:42.420 --> 16:47.380
Ogilvy and Schwartz are business consultants, and this technique, using scenario-based exercises,

16:47.380 --> 16:52.020
is a very common one among organizations that want to explore how prepared they are to face

16:52.020 --> 16:55.780
potential challenges that could come up expectedly or unexpectedly.

16:55.780 --> 16:56.580
Yeah, war games.

16:56.580 --> 17:00.580
Yeah, these scenarios work better if they're written as compelling and engrossing stories,

17:00.580 --> 17:04.820
and as we've learned, Alex has an incredibly hard time differentiating between reality

17:04.820 --> 17:05.460
and fiction.

17:05.460 --> 17:05.860
Yeah.

17:05.860 --> 17:10.900
To compound the problem, these guys, they recommend that people, quote, invent catchy

17:10.900 --> 17:15.780
names for the scenarios, saying, quote, when your managers feel the hot breath of crisis,

17:15.780 --> 17:18.820
they should be able to recall the appropriate scenario by name.

17:18.820 --> 17:24.260
Dan, if you recall, I have suggested to scientists that they need to rename things better.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.100
Now, here's the problem, though.

17:26.100 --> 17:30.820
I have also suggested they go outside of scientists for naming.

17:30.820 --> 17:35.460
Yeah, but then Alex also talks about how, like, THX 1138 or whatever is-

17:35.460 --> 17:36.020
Sure.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.220
That's not a catchy name.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.860
But I mean, we could come up with some catchier names.

17:40.980 --> 17:41.700
What's this one called?

17:42.260 --> 17:43.940
Well, this one is called the echo chamber.

17:43.940 --> 17:44.660
The echo chamber.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.220
Yeah.

17:45.220 --> 17:47.780
Okay, I'll call it the shitty room.

17:47.780 --> 17:48.980
Okay, all right.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.500
You won't forget the shitty room.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.300
No, that's true.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.100
That might work.

17:52.100 --> 17:52.980
That might work.

17:52.980 --> 17:57.380
So this technique, though, creating these names that you remember, it's a good strategy

17:57.380 --> 18:02.420
for scenario-based planning, but the flip side, like you have pointed out, is that these

18:02.420 --> 18:04.740
names could be exploited very easily.

18:04.740 --> 18:05.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.540
Lockstep is a perfect example of that.

18:07.540 --> 18:12.340
It's just a catchy scenario name, which is apparently so catchy that Alex has built a

18:12.340 --> 18:13.460
gigantic conspiracy around it.

18:13.460 --> 18:13.860
See?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.260
Now I rename it Bummertown.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.020
One, you remember it.

18:18.020 --> 18:23.060
Two, nobody's like, oh, they're using Bummertown to defeat the globalists.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.020
It's a classic Bummertown.

18:24.580 --> 18:28.020
Yeah, this is the Bummertown scenario all over again.

18:28.020 --> 18:32.180
Anyway, the bottom line here is that this document is none of the things Alex claims

18:32.180 --> 18:35.140
that it is, and it doesn't prove any of the shit he's pretending it does.

18:35.140 --> 18:39.620
Also, it's 89 pages long, so there's no way, I believe, for a second that Alex has read

18:39.620 --> 18:39.700
it.

18:39.700 --> 18:40.820
Absolutely not.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.020
He talks a little bit more about it here, although he said he was going to wait until

18:44.020 --> 18:44.420
Saturday.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.260
Of course he did.

18:46.260 --> 18:50.100
He actually doesn't talk much about it, because I think he actually hasn't read it at all.

18:50.100 --> 18:50.740
Right, right, right, right.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.660
He's just got no clue.

18:52.660 --> 18:53.060
No.

18:53.060 --> 18:53.540
No, okay.

18:54.340 --> 18:59.060
Basically, anyone taking these vaccines, they're all designed to the same thing, is going to

18:59.060 --> 19:03.700
have neurological disorders within one year, most of the people taking the vaccine will

19:03.700 --> 19:06.580
be dead within 10, and this John Hopkins says it all right here.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.100
That is not in the Hopkins report.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.580
That would be a very strange thing for Johns Hopkins to release.

19:12.580 --> 19:17.140
Yeah, the scenario is written from the standpoint of someone who lives in 2030, so there's not

19:17.140 --> 19:21.380
even 10 years depicted in the exercise since the outbreak begins in 2025.

19:21.380 --> 19:22.100
Sure, sure.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.460
Alex is just making shit up because he knows no one's going to read it, and he's got all

19:25.460 --> 19:27.380
the elements there that he needs to lie about.

19:27.380 --> 19:30.420
It's 89 pages, it's got the name.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.300
Yeah, you're golden.

19:31.300 --> 19:31.700
Yep.

19:31.700 --> 19:32.580
Just riff.

19:32.580 --> 19:37.780
So every now and again I like to point out when Alex makes it abundantly clear that he

19:37.780 --> 19:42.180
thinks that he's fighting literal demons, because everyone needs to keep that in the

19:42.180 --> 19:42.660
front of their mind.

19:42.660 --> 19:47.140
It's really nice to recall that this man thinks he's fighting the devil.

19:47.140 --> 19:47.460
Right.

19:47.460 --> 19:48.980
You know who authored this report?

19:48.980 --> 19:52.820
It wasn't the Center for Public Health at Johns Hopkins.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.500
It was Lucifer the Morningstar.

19:54.500 --> 19:54.900
You bet.

19:54.900 --> 19:55.540
Yeah, okay.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.540
He's a master of public health, actually.

19:57.540 --> 19:58.340
Got a degree.

19:58.340 --> 19:59.300
Honorary.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.020
Well.

20:00.020 --> 20:04.420
Obviously this is not a human intelligence running this, and I just go back to that over

20:04.420 --> 20:04.980
and over again.

20:04.980 --> 20:10.660
I tell top generals that, top former head of intelligence agencies, senators, you name

20:10.660 --> 20:15.940
it, at secret meetings, and they nod their head and agree with me, because everybody

20:15.940 --> 20:16.340
knows.

20:18.180 --> 20:18.660
Everybody knows.

20:18.660 --> 20:21.620
I'm talking about fake low res of flying saucers here.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.100
I'm talking about interdimensional entities.

20:24.100 --> 20:24.580
Sure.

20:24.580 --> 20:26.180
Hell-bent to destroy us.

20:26.180 --> 20:26.820
Naturally.

20:26.820 --> 20:31.540
And they are influencing humans on Earth to do this, and this is not a human plan.

20:31.540 --> 20:34.900
It is a satanic fallen angel operation.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.540
Sounds right.

20:35.540 --> 20:41.300
I honestly might have more respect for low res pictures of UFOs.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.860
I'd definitely rather talk to that guy than Alex.

20:43.860 --> 20:52.260
Yeah, I would say that I am more convinced by the Loch Ness Monster photo than I am by

20:52.260 --> 20:57.140
why interdimensional beings are controlling the plan that's not even happening.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.460
Yeah, yep.

20:59.460 --> 20:59.780
Yeah.

20:59.780 --> 21:03.940
So Alex lies a little bit more about this Hopkins report, which again, he's not going

21:03.940 --> 21:04.420
to talk about until Saturday.

21:04.420 --> 21:05.220
No, of course not.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.860
Hell on Earth is going to be released.

21:07.860 --> 21:10.260
The total collapse is being engineered.

21:10.260 --> 21:13.700
I mean, giant John Hopkins plans that are operational.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.020
John Hopkins runs the whole thing.

21:16.020 --> 21:19.060
Hee hee hee, I'm John Hopkins.

21:19.060 --> 21:29.300
All spelled out says here, just like I surmise by 2030, you did not surmise the population

21:29.300 --> 21:31.140
is dead or living dead.

21:31.140 --> 21:33.140
Totally brain damage, totally gone.

21:33.140 --> 21:36.100
And then we're going to have to, we won't be able to take care of people.

21:36.100 --> 21:41.140
Then the good people to survive will have to join the globalist in exterminating who's

21:41.140 --> 21:43.380
left because things will be so out of control.

21:43.380 --> 21:43.700
Whoa.

21:45.140 --> 21:46.180
Alex is making that up.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.060
Yeah, no.

21:47.060 --> 21:47.700
Big no.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.740
Big pass on that one.

21:48.740 --> 21:53.940
Yeah, so here's kind of the passage that I guess most closely resembles what he's talking

21:53.940 --> 21:54.340
about.

21:54.340 --> 21:54.900
Okay.

21:54.900 --> 21:58.740
Quote, while the federal government appeared to have appropriately addressed concerns about

21:58.740 --> 22:01.060
the acute side effects of Corovax.

22:01.060 --> 22:01.780
That's the vaccine that comes up.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.180
The vaccine for scars.

22:04.180 --> 22:04.740
SPARS.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.740
Scars Guard Cove 9.

22:06.740 --> 22:10.420
The long-term chronic effects of the vaccine were still largely unknown.

22:10.420 --> 22:14.900
Nearing the end of 2027, reports of new neurological symptoms began to emerge.

22:14.900 --> 22:18.660
After showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year, several vaccine recipients

22:18.660 --> 22:22.740
slowly began to experience symptoms such as blurry vision, headaches, and numbness in

22:22.740 --> 22:23.940
their extremities.

22:23.940 --> 22:27.700
Due to the small number of these cases, the significance of their association with Corovax

22:27.700 --> 22:29.060
was never determined.

22:29.060 --> 22:33.780
As of this writing in 2030, longitudinal studies initiated by the NIH at the beginning of the

22:33.780 --> 22:37.380
vaccination program have not reached the next round of data collection.

22:37.380 --> 22:40.820
So formal analysis of these symptoms has not yet been conducted.

22:40.820 --> 22:44.500
Furthermore, these cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.500
Those in high-risk populations, including those with underlying health conditions, making

22:48.500 --> 22:52.500
it increasingly difficult to determine the extent to which these symptoms are associated

22:52.500 --> 22:53.540
with vaccination.

22:53.540 --> 22:53.860
Yeah.

22:53.860 --> 22:58.340
See, that's good dungeon mastering, but I would expect Alex would have added a little

22:58.340 --> 22:58.340
more fire.

22:58.340 --> 22:58.820
They're all dead.

22:58.820 --> 22:59.540
We're all dead.

22:59.540 --> 22:59.780
Yeah.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.860
Just like, they're coming.

23:01.860 --> 23:07.300
Those of us who haven't been vaccinated will be forced to kill the rest of everybody.

23:07.300 --> 23:07.780
Totally.

23:07.780 --> 23:09.620
You need a little bit of flair there.

23:09.620 --> 23:10.580
That's all I'm saying.

23:10.580 --> 23:14.580
The imagined scenario involves a small number of possible unforeseen side effects from a

23:14.580 --> 23:16.820
vaccine that's just deployed to fight the pandemic.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.060
And Alex has turned that into the clip that we just heard.

23:19.060 --> 23:19.380
Sure.

23:19.380 --> 23:23.300
He's claiming that John Hopkins is saying that by 2030, everyone will be dead or walking

23:23.300 --> 23:23.620
dead.

23:23.620 --> 23:24.500
That's a leap.

23:24.500 --> 23:28.500
It's a complete fiction that he's just created out of thin air from his imagination.

23:28.500 --> 23:32.580
The story that he's telling literally has no connection to the primary source that he's

23:32.580 --> 23:33.380
pretending to cover.

23:33.380 --> 23:33.780
That sounds correct.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.260
But I can't wait until we get to Saturday.

23:36.260 --> 23:39.780
They had days, and it's one of the most incompetent displays that I've ever seen.

23:39.780 --> 23:43.940
There's no way that you heard, I'm going to get to this Saturday, and weren't like,

23:43.940 --> 23:46.340
well, we're going to handle this Saturday.

23:46.340 --> 23:48.100
That's when I'm like, all right.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.220
All right, we'll see you then.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.220
All right, I'm going to stretch.

23:51.220 --> 23:52.820
Yeah, exactly.

23:52.820 --> 23:56.580
You crack your knuckles a little bit, you do a little, all right, here we go.

23:56.580 --> 24:02.500
And I got to say, I don't know who he's got for this Saturday show.

24:03.780 --> 24:06.100
It's him, Rob Dew, and some dude named Mike.

24:06.100 --> 24:09.860
I don't know who this Mike dude is, but he is a weirdo.

24:09.860 --> 24:10.980
Okay, all right.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.340
He is a sleepy weirdo.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.700
All right, we're going to bring Mike into this.

24:13.700 --> 24:14.580
Holy shit.

24:14.580 --> 24:14.900
Okay.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.220
Not to be believed, this guy.

24:17.220 --> 24:17.780
Okay, all right.

24:17.780 --> 24:20.420
So anyway, Alex is fighting Satan.

24:20.420 --> 24:20.980
Sure.

24:20.980 --> 24:22.980
And maybe he just wants to quit.

24:23.940 --> 24:24.740
That's fair.

24:25.460 --> 24:28.980
Satan's got infinite resources and is it a million years old or whatever?

24:28.980 --> 24:31.460
I don't think Satan's interested in an information war.

24:31.460 --> 24:32.180
That's probably true.

24:32.180 --> 24:37.300
Yeah, it's time for the information war against heaven.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.660
Did you know what you missed?

24:38.660 --> 24:43.540
In the 40 days and 40 nights that Satan tempted Jesus in the desert, most of what they talked

24:43.540 --> 24:44.420
about was Alex.

24:44.420 --> 24:45.060
Well, when...

24:46.580 --> 24:49.540
Dude, do you know what we're going to eventually have to deal with?

24:49.540 --> 24:51.060
You have no fucking clue.

24:51.060 --> 24:57.460
When Satan got all the angels turned against God or whatever, it really was information

24:57.460 --> 24:57.860
warfare.

24:57.860 --> 25:02.500
Yeah, it was. I mean, it's like you had to first convince them that their freedom was

25:02.500 --> 25:04.660
stolen by an infinite creator.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.100
It was mostly about vaccines.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.060
Yeah, pretty much.

25:07.060 --> 25:10.100
Anyway, Alex is fighting against Satan.

25:10.100 --> 25:17.540
And we have now entered the operational shutdown of the planet as we know it.

25:17.540 --> 25:22.660
And the decision has been made to overwrite every genetic system on the earth.

25:22.660 --> 25:31.700
And the earth is to be completely sacrificed in the attempt to become God.

25:33.380 --> 25:33.780
Sure.

25:33.780 --> 25:37.940
In fact, their main mission, they say, is to destroy the earth.

25:38.660 --> 25:47.220
And then only out of that metamorphosis can this new creature emerge.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.740
That's what they've been told.

25:48.740 --> 25:53.540
It is their universal code.

25:53.540 --> 25:54.580
It is their ethos.

25:54.580 --> 25:55.540
It is their religion.

26:00.260 --> 26:01.300
And they've signed on to it.

26:02.980 --> 26:06.020
And they've rebelled against God that made us.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.900
And so I really don't even know if I can keep doing the show.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.180
And I'm not kidding.

26:14.180 --> 26:18.660
I think I'm going to have to just hand this over to somebody else.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.580
This stuff's too big to even talk about on there.

26:21.220 --> 26:23.460
If people don't know about this now, they're not going to figure it out.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.380
I just need to get ready with my family.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.740
I can't believe this, man.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.060
Almighty, it's so horrible.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.100
That didn't seem sincere.

26:32.100 --> 26:37.220
Oh, I had a dream about the space baby from 2001 Space Odyssey.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.380
And I just don't know if I can do this anymore.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.540
It's just too big for me.

26:41.540 --> 26:42.420
Oh, no.

26:42.420 --> 26:43.140
So terrible.

26:43.140 --> 26:45.060
The time baby is out there.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.940
It's going to grow into a thing.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.420
This is just big stuff, though, man.

26:50.420 --> 26:51.060
Sure.

26:51.060 --> 26:55.620
The globalists are trying to give birth to Satan to walk on the Earth.

26:55.620 --> 26:56.180
Right.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.860
This is too big.

26:57.860 --> 26:59.620
No, I mean, that's a real bummer.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.340
I kind of understand wanting to go to the woods.

27:02.340 --> 27:04.820
But then again, in the best of times, I want to go to the woods.

27:04.820 --> 27:05.540
That's true.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.100
That's true.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.620
Maybe I'm not the person to talk about this.

27:07.620 --> 27:08.500
I don't know.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.180
Wouldn't the woods be a bad place?

27:10.180 --> 27:11.940
Because Satan's all about the fire.

27:11.940 --> 27:12.740
He does love fire.

27:12.740 --> 27:13.220
Yeah.

27:13.220 --> 27:14.820
You want more like a blacktop.

27:15.540 --> 27:15.940
Sure.

27:15.940 --> 27:17.620
Go move into a parking lot.

27:17.620 --> 27:18.260
Desert.

27:18.260 --> 27:18.740
Yeah.

27:18.740 --> 27:19.940
A desert would be great.

27:19.940 --> 27:24.180
And then whenever he burns it all, you've got glass to make really great windows.

27:24.180 --> 27:25.060
This could be a good plan.

27:25.060 --> 27:25.940
This is a plan.

27:25.940 --> 27:26.180
Yeah.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.740
We're going to make it through this apocalypse, Dan.

27:28.740 --> 27:32.180
So anyway, back to lying about this document that he's not going to cover until Saturday.

27:32.180 --> 27:32.740
Okay.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.180
And they all know it's bull.

27:34.180 --> 27:37.060
It's just every part of it is a lie.

27:37.780 --> 27:39.220
And you're wearing a death shroud.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.660
You're wearing this diaper.

27:40.660 --> 27:44.340
And they even admit in the John Hopkins report that it gets an added bonus.

27:44.340 --> 27:49.780
The bacterial pneumonia of the mask wearers is going to really increase their death toll.

27:49.780 --> 27:53.700
The word mask does not appear once in the John Hopkins document.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.220
That sounds right.

27:55.220 --> 27:55.700
Yeah.

27:55.700 --> 27:59.220
In the scenario, bacterial pneumonia is a condition that appears to be connected to the

27:59.220 --> 28:01.060
invented virus spars.

28:01.060 --> 28:04.740
But Alex is completely making up everything he's saying here about this document.

28:04.740 --> 28:05.140
Wow.

28:05.140 --> 28:05.860
Pretty great.

28:05.860 --> 28:07.140
That's lovely.

28:07.140 --> 28:12.020
I do like whenever you can toss in something that isn't even mentioned obliquely.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.380
That's always good stuff.

28:13.380 --> 28:14.100
Pretty solid.

28:14.100 --> 28:14.500
Yeah.

28:14.500 --> 28:20.980
So as someone who's fighting the devil, Alex has covered himself in the armor of God.

28:20.980 --> 28:21.300
Sure.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.700
And that means talking about the Bible.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.340
Naturally.

28:24.340 --> 28:25.140
And...

28:25.140 --> 28:25.860
Gotta get into it.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.460
And it's also Good Friday, right?

28:28.020 --> 28:29.140
No, this is Thursday.

28:29.140 --> 28:29.620
Oh, okay.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.660
It's Maundy Thursday.

28:30.660 --> 28:31.220
Apologies.

28:31.220 --> 28:31.380
Right?

28:31.380 --> 28:32.180
Isn't that what it is?

28:32.180 --> 28:32.900
No idea.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.260
I can't remember what the...

28:35.380 --> 28:36.660
There's Good Friday.

28:36.660 --> 28:37.140
Right.

28:37.140 --> 28:38.260
Palm Thursday.

28:38.260 --> 28:39.140
Palm Saturday.

28:39.140 --> 28:40.260
Palm Wednesday.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.140
Ash Wednesday.

28:41.140 --> 28:42.020
Ash Wednesday.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.300
But that's way different.

28:44.420 --> 28:45.140
Don't worry about it.

28:45.140 --> 28:45.380
We're doing great.

28:45.380 --> 28:46.340
I don't know the week.

28:46.340 --> 28:46.900
We're doing great.

28:46.900 --> 28:47.460
I'd forgotten.

28:47.460 --> 28:47.860
Yeah.

28:47.860 --> 28:51.780
Anyway, Alex also has forgotten some things about revelation.

28:52.580 --> 28:56.660
If you believe the Bible, no flesh would be spared unless God intervened.

28:56.660 --> 28:58.100
No flesh would have been spared.

29:00.180 --> 29:00.680
None.

29:01.380 --> 29:01.880
Sure.

29:01.880 --> 29:06.520
And it says the rich men will sit under the mountains in their

29:06.520 --> 29:12.280
fortresses under the mountains, beating themselves in the head.

29:14.760 --> 29:19.720
So angry that they serve Satan and begging God to forgive them.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.800
So like Trump, right?

29:21.800 --> 29:23.400
And at that point they've come into the ultimate sin.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.520
There will be no Holy Ghost.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.400
There will be no forgiveness.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.160
You have now chosen your side.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.360
Yeah, like Trump, right?

29:28.360 --> 29:28.860
Wow.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.580
Wow. That's just a chance.

29:36.860 --> 29:37.580
Weird.

29:37.580 --> 29:37.980
Wow.

29:37.980 --> 29:40.460
That's an intense thought, but it's also a delicious thought.

29:42.140 --> 29:42.780
So weird.

29:44.940 --> 29:47.900
So if the Bible did, in fact, say that rich people would live

29:47.900 --> 29:50.540
under mountains, that kind of does sound like Alex's whole

29:50.540 --> 29:53.180
thing about the elite globalists having underground bases.

29:53.180 --> 29:54.300
Isn't he rich?

29:54.300 --> 29:55.020
Yeah.

29:55.020 --> 29:57.820
Unfortunately, Alex is leaving out a very critical part of

29:57.820 --> 29:59.820
the verse that he's poorly referencing.

29:59.820 --> 30:02.860
This is from Revelation 6, verse 15.

30:02.860 --> 30:06.060
Quote, then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals,

30:06.060 --> 30:09.500
the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free,

30:09.500 --> 30:11.660
hidden caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.580
Oh, so everybody hidden caves.

30:13.580 --> 30:15.020
It wasn't just the rich people.

30:15.020 --> 30:17.740
No, it was a whole plethora of folk.

30:17.740 --> 30:18.140
Yep.

30:18.140 --> 30:18.460
Gotcha.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.380
It's pretty much everyone trying to hide from the opening

30:20.380 --> 30:20.780
of the sixth seal.

30:20.780 --> 30:22.140
So it's pretty much everyone.

30:22.140 --> 30:22.380
Yep.

30:22.380 --> 30:22.780
Gotcha.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.180
Anyway, much like Alex just writes fan fiction about the

30:25.180 --> 30:27.980
nefarious documents he covers as news, he does the same thing

30:27.980 --> 30:30.860
with the Bible, even like religious texts.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.020
Everything is just a prop for him to use.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.140
It really seems like that should be way more important.

30:36.140 --> 30:38.860
You know, you want to know it word by word, really.

30:38.860 --> 30:39.180
Yeah.

30:39.980 --> 30:42.060
If you were fighting the devil, that is.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.540
It's even like that would be your best weapon against the

30:44.540 --> 30:46.460
devil is knowledge of the Bible.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.020
Sure.

30:47.020 --> 30:50.620
I've seen that in various Chuck Norris movies.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.700
Yes, indeed we have.

30:54.700 --> 30:57.500
So Roger is coming in again.

30:57.500 --> 30:58.220
Great, great.

30:58.220 --> 30:59.740
Which we saw on our last episode.

30:59.740 --> 31:01.020
Yeah, it's time to pray.

31:01.020 --> 31:02.380
It's interesting, though.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.540
I got really weirded out by this.

31:05.100 --> 31:08.780
Roger Stone has talked a lot about trying to draft Flynn to

31:08.780 --> 31:11.500
get him ready to lead a national movement to run for

31:11.500 --> 31:13.740
president or to support Trump for running for president.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.820
But regardless, instead of overthinking it, I agree with

31:15.820 --> 31:17.660
him, Flynn's got to launch it now.

31:19.180 --> 31:21.820
And I'm going to leave it at that.

31:21.820 --> 31:25.340
And obviously I've been talking to Flynn, and I just need

31:25.340 --> 31:28.220
to we need to draft him here on this show.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.820
We can't wait for Trump.

31:29.820 --> 31:31.740
We can't wait for DeSantis.

31:32.780 --> 31:35.260
We need General Flynn, who is a good man and a patriot

31:35.260 --> 31:36.460
understand what's going on.

31:36.460 --> 31:37.740
We need him to do this.

31:37.740 --> 31:39.420
So Roger is at a dental appointment.

31:39.420 --> 31:40.220
He's a little bit late.

31:40.220 --> 31:42.380
He'll be popping in sometime next hour.

31:42.380 --> 31:48.300
So on our last episode, the conversation was about trying

31:48.300 --> 31:50.060
to draft Flynn or Gates.

31:50.060 --> 31:55.180
Sure, sure, Gates might not be around for much longer.

31:55.180 --> 31:58.220
We've gone a day, and Alex is just pretending that that

31:58.220 --> 32:00.540
wasn't the whole conversation that they had.

32:00.540 --> 32:01.500
Never happened.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.100
No, we never defended that guy.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.220
He's a real criminal.

32:04.220 --> 32:08.220
Now, I mean, not to his credit, but Roger is still like,

32:08.220 --> 32:08.860
he's innocent.

32:08.860 --> 32:09.740
He's being set up.

32:09.740 --> 32:11.660
Yeah, that sounds like a good Roger move.

32:11.660 --> 32:12.860
Boy, has it deflated.

32:13.500 --> 32:17.980
It is not like they spent over an hour on the last episode

32:17.980 --> 32:21.180
incriminating themselves in order to defend the Gates.

32:21.180 --> 32:22.380
Look, he just likes to party.

32:23.340 --> 32:27.900
Hey, guys, we had a post debriefing on this one,

32:27.900 --> 32:31.100
and we decided you guys should not commit any crimes

32:31.100 --> 32:32.620
in the defense of someone.

32:32.620 --> 32:35.980
Hey, everybody out there in the Infowars land, shit got bad.

32:36.780 --> 32:39.020
Shit kept going the way it looked like it was going to go.

32:39.020 --> 32:40.620
And we should have seen it coming.

32:40.620 --> 32:41.740
Yep, yep.

32:41.740 --> 32:43.500
I can walk away from this at this point.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.140
Not hard.

32:44.140 --> 32:44.700
Gunna.

32:44.700 --> 32:45.260
Gunna bye.

32:45.260 --> 32:49.100
Yeah, so I listened to this next clip,

32:49.100 --> 32:51.660
and I kind of got the sense that, like, Roger is fucking

32:51.660 --> 32:53.820
with Alex a little bit, which I can kind of enjoy.

32:53.820 --> 32:54.540
Well, he just got back.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.980
Roger Stone has been trying for a week to send me a report,

32:58.780 --> 33:00.220
a secret report.

33:00.220 --> 33:01.340
It's not a classified report.

33:01.340 --> 33:02.380
It's a secret report.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.500
My email doesn't work.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.300
He can't send it to any of our emails.

33:04.300 --> 33:05.500
They're in his email blocking it.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.620
They're in our email.

33:06.620 --> 33:07.500
Oh, no, it really is.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.300
It's a total take over, folks.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.980
The full weight of the government works against the country

33:11.980 --> 33:13.260
to implode it and destroy it.

33:13.820 --> 33:14.540
All right.

33:14.540 --> 33:15.340
They're in his email.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.020
My email doesn't work.

33:17.020 --> 33:19.660
Roger can't send me emails, but he can't send me this secret

33:19.660 --> 33:20.300
document.

33:20.300 --> 33:23.500
I don't know why Outlook isn't working right now.

33:23.500 --> 33:28.540
Yeah, I think Occam's Razor tells me Roger is fucking

33:28.540 --> 33:29.180
with Alex.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.380
Yeah, that would make sense.

33:30.380 --> 33:33.020
So we get another headline here, and this is important.

33:33.020 --> 33:34.220
This is really important stuff.

33:35.420 --> 33:35.900
Breaking.

33:37.420 --> 33:37.900
That's right.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.820
The Alex Jones show there's a war on for your mind.

33:39.820 --> 33:41.900
High school to re-educate students.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.980
That's a quote who refused to wear COVID mask in Clearwater,

33:45.980 --> 33:46.540
Florida.

33:46.540 --> 33:49.820
Even a conservative city, conservative state.

33:49.820 --> 33:53.180
They're the leftist are teaching their critical radical

33:53.180 --> 33:53.900
race theory.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.020
Teaching America sucks.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.260
The high school in Clearwater, Florida, says it will re-educate

33:57.260 --> 33:59.100
students who do not wear a mask when required.

33:59.100 --> 33:59.660
Naturally.

33:59.660 --> 34:01.660
This is a story about Clearwater High School.

34:01.660 --> 34:03.900
And honestly, if I were involved, I would have just told

34:03.900 --> 34:05.820
them to use a different word than re-educate.

34:06.540 --> 34:07.980
That seems very easy.

34:07.980 --> 34:10.780
Yeah, it says, quote, students who do not wear a mask when

34:10.780 --> 34:13.980
it is required or refuse to do so should first be re-educated

34:13.980 --> 34:15.660
on the importance of wearing a mask.

34:15.660 --> 34:18.380
If after the re-education occurs, they do not comply, the

34:18.380 --> 34:20.620
student administrator should be contacted.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.340
The importance of wearing a mask should be reinforced.

34:23.340 --> 34:23.740
Yes.

34:23.740 --> 34:27.340
If not done so, if behavior has not changed, and then this

34:27.340 --> 34:29.260
whole thing goes away.

34:29.260 --> 34:31.420
The word re-education is something that means a lot of

34:31.420 --> 34:33.420
different things in different contexts.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.300
For Alex, the word means commies taking kids to camps and

34:36.300 --> 34:37.740
doing that thing from Clockwork Orange.

34:37.740 --> 34:38.220
Naturally.

34:38.220 --> 34:40.700
In this context, it's really clear that what they mean is

34:40.700 --> 34:43.020
that if a student is refusing to wear a mask, they should be

34:43.020 --> 34:45.820
given a chance to better understand why a mask is important

34:45.820 --> 34:48.620
in a schoolroom setting before any kind of disciplinary

34:48.620 --> 34:49.820
action is even considered.

34:49.820 --> 34:50.220
Right.

34:50.220 --> 34:52.940
This is essentially what it's basically saying like the

34:52.940 --> 34:53.900
kids get a warning.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.700
The right wing blogs that are covering the story use this

34:56.700 --> 34:59.660
quote, but seem to leave off what comes immediately after

34:59.660 --> 35:01.900
it in the school's plan for the new academic year.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.780
Oh, that's harder.

35:02.780 --> 35:05.420
Quote, not wearing a mask when it's required is not a

35:05.420 --> 35:08.620
disciplinary matter, but rather a health and safety concern.

35:08.620 --> 35:10.940
Administrators will contact the parent or guardian for

35:10.940 --> 35:11.660
support.

35:11.660 --> 35:14.460
If the refusal continues, the principal must contact the

35:14.460 --> 35:17.340
area superintendent to discuss options, which include

35:17.340 --> 35:19.740
administrative placement into one of the other learning

35:19.740 --> 35:20.460
options.

35:20.460 --> 35:22.860
This placement is a non-disciplinary placement and

35:22.860 --> 35:24.940
is based on the health and safety needs of all students

35:24.940 --> 35:25.420
and staff.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.540
So this same document literally says that students who refuse

35:28.540 --> 35:31.100
to wear masks won't get in trouble, and if it's something

35:31.100 --> 35:33.740
that can't be resolved, then accommodation will be made to

35:33.740 --> 35:36.220
allow them to continue to go to class remotely.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.540
That seems like going above and beyond to cater to people

35:38.540 --> 35:40.780
who refuse to wear masks in public gathering settings.

35:40.780 --> 35:41.340
Yeah.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.660
But of course they use the word reeducation, so this is

35:43.660 --> 35:46.060
somehow about critical race theory or something.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.100
Yeah, that sounds right.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.380
It's ridiculous.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.860
Their plan is really well thought out and kind of

35:50.860 --> 35:54.780
considerate and perhaps overly sensitive, you know, but it

35:54.780 --> 35:57.900
is better than my plan of if a kid decides not to wear a

35:57.900 --> 36:00.620
mask, you go to his house and scream in his parents face

36:00.620 --> 36:02.140
until they leave you alone forever.

36:02.140 --> 36:05.260
It's tougher to codify into a rule.

36:05.260 --> 36:08.220
It's better that I wouldn't use the word reeducation.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.260
Give less meat for Alex.

36:11.260 --> 36:11.740
There you go.

36:11.740 --> 36:12.380
Yeah.

36:12.380 --> 36:16.220
So Roger comes on after the dentist and, you know, like I

36:16.220 --> 36:18.380
said, they do not talk about Matt Gaetz much.

36:18.380 --> 36:18.620
Sure.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.220
It's much different than the day before.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.020
Unsurprising.

36:21.020 --> 36:23.660
The entire interview is about how Alex wants General Flynn

36:23.660 --> 36:25.980
to announce that he's running for president and Roger trying

36:25.980 --> 36:28.460
to explain to Alex that there's a game they need to play.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.420
Roger is saying that if they're going to do this, the first

36:31.420 --> 36:34.220
thing they need to do is gather massive amounts of data about

36:34.220 --> 36:36.700
the people who would support Flynn, and then they need to

36:36.700 --> 36:39.100
somehow get around all the social media bans that all these

36:39.100 --> 36:41.820
shitheads like Alex have that limit their reach.

36:41.820 --> 36:42.460
Right.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.860
It's a farce of an interview, and it seems pretty clear to

36:44.860 --> 36:46.940
me that there's going to be some attempt coming down the

36:46.940 --> 36:49.580
line to try to replace Trump with Flynn as the figurehead

36:49.580 --> 36:51.100
of the Infowars idol cult.

36:51.740 --> 36:54.620
Roger is trying to subtly implant the idea that Flynn is

36:54.620 --> 36:55.820
like Eisenhower.

36:55.820 --> 36:58.780
He's a military hero who the people need to coerce into

36:58.780 --> 37:01.340
running for office because it's his duty to the country.

37:02.060 --> 37:04.620
See, Roger seems to realize that the only thing that's going

37:04.620 --> 37:07.340
to work for someone like Flynn is a fully realized storyline

37:07.340 --> 37:09.980
to push as a campaign, and his character works with that

37:09.980 --> 37:12.620
kind of archetype, regardless of how disconnected from

37:12.620 --> 37:13.900
reality it is.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.900
It's the same thing they did with Trump, pretending that he

37:15.900 --> 37:18.140
was a successful businessman who had never had any interest

37:18.140 --> 37:20.460
in politics who won the presidency on his first try.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.340
When compared to reality, that's bullshit, but it's a

37:23.340 --> 37:25.740
compelling storyline for the base to enjoy.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.780
Flynn being a reluctant candidate would have a similar,

37:28.780 --> 37:31.420
you know, complete bullshit narrative thing if it were to

37:31.420 --> 37:33.340
get off the ground, but could be effective.

37:33.340 --> 37:38.140
I am wilded out by the idea that anyone would want anyone

37:38.140 --> 37:40.860
who had any command during the Iraq war.

37:41.820 --> 37:42.860
Oh, yeah, that's weird.

37:42.860 --> 37:46.460
Also somebody who pledged allegiance to QAnon.

37:46.460 --> 37:49.660
Yeah, shouldn't that be immediately disqualifying?

37:49.660 --> 37:52.780
Like, I don't even care what your politics are.

37:52.780 --> 37:55.500
You were involved with commanding in the Iraq war.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.860
You are already a failure before you even began.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.060
Yeah, you should maybe take a seat.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.340
You should go away.

38:01.340 --> 38:04.620
So Roger wants to build up to this subtly and softly,

38:04.620 --> 38:06.860
whereas Alex is a little bit less patient.

38:06.860 --> 38:09.260
They're just going back and forth about how Flynn needs to

38:09.260 --> 38:10.460
go on the attack immediately.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.740
That's what Alex is saying.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.940
And then Roger comes back with, who knows what will happen?

38:14.940 --> 38:16.860
And then finally, Alex has just had enough.

38:17.900 --> 38:18.540
Here's the deal.

38:18.540 --> 38:19.660
He's got to do it.

38:19.660 --> 38:20.300
He knows it.

38:20.940 --> 38:24.940
And the amount of money he can raise is staggering.

38:24.940 --> 38:26.780
And so he's going to run for president.

38:26.780 --> 38:28.460
I'm drafting him right now.

38:28.460 --> 38:29.980
And so are the American people.

38:29.980 --> 38:32.380
And as he does these quiet events to 10,000 people here,

38:32.380 --> 38:34.940
10,000 people there, 1,000 there, everybody that goes to

38:34.940 --> 38:37.580
these things he quietly has that are packed out need to

38:37.580 --> 38:38.540
tell him you're doing it.

38:38.540 --> 38:40.220
And I'm not being presumptive here.

38:40.220 --> 38:43.340
Listen, they want you and I in jail because they know we

38:43.340 --> 38:45.340
helped light the fire with Trump.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.340
They know that we're not afraid and they know we've got

38:47.340 --> 38:49.020
lightning in a bottle and they know that lightning does

38:49.020 --> 38:50.460
strike the same place repeatedly.

38:50.460 --> 38:53.100
That's how Will and Zeitgeist and.

38:53.100 --> 38:53.660
Wait, what?

38:53.660 --> 38:54.220
Yes.

38:54.220 --> 38:57.180
So obviously I could sell off of the sunset right now.

38:57.180 --> 38:59.260
The globalists are ready to buy me off like that.

38:59.260 --> 39:02.540
I could snap my fingers, $100 million, private jets,

39:02.540 --> 39:04.700
everything, but I'm not selling humanity out.

39:04.700 --> 39:05.900
So and he's not either.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.580
He just keeps overthinking it.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.260
He needs to listen to you.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.100
He needs to announce soon.

39:11.100 --> 39:15.260
Alex is sick of the bullshit and he wants a hero figure to

39:15.260 --> 39:18.620
get behind and it's the best thing out right now out of

39:18.620 --> 39:20.460
options for God King.

39:20.460 --> 39:24.940
It turns out without his inimitable platform, Trump's shit

39:24.940 --> 39:26.220
talking doesn't work.

39:26.220 --> 39:30.700
Yeah, I am not really all that good as the center focus.

39:30.700 --> 39:31.100
Exactly.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.140
Me, Alex Jones, not good as center focus.

39:34.140 --> 39:36.220
Need to be someone else's hype man.

39:36.220 --> 39:36.860
Totally.

39:36.860 --> 39:39.820
That person I'm hyping is absent now.

39:39.820 --> 39:40.620
Not gone.

39:40.620 --> 39:41.660
This does not work.

39:41.660 --> 39:43.660
I'm really flailing.

39:43.660 --> 39:45.900
I need a dad.

39:48.060 --> 39:50.060
You are 100% correct.

39:50.060 --> 39:52.140
Yeah, that is exactly what's going on.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.780
So this clip means nothing, but I just thought it was kind

39:54.780 --> 39:57.420
of interesting to hear Alex describe the plot of Romeo and

39:57.420 --> 39:57.980
Juliet.

39:58.780 --> 40:00.620
I think he gets some of the beats right.

40:00.620 --> 40:00.940
Okay.

40:01.580 --> 40:04.140
I'm really, really interested in this.

40:04.140 --> 40:04.860
I'm going to be honest.

40:04.860 --> 40:07.980
This is the first time in a while I've been like, I'm going

40:07.980 --> 40:09.260
to be on the edge of my seat.

40:09.260 --> 40:11.180
Alex's literature recap.

40:11.900 --> 40:17.340
Like reading a William Shakespeare play that you've already

40:17.340 --> 40:17.900
read before.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.860
You know, you turn the page and Romeo and Juliet meet, tell

40:20.860 --> 40:22.940
me you love and their parents are mean to them.

40:22.940 --> 40:23.820
They have their problems.

40:23.820 --> 40:25.660
And by the end, they commit suicide.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.100
You know, you know the play.

40:30.220 --> 40:30.700
All right.

40:33.100 --> 40:36.940
Well, I mean, he's not wrong.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.980
He's not wrong.

40:39.980 --> 40:45.180
It didn't exist as a venerated play for hundreds of years

40:45.180 --> 40:47.340
because of that plot synopsis.

40:47.340 --> 40:50.300
I mean, look, look, look, look, the skeleton is there.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.260
There's a thing.

40:51.260 --> 40:52.700
Their parents are mad at him.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.740
They kill themselves.

40:53.740 --> 40:55.180
And it's a great play.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.300
The parents are mean.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.820
You've read it before.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.860
It does not sound like you've read it before, sir.

41:00.860 --> 41:01.580
Oh, God.

41:01.580 --> 41:05.260
It sounds like you saw half of the Leonardo DiCaprio version

41:05.260 --> 41:06.620
and then woke up at the end.

41:06.620 --> 41:08.780
You're one of these literature major types, though.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.300
Like from where?

41:10.300 --> 41:11.580
I'm from the streets, right?

41:11.580 --> 41:12.060
Sure.

41:12.060 --> 41:12.620
Sure.

41:12.620 --> 41:13.100
No, no, no.

41:13.100 --> 41:13.580
I'm with you.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.100
For someone like me, I hear that.

41:15.100 --> 41:17.340
And I'm like, yeah, that is what Romeo and Juliet is about.

41:17.340 --> 41:18.220
Because it is.

41:18.220 --> 41:21.260
Yeah, but even if you're watching West Side Story,

41:21.260 --> 41:24.140
there's more to it than that.

41:24.140 --> 41:24.940
I disagree.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.300
OK, well, that's fair.

41:26.300 --> 41:26.860
That's fair.

41:28.060 --> 41:29.740
You could cut out a lot of those songs.

41:29.740 --> 41:33.500
A classic tale of people meeting,

41:33.500 --> 41:37.020
their families being mean, and then they kill themselves.

41:37.020 --> 41:40.060
I mean, you know, it does have an arc.

41:40.060 --> 41:40.540
Yeah.

41:40.540 --> 41:41.020
Yeah.

41:41.020 --> 41:43.740
So Alex cares about the theater, cares

41:43.740 --> 41:46.140
about classic literature.

41:46.140 --> 41:48.460
But what he doesn't care about, money.

41:48.460 --> 41:48.940
OK.

41:48.940 --> 41:50.940
And you know why I feel so upset?

41:50.940 --> 41:52.300
I've never cared about money.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.860
And back when I could have made a ton of money

41:54.860 --> 41:56.940
before we were censored, I would make enough money

41:56.940 --> 41:57.820
to fund the operation.

41:57.820 --> 41:59.340
And if I had extra money, I'd hire more people

41:59.340 --> 42:01.980
and expand because my mission was to beat the New World Order.

42:01.980 --> 42:03.260
I never cared about money.

42:05.660 --> 42:07.660
But now I can tell you going into the future,

42:07.660 --> 42:09.980
you'll be able to stave this off a little bit longer,

42:09.980 --> 42:11.660
but not longer if you do have money.

42:11.660 --> 42:15.020
I mean, this is a world civilization ending event

42:15.020 --> 42:17.820
coming up, and it's all right there.

42:17.820 --> 42:21.180
I mean, man, they are talking about everyone vaccinated

42:21.180 --> 42:23.420
is going to have Alzheimer's, including children,

42:24.140 --> 42:25.740
and society is going to collapse and they're

42:25.740 --> 42:27.260
going to have to have robots clean us all up

42:27.260 --> 42:28.060
off the streets.

42:28.060 --> 42:29.500
And I mean, I knew this was all coming.

42:29.500 --> 42:30.220
I already laid it out.

42:30.220 --> 42:33.340
But my God, this is scarier than my film Endgame.

42:33.340 --> 42:35.020
And they were going to be like, oh, well,

42:35.020 --> 42:37.900
this is scarier than my film Endgame, and they wrote

42:37.900 --> 42:38.620
the damn thing.

42:40.780 --> 42:41.820
Oh, God.

42:41.820 --> 42:43.420
Do they get royalties for that?

42:48.940 --> 42:50.780
I don't even know what to do at this point.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.460
Just please save us, God.

42:52.460 --> 42:54.300
God's like, yeah, well, stop killing all those babies.

42:55.420 --> 42:56.300
Weird God.

42:56.300 --> 42:56.940
Weird God.

42:56.940 --> 42:57.980
So just a quick fact check.

42:57.980 --> 43:00.300
There's literally nothing in the Johns Hopkins report

43:00.300 --> 43:02.780
about anything close to what Alex is making up here.

43:02.780 --> 43:05.580
The robots cleaning up dead body stuff is just from Soylent

43:05.580 --> 43:09.420
Green, and the word Alzheimer's doesn't even appear

43:09.420 --> 43:10.060
in the document.

43:10.060 --> 43:11.100
Now that makes perfect sense.

43:11.100 --> 43:13.580
The Johns Hopkins document is about public health

43:13.580 --> 43:15.660
communication challenges that could come up in the event

43:15.660 --> 43:17.180
of a disease outbreak.

43:17.180 --> 43:19.260
It's comically stupid for Alex to pretend there's

43:19.260 --> 43:21.180
a chapter on how everyone's going to be dead and robots

43:21.180 --> 43:22.380
will clean up our corpses.

43:22.380 --> 43:27.340
It'd be a really weird flourish for them to just be like,

43:27.340 --> 43:30.460
oh, and also the vaccine causes Alzheimer's even in children.

43:30.460 --> 43:32.700
Like, that's a clause.

43:32.700 --> 43:33.980
Also, Alex loves money.

43:33.980 --> 43:35.500
Yeah, so much.

43:35.500 --> 43:39.260
He should be swimming in a Scrooge McDuck style.

43:39.260 --> 43:39.900
Yeah, yeah.

43:39.900 --> 43:42.780
Also, at the end of the April 1st show, Alex interviews

43:42.780 --> 43:44.860
James O'Keefe about some footage he apparently got of

43:44.860 --> 43:46.780
immigrants living in poor conditions.

43:46.780 --> 43:49.260
This falls under the heading of a subject I care about,

43:49.260 --> 43:52.220
and it's a political issue that means quite a bit.

43:52.220 --> 43:54.220
It's something that people should be paying attention to,

43:54.220 --> 43:56.940
but I do not trust that the person delivering this message

43:56.940 --> 43:58.220
is acting in good faith.

43:58.220 --> 43:58.860
Oh, no.

43:58.860 --> 44:00.060
And I don't care.

44:00.060 --> 44:00.380
No.

44:00.380 --> 44:02.620
I've reserved the right to ignore anything James O'Keefe

44:02.620 --> 44:03.660
does, so fuck him.

44:03.660 --> 44:05.420
Let's move on to April 2nd.

44:05.420 --> 44:06.940
Yeah, 100% fuck James O'Keefe.

44:06.940 --> 44:09.580
I could have seen that being an April Fools episode, though.

44:09.580 --> 44:12.220
The way Alex is like, I'm not covering this document until

44:12.220 --> 44:12.700
Saturday.

44:12.700 --> 44:14.060
Then he lies a bit about it.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.740
A little touch and go on it.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.660
James O'Keefe's existence is a joke.

44:17.660 --> 44:21.100
Has Roger on, and Alex sort of pretends that the conversation

44:21.100 --> 44:22.540
didn't involve Matt Gaetz the day prior.

44:22.540 --> 44:23.260
Sure, sure.

44:23.260 --> 44:23.980
It's very weird.

44:23.980 --> 44:25.900
Never thought of Matt Gaetz before, honestly.

44:25.900 --> 44:30.300
So we get to the second, and the tone is completely changed.

44:31.260 --> 44:32.460
Things are totally different.

44:33.340 --> 44:36.140
Look at these headlines on Infowars.com.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.940
Biden infrastructure bill includes $20 billion

44:38.940 --> 44:41.260
to destroy highways for being racist.

44:41.980 --> 44:44.300
Now, if you're not aware of this, I'm not joking.

44:45.260 --> 44:46.380
Here's some of the headlines.

44:47.100 --> 44:48.300
Here's out of the News Gazette.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.700
Biden administration may target racist highways.

44:50.700 --> 44:51.820
That was December.

44:51.820 --> 44:56.540
A woman called for highway removal in a black neighborhood.

44:56.540 --> 44:57.660
Oh, my God.

44:57.660 --> 44:59.420
One person calls for a statue to come down.

44:59.420 --> 45:01.180
One person calls for a cross to come down.

45:01.180 --> 45:03.500
One person calls for a highway to come down.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.860
The White House singled it out in its infrastructure plan

45:06.860 --> 45:10.620
as racist, and they're announcing the big, giant highway

45:10.620 --> 45:13.020
that brings all the jobs to the neighborhood,

45:13.020 --> 45:15.340
and people can get around the town will be destroyed.

45:17.820 --> 45:19.420
I mean, I shouldn't laugh at this.

45:19.420 --> 45:21.340
This is so evil, ladies and gentlemen.

45:21.340 --> 45:23.420
We covered this back in the endgame coverage,

45:23.420 --> 45:25.100
so I don't want to dwell too much on the subject,

45:25.100 --> 45:26.780
but in case Alex is listening,

45:26.780 --> 45:29.740
the history of the placement of highways is incredibly racist.

45:29.740 --> 45:31.900
The fact that he's laughing at the idea and mocking it

45:31.900 --> 45:33.660
really only reveals that he has no idea

45:33.660 --> 45:34.860
about the history of that subject.

45:34.860 --> 45:35.500
Totally.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.500
No one's calling for all highways to be gone,

45:37.500 --> 45:39.740
so there can't be business or travel anywhere.

45:39.740 --> 45:41.340
The conversation is about how the ways

45:41.340 --> 45:43.180
that highways have been constructed in the past

45:43.180 --> 45:45.420
often has been done with absolutely no regard

45:45.420 --> 45:48.620
for minority communities and often to their detriment.

45:48.620 --> 45:51.100
There's tons of primary sources Alex could read up on

45:51.100 --> 45:52.860
if he's interested in the devastating impact

45:52.860 --> 45:55.420
that practices like redlining had on communities of color

45:55.420 --> 45:57.980
in this country in terms of social impacts

45:57.980 --> 46:00.860
and the destruction of economic power over generations.

46:00.860 --> 46:04.380
The history of redlining in Chicago is so fucked.

46:04.380 --> 46:06.940
Yeah, Alex is a stupid, stupid bigot

46:06.940 --> 46:09.100
who doesn't actually care about reporting accurate information

46:09.100 --> 46:10.860
or depicting reality to his audience.

46:10.860 --> 46:14.380
He's just interested in protecting the notions of whiteness.

46:14.380 --> 46:19.660
And I am demanding that Joe Biden destroy

46:19.660 --> 46:22.380
all of Illinois's portion of Route 66.

46:22.380 --> 46:23.420
I want it all gone.

46:23.420 --> 46:24.380
You don't want to get kicks anymore?

46:24.380 --> 46:26.300
I want it all gone.

46:26.300 --> 46:28.380
No more historic Route 66.

46:28.380 --> 46:30.220
I want all the signs taken down.

46:30.220 --> 46:33.180
I want the asphalt dug up.

46:33.180 --> 46:36.220
I have no skin in this game, so I'll support you on this.

46:36.220 --> 46:39.820
Historic mote 66 is what I want.

46:39.820 --> 46:40.860
Fill it with water.

46:40.860 --> 46:42.460
Fill it with water and crocodiles.

46:42.460 --> 46:44.460
I don't want to see that part of the state anymore.

46:44.460 --> 46:46.460
Does the Dan Ryan survive?

46:46.460 --> 46:47.260
Well, why not?

46:47.260 --> 46:47.760
Okay.

46:47.760 --> 46:52.080
So, tyranny.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.040
You heard of it.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.560
I am familiar.

46:54.560 --> 46:56.880
It's speeding up and has been speeding up over time.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.880
That doesn't sound 100% wrong.

46:58.880 --> 47:00.480
And we're there.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.400
It's fucking tyranny, man.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.400
This is what they like to do.

47:04.400 --> 47:09.600
And they're doing it to us in an act of raw power and domination.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.160
And we sit here with our open free society model

47:12.160 --> 47:17.200
in a daze as it moves so quickly.

47:18.240 --> 47:20.400
Ten years ago, we were going five miles an hour.

47:22.960 --> 47:25.280
Five years ago, we were going 50 miles an hour.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.160
Ooh, that's faster.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.680
Three years ago, we were going 100 miles an hour.

47:31.680 --> 47:32.080
Whoa.

47:32.080 --> 47:35.360
Honestly, though, if you think about the time in between these speeds,

47:35.360 --> 47:38.160
that is a very slow acceleration.

47:38.160 --> 47:43.200
Yeah, it's not quite parabolic, is it?

47:43.200 --> 47:45.920
Two years ago, we were going 200 miles an hour.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.080
A year ago, we were going 500 miles an hour.

47:48.720 --> 47:52.400
And now we're going 10,000 miles an hour down the rattle.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.040
That's a big job.

47:53.040 --> 47:53.920
That was parabolic.

47:53.920 --> 47:55.760
And we're going to go a million miles an hour.

47:55.760 --> 47:56.880
And two million miles an hour.

47:56.880 --> 47:57.200
That's quick.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.720
And a billion miles an hour.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.400
Right into hell, ladies and gentlemen.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.160
That's how tyranny works.

48:02.160 --> 48:03.360
It builds up.

48:03.360 --> 48:05.200
It gets its confidence going.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.080
People submit.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.880
And like dominoes, boom, kills everybody.

48:10.960 --> 48:11.360
OK.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.400
And John Hopkins, I'll cover it tomorrow, has got it all laid out,

48:14.400 --> 48:17.600
how the collapse is going to work, how there are going to be so many brain

48:17.600 --> 48:20.320
damaged people from these vaccines that society will shut down.

48:20.320 --> 48:20.640
Naturally.

48:20.640 --> 48:23.040
We're just going to have big mass reclamation centers

48:23.040 --> 48:26.320
right out of Soylent Green where we're just killing people around the clock.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.640
Young people, old people, you just sign the paperwork,

48:28.640 --> 48:31.440
roll your son in, your daughter in, your mama, your daddy.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.840
20 years old, 30 years old, 60 years old.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.840
Because they could have just given them something that killed them right away.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.640
That'd be too obvious you'd fight back or something kills you on the road.

48:38.640 --> 48:45.040
But instantly when you finally die, they want it to be something that wipes you out.

48:47.360 --> 48:53.440
They want it to be something that weighs on everyone.

48:53.440 --> 48:58.000
They want the sorrow and the pain and the breakdown and have the big medical system

48:58.000 --> 49:03.760
suck everything out of you, squeezing you dry before they blast you out of the dust.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.680
None of that is in the document.

49:05.680 --> 49:06.480
Yeah.

49:06.480 --> 49:10.000
I like how he describes something from Soylent Green

49:10.000 --> 49:13.280
and then says that it's in the document like in Soylent Green.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.000
Yeah.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.360
Yeah, that's real convenient.

49:17.360 --> 49:17.760
Yeah.

49:17.760 --> 49:22.960
It is really helpful for movies to tell you what is in the document you're talking about.

49:22.960 --> 49:23.200
Yeah.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.920
Yeah, I could describe any movie and then just claim that it's what a document says

49:29.920 --> 49:31.440
and be like, it's like The Matrix.

49:31.440 --> 49:32.160
Sure.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.040
It doesn't matter.

49:33.040 --> 49:33.680
Oh man.

49:33.680 --> 49:34.720
You're not doing anything.

49:34.720 --> 49:40.400
Dude, the Rockefeller report on 13 going on 30 and body swap issues.

49:40.400 --> 49:41.120
Holy shit.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.000
Insane.

49:42.000 --> 49:42.720
Yeah, that's insane.

49:42.720 --> 49:45.120
We're all going to swap with our parents.

49:45.120 --> 49:49.200
I read that document out of the Aspen Institute about body swapping.

49:49.200 --> 49:53.200
No, we're going to learn important lessons about walking in each other's shoes.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.560
It's actually going to be great.

49:54.560 --> 49:55.120
Right.

49:55.120 --> 49:58.000
But the people who don't learn those lessons, it's going to create a community of-

49:58.000 --> 50:01.120
Oh no, we're going to be robots in the streets cleaning them up.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.240
Displaced within other people.

50:04.240 --> 50:04.720
Yeah, yeah.

50:04.720 --> 50:05.600
Oh, it'd be terrible.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.320
Terrifying.

50:06.320 --> 50:08.800
Illegal immigration inside a body.

50:08.800 --> 50:09.760
Ooh, that's a-

50:09.760 --> 50:11.360
We're going to have to have a lot of new regulations.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.240
Oh, it's going to be an issue.

50:12.880 --> 50:15.280
And the Aspen Institute is working on that and I appreciate it.

50:15.280 --> 50:15.920
I think it's good.

50:15.920 --> 50:16.160
Yeah.

50:16.160 --> 50:16.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:16.880 --> 50:21.520
So I've been saying that Alex isn't really supporting Gates as much.

50:21.520 --> 50:21.760
Right.

50:21.760 --> 50:25.680
And that is mostly because it was aggressive at the end of March.

50:25.680 --> 50:29.520
Those last episodes in March, it was over the top.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.040
I fucked underage women.

50:31.040 --> 50:31.600
What?

50:31.600 --> 50:34.240
I didn't mean to say that in defense of Matt Gaetz.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.080
I meant to say it's okay if you fuck...

50:36.800 --> 50:38.320
Nope, that's not good either.

50:38.320 --> 50:38.800
Oh boy.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.760
Wait, you're telling me he dated a 17-year-old three years ago?

50:41.760 --> 50:42.800
What's the big deal?

50:42.800 --> 50:43.760
Yeah, she's...

50:43.760 --> 50:44.960
Yeah, it's fine.

50:44.960 --> 50:49.120
So, but in total fairness, Roger was still defending him.

50:49.120 --> 50:53.120
And Alex on the April 2nd episode does sort of support him.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.200
But you can sense a lack of enthusiasm.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.400
A little reticence.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.280
A little bit just like...

50:57.280 --> 51:01.280
But Matt Gaetz with no proof why he's got to be removed.

51:02.880 --> 51:06.800
While they're saying he might have given a 22-year-old girl $1,000 one time.

51:09.760 --> 51:11.760
And maybe she flew on a commercial flight with him.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.360
So that's sex trafficking.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.720
Of course, he's not on the Alita Express flying to a Caribbean island.

51:17.600 --> 51:20.720
And now we're learning it's not a 17-year-old girl, but it's okay.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.680
Because Tim Cook runs Death Tamps.

51:24.720 --> 51:25.040
What?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.800
They're the moral media.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.320
They're gonna get that Matt Gaetz.

51:28.320 --> 51:29.440
Matt Gaetz did something real.

51:29.440 --> 51:31.360
I'd throw him under the bus just like that.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.400
But that's not what happened here.

51:33.840 --> 51:36.320
I've also gotten to experience them doing it to me.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.760
But of course, I said, go ahead, publish all your lies.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.640
And of course, they don't.

51:42.640 --> 51:45.520
Still needing to bring himself into it.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.480
I know.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.440
Unnecessary.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.240
Very strange.

51:48.240 --> 51:48.960
I want...

51:48.960 --> 51:50.000
Very strange.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.440
If he says something like, oh, if it's real, I'll throw him under the bus.

51:53.440 --> 51:56.400
I want a countdown clock to appear right over his head.

51:56.400 --> 51:56.720
Sure.

51:56.720 --> 51:57.200
You know?

51:57.200 --> 51:57.840
Just like Ted.

51:57.840 --> 52:00.720
But you can sense the different tone.

52:00.720 --> 52:04.000
Like, that's very different than he was before.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.520
This is the dismount.

52:05.520 --> 52:09.360
So anyway, Alex goes to calls, and he gets this one caller.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.040
And this is sort of...

52:11.760 --> 52:15.120
The call wasn't interesting, but he said something that I wanted to play as like,

52:15.120 --> 52:18.160
this is the type of person who believes in Alex's shit.

52:18.160 --> 52:18.320
Sure.

52:19.120 --> 52:23.840
When you think about the UN, the UN was created because of the Club of Rome, basically,

52:24.400 --> 52:25.840
to give the Antichrist his power.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.280
That's what the UN was created.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.240
I'm sorry, what now?

52:28.240 --> 52:34.160
So the Club of Rome was founded in 1968, and the UN began in 1945.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.400
Yeah, because they knew the Club of Rome was coming.

52:36.400 --> 52:36.960
Right.

52:36.960 --> 52:37.200
Yeah.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.560
I mean, do you understand, like, there's just this...

52:40.560 --> 52:41.440
This is the sort of thinking.

52:41.440 --> 52:42.640
No, no, no, no, Dan.

52:42.640 --> 52:43.760
You're not understanding.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.120
I believe the Club of Rome he's speaking about...

52:47.120 --> 52:47.760
Oh, boy.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.720
Is Romulus and Remus.

52:50.720 --> 52:51.680
And the wolves.

52:51.680 --> 52:52.320
Exactly.

52:52.320 --> 52:56.400
I mean, like, okay, so the Antichrist needs to get its power.

52:56.400 --> 52:57.120
Sure.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.800
And that's why they made the UN.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.280
I'm sorry.

53:00.240 --> 53:00.480
Yeah.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.360
13 years later, the Club of Rome is founded.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.600
It just doesn't make any sense.

53:05.600 --> 53:09.200
Anyway, Alex in between calls rambles a little bit about how,

53:09.200 --> 53:13.600
oh, God, wouldn't it be so great if the US and Russia became best friends?

53:13.600 --> 53:14.400
Oh, that would be great.

53:14.400 --> 53:18.400
And anybody that studies geopolitics knows that the US links up with Russia geopolitically.

53:18.400 --> 53:24.720
It's over those two countries could dominate the world for good and a new golden age.

53:24.720 --> 53:28.080
But alas, we know that's not how it works, right?

53:28.800 --> 53:30.480
Anybody can read Revelation and the Dragon.

53:30.480 --> 53:33.120
The whole war that happens, we all know it unfolds.

53:33.120 --> 53:33.360
What?

53:34.080 --> 53:39.520
So now the holy war that unfolds is between the United States and Russia.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.240
I guess so.

53:40.800 --> 53:45.840
But also, this is a real strong argument of pre-determinism.

53:45.840 --> 53:46.000
Yeah.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.040
There's no free will.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.080
It does seem like that.

53:48.080 --> 53:48.480
Yeah.

53:48.480 --> 53:52.080
It does seem like we're dipping into Calvin territory.

53:52.080 --> 53:52.240
Yeah.

53:52.240 --> 53:54.320
This is a horrifying view.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.200
Of course, we all know what happens in Revelation.

53:57.200 --> 53:57.440
Yeah.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.360
Geopolitically, if the US and Russia teamed up, they could dominate the world.

54:01.360 --> 54:03.760
But we know from Revelation that's not going to happen.

54:03.760 --> 54:07.200
But that's such a fucking cop out.

54:07.200 --> 54:07.680
Fuck you.

54:08.480 --> 54:08.880
Fair enough.

54:08.880 --> 54:09.440
Fuck you.

54:09.440 --> 54:10.320
How dare you?

54:10.320 --> 54:10.720
Fair enough.

54:11.520 --> 54:14.320
The Book of Revelation doesn't also include, like,

54:14.320 --> 54:18.000
a hundred years of prep time for the Antichrist to rise.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.040
There is that part in Revelation about how the devil's ten years behind.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.160
Wow, that was an interesting thing for Jon to add.

54:24.160 --> 54:24.880
Yeah.

54:24.880 --> 54:29.280
So we get another caller, and this dude is on every fucking episode.

54:29.280 --> 54:30.720
He calls in all the time.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.000
There's a dude named Carlos.

54:32.000 --> 54:32.320
Okay.

54:32.320 --> 54:35.360
And he thinks that everything that's going on right now is an attack on Christianity.

54:35.360 --> 54:36.160
Sure.

54:36.160 --> 54:36.800
What do you...

54:36.800 --> 54:40.640
Obviously, I'm going to cover this John Hopkins document tomorrow that admits we're in a simulation

54:40.640 --> 54:41.280
takeover.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.200
The vaccines are going to make a lot of people sick.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.720
It's a society collapsing weapon.

54:44.720 --> 54:45.840
It's so incredible.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.200
What is their big end game?

54:47.200 --> 54:48.800
Why are they so savage?

54:48.800 --> 54:52.160
Why are they moving ahead with something so incredibly dangerous and committing these

54:52.160 --> 54:53.200
giant mass crimes?

54:54.320 --> 54:59.680
Because what people don't realize, and this is Good Friday to think about it, this is

54:59.680 --> 55:02.560
an Antichristian worldwide movement.

55:02.560 --> 55:03.200
Sure.

55:03.200 --> 55:06.960
It is led by individuals who are not Christians.

55:06.960 --> 55:07.520
Exactly.

55:07.520 --> 55:11.840
The US is taking more vaccines than anybody else, and predominantly it's Christian countries

55:11.840 --> 55:12.800
being hit by this.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.000
You're exactly right.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.280
I don't know how this dude gets on every day.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.480
Almost every day.

55:18.480 --> 55:24.000
It makes me think that either he has a priority number or they don't get that many calls.

55:24.000 --> 55:24.960
I doubt they get that many calls.

55:24.960 --> 55:27.680
Because that Carlos dude is on all the fucking time.

55:27.680 --> 55:27.920
Okay.

55:28.720 --> 55:32.240
And Alex has a bizarre level of deference for him.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.040
He lets Carlos talk for quite a while.

55:35.920 --> 55:39.040
Carlos seems like a guy that is in the circle.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.000
He has some thoughts.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:41.440 --> 55:47.200
I don't know, maybe he's just letting people talk too much now because he gets another

55:47.200 --> 55:49.600
caller, and I will say that he let this guy talk too long.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.080
Too long?

55:50.080 --> 55:50.800
A little bit too long.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.240
Oh, that's unsurprising.

55:52.240 --> 55:55.680
Not the same kind of problems that Harrison Smith gets when people talk too long.

55:55.680 --> 55:56.240
Sure.

55:56.240 --> 55:59.120
This guy just sounds a little bit sovereign citizen-y.

55:59.120 --> 55:59.840
Oh.

55:59.840 --> 56:03.040
You know, we have some really big issues.

56:03.040 --> 56:06.000
Trump owns the original post office, and it's been...

56:06.000 --> 56:07.120
The original post office?

56:07.120 --> 56:08.880
The wars are between post office.

56:08.880 --> 56:19.840
And, you know, this whole thing is about the legal fictions that Congress created to our

56:19.840 --> 56:24.320
birth certificates that were representing that all caps name.

56:25.200 --> 56:25.520
So...

56:25.520 --> 56:27.200
Is that MF2?

56:27.200 --> 56:30.640
What you said over and over, we're operating under color of law.

56:31.440 --> 56:32.320
Color of law.

56:32.320 --> 56:40.720
And until and unless we refute their presumptions and stop representing that all caps name,

56:40.720 --> 56:47.360
now you can find an explanation of that at Adebon Red, Article number 73.

56:47.360 --> 56:50.160
She really, really gets into it and has sent notices.

56:50.160 --> 56:50.800
Beautiful, brother.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.880
I got to tell you, everybody, thank you, Steven.

56:52.880 --> 56:53.360
Beautiful.

56:55.120 --> 56:55.760
Wow.

56:55.760 --> 56:56.000
So...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.320
All caps when you spell the man named, and...

56:58.320 --> 56:59.920
Do do do do do do do do do.

56:59.920 --> 57:00.160
Right.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.320
Right.

57:02.320 --> 57:05.200
Beyond that, and that's just standard sovereign citizen stuff.

57:05.200 --> 57:05.840
Yeah, naturally.

57:05.840 --> 57:06.800
Hooray for that.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.040
All caps, birth certificate, you're great.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.680
Now, I was unaware that Trump owns the original post office.

57:11.680 --> 57:13.360
I was surprised to discover that as well.

57:13.360 --> 57:16.320
And that all wars are wars between post offices.

57:16.320 --> 57:17.440
Did you not know that?

57:17.440 --> 57:18.000
I didn't.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.280
Did you not know that there has been a hundred year secret war between post offices?

57:23.280 --> 57:28.400
Ever since one guy, his horse knocked over another guy's horse and started the great

57:28.400 --> 57:29.360
post office war.

57:29.360 --> 57:34.000
I feel like probably there were, in earlier times, some feuding...

57:34.000 --> 57:34.960
Sure, of course.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.400
Between, like...

57:36.400 --> 57:37.760
Capitalism is capitalism.

57:37.760 --> 57:42.000
If you're getting paid by the letter, yeah, people are going to fight.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.680
Oh, these days.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.400
A little different.

57:44.400 --> 57:44.800
Not sure.

57:44.800 --> 57:45.920
A little different.

57:45.920 --> 57:47.600
So this show sucks.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.040
This episode is not good.

57:49.040 --> 57:54.400
Sorry, I just got the image of, you know, just a regular post office driver just driving

57:54.400 --> 57:57.760
on the with the door open on the wrong side.

57:57.760 --> 58:00.160
And you're like, isn't that cute? You guys are driving.

58:00.160 --> 58:04.640
They get out and then they're suddenly attacked by another post office guy.

58:04.640 --> 58:07.840
Throws him into the open window of the car and lights it up on fire.

58:07.840 --> 58:10.320
The FedEx boys jump UPS boys.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.040
It's the IRA of post offices.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.080
Yes, I gotcha.

58:14.080 --> 58:16.080
So, like I said, this show sucks.

58:16.080 --> 58:17.040
This episode's bad.

58:17.040 --> 58:22.640
And in the third hour, Alex has Drew Hernandez on, who's another reporter baby.

58:23.760 --> 58:26.800
I find this guy's voice incredibly annoying.

58:26.800 --> 58:32.560
He's on to talk about the border and talk about, oh, everything is.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.560
Oh, those people from not here.

58:34.560 --> 58:36.720
They're coming to here and we don't want them here.

58:36.720 --> 58:37.680
They're from not here.

58:37.680 --> 58:41.280
But Mike down for this, because this is how the interview started and where I turned it off.

58:41.280 --> 58:41.780
OK.

58:42.240 --> 58:46.160
You were saying, yeah, well, let's get into the border, but also some of the culture war stuff

58:46.160 --> 58:49.760
and some of the things that are going on as they put us onto this virtual economy.

58:49.760 --> 58:50.480
Tell us about it.

58:50.480 --> 58:53.840
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure your viewers are familiar with Bad Baby.

58:53.840 --> 58:57.920
You know, she's the catch me outside girl that was on Dr. Phil and extremely viral,

58:57.920 --> 58:58.880
totally depraved.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.800
She made an OnlyFans.

59:00.800 --> 59:01.440
I got to go.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.080
I don't know.

59:04.080 --> 59:08.800
I don't know what good is going to come with this conversation about the cash me outside girl.

59:08.800 --> 59:10.080
No, we get only fans.

59:10.080 --> 59:11.360
No, I don't care.

59:11.360 --> 59:16.240
Did you know that somebody in a viral video has an OnlyFans account now?

59:16.240 --> 59:17.760
Did I know she's a rapper?

59:17.760 --> 59:18.800
Do I care?

59:18.800 --> 59:19.440
No.

59:19.440 --> 59:19.920
Goodbye.

59:20.480 --> 59:21.200
Goodbye, sir.

59:21.200 --> 59:21.600
Yeah.

59:21.600 --> 59:24.560
I don't I don't care to listen to you, I guess.

59:24.560 --> 59:28.880
I mean, best case scenario, shame someone for being a sex worker.

59:28.880 --> 59:32.560
Like, I don't give a I don't I know people with OnlyFans accounts.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.040
Cool.

59:33.040 --> 59:33.600
Have fun.

59:33.600 --> 59:34.480
Yeah, great.

59:35.120 --> 59:38.320
I hope you supplement your income, I guess.

59:38.320 --> 59:38.800
I don't know.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.120
Yeah, if he's on to talk about the border.

59:41.120 --> 59:42.960
But first, we're going to get into culture wars.

59:42.960 --> 59:44.880
Someone has an OnlyFans account.

59:44.880 --> 59:45.920
I'm mad about it.

59:45.920 --> 59:46.880
I have to leave.

59:46.880 --> 59:49.120
I can't I'm not going to take you seriously.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.680
No, that's that's a dynasty level offense.

59:51.680 --> 59:54.480
If I had a glass of wine in my hand, I would throw it in that guy's face.

59:54.480 --> 59:55.600
How dare you say that.

59:55.600 --> 59:56.400
The temerity.

59:57.760 --> 59:58.080
Yeah.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:03.040
And plus, like, I mean, realistically, Saturday is just right around the corner.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:03.520
Of course.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.160
I'm not going to waste my time with Drew Hernandez.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:06.640
Yeah.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.920
I'm not going to waste my time.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.240
You've got an hour of meat and gristle to really dig your teeth into.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:12.560
Yep.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.280
So here we go.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:20.160
This is where things start off with Alex covering the Johns Hopkins document.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:20.640
Sure.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.440
Now, most people that are informed have heard about Event 201.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.000
They've heard about Operation Lockstep.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.320
They've heard about Crimson Contagion.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.200
They've heard about Disease X and the UN Drills.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:39.520
But have you heard about

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.520
2025, 2028, it is all of those plans together.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:42.560
It's not.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.040
But not set in the near future, like those previous drills were,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.000
but set out a few more years in the future.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.200
That's the time we're in now.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:01:00.560
So just superimpose 2025 to 2028 with 2020 to 2023.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.080
And it is exactly what's happening.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.560
So I love the idea that Alex says the Johns Hopkins scenario depicts things

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.320
exactly as they're happening in real life, just superimposed on a different date.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.360
Also, nothing funnier than it's not a little bit in the future.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.160
It's a few years.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.280
It's not in the near future, idiots.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.120
It's in the near, near future.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.080
Alex didn't know where that sentence was going to end when it started.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.360
That's a bad dismount.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.200
So when he's talking about things being exactly like real life, just a few years off.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:31.520
Sure.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.360
I have a few things to say.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.320
Okay, toss it at me.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.880
First of all, one of the main tensions of the Hopkins exercise is messaging issues around

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.440
a drug that was believed to be effective against spars called Calosevir.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.160
Calosevir.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.240
There wasn't a drug that the government was trying to push for the treatment of COVID

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.080
in the way that the medical community gets behind Calosevir in this exercise.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.160
Maybe remdesivir, possibly, but...

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:54.560
Yeah.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.720
I mean, your basic there is like Trump and his messaging campaign pushed

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.000
hydroxychloroquine so hard.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.560
Yeah.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.000
The mixed messaging though.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:04.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.440
It doesn't fit for this.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:11.200
And I don't think that remdesivir does either in terms of the way it's depicted in the exercise.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.080
So to me, this seems like one really big problem with the scenario matching real world history.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.480
Second, backlash to Calosevir begins in February 2026, four months into the outbreak,

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.680
when a video of a child projectile vomiting after taking a dose goes viral online.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.200
This did not happen four months into COVID, even metaphorically.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:31.760
That's fair.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:38.240
Third, in May 2026, a made up rapper named BZ suffers a public embarrassment when trying

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.160
to promote sparse treatments to his audience when he compares people who volunteer for

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.960
vaccine trials to participants in the Tuskegee experiments.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.360
This did not happen in the real world.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.280
Exhibit A in why scientists don't become rappers.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.640
Our fictitious rapper is named BZ.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.140
Sure.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.800
There are plenty of examples of things like this that did not happen in the real world,

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.960
but do in the scenario exercise, because the point of the events that happened in the scenario

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.320
is to create situations where messaging challenges would arise that the exercise participants

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.800
could reflect on how best to respond.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.040
The inclusion of a situation like this rapper making a public gaffe in this scenario doesn't

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.880
make sense out of context.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.080
When you don't see this exercise within the context of why it exists, it seems really weird.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.920
But when you understand that it's designed to assist medical communications professionals

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.480
brainstorm the ways that they might need to respond to various events in a crisis, the

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.000
picture makes far more sense.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.880
At the same time that BZ makes his comments, the fictional former president, Jacqueline

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.880
Bennett, gives a noncommittal answer about whether or not she would give her grandson

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.080
callous of ear, which creates a similar but slightly different messaging problem for the

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.160
exercise participants to reflect on.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.040
Sure, sure, sure.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.840
Anyway, the point is a bunch of things that happen in very differently in this imagined

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.400
scenario than have happened in our real world outbreak.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.080
Alex is just trying to pretend everything is the same because it's more fun and profitable

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.760
for him, but it's all made up.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.040
So is this SBZ supposed to be a play on Yeezy?

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.240
I thought Jay-Z.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.840
Well, I mean, but the very public gaffe would suggest more of a Kanye circumstance.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.320
Yeah, you're not wrong, but I think that...

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.280
Are they saying that Kanye is going to Taylor Swift COVID-19?

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.840
No, because in the context of the scenario exercise, BZ is one of the people who was

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:31.040
enlisted to help get messaging out about the safety of the treatment.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.440
And then he said George Bush doesn't care about black people.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.800
I don't think that Kanye would be enlisted by the medical community.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.480
Not anymore, not anymore.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.160
So this document, my friend, is a timeline.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.360
This is what you need to understand.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:43.840
Naturally.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.340
Timeline.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.280
But a few years off into the near near future.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:54.000
Basically, you just transpose the beginning of the outbreak to the outbreak in the document.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:54.480
Sure.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.160
You could tell what's going to happen in the future.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.880
That sounds right.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.000
And unfortunately, we are six months away from something bad.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.720
Oh, that's bad.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.080
Now, here's what's devastating.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:08.240
We're about 13 months into the simulation that, again, is not really a simulation.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.720
They're using that to cover their operations.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.000
In case they get caught with the documents, they just say it's part of the drill.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.640
That's a classic operation by intelligence agencies, governments, but also health agencies.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.520
Classic by health agencies.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.920
Next, they say that within six months to a year of people being inoculated with these

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:33.200
experimental GMO gene therapies, that you will have massive brain damage and spongiform

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.200
encephalopathy, basically, or prion disease, mad cow disease.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.440
So that's good, good times.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.640
That's a real bummer.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.520
That's going to be a really rough six months to a year from now.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.640
Don't worry, it's bullshit.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.280
Oh, okay.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.440
So in the exercise, there's this potential basis for a vaccine discovered in the form

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.640
of an animal vaccine for hoofed mammal respiratory virus developed by a company called GMI.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.600
This condition was similar in many ways to SPARS, so researchers began looking at whether

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.200
or not it could be effective for humans.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:06.720
One of the initial downsides was that, quote, data provided by GMI suggested that the vaccine

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.280
was effective at preventing SPARS-like illness in cows, pigs, and other hoofed mammals, but

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.840
internal trials revealed several worrisome side effects, including swollen legs, severe

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.960
joint pain, and encephalitis leading to seizures or death.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.800
Right, and cows learning how to talk.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.520
Sure.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:27.120
In this scenario, in May 2027, a group of parents, the size of the group is unspecified,

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.480
they sue the government because they believe that their children got encephalitis from

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.440
the vaccine.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.240
The claims are not presented as necessarily accurate.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.640
It's just more detail added to make this a more real scenario, since this mirrors real

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.400
world anti-vax folks, and it's something that presents a challenge to the messaging that's

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.840
required for medical communicators.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.800
Naturally.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.960
The scenario does say that, quote, after showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year,

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.720
several vaccine recipients slowly began to experience symptoms such as blurry vision,

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.800
headaches, and numbness in their extremities.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.760
Due to the small number of cases, the significance of the association with Corvax was never determined.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.000
As of this writing in 2030, longitudinal studies initiated by the NIH at the beginning of

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.320
the vaccination program have not reached the next round of data collection, so formal

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.360
analysis of these symptoms has not yet been conducted.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.280
Furthermore, these cases arose from the initial cohort of vaccine recipients, those in high

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:20.000
risk populations, including those with other underlying conditions, making it increasingly

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.920
difficult to determine the extent to which these symptoms are associated with vaccination.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.920
I read this earlier, but I wanted to read it again because this brings up an important

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.800
point, and that is that these elements of the scenario, it's left intentionally open

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.040
ended because it exists to pose a question to the participants, not to depict a reality

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.040
that actually exists.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.960
In that scenario, how does a person in a position of medical messaging respond?

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.880
How do you convey confidence on the medical side of things, while still acknowledging

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.120
certain uncertainties?

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.880
These are the sorts of questions this story arc is meant to bring up.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.840
Because Alex knows better and he's a psychic, he's realized that this is actually the globalists

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.400
admitting that they're going to give everyone mad cow disease, when the encephalitis is

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:07.680
really just the animal vaccine that GMI created, and it's just encephalitis in animals, and

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:13.240
then there's some parents who allege encephalitis, but it's not actually proven in the case of

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.240
the scenario.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.360
No, and that's maybe the most important question for the study to ask, which is how is it that

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:26.820
we can tell people, honestly, we don't know, and at the same time reassure them that they

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:27.820
can trust us?

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:32.920
Yeah, and one of the other things that they take great care to point out is exploring

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:39.020
ideas of how to be compassionate about the uncertainty, because it's an understandable

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:44.460
feeling for people to have, and how do you mix that compassion about the uncertainty

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.620
with the confidence in medical science?

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.520
It's a challenging thing, but that's why you do exercises like this.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.180
Yeah, my message would probably not be good, it would be more something like, listen, we

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:03.280
know public education has failed you between first and eighth grade, at least.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.220
You wouldn't make it through the exercise.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:11.260
So the thing is that Alex is connecting this with the study that he's found, right?

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.640
So they say encephalitis in the scenario, right?

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.820
And that's like the Zika virus, right?

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:23.920
I just mentioned to you spongiform encephalopathy, or prion disease, microbiology infectious

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:29.260
diseases journal, COVID-19 RNA-based vaccines, and the risk of prion disease.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:33.760
That was put out in 2021 by prestigious scientists.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.620
Whenever you hear Alex say that a claim is being made by a prestigious scientist, that

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.580
means he has no idea who the person is.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.020
Yeah, I was going to say that's a huge red flag immediately.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:46.940
It's an unknown quantity, but he wants to elevate this claim that they're making because

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.900
it works well for him.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:53.020
This claim that the COVID vaccine causes prion disease was based entirely on a non-peer reviewed

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.660
paper by a guy named J. Bart Klassen.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:59.420
No one agrees with his conclusion, and he is not a prestigious scientist.

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:04.060
According to USA Today, quote, in 1999 he claimed the influenza vaccine caused type

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:10.220
one diabetes, a claim disproven by Johns Hopkins University Institute for Vaccine Safety.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.900
He's just an anti-vax weirdo who makes these claims pretty regularly whenever there's a

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.060
vaccine that needs to be smeared.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.060
Vaccines cause IBS!

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.420
Alright, man, okay.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.660
So now Alex is there.

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.500
He's rolling deep, though, with the crew.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.500
Sure.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.500
To quote B.Z.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.620
Nicely done.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:27.620
He's got Rob Dues.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.860
It is Easter, so Jesus walks.

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.860
Oh.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:38.260
So Rob Dues is in studio, the corporate representative Rob Dues, and he's just blown away by this

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.260
document.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.260
Rob Dues.

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:45.940
Yeah, so the parallels on this are just from a, when you looked at 9-11 and you saw the

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:51.100
parallels that happened, this has got the same thing in it with like massive power outages.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:57.140
You've got a male and female president, the president who's a male stops after a few years,

01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:01.500
the female who's, she's only in for one term and then she leaves and then the male president

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.500
takes over.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.540
We kind of have that going on.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:07.380
So first of all, Biden hasn't stepped down, so this isn't actually a similarity at all.

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:09.160
No, it's exactly like that.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.160
It's happening, though.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.160
You can see it.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.840
I don't know if the Infowars universe is just so convinced that it's going to happen any

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:18.100
day now that they've just decided it's already happened, but this is just a similarity in

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.440
Rob's head.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.600
So in this scenario, the president is named Randall Archer.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.380
He'd previously been the vice president under Jacqueline Bennett.

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:29.700
She didn't step down, she just decided not to run for a second term after being president

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.060
from 2020 to 2024, at which point Archer ran and won.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.300
Shouting, fuck you guys, you were shit.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.360
Bennett is still actively involved in being an advisor, but was not up to seeking re-election

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.900
quote due to health concerns.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.420
This is the case in the scenario because it creates an interesting dynamic where there's

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:51.220
a new president, but also a fully functioning and intact staff at the Department of Health

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.740
and Human Services.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:56.580
In terms of what the exercise is designed to explore, this makes total sense.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:00.420
Essentially, former President Bennett exists as a prop, so she can be a character that

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.660
makes a media gaffe where she gives that non-committal answer about Calus Avere.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.660
Sure, sure.

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:09.380
The character that does that should be a beloved public figure, you know, because then it works,

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.340
there's a weird dynamic there, but it also shouldn't be the current president because

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.660
that's too weird.

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.240
So a former president works great.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.420
In order to make that scenario work, she would have to have just had one term, and ideally

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.340
she shouldn't have just lost an election.

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:25.780
Seems like the best way to get to that story beat would be if you just didn't want to seek

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.780
re-election.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.740
Everybody still trusts her, so the gaffe would carry so much weight that they would be influenced

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:36.980
by it, while at the same time, you couldn't lose an election and have everybody be influenced

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:37.980
in the same way.

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.980
It would be weird.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:44.140
And you don't want it to be the current president because it adds a whole layer to it.

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:49.880
The other specific that Rob uses is this power outage, which I will admit is in the scenario.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.900
There's a massive power outage in the Pacific Northwest just one week prior to the rollout

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.640
of the vaccine, which doesn't match up with what Rob wants it to in the real world, sure.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.740
He's trying to compare that to the Texas outages, which happened well after vaccination programs

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.460
began and are reality.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.660
Again, it's important to understand why this specific detail is included in the exercise.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:13.700
This is all about medical messaging in a public health emergency, so this power outage was

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:17.820
added to the scenario so participants could consider what methods they might employ if

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.860
they didn't have access to things like social media.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:25.420
With a massive power outage, one of the main methods of communications is less effective.

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:28.900
But you need to continue helping the public through, so what do you do?

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.460
This is super clear from the exercise if you read it, but if you just want to make random

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.540
connections, I guess you could do what Rob Doo is doing, and it's really embarrassing.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:41.020
I mean, look, this is what it says in the text, quote, all communication about the vaccine

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:45.140
rollout was published in electronic form, and consequently many individuals in the affected

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.660
areas were initially unable to access information provided by state, local, and federal health

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.060
authorities regarding CoraVax dispensing.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.060
Reasonable.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.740
Immediately after this, there are study questions for the participants in the document, like,

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:02.700
quote, while greater use of electronic media opens new opportunities for broad outreach,

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.980
what communications vulnerabilities exist that could impede communication efforts via

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.700
electronic media?

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:12.700
Or the other question, quote, how can public health communicators remain flexible when

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:15.060
multiple disasters occur at once?

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.060
Right.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.200
In their paper about designing scenario-based exercises, Ogilvy and Schwartz discuss the

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.340
need for stories that follow various plots, and one of the most common archetypes is crisis

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.080
and response.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.260
This plot element is about introducing a big problem, and then the participants get to

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.260
respond.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:36.260
The paper discusses an exercise they ran with Shell that followed basically this exact same

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.260
path.

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.060
Quote, first comes the scenario's crisis.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:44.420
Initial signs of environmental degradation lead reputable scientists to conclude that

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.900
an environmental disaster is fast approaching.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.900
A few leading governments and companies change the way they do business.

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:54.460
Disasters begin to occur in countries that could not or chose not to adapt, and there's

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.140
public outcry.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:01.100
The playing field, the organizational operating environment, is suddenly dramatically altered.

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.940
The innovative firms that learn to make difficult changes in their business practices to avoid

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.080
environmental degradation are now positioned to become market leaders.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.800
In the Johns Hopkins exercise, the outbreak itself is the initial crisis.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.620
Then things like the power outage in the Pacific Northwest or the video of the kid vomiting

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.920
represent new crises that the participants have to deal with.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.660
This is the context of what Alex and Rob are lying about, and it makes total sense there's

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:27.700
no way to read that document and not understand that that's what it is.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:33.580
That's so funny to me that they missed the most important question of having that kind

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:38.940
of power outage a week before the vaccine rollout, which would just simply be like,

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:43.620
okay, an astonishing number of people are going to think that God is punishing us for

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.800
this vaccine.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.300
How do we deal with that?

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.940
Or are all the Proud Boys accounted for?

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:51.140
Yeah, is this witches?

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:57.020
People are going to ask us why God punished us with this power outage before the vaccine.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.020
You know what?

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:00.820
That isn't in the exercise, but I think...

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.820
It's a subtext.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:06.140
Jordan, to be fair, it was made in 2017.

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:07.140
That's true.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:10.580
If it was made today, that might've been a relevant messaging question, but yeah.

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.580
Okay.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.260
People are going to assume meteorologists are witches.

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.140
What do we do about that from a health standpoint?

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.340
It's interesting to me that this is how Rob Dues starting it out.

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.180
He's talking about these similarities.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:27.580
One is not a similarity at all in that Biden hasn't stepped down, and even if he did, it

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.380
doesn't match the scenario that's depicted in the exercise.

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:36.200
And then the other one is that there's a power outage, but they're completely different situations.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.780
And if you understand what the document is for, it makes total sense that a power outage

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.000
would be in there.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.120
It creates an important teaching moment about using non-electronic methods.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:52.460
Every time Dues goes to a diner, he has failed the, what are the three differences picture.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:53.460
Oh dude.

01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.180
He's never gotten one of those cereal boxes, placemats, it doesn't matter.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180
Shut up.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.180
I just had a great idea.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.180
Okay.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.580
Have you ever played Overcooked?

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.580
Uh, yes.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.580
We tried one time.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:07.580
Yeah, it's that game where you have to cook meals, you know, like you're running around

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:08.580
chopping up an onion.

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:09.580
You gotta do the thing.

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.140
It's like Burger Boss or whatever it is.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.140
I have a new idea.

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.140
Okay.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.140
Dues Diner.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.780
Try and figure out puzzles that are way too easy.

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:17.780
No, no, no.

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.740
It's Overcooked, but the goal is to fail.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:23.580
You just have to fail interestingly.

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.580
I like that game.

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.140
That's a good open-ended game.

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.700
Anybody who can program an app, don't waste your time on that.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:31.700
Please don't.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:36.060
Uh, so Alex gets to starting up reading the, uh, the document and this is fun.

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.540
I love this.

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:40.460
Let's go ahead and begin here.

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.300
Here is the project team who is on it.

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:47.660
All these different top eugenicists, top globalist, uh, from around the country.

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.540
John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.860
The team, uh, it's top eugenicists, right?

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:58.380
It's five senior associates with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, a professor

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:03.220
from Texas State, and a Masters of Public Health candidate from Columbia University.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.220
Well yeah.

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.220
Top eugenicists.

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:10.180
How do you get any of those things without a proven track record of top eugenicism?

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:13.220
Alex has no idea who any of these people are.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:14.220
Why would you?

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.220
Just making this up.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:16.540
Why would you know who they are?

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:19.300
Oh yeah, this Masters student is a fucking top eugenicist.

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:25.060
A sane person who doesn't directly, uh, affect, uh, interact with these people know who they

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.060
are.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:29.140
This Columbia University grad student is a sixth generation eugenicist.

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:30.140
Sure.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.140
Sure.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.140
Ah.

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:35.980
So anyway, I warned you earlier that there was a squirrely weirdo coming up named Mike.

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:36.980
Mike.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:37.980
Mike the squirrely weirdo.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.340
I honestly don't know who this dude is.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.380
I think he might be an Infowars employee.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.940
He might be Harrison Smith's roommate.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940
Sure.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
I don't fucking know.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:45.940
Could be anybody.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:46.940
But he is weird.

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:47.940
Wife's tennis instructor.

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:48.940
He is weird.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:49.940
He's a liar.

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:50.940
Okay.

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:55.260
And, uh, this can be found inside of the sparse document word for word after showing no adverse

01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:01.740
side effects for nearly a year, vaccine recipients slowly began to experience symptoms as time

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:07.020
passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated claims of adverse side effects

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.460
began to emerge.

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:14.500
As the investigations grew in intensity, several high ranking officials at the CDC and FDA

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.620
were forced to step down and withdraw from government.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:21.900
They're setting up the health officials and the politicians to take the fall for this.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:25.980
What Mike is reading here, that's definitely from the document, but he's made a classic

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:30.740
Infowars move here and that he's taken two unrelated passages from the text and combine

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.540
them, pretending they're about the same thing in order to lie about this document.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:35.540
Yeah.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:39.060
The part about people experiencing side effects after a year is from chapter 17.

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.500
It's on page 60.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.820
The second part about government officials stepping down is chapter 19.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.500
It's on page 67.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.740
It's completely unrelated to the previous chapter's conversation about possible side

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.020
effects.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:55.460
Here is the paragraph about the government officials in full quote after action reports,

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:59.760
government hearings and agency reviews following the pandemic were too numerous to count.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.060
Emergency funding appropriated by Congress to fight the disease became available partway

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:07.500
through the course of the pandemic, but federal state and local public health agencies struggled

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.220
to manage the procedural requirements to spend it.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.520
That does sound familiar.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.900
As a result, significant amounts of emergency funds remained unused as the pandemic wound

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:16.900
down.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:20.620
As the investigations grew in intensity, several high ranking officials at the CDC and FDA

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.400
were forced to step down and withdraw from government in order to quote spend more time

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.040
with their families.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:32.560
The investigations that are causing these imaginary officials to step down are not related

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.600
to possible drug side effects.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.980
It's clearly about mismanagement of funds.

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:41.200
If this guy's read the document as he's presenting himself as having done, then he knows fully

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:45.480
well that the two passages he just read as if they were one paragraph are actually two

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:48.040
completely different sections of the document.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.920
If this document actually said what he wanted it to, he wouldn't have to lie like this in

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:55.200
order to make it look like it met his needs.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.480
This is bullshit, weirdo Mike.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.140
That is funny that even in the Johns Hopkins report, it's like, listen, we all know at

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:05.640
least 15 to 20 senators are corrupt as shit.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:09.160
We're just going to put in that some of them had to quit.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:17.120
I mean, I think that the scenario paints a very realistic portrait of some of the things

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.000
that you could expect might happen.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Absolutely.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.720
We'll deal with another one of them that Rob Dew thinks is maybe wizardry a little bit

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.280
later, but I don't know.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.140
From reading the document, I think there's some pretty fair assumptions that are made

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:34.920
and then also some ones that are like, that's a little silly, but they're all in service

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.600
of what the document is for.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.600
Right.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.600
They're teaching documents.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.240
They're still focused around this exercise that is how do medical communicators rise

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.280
to various challenges.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:51.400
Now I think that clip right there where Mike is reading two different sections as if they

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.960
were the same, because when he's talking about these side effects, he then says, as investigations

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.360
grow in intensity, and that's meant to lead the audience to think that these investigations...

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:05.560
Very clearly split those quotes, but then combine them together to form a single quote.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:10.920
Which leads you to believe that the investigations are about drug side effects, and that's how

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.200
they're going to set up the politicians to take the fall for this, has nothing to do

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.200
with that.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200
He has to know that.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.760
And this is the point at which any reasonable person would just be like, fuck this.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.920
You're absolutely misrepresenting the primary document you're talking about, and there's

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.880
no way that that is an accident.

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.840
There's no way you did this accidentally.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:37.480
Well, I mean, it's somewhat similar to Alex's synopsis of Romeo and Juliet in so far as

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.360
he leaves out a bunch of the middle between those two things.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360
No it's not.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.920
No, no, no, no, no.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.920
No, I know.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.640
It would be like if he threw in a little bit of Hamlet.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.440
Yeah, that sounds fun.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:57.560
So anyway, Mike gets to being weird some more about a passage about vaccine distribution.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:03.200
To determine how to best distribute limited doses of Corovax to members of priority groups

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:09.240
across the country, the US government resorted to new controversial tactics, notably having

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:14.560
health care providers access patients' electronic health records to determine the number of

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.260
individuals in high-risk populations receiving care in particular areas.

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:22.520
This passage really undercuts the argument that this document represents the globalist

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.480
plan because they didn't do that.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:28.040
Also, while we're on the subject of things that didn't happen in real life that do happen

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:33.400
in the scenario, we should look at chapter 10 and see one of the big, uh, giant, gigantic,

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:38.800
I'm going to come up with more words, one of the big public messaging crises that come

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.320
up over the course of the exercise.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.240
Gojira emerged from the ocean.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.640
No, that's chapter 12.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.680
Oh, okay, okay.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.120
In chapter 10 of the scenario, there's a huge public backlash because doctors and nurses

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.520
aren't included in the highest priority group for the distribution of the vaccine.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.400
Yeah, that would cause a huge public backlash.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.840
Yeah, they even designed two fake tweets that illustrate the outrage that was happening

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.880
in the medical worker communities.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.840
There's a strike in Milwaukee among health care providers when they won't go to work

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.680
unless they're made of vaccine priority.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.680
Yeah.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.680
And none of that happened in life.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.400
Yeah, no, that's a totally reasonable thing for them to do were that unreasonable thing

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.400
to occur.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.400
Sure.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.400
Yeah.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.060
Also in the scenario, there's a groundswell of college activism taking place in the social

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:23.300
media app that's created for this exercise called Unequal.

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:27.560
On the exercise, quote, another group that was not generally affected by the government's

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:32.200
Corovax promotion efforts were college students, especially those attending school on the east

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.020
and west coasts.

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.400
Public health officials had no explanation for the lack of vaccine uptake among this

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.600
population until protests began at several college campuses, including UC Berkeley, the

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.480
University of Washington, Reed College, Harvard, and the University of Chicago.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.960
The focus of these protests was the lack of access to Corovax, particularly for populations

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.620
in less developed countries like Haiti, Guatemala, and Cameroon.

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.880
The college students involved declared that they would not accept Corovax until it was

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.200
made available in terms of both access and expense to everyone in the world who wanted

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.200
it.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200
Right.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200
This, too, did not happen in the real world.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.200
Right, right, right.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.200
Yeah.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.160
The reason these events are included in the scenario is the same as anything that is in

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.160
there.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.920
They present an opportunity for the participants to wrestle with challenges in the field of

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.440
medical messaging.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:18.040
None of it's real, but it portrays situations that are close enough to seeming real for

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.320
them to be effective in role-playing situations.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.680
And that's enough for Alex to think that it's all secretly real.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:35.160
Yeah, I mean, it seems fun whenever these studies predict events that do wind up occurring,

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.600
because you're like, ooh, look at how good those predictions are.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:43.700
But it's really just based on the shit we've already seen that's going to almost certainly

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:49.680
happen again, because people don't learn lessons from things exactly like the thing that we're

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.680
writing now.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.120
So Mike is a weirdo, I've decided.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:02.280
And he reads this passage, and again, normal people would have checked out already, but

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.280
I'm not normal.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.920
I still want to hear more.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:07.080
I mean, this gets worse, Alex.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.480
Severe side effects, including swollen legs, severe joint pain, and encephalitis potentially

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:16.880
resulting in seizures, seizure disorders, or death occasionally occurred word for word

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.520
from the document.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.720
Something now happening in Max.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.240
We've got to add all the B-roll to that.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.120
So what Mike is failing to mention here is the passage he's reading is about the side

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.120
effects.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.220
It's not for the Corvex human vaccine.

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.320
It's from the section about the vaccine for animals.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.880
There's an added bit of comedy in that he's reading a quote from a fake email that the

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:40.720
scenario created in order to depict an exchange of information about an animal vaccine, and

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.560
then Mike's dumb ass is pretending it's a document talking about human side effects.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.560
Just amazing.

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.960
That is real, real bummer town level shit.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:55.000
Here's what he read in context, what the actual thing says, quote, in 2021 a coronavirus caused

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000
an outbreak in region seven, parenthetically Southeast Asia, in the hoofed mammal populations.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.120
Our researchers developed and produced in-house an effective vaccine against the infection.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.160
Its subsequent approval and use successfully ended the outbreak in the region.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.120
While largely effective in preventing infection, severe side effects, including swollen legs,

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.200
severe joint pain and encephalitis, potentially resulting in seizures, seizure disorder or

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.280
death occasionally occurred.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.720
Given the millions of vaccinations required for region seven, this resulted in measurable

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.120
losses in the animal population.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.880
This is critical to understand.

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.280
If this document actually said what these dumdums were claiming it was, they wouldn't

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.120
resort to tactics like this.

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.460
This is so manipulative, it's nonsense.

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:35.460
This is bullshit.

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:38.160
If it were truly a smoking gun, they'd just be able to read it.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.520
They wouldn't have to pretend that they were reading this fake email from the document

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.320
as if it's a real thing about a human vaccine.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:52.400
What's the point of having these things if you're just going to highlight like one paragraph

01:27:52.400 --> 01:28:00.480
from every other chapter and then just combine them into a single double-spaced page?

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.480
You know?

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.480
Why?

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.480
Yeah.

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.480
Fuck off.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.520
So Mike reads a passage about conspiracy theories that go around.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.160
And Alex gets so excited that he has to read it himself.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160
Oh boy.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.240
I think it's because he's like, I want to maybe use a cut of me saying this later, like

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.600
in a John Bowne report, and I don't want to have this weirdo reading it.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.560
I want it to be in my voice.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.380
Conspiracy theories also profited across social media suggesting that the virus had been purposely

01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:30.720
created and introduced to the population by drug companies or that it had escaped from

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.180
a government lab secretly testing bio-weapons.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:41.860
This is in 2017 right after Fauci says a virus will be released.

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.860
It's going to happen.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:43.920
It's going to challenge Trump.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.480
It's going to be a surprise operation.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.140
Fauci didn't say that.

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:50.120
In the speech that he was given, we've talked about this, he was talking about how every

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.280
administration deals with an unforeseen health crisis.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.640
And he said that conspiracy theories would abound that it would escape from a government

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.640
lab just 20 years after Alex started saying that every four months.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.640
Yeah.

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.640
That's interesting too.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.640
Yeah.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.440
It's like, we listened to that 2003 episode and now it's just saying foot and mouth came

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.440
out of port and down.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.440
Yeah.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.440
The same thing.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.480
It's like, yeah, of course they would add that scenario in there.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.740
That's what you do.

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:17.880
That's one of the things that's like, oh, this is giving texture to the world.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.880
Exactly.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.080
And it's not even a major point.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.040
That's not even like...

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.040
It's just mentioned.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.040
Yeah.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040
Yeah.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040
And it's after the fact.

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.440
It's after the entire course of the outbreak happens in terms of the document.

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:35.360
Call me when conspiracy theorists in this paper decide to inspire people to overthrow

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.360
the country.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:43.980
So Mike, I mean, look, some of this stuff, I don't know.

01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.760
Like someone who's really generous might be able to say he's just sloppy.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.760
Sure.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:52.720
But there's intention behind the misrepresentations he's presenting.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.480
I don't believe that he did this by accident.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.320
Someone incredibly generous, neither of which are we.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320
No.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.640
Also, I think...

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.120
I heard this and I got really worried.

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.040
This took me two weeks to read, by the way.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.960
The wording, it weaves everything together so you're like, what is going on?

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:12.960
Is this an exercise?

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.160
Is this real?

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:16.760
I was just trying to do the best job I can to extract everything.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.480
So if you had five minutes, you could just understand what's happening.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.480
Oh my God.

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.480
Bad.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.480
Oh my God.

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.480
Bad.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.480
Super bad.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.480
Oh my God.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.540
Some things require more than five minutes.

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.540
That's a good thing.

01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:29.540
Sure.

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:34.880
I can't imagine taking two weeks and then coming away with that sort of sewn together

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.640
quotation that misrepresents the point.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:42.920
I don't understand, too, being able to look at this and not be able to understand fairly

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.480
quickly what it is.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:48.920
I understand if you see it out of context, completely out of context, it could be confusing

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:49.920
for a bit.

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:50.920
Sure.

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.920
But if you sat down...

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.080
Perhaps you only had five minutes to hear about it.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.080
Sure.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:31:00.480
If you sat down and actually read a couple pages, it explains the exercise at the beginning.

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:01.480
Yeah, of course.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.480
It explains...

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.480
I don't know.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.480
I don't know.

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:08.760
It starts with, Dear Alex Jones, please, we're explaining the exercise.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.080
You literally can't use this for your propaganda.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.760
I really, really don't understand the idea of anyone sitting with this for an hour, let

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:21.080
alone two weeks, and coming away with any confusion about, oh, also there is a disclaimer

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.560
that Alex shouldn't use this.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.160
Let me read this, quote, this is a hypothetical scenario designed to illustrate the public

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.680
health risk communication challenges that could potentially emerge during a naturally

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:34.640
occurring infectious disease outbreak requiring development and distribution of a novel and

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:39.320
or investigational drugs, vaccines, therapeutics, or other medical countermeasures.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.320
The infectious pathogen...

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.640
Oh, I just did an Alex.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.440
The infectious pathogen, medical countermeasures, characters, news media, excerpts, social media

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:52.080
posts, and government agency responses described herein are entirely fictional.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.080
So there is a disclaimer.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.960
But that does not stop these dorks.

01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:58.960
Doesn't sound like it.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.840
Dan, it's about what they're not saying.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:01.840
Mm-hmm.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:02.840
Yeah.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.840
It's like jazz.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:04.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.840
So here's Mike.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.840
Two weeks of study.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.200
Two weeks of intense study.

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.960
And now he's going to bring back up this power outage.

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.960
Okay.

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.860
A week before Corovax was released for distribution in the United States, the power grid at the

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:22.540
Grand Coulee Dam in eastern Washington state experienced a catastrophic failure.

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:27.640
While the event did not destroy any infrastructure or result in any deaths, it did cause widespread

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:32.560
power outages in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.500
Though power was restored within a day of the initial outage, blackouts continued plaguing

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.440
these areas over the next three weeks.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.320
And the resurgence of the banned widespread panic.

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:43.560
Why would they put that in a vaccine exercise?

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.220
Because they're all behind all this.

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:48.120
They're showing off to their people.

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.120
Keep going.

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.120
Yeah.

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.680
So Mike seems so confused by why they would include something about a power outage in

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.860
this document about a medical situation.

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:58.800
But if he'd actually read it, he shouldn't be confused.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.640
It's literally spelled out in the exercise.

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.900
This is very clearly to get participants to consider how to be effective in getting messaging

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:08.700
out in a real non-digital world.

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:12.440
From the scenario, quote, state and local public health officials scrambled to hand

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.560
deliver flyers printed and copied at local emergency operation centers using backup generators

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.440
to explain vaccine prioritization and POD information.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:25.600
This extremely time-consuming effort exhausted the public health workforce already stretched

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.640
thin by the epidemic response and several years of budget cuts.

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.760
But it was ultimately successful.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.800
Early vaccination rates in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho were very similar to other states

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.060
and in some cases above average.

01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:43.320
In spite of this success, the incident underscored the shortcomings associated with relying solely

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.280
on electronic communication strategies.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:49.280
That what I just read to you is immediately after the part he was reading.

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.400
Yeah, it makes it very clear.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.120
Almost impossible to misunderstand.

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.120
Yes.

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.760
There's no way to believe that he took two weeks to read this and couldn't understand

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:58.040
what the point was.

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:02.680
This is either someone who's deeply disturbed and needs help, needs like mental help, or

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.900
he's a willful liar.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.800
And I'm more inclined to believe it's the latter.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:15.080
Yeah, I mean, this is not a generous interpretation, but the idea of these people reading a document

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.600
that tells them what it says absolutely does confuse them.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.080
Like on a deep level.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.760
Because they can't just be like, oh, like that's not a thing they can do.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.400
They can't read an explanation of what's happening and go, oh, well they're being honest with

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.400
me.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.400
I understand that.

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.400
You know?

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.400
I understand that dynamic.

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:41.400
Now, if they weren't copy and pasting various parts of the document in order to create a

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:46.540
misrepresentation of what it says, if they weren't pretending that side effects and animals

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:51.960
were actually humans, like if they weren't doing stuff like that, then maybe I would

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.520
be like, oh, this is just suspiciousness run amuck.

01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.120
But there is work that's been done in order to misrepresent this document.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.360
Not two weeks' worth, but there has been work done.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.360
No.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:15.120
Now, Jordan, Rob, do he's about to have his mind blown, man.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.120
This doc.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.120
Okay.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120
Okay.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.120
It's crazy.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.120
Let's go to the next one.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:25.240
You look at the similarity to the names, spars, COVID, and then we have SARS COVID two.

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.240
Okay.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.240
Same.

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.240
Almost same exact name.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.880
And they wrote this three or four years before they added a number and they, and they, and

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:36.640
they just added a P, they added a P and a V.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.640
Exactly.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.640
It's really crazy.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.820
Where's the V?

01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:45.200
It's almost like scientists aren't interested too much in different naming conventions when

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.760
it comes to viruses.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.840
And instead it's almost a classification.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.840
Yeah.

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.840
Yeah.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.560
Spars, it means St. Paul acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which is similar to

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:56.560
SARS COV-2.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.160
Yeah, sure.

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:02.000
The reason that this is probably, it's named after the city that it popped up in.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.920
And the reason that it is that, and we've had this whole thing about not naming things

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:12.480
after places is because that whole thing is a world health organization convention that

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.200
you don't name something after the city or the location where it came up and the world

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.560
health organization isn't involved in this exercise.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:24.160
Because that would give a massive incentive for people to be like, never fuck with those

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160
people ever again.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.160
Don't go to St. Paul.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.160
Exactly.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.860
Plus this was in 2017, which is fairly shortly after the world health organization changed

01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:33.000
its best practices about that whole thing.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.280
So there may have been some lingering confusion about naming conventions.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.280
Sure.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:41.280
I almost guarantee that if the world health organization had made this scenario, it probably

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.600
would have named the condition SARS COV-2 and like Rob Dew would have a heart attack.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.800
Yeah, no, he would shit.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.800
Yeah.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.800
He would just shit.

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:50.800
Yeah.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:51.800
Fuck it.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:52.800
I might shit.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:53.800
Yeah.

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.800
It is not weird.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.800
No.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.800
At all.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.800
No.

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:58.800
It's a convention.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:36:59.800
It's a naming convention.

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.040
It's a fucking taxonomy, you know?

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.160
It's like kingdom phylum, you know, it's yeah.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.520
In terms of like a conspiracy theory, this is the one that rises to the level of, eh,

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.520
eh, eh.

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:11.520
How about that?

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.160
Their names are, yeah.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.160
That's how they name stuff.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160
Yep.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.400
There's another connection with the real world though.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.760
Do they want them to name viruses like they do hurricanes?

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.840
Like this is virus Maria.

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.800
Is that what they would feel better about?

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800
Maybe.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800
Well.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.040
Let's flip another thing in this, uh, this next clip that, uh, that it is kind of similar

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.320
to real world.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.920
Then we have the inflated fatality estimates.

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:39.840
Initially they write in the scenario, CDC fatality rate, almost 5%, who fatality rate

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.640
14 and a half percent.

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:44.800
And then the fatality rate of over 64 is 50%.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.120
This is fair.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:51.080
The inflated death estimates are in the scenario, but they're there for a few reasons.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.520
The first is that the scenario is supposed to depict reality and the reality of dealing

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:58.560
with a completely new disease is that sometimes you get some things off.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.920
One of the main reasons is actually spelled out in the document.

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.040
If you read it quote at the outset of the sparse outbreak, physician's understanding

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:10.360
of the disease stem primarily from extremely severe cases resulting in pneumonia or hypoxia.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.660
There required hospitalization and extensive medical treatment, mild cases of the disease,

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:18.880
which produced symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, and malaise were often perceived

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:24.040
as the flu by people who had them and consequently often went untreated and undiagnosed by medical

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:25.040
personnel.

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.800
As a result, early case fatality estimates were inflated.

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.160
This is a real dynamic that we've seen play out in the COVID-19 outbreak, but it's been

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.640
true in other past outbreaks as well.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.960
The issue is that you can't always assume that it's going to be the case or else you're

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.120
putting yourself in a position to get blindsided by a super deadly condition that you happen

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.160
to underestimate.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.280
It's far better to be over cautious with new diseases than to just let them go and see

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280
what happens.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.680
Again, this is what we talked about, diseases have killed almost all of us.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.680
Yeah, be careful.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.680
We should be crazy.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.680
Be careful with that.

01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:58.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.560
So the other reason that this is in the document is because it's made as an exercise for medical

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.680
communicators.

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:08.240
And what could be a greater communication challenge than having been wrong initially?

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.360
The study question for this section is quote, how can health authorities best meet public

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.920
demands for critical information such as what is the health threat and what do I know about

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.960
it when the crisis is still unfolding and not all the facts are known?

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:24.420
If you understand this in the context it was written and used, all of the things that they're

01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:28.360
trying to create paranoia about just sound fucking stupid.

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:29.360
Yeah.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.360
It's awesome.

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360
Yeah.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360
It is awesome.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.400
Dude, this next thing that they try and make like a conspiracy out of, holy shit, these

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:37.400
guys are dumb.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.400
All right, sell me on it.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.020
Let's go to the antivirals is the next slide.

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:46.200
In this scenario, they have one called Calosovir, all right?

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.880
Teens in an IR, side effects, nausea, headaches, vomiting, and body aches.

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.080
There's actually a viral video of a boy in this scenario taking the Colosovir and then

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.840
immediately projectile vomiting everywhere.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:56.840
Yeah.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:57.840
They even have videos of their scenario.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:58.840
It's crazy.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.480
And then, and they go back to it, then three years later, it's Remdesivir.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:04.680
And this is not the real name.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.820
This is the name they gave it later.

01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.800
It's actually got a different name that they, that it's, that it's made from.

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.040
And remember they said Remdesivir was this new experimental thing they just developed.

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.040
Exactly.

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.040
But they had the damn name three years before.

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.040
Same side effects.

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.040
Nausea, constipation, vomiting.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.040
They only changed a few letters.

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:20.040
It's all about rubbing in their faces.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.040
It is.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.040
They really do.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.200
This is smoking gun.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.040
If these dudes cared at all, they could learn why these drugs have similar names.

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.600
They could learn so much.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.600
Yeah.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:33.640
These are generic names for the drug, which is to say they're not brand names.

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.640
Right.

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:37.640
The convention for naming generic drugs is to have the suffix of the word indicate what

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.720
the drug is.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.680
For instance, antiviral drugs generally end in the suffix V-I-R for viral.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:48.080
This isn't universal, but most of them end up with this, uh, this, and that's why these

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.080
two do.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.080
Sure.

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:54.440
You know, you can go down the list of antiviral, and then also like penicillin derived drugs

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.280
have cillin, like a box of cillin.

01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.280
Right, right, right, right.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.280
It's how drugs are named.

01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280
It's very simple.

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.080
It's, and it's done that way on purpose to be simple so people don't have to, yeah, no.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:07.440
The people making the scenario were striving to fill it with realistic details, so they

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.360
followed accepted conventions for naming the drug they made up in it.

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.800
Alex and Rob Dew are so stupid and so addicted to thinking coincidences mean something, that

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.400
they take that as a sign that the document is mocking them.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.400
This is nuts.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.400
Yeah.

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:30.280
It's, it's like just such a, just don't talk and just scream repeatedly, I refuse to learn

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.280
anything!

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:32.280
Yeah, it's outrageous.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.840
Oh, they both end in I-O.

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.160
I refuse!

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.320
I refuse to read the first page of Google!

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:39.320
No!

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.920
They just changed a few letters.

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:47.040
You could type any of these questions into Google and the first result would tell you

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.040
what.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.680
Yeah, it's really easy to understand these things.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680
It's so easy.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.880
So this, this clip is just where everything turns to parody.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.200
Rob is in the middle of complaining about like medical ads and stuff.

01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.780
Yeah, and then, and then you have the native ads, which are put out by the vaccine companies

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:04.800
saying the vaccine is safe and effective.

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.800
And that's all they do.

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:12.280
Vitamin Mineral Fusion is a remarkable product and it's back in stock 40% off at infowarsstor.com

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.280
right now.

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.280
Don't.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.280
Don't do that to me.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.280
It's almost like whoever edited this did that as a joke.

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:19.280
Did it on purpose, yeah.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.280
That's, that's just too much.

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.320
He's complaining about like medical ads.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:23.320
That is too much.

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.800
And then in the middle of it.

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:28.900
It's safe, they, these people, all they do is put out these ads that say things are safe

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:29.900
and effective.

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:34.360
Anyways, let's go to a commercial of Alex saying that his stuff is safe and effective.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.360
Oh wow.

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:42.440
So yeah, they, they've, they've gone, gone a while now and Alex realizes.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.440
We did it.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.040
We, we, we have not done it.

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.040
Oh no.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.040
We're all humans.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.240
We're all people that care about freedom.

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.240
I get upset.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.240
Rob gets upset.

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.020
As we spend weeks studying this, we finally get on air and it's just, it's so upsetting.

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:57.800
We've covered 10% of what's in front of us.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:00.400
Every bit of this is just as insane or more insane.

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.160
I haven't even gotten to the part where they admit they're doing this to kill you and get,

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.160
and save the earth.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.000
I mean, they admit they're doing this.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.480
That part is not, not in the document.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.480
They specifically say they're not doing this.

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:18.160
Although that would introduce a very interesting medical messaging challenge.

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.720
That would be an interesting medical, okay, let's say in this scenario, our secret plan

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:33.040
has gotten out and gotten into the hands of the least reliable and credulous person.

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.360
Now what do we do?

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.480
You can have, what do we do?

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.480
Let it go?

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.480
I guess.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.480
Yeah.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.680
Hit the panic button.

01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:45.440
So yeah, I, I, this is, this is where I checked out.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:47.360
Yeah, that's a good place to check out.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:48.640
Well, no, this next clip.

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640
Oh, okay.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.640
Okay.

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:56.600
I should have checked out whenever Weird Mike was doing that stuff about the cut and

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:57.600
paste job that he did.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.600
Naturally.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.640
That's when you have like, all right, your credibility's out the window, I got to get

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.640
out of here.

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:02.640
Gone.

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:03.640
That's what I'm talking about.

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:04.640
This show is about giving too many chances.

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.640
Okay.

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:08.000
Um, and here's where I was like, Alex, go fuck yourself.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.840
Spend a few minutes just in summation of, of the bombshells that have been released

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:13.840
here.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:19.120
I mean, to me, the strongest thing is the drug name's the same before a drug even exists.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.560
The virus name the same before they release it.

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.560
Them running the lab.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:27.560
I mean, this is smoking gun one in 85 trillion quadrillion.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.560
Wow.

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:34.560
So the, the, the thing that, that is so convincing for Alex is that there's similarities in the

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:43.000
name of Spars Cove and SARS-CoV-2 and the, uh, the name of two antiviral drugs end in

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
the same suffix.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
This is nothing.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Yep.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
This is outrageous.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:53.120
Alex started promoting this on Thursday and this is the best he can do on Sunday or on

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.120
Saturday.

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.120
Wow.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.120
It's, it's offensive to my professionalism.

01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:03.080
What blew me away was that naming conventions can be used in a fictitious scenario also.

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.080
Yeah.

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:09.720
I never would have imagined that these people would have done something so insane as to

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:16.440
stick to basic borderline universally standardized naming conventions.

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.600
I'd listened to over an hour of this Saturday thing that they were doing and then Alex said

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.600
that.

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:28.240
And then Abdu brought up, oh, also, uh, they use some of the same hashtags and fake tweets

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.480
that they have on there that people used in real life.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.720
I said, I gotta go.

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.720
Nope.

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:33.720
Nope.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.720
Don't care.

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:35.720
Nope.

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:36.720
Throwing things.

01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:37.720
No.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.720
Immediate throwing of things.

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.720
That means nothing.

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.720
Immediate throwing of things.

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:41.720
Yeah.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:46.660
So anyway, I got really excited because, um, you know, I think after our last present day

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.200
episode I was, I was in the doldrums.

01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:50.200
I felt bad.

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.200
Sure.

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.200
Sure.

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.800
It was a very weird, uh, defense of Matt Gaetz.

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.160
And this was a promise of a primary source.

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.320
And, and no, no, I mean, that's what we found eventually.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.320
Yeah, of course.

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.440
But, but Jordan, I mean like we were, you know, we talked over the weekend and I was

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:10.320
telling you, like, I really think that, you know, I, we've got to stay in the present

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320
for Sunday.

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.880
I think Alex is probably going to have some, uh, some, something.

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:15.880
Yeah.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:16.880
He's going to have something.

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.980
I thought for sure this Matt Gaetz thing would continue.

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.920
Because Matt Gaetz has had more information come out, it looks worse and worse.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:30.240
I thought that Alex would either have to double down and triple down or he'd have to cut bait.

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:32.340
I didn't know what he was going to do.

01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:37.080
And so I was like, well, I think in the interest of keeping people up to date on the, the goings

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:44.920
on of this, this, and then I dig in and here we are, we got, we got a new lockstep document.

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:50.200
And it's nice because, you know, I think, I think sometimes one of the things I enjoy the most

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:56.320
about doing this show is the opportunity to understand something like this document that's

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.880
called, it causes such fear for people.

01:46:58.880 --> 01:46:59.880
Yeah.

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:07.000
Like to be able to, to see this, uh, Freddy Krueger on paper and understand it for what

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.120
it is and understand like some of the very interesting lessons that actually could have

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.560
been learned and, and, and, you know, that, that people are doing these, these kinds of

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:19.840
exercises that they probably did pay dividends.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:26.080
Like we probably didn't see enough of the lessons learned, but on a, on a granular level

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:30.920
in terms of some people being able to better deal with the challenges that came up over

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.880
the course of this, this pandemic, this probably helped a lot.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:35.880
Right.

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:36.880
Yeah.

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:37.880
And I appreciate that.

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:38.880
I like getting that glimpse.

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:39.880
Yeah.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.800
It was a little bit like if, uh, Jamie Lee Curtis was running away from Michael Myers

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:45.800
the whole time.

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:50.480
And then at the end it was like, lady, I've been trying to deliver you this letter from

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.480
15 years ago.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.480
You've been served.

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.480
I've been hanging onto it.

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.480
Yeah.

01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.040
That whole thing of just like, this was a complete waste of time for everyone involved.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.040
Why are we here?

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:06.600
I honestly enjoy having my time wasted like this far more than I enjoy most of present

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.900
day Alex Jones though.

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.600
At least you're having fun running away from Michael Myers, you know, you're not just sitting

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.760
at your home being like, this is a waste of time.

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.760
I'm getting a jog in.

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:15.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.040
I'm getting some calories burning.

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.040
Yeah.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.040
I'm getting that cardio.

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.040
Yeah.

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.040
It's good stuff.

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.040
So thank you, Alex.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.720
I don't look forward to him constantly bringing up this document.

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:27.720
Nope.

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:28.720
Nope.

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:29.720
Uh, cause it's a big old zero.

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.720
Yeah.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:33.480
Uh, but you know, Hey, whenever these things happen, it's often good for us to spend time

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:36.120
looking at it before it gets too out of control.

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.120
Too boring.

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.120
Yeah.

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.720
Cause I think, I think that this is something that definitely could have, could stand to

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.800
have traction in other communities or conspiracy spaces.

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.800
Possible.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.800
Yeah.

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:47.800
Hopefully Tucker covers it.

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.800
Yeah.

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.800
That'd be funny.

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.800
That would be funny.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800
Oh boy.

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.800
Anyway, we'll be back Jordan.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:55.800
Will we?

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.800
Yeah, we will.

01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.800
But then we have a website.

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.800
We do have a website.

01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.800
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:00.800
You bet.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.800
We're also on Twitter.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.800
We are on Twitter.

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:03.800
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:04.800
Go to bed Jordan.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.420
We're also on the fake social media app from the scenario unequal.

01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.420
We are on unequal.

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:12.440
And if you'd like to tell us an equal, and if you could please find a local charity or

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.120
bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work right now, we'll be back.

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:17.120
But until then I'm Neo.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:18.120
I'm Leo.

01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:19.120
I'm DZX Clark.

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.120
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.160
So what do you think about them apples?

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.160
Andy in Kansas.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.160
You're on the air.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.160
Thanks for holding.

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.160
Hello Alex.

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.160
I'm a first time caller.

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.160
I'm a huge fan.

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:29.160
I love your work.

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:36.680
