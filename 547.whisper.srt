4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,920

Knowledgefight

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,440
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,040
Shang, we are the bad guys, Knowledgefight

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,240
Damn and Jordan, Knowledgefight

00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,040
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

Need, I need money

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

I'm Jordan

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,240
We're Gible Dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,040
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,640
Oh indeed we are, Dan

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,040

Jordan

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Quick question

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,840
What's up?

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,640
What's your bright spot today?

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,640
My bright spot today, Jordan, is, uh, hey

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,440
I finally got an appointment to get a vaccine

34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,640
Yay!

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
Oh yeah, thank you

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Very exciting

37
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,240
Um, it's been, I've been, uh, I'm past due in terms of, like, the groupings and what have you

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,640
and I've been trying to, uh, find a place where I can go get a shot

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,640
and I'm finally, as people are listening to this, it comes out on Friday

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,440
Oh that's true

41
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm going tomorrow

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,840
to get my shot, so, uh, I'm excited about that

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,240
I'm very excited about that

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm excited about embarking on this next chapter of, uh, life

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
We're free!

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Or something approximating it

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,640
Something like that

49
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Yeah, and, uh, also as a sort of byproduct of this, this bright spot

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,440
Um, I don't know if there's going to be, you know, any kind of side effects

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,640
like a fever or, you know, tiredness or anything

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,240
and so, in the interest of that, I'm going to give myself the weekend for just self and rest

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Recuperation

54
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,040
Um, and so our Monday episode, uh, will actually come out on Wednesday

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,440
Yes

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
We're gonna push that back just, uh, for the sake of

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,040
Safety, better safe than sorry

58
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,840
I'd like to sit around and drink some tea, maybe, or something, you know, like

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,240
If there's anything that the pandemic has taught us, it's maybe be overly cautious from time to time

60
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Yeah, you know, it's sort of, uh, I wanna, I wanna be like that image of what my parents thought I was doing

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
when I stayed home from school sick

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
When I was in school

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,440
Oh, he's just watching the Price is Right like everybody else does

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
Just sipping soup

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,040
Just sitting there with a little blanket on

66
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,840
Just broth

67
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

68
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Letting those, those fumes open up my pores and my, uh

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,340
Absolutely

70
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,840
My sinuses

71
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640
Yeah, you got it

72
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Um, yeah, so that's, that's exciting

73
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,440
That's wonderful

74
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
Yeah, how about you?

75
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,840
We're all very excited

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,240
Uh, my bright spot, Dan, is, uh, Godspeed You Black Emperor

77
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Yeah, you were telling me it's a new album

78
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Has put out a new album

79
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,440
And it is spectacular

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,840
Yeah

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
It is so good

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,240
Mhm

83
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,440
They're on, like, almost 25 years as a band or something

84
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
They're incredible

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
It's fantastic

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,040
They still got it, Dan

87
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,640
I feel like you and I were supposed to do something and you couldn't because you had to listen to the album on repeat

88
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,240
I was too busy listening to Godspeed

89
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
Uh, hey, work can't get done

90
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Sorry, I would, look, I would love to help

91
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,440
But, uh, Godspeed released a new album

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,040
So I'm gonna have to listen to this 40-minute opus

93
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,640
I understand

94
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,040
Yeah

95
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
I understand

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,440
Um, so, Jordan, today we have an interesting, uh, little bit to go over

97
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,440
I don't know if you've been able to keep unaware of some of the news

98
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,640
Some of it I have been unable to stay unaware of

99
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,040
Right, so we'll get into some of that

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,640
Alright

101
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Oh, boy

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Um, but before we do, let's take a little moment to say hello and thank you to some new wonks

103
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Oh, that's a great idea

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,040
First, uh, this person, J-D-O, J-D-O, I don't know how to pronounce that

105
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Sure

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
J-D-O

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,640
Um, they, uh, also, uh, were kind enough to mention, uh, keep, uh, tell me about an event that's coming up in Oklahoma

108
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Uh-huh

109
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,240
Where, uh, all kinds of weirdos are speaking and, man, I wanna go

110
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
I believe Mike Adams is giving a speech

111
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Oh, no

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,440
Uh, I really would like to go, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it

113
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,040
But anyway, thank you, J-D-O

114
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm a policy wonk

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
You're now a policy wonk

116
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Thank you

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Next

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Oi, hawkin

Oi, hawkin

123
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,540
Uh, this person also wanted me to give a shout-out to the Knowledge Fighters

124
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,040
Apparently there's a Discord, uh, uh, server?

125
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Is that what it's called?

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
I have no idea

127
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Discord is beyond me

128
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Yeah, me too

129
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Um, but, uh, there's apparently a place where, uh, listeners of the show congregate and, uh,

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
chat, uh, up

131
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
And I've heard it's a lot of fun

132
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Oh, that's great!

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Yeah, so

134
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,040
That's really great that I'm just now finding out about it

135
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040

Oh, boy

159
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
I think they said that they wanted me to mispronounce

160
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Mispronounce it?

161
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Yeah, okay

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

184
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,040
How's your 401k doing, bro?

185
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

186
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Let's just get down to business

187
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
We ain't making that money off that heroin

188
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Why you pimps so good?

189
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
My, my neck is freakishly large

190
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
I declare info war on you

191
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Thank you so much, Treadmark

192
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Yes, thank you very much, Treadmark

193
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Treadmark also wanted me to give a shout out to, uh, Reddit board, ah shit, I forgot the

194
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
name of it

195
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Um, R The Donald, I believe was the one that he really wanted to get out there

196
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
So Jordan, there's been some news

197
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Yes, Dan

198
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,040
So I'd been all ready to go back to 2003 for today's episode, have some fun, learning about

199
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
the past and what have you

200
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Of course

201
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
But then at the last minute all my plans got thrown into whack

202
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
As is always the case

203
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Alex went down to the border, he was looking for a soul to steal

204
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,040
And on Wednesday he released a video of himself accosting somebody who was transporting some

205
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,040
children, possibly recklessly in the back of a station wagon

206
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Sure

207
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Alex, or maybe it was more of a van, I don't know, I don't know car types

208
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Anyway, Alex and his associates yell at the guy driving the car about how he's been caught

209
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
smuggling people

210
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Sure

211
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
And it is a huge mess

212
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Uh huh

213
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I don't know what all the details of this situation are at this point, but I do know

214
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,040
that I don't believe for a second that Alex and his dumb posse found someone just smuggling

215
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
children casually

216
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,040
I'm gonna wait to dig into this until there's a little bit more public information because

217
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
I could see this going a couple different directions

218
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,040
And honestly, Alex better keep his fingers crossed because it looks like a couple things

219
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,040
in that video that he released could be crimes

220
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Oh, that's not good

221
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,040
He's sitting there banging like on the roof of a car trying to physically stop it from

222
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
leaving

223
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Yeah

224
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Which could be a problem

225
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,040
He's acting in ways that some might interpret as defamatory

226
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,040
I mean, it does a little bit sound like Alex Jones just started attacking Clark Griswold

227
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,040
on the way to the fucking theme park

228
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm not a legal expert, but it really looks like this video is an open and shut case of

229
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,040
defamation against a charity that is alleged to be involved in this smuggling

230
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,040
This is Catholic Charities RGV

231
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Their address and signs are clearly shown in the video

232
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
That's not good

233
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
And the accusation is very clear from Alex's actions that this charity is essentially a

234
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
front for smuggling

235
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
That's probably defamatory

236
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
This organization is the Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley

237
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,040
And the specific building that Alex was staking out was the Humanitarian Crisis Relief Center

238
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
that they began operating last summer

239
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Right

240
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,040
According to their website, this is at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen, Texas

241
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,040
And quote, the center provides a place for the countless men, women, and children and

242
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,040
infant refugees to rest, have a warm meal, a shower, and change into clean clothing

243
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,040
as well as receive medicine and other supplies before continuing on their journey

244
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,040
So Alex was like, quick, someone's acting Christ-like, destroy them!

245
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Yep

246
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay

247
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,040
If you look into this specific charity, it becomes a little interesting that Alex would

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
choose this one to focus on

249
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,040
The organization was started by a nun named Sister Norma Pimentel

250
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
who was a very fierce and public critic of Trump's border policies

251
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,040
To her credit, she was also a vocal opponent of Obama's policies, but that probably doesn't matter to Alex

252
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,040
She wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post in February 2020 titled

253
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,040
quote, President Trump don't ignore the suffering at the border caused by your policies

254
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,040
In 2019, she was invited to participate in what was called a roundtable conversation

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
about issues at the border with Trump himself

256
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
That one was called Back in the Habit, I believe

257
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Sister Pimentel was disappointed by what she experienced

258
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,040
as she discussed in an interview with Texas Monthly

259
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Quote, Trump asked every single person at the table to say something

260
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
and I realized that when they were speaking, they were just reaffirming what it was

261
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,040
that he had talked about and congratulating him

262
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,040
I realized that the roundtable was about listening to and reaffirming his plans

263
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,040
He didn't really give local people an opportunity to say anything

264
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
That is unsurprising

265
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Very recently, in March 2021, she was featured in an article in the Rio Grande Guardian

266
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
that begins like this

267
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Quote, the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley

268
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
thanks God for President Biden's decision to reverse the Trump administration's

269
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Migrant Protection Protocols policy

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Sister Norma Pimentel says it's God's plan to have asylum requests

271
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,040
of unaccompanied minors from Central America fully processed in the United States

272
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Sure, mere days ago, on April 4th

273
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Sister Pimentel was interviewed on Face the Nation

274
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
where she discussed how Biden's changes to Trump's policies have changed her work

275
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Okay, so you're saying that a few days ago

276
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Just a few days, perhaps even, what?

277
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
One or two days before this incident occurred

278
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Eh, right around

279
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,040
The person who began or started the very charity that Alex will accosted

280
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
and defamed

281
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Who has also been a long time public critic of Trump's policies

282
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,040
and again, for the sake of giving it up for moral clarity and consistency

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,040
was also a critic of Obama's policies

284
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,040
and is a critic of these new policies not going far enough

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,040
but inasmuch as they are representative of progress in the areas that she works in

286
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
she is congratulatory of them

287
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,040
So what you have just told me is that this was a completely extemporaneous event

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Alex was wandering around and heard the call to action

289
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
No, but here's the thing

290
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Instinctively ran to stop this human trafficking from occurring

291
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
No, but here's the thing

292
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,040
I can totally believe he doesn't know any of this

293
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I actually can totally believe that too

294
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
It could totally be a coincidence

295
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Yeah

296
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,040
I was looking into this charity and trying to understand a little bit more about it

297
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,040
and all these things like, oh, this is a person who is someone who Alex absolutely would target

298
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Oh, despise, yeah

299
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,040
But at the same time, I can totally see this just being a situation where

300
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,040
he went to McAllen, Texas

301
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,040
was hanging out outside waiting for the optics to be right

302
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Sure

303
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Then he created a scene

304
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Sure

305
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
did a publicity stunt

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
and blah, blah, blah, here we go

307
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Yeah, that sounds about right

308
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
But, better hope this doesn't go to court

309
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,040
because I think you could make a pretty compelling case

310
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,040
that Alex has a reason to have animus towards this organization

311
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
based on their political differences

312
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm struggling to live in a world where a judge might disagree with me

313
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
on what is very clearly an open and shut case

314
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I don't like living in a world where a judge is like, well, if you interpret that

315
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Nah, nah, nah, this is too obvious

316
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Yeah

317
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,040
So, I don't really care to deconstruct this video in and of itself

318
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,040
because it's just Alex yelling at a guy in a car

319
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
It's great

320
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,040
On April 8th, the Catholic Charities released a statement hoping to clarify

321
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,040
the various defamatory claims made by Alex

322
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
The response makes total sense

323
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
Fuck that guy

324
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,040
The only thing that I think is missing is a threat of legal action

325
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Yeah

326
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
But again, this is up to everybody themselves

327
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Of course

328
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,040
to deal with on their own terms and decide whether they want to go through that

329
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,040
rigmarole and that public embarrassment and difficulty

330
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Oh yeah, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy

331
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Nah

332
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
I would wish it on Alex though, so never mind

333
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
I would wish that on my worst enemy, yeah

334
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,040
I wouldn't wish whatever the person suing him would have to go through

335
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
all the difficulty

336
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Yeah

337
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,040
I understand why some people are reluctant to

338
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Totally

339
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,040
But boy, this seems like a pretty easy case

340
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,040
It shouldn't take too long to work its way through the courts

341
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Yeah

342
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I can imagine Alex giving a blustery speech about how he'll fight this or die

343
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Sure

344
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
And then a week later issuing a public apology

345
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Listen, I don't want to get in the way of nuns doing all their business

346
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Love nuns

347
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Nuns are good people, yeah

348
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Did you see Sister Act 2 back in the habit?

349
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
This is how I'm going to poach Jordan's joke

350
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
It was pretty great

351
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,040
So yeah, I don't want to talk about that video in and of itself

352
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
but what I thought might be interesting is seeing what happens on the 8th

353
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,040
because this is Thursday, this is after he's had the social media flare up

354
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
over this video

355
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Sure, he's had his moment

356
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,040
It's been posted, we went all kinds of viral and stuff

357
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Yeah, of course

358
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,040
And yeah, I wanted to see where he was at on the 8th

359
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Yeah, sure, let's see what happens

360
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
So here's another context drop from this show

361
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
I'm not okay

362
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,040
And is anybody the good guy in Ukraine?

363
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
They've been killing each other for so long, eastern and western Ukraine

364
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,040
It's like the half-cocks and McCoys

365
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
What?

366
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Is anybody the bad guy in Ukraine is a dark question to ask

367
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Well, you're focusing on a different part than I'm focusing on

368
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I understand that

369
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
The half-cocks and the McCoys?

370
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I don't know what to do with the half-cocks and the McCoys

371
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I just heard that and stroked out

372
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Yeah, I know that the people misspeak and whatever

373
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
And I'm not a nitpicker

374
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
But this is an out-of-context drop, first of all

375
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,040
And second of all, if there's anything that Alex's persona should know a lot about

376
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Oh, the Hatfields and the McCoys?

377
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Yeah, you think so?

378
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Yes

379
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Not the half-asses and the McCoys?

380
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
The half-cocks

381
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Yikes

382
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Oh man, now I want to start a gang called the half-cocks

383
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
And just never explain the name

384
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Sure

385
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
People are just like, why do they call them the half-cocks?

386
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,040
They say, we should get windbreakers

387
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Unrelated to this conversation entirely

388
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,040
That was just a random thought

389
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
We should just get windbreakers

390
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
So we're going to start here on April 8th

391
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,040
And I will say, it seems like Alex isn't even thinking about the border, this video, anything

392
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Of course

393
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
The alarm bells are hitting

394
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
China has now, with aircraft carriers and over a hundred ships

395
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
Thousands totaled

396
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Encircled Taiwan and has heavy bombers flying over it

397
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,040
The Taiwanese say they may start firing missiles any minute

398
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,040
That was this morning, last night there

399
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,040
All hell is breaking loose

400
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,040
The Russians are massing troops on the edge of Ukraine because Biden's sending in heavy weapons

401
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,040
And there are major artillery battles going on

402
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Between proxy U.S. and Russian forces and we are not the good guys in this

403
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,040
So we got a world war coming together here

404
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Yeah, that does sound pretty much the canary in the coal mine

405
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,040
This seems to be the line that Alex is taking now

406
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Which I find interesting because a couple days prior

407
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,040
He was really going hard on this SPARS document

408
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Sure

409
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
And then he went to the border and did a giant publicity stunt

410
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Right, right, right

411
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
And now it's world war

412
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Now we're moving on

413
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
This is confusing

414
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
I hear, I hear

415
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
This is chaotic

416
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,040
What I am hearing while he speaks is the advice of a lawyer in his ear going

417
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Don't explain anything about that

418
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Talk about

419
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
The more you talk about it

420
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Something else

421
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Do you remember what happened with the million dollar bounty? Do you remember?

422
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Oh no, I mean you're wrong about that

423
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
But it's weird that he starts the show like this

424
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
He does get into the video eventually

425
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Oh okay, well of course

426
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,040
So if there's a lawyer in his ear he forgets about it very quickly

427
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
You gotta keep the lawyer in there at all times

428
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,040
I think that one of the reasons that Alex is going on and starting his show

429
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Sort of leading with this idea about world war and all this

430
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Is because that day Biden was giving a speech

431
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,040
About gun control, regulation ideas

432
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Sure

433
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,040
And that fits more in those sets of narratives

434
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

435
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,040
I'll make more clear what I mean a little bit later as we go through

436
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,040
But the beginning of this show and a large portion of the top of it

437
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Is Alex playing Biden's speech and then just sort of rambling over it

438
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Sure

439
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Thank you for having the courage

440
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
He cares so much about violence

441
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
That's why Obama fought in the Arab Spring

442
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Fast and furious, killed millions

443
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Senator Blumenthal understands it

444
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
With the guns of what the Middle East and Mexico

445
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
A lot of the folks out here understand it

446
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
He transitioned weapons to terrorists in Mexico

447
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Thank you

448
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
With Obama

449
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,040
To turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the action

450
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,040
He's a gun running communist Chinese criminal

451
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Enough

452
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Yeah, enough of you funded terrorists

453
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
You drug dealing pedophile

454
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Oh boy, so it's that, it's that for a while

455
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,040
He's interrupting like Joe Biden is the highwayman

456
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,040
It's a little annoying

457
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Yeah, that's frustrating

458
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Yeah, so he keeps insisting that fast and furious

459
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Is the silver bullet that will take down the O'Biden administration

460
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Ooh, how long did it take to get there?

461
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
It seems like that should have happened way earlier

462
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,040
He kept calling Biden Obama and then

463
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
And then he just put it together

464
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Yeah, for a while he's been calling

465
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
That's so frustrating

466
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Oh, the reason I keep calling him Obama is because it's O'Biden

467
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
O'Biden was right there, guys

468
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
It was right there

469
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
It's not hard to get there

470
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Nope

471
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
This is Alex doing his level best at being Rush

472
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
This is why the right is terrible at comedy

473
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,040
They can't even pick up found jokes

474
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Yeah, terrible

475
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,040
I would say that if Alex were to get sued

476
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Over this video where he is, you know, in my opinion

477
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Probably defaming this charity

478
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Yeah, almost certainly

479
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,040
One of his best defenses might be that like

480
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Not many people saw it, you know, it's no big deal

481
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Unfortunately, here he is bragging

482
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
See, now there's where we get into trouble

483
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,040
And then what happened yesterday, two days ago

484
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,040
We put out the video that has probably 50 million views

485
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
I mean, it's just everywhere

486
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,040
And the smuggling going on, it's all illegal

487
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
He didn't sign an executive order

488
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
He didn't pass a law

489
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
He didn't repeal a law

490
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,040
He just said, surge us before he even stole the election

491
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,040
And then now he congratulates them on the great job they've done

492
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,040
And then there's the quote Catholic charity that's run by the Democratic Party

493
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Just one of the facilities there in McAllen, Texas

494
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,040
And there they are loading little kids in to a trunk like luggage

495
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,040
And we stop them, the police say, yeah, what you're doing is illegal, take them out

496
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
They go inside, we catch more cars doing it

497
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
We haven't even put that footage out

498
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I don't think you will

499
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
No, no

500
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
I suspect that that footage is not forthcoming

501
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Yeah

502
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
We'll see though

503
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Yeah, I mean, he's just bragging about how many people saw this

504
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Which I think works against his eventual probable argument that he's gonna need to make

505
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Yeah, he's not good at this

506
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
To downplay this

507
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
He's not good at this

508
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Yeah

509
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
This is not good

510
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
But then again, if he doesn't get sued and there's no legal trouble

511
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Then I guess he

512
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Wee

513
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Yeah

514
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Yep

515
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Anyway, Alex has this bee in his bonnet about the idea that people are saying that he staged this whole thing

516
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
He went down to the border and he staged it

517
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Well, it seems like he didn't like capture a coyote

518
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
No

519
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,040
So much as found people who were doing exactly what they said they were going to be doing

520
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
And accosted them

521
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Yeah

522
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,040
And then how does literally dozens of national newspapers said, Jones probably staged this

523
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
There are no crisis

524
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Yeah, I staged the McAllen police

525
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
I staged the kids being put in the trunk

526
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,040
I mean, if I could stage something like that with a hundred million dollar budget

527
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
I would be better than

528
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Is Joe Rogan gonna pay for it?

529
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
The top directors out there

530
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Alex couldn't think of one director

531
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Spielberg, no, he's a globalist

532
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Scorsese, no, he's a globalist

533
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Clinton Tarantino, I hate him

534
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
I hate that guy

535
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Ryan Johnson, no, I wasn't a fan of The Last Jedi

536
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
What else do we got?

537
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I'm still bitter that I wasn't in Guardians of the Galaxy

538
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
James Scott, yeah

539
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Add that one into the list

540
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,040
All he's got is Clint Eastwood

541
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Probably

542
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
So the media didn't say this about Alex

543
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,040
On April 7th, I couldn't find like any media outlets even really covering this publicity stunt

544
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Any actual media outlets, I mean there was like a gateway pundit

545
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Sure, sure, sure, sure

546
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
But there were a bunch of random people tweeting about it

547
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,040
And I think that Alex is just pretending that random tweets saying that he probably staged the videos

548
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,040
The same thing as dozens of media outlets and national newspapers covering it

549
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,040
What is new media other than tweets going national, man?

550
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
That's new media

551
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I think I've come up with this equation

552
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,040
And that is random tweets plus narcissism equals literally dozens of national newspapers

553
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
That's a good, that's a good equation

554
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Yeah, I think that's what's going on

555
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,040
So Alex is saying that everybody's saying that he just made this up and he staged it

556
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,040
And it's like back in 2009 when he covered Bilderberg Man

557
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
And everybody said that he was making it up

558
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
And the New York Times said

559
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:37,040
It did not exist and that I was having a full schizophrenic breakdown in the parking lot

560
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,040
That's because back then folks Bilderberg didn't exist

561
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Within two years it was all over the news

562
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Because back then the Drudge Report was not I guess run by CNN

563
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
I was told that CNN bought it two years ago

564
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
I didn't believe it, it looks like it's true

565
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,040
But Drudge, the real Drudge back when Drudge actually owned it

566
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Exposed all that

567
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,040
This is so fucking stupid

568
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,040
A quick search will disprove the idea that the media claimed that Bilderberg didn't exist until 2008

569
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
I'm sorry I said 2009 earlier

570
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
When Alex and Drudge exposed it

571
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,040
For instance there's a September 2005 article in the BBC titled

572
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Quote inside the secretive Bilderberg group

573
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Or you could look at Jon Ronson's 2001 book

574
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Them Adventures with Extremists

575
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Excerpts of which were published in the Guardian

576
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,040
And it was accompanied by the release of his TV show Secret Rulers of the World

577
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Which featured an episode where he and Alex Jones go to Bohemian Grove

578
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,040
And the other episode of it was about the Bilderberg group

579
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
No tweets at the time

580
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Oh there's also a reference to the Bilderberg meetings in a 1999 Wired article you can easily find

581
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Alright, alright

582
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
When Alex said that the media said that he was imagining the whole thing

583
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,040
What he means is that no one accepted his imaginary framing of real life events

584
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
People didn't say that the meeting or the group itself didn't exist

585
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Just that the stories that Alex was selling his audience about them didn't stand up to scrutiny

586
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
That's the accusation

587
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Not that he made up the Bilderberg group

588
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Excuse me Alex, you're full of shit can mean many different things

589
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Also I'd like to learn more about how the Drudge report was secretly sold to CNN two years ago

590
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Sounds like another thing that Alex is pulling out of thin fucking air

591
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
I would be interested to hear about that

592
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Did you look deep into that?

593
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I didn't

594
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Did you reach out to Drudge for comment?

595
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
I looked for tax filings

596
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
I don't know

597
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
It's nonsense

598
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Yeah, whatever

599
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,040
So I think that there's overlap between this idea of like

600
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,040
When people are accusing Alex of making stuff up

601
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
They're not talking about like the actual event

602
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Right, right, right

603
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,040
And so like with the video that he shot down near the border

604
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
It's the same thing

605
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,040
It's like you didn't make up that someone got in a car

606
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
You're just lying about the surrounding context

607
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
9-11 was an inside job, you're full of shit

608
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
You don't think 9-11 happened?

609
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
No, obviously it happened

610
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Yeah, you may have actually said it didn't happen at some point

611
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah, exactly, that's fair

612
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
I gotta review all the tapes

613
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,040
So when Alex is making these accusations, obviously

614
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
That's bad

615
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,040
But there are certainly ways that he could make the situation worse

616
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Which he decides to do in this next clip

617
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Putting out a million dollar bounty

618
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
I'm not gonna say what we're gonna do

619
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,040
But I'm obviously gonna be going back to the border very soon

620
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I'm not gonna say it's gonna be tomorrow, even this weekend

621
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
It might be today

622
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I'm just gonna tell you that

623
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
I've already decided when I'm going, I'm going

624
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
I'm going

625
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,040
I'm not gonna tell this system how or when

626
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
And quite frankly

627
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,040
If I had the money, because we're maxed out right now

628
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,040
I would have a full-time team just in McAllen

629
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
And in Brownsville, rubbing the Texas border

630
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
It is wild, wild west

631
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Insane, illegals everywhere you go

632
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Buses everywhere you go

633
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Total children sleeping in dirt under bridges

634
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
We sent a drone in there, they had a geo fenced up

635
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
So we couldn't show them in the dirt

636
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
But Project Veritas got folks in there

637
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
We have all these whistle blowers

638
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
All this whistle blower video

639
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
People that saw children being raped inside the facilities

640
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
We broke that on Monday

641
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Now you see Governor Abbott talking about it

642
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,040
I mean, I flew over with a helicopter

643
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,040
We have hours and hours and hours of this footage

644
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,040
And that's why you need to go to Infowarsstore.com

645
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
So we can stay on air

646
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Wow

647
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Now do you see what's happening

648
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
As everything we talked about went on

649
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Despite the fact you're trying to censor us and block us

650
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Infowars, I want to report to you our success

651
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
So that you understand why you supported us

652
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
As the core audience of the core radio stations

653
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,040
That are like, you know, funding us to go out and be the missionaries

654
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
To tell the truth against the globalists

655
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
That's what you're doing here

656
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,040
So there's something a little bit disgraceful about using this as a

657
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Like directly as a fundraising

658
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Yeah, it's a little bit like holding your audience hostage

659
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Yeah, it also will be difficult for Alex

660
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Were somebody to sue him for this

661
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,040
It would be hard for him to argue that he's not using it

662
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
In order to make money

663
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Yeah

664
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Because that's literally what he's doing here

665
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Yeah

666
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,040
And as far as the criminal malicious intent towards the border

667
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Saying, I'm not going to tell the system how or when I'm going to get there

668
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Seems like admitting to a certain amount of suspicious activity at least

669
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm going to be sneaky

670
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Yeah, exactly

671
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Now, if you want to escalate this even further

672
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Alex has a great idea for you

673
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,040
And that is one of his old tricks

674
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I mean, I have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen

675
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
That anybody

676
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Because I don't care about getting the scoop

677
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,040
If Ben Shapiro wanted to go down to McCallum

678
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Or if Tucker Carlson wanted to go down to McCallum

679
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
He probably will

680
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Or anywhere

681
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Ted Nugent says he wants to go with me down there

682
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:35,040
I'm going to take him down there, he's a fellow Texan

683
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,040
You'll sit there for 30 minutes and you'll see kids getting crammed in trunks, okay

684
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,040
I mean, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit smugglers down there

685
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,040
There is a sense that Alex is giving off that is like, you should go

686
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Yeah, of course

687
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Everybody should go

688
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
We're all going, it's going to be a great big party

689
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Anybody who goes down there will immediately find proof of this illegal human trafficking ring

690
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
And you need to, you know, hey, all these people

691
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,040
If they went, if Ben Shapiro had the nerve to do it

692
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
He could get the scoop

693
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
I don't care about getting the scoop

694
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Everyone should go, you should go

695
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
That's a bad thing to do

696
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
When you're escalating people's suspicion

697
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,040
And belief that they're fighting the literal devil and all this

698
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
To such a heightened point

699
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
And be like, oh hey, you all should go down there

700
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,040
You'll find direct evidence of all this stuff

701
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I mean, you're asking for trouble

702
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Like he has every single time in the past

703
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
I don't want to, like, here's the thing about

704
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,040
You know, you don't want to get into slippery slope arguments with restricting speech, of course

705
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
So what I think we should do

706
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Is write a very, very narrow law that puts out step by step what Alex did for Pizzagate

707
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
And then is like, you just can't do that

708
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
All of that stuff, you can't do it

709
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
And then Alex wouldn't be able to do this shit

710
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,040
And you know, the part about it that always gets a little bit muddy

711
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Is that like, yeah, not every time that you behave like this

712
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,040
It causes a horrible outcome like a shooting

713
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Of course

714
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
But

715
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
We have proof that it can and does from time to time

716
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
So stop doing the things that lead there

717
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Here's why it's not a free speech argument

718
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Are you going to or have been

719
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Inspiring people to go commit terrifying acts

720
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,040
And have you really faced any consequences

721
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Yeah, exactly

722
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I would say you've been rewarded

723
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Yes, exactly

724
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Anyway, so Alex spends a lot of time on this episode

725
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Talking about Biden trying to take the guns

726
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Because Biden has some ideas about, you know, hey, it is a little bit terrifying

727
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,040
The prospect of, you know, being able to get kits where you can make a gun

728
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,040
And none of the parts have any kind of serial number

729
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Totally

730
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Completely untraceable guns

731
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,040
It's certainly something that in the wrong hands could lead to a lot of trouble

732
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Also the ability to just, you know, buy guns on the internet

733
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
I mean, they trace fucking cold medicine

734
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Yeah, and so he has, you know, he has some ideas

735
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
I'm not the biggest expert in the world

736
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,040
But when I was listening to the ideas it didn't sound like anything that was too terrifying

737
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
No, I think I will be fine

738
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,040
But anyway, Alex thinks that Chidna is trying to use Biden to get the guns

739
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
For a specific reason

740
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Really, the big news is the Chicons are trying to cause a civil war

741
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Knowing that this will trigger a civil war

742
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,040
And a bloodbath for everybody, which I'm not looking forward to, which I do not want

743
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
But nevertheless, is a fact

744
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
So there you go, that's what's going on there

745
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Everybody else in the bay, oh, he wants to save children

746
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
This doesn't make any sense

747
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
No

748
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Now the globalist plan is to start a civil war

749
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Like at the behest of China for some reason

750
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
And that's gonna, I guess, kill a lot of people

751
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Yep

752
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
I thought their plan was soft killing everyone with vaccines

753
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
And then having an orderly extermination

754
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,040
And if that didn't work, then their plan B was to release super bio-weapons just to kill everyone off

755
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Yeah, but that was last week

756
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,040
How does a civil war or world war fit into that plan exactly?

757
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Like, how is gun regulation a part of the bio-weapon plan?

758
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Yeah, it would be a really dumb civil war to have if, like, while you're fighting it

759
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Half of your army is just gonna drop dead from the vaccine at any moment

760
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,040
It seems like if the plan was these bio-weapons, the globalist shouldn't care if you have guns

761
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Like, you can't shoot a virus

762
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,040
I kept this clip in to illustrate how none of Alex's narratives mean anything

763
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Everything is self-serving and meant to escalate whatever he's decided to make his audience afraid of that day

764
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,040
In this case, Biden's giving this speech on gun reform ideas

765
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,040
And thus, the thing to profit off making the listeners scared of is gun confiscation

766
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,040
That narrative doesn't really match up with the whole thing Alex has been doing with vaccine fear-mongering

767
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,040
So he can't really say that the gun regulation is part of the whole bio-weapon thing

768
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Thus, he pretends that, you know, this isn't the entire thing he's been ranting about forever

769
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
And now it's time to be scared about war

770
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,040
It's war that we need to be scared about, it's the summer of rage, Dan!

771
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Also, if all Alex's enemies were working for the literal devil, it seems like they wouldn't be all on such different pages

772
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:05,040
Like, if the devil had this plan that they were supposed to be trying to carry out, why would China mess around with Taiwan

773
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
When that could only really get in the way of following through on the larger plan?

774
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,040
That seems really weird, and I would love Alex to explain that

775
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Well, what it is, so it's, what it is, it's a Japanese management strategy that the, that the devil is using here, alright?

776
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:24,040
You have many different divisions, and you don't share all the information because they're all working for the same end goal

777
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:30,040
But, they've got their own strategies, that's how you create new solutions to problems, Dan

778
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:36,040
I feel like the devil, were this devil to be singularly focused on one objective

779
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Sure

780
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I don't know if there would be a need for teams to be working across purposes

781
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,040
But you haven't been reading Japanese management models

782
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
You do make a fair point

783
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Yeah

784
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
So anyway, Biden wants the guns

785
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Sure

786
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,040
And Trump, you know, he said that he wanted red flag laws

787
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Right, right, right, but that didn't happen, so we're good

788
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
But also that was, he was being sneaky and it was different

789
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Of course, completely different, completely different

790
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:04,040
And of course, the red flag laws, you know, Trump was like, oh red flag means if you've been adjudicated mentally ill and you're schizophrenic

791
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
And you were, you know, kicked out of the Air Force was the case they brought to him

792
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,040
But he, they never put the Air Force records in that he was dishonorably discharged in an Air Force mental institution for two years

793
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Trump's like, yeah, that guy shouldn't have a gun. Oh, the conservatives, Trump wants to, no, no, no, okay, well Trump's gone

794
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,040
Let's not, bad guy's gone, don't have him to kick anymore

795
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:28,040
We got Biden saying, if anybody has a concern about you, your guns are gone, you don't get them back most of the time

796
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,040
And you get the SWAT team raid that ensues

797
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,040
So civil war, civil war, civil war

798
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Whoa, so this is how Alex wants to remember Trump's comments on red flag laws, but that's not what Trump said

799
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,040
This was in 2019 after the mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso

800
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Trump said, quote, first we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs

801
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:56,040
I'm directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies as well as social media companies

802
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,040
To develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike

803
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,040
That doesn't sound like adjudicating someone as mentally ill

804
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:11,040
That seems like talking to social media, taking the posts from social media to identify people who may be unwell and then getting their guns taken away

805
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,040
It's almost like Alex thinks reality is whatever fits his narrative at any given point in time, it's really weird

806
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Honestly, what Trump was talking about seems way more invasive and draconian than anything that Biden's proposing

807
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Trump went on, quote, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence

808
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,040
And make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement

809
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Seems like Alex should be against that pretty strongly

810
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,040
These people have not committed any crimes, but because some globalist doctor is saying that they might commit one, we should have laws that they get locked up

811
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,040
This is pre-crime, Trump wants to bring in the guys in the tanks from the Tom Cruise movie

812
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,040
Yeah, it's precogs, it's Mission what, not Mission Impossible, Minority Report

813
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Yeah, oh, this is Philip K. Dick shit

814
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
They're coming for us

815
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Trump continued, quote, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms

816
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,040
And if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process

817
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,040
That is why I've called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders

818
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Today, I'm also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty

819
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,040
And that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay

820
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:34,040
As a libertarian type and someone who's insanely anti-government, Alex should be really afraid of a president calling for expedited death sentences

821
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Especially since Alex thinks that most people who commit mass shootings are secretly patsies

822
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Also, that was the speech where Trump said, quote, may God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo

823
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
And may God protect them, because he misread a teleprompter, the shooting was in Dayton

824
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Yep. Anyway, the point of this is that Alex has created an ahistorical version of Trump's response to mass shootings and his public support for red flag laws

825
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:04,040
Because what Trump advocated is directly counter to a lot of what should make sense as Alex's position, so that's kind of messy

826
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:11,040
I think it's easier to hand wave it away and say the past is the past, let's move on and think about the future

827
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Trump isn't president anymore, we don't need to think about all the stuff he said

828
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,040
We even sputtered through that in that clip

829
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,040
We don't learn from history here, how dare any of you

830
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Let's not deal with what was said realistically, let's just have fun

831
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,040
So, who do you think the world's most powerful doctor is?

832
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,040
The world's most powerful doctor? Doom?

833
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
Sure, he has his own country

834
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Exactly, he's pretty powerful

835
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
What about Oz?

836
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Dr. Oz? No, I don't think he's very powerful

837
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Dr. Phil is rich as hell

838
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Dr. Phil is pretty powerful

839
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,040
But you couldn't stand up to Dr. Doom, I think you really cheated the game there

840
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Dr. Doom is a little bit of a winner there

841
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,040
He has lightning powers, right? What powers does Dr. Doom have?

842
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,040
No, the super stretch man is a doctor too, he's more powerful than Dr. Doom

843
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Mr. Fantastic?

844
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Yeah, Mr. Fantastic, why do I call him super stretch man? I don't know

845
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Super stretch man

846
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
See, this is why people think that I'm not amused by things you said

847
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
I was just laughing really hard but silently

848
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
Yes, yeah, yeah, naturally

849
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Sometimes it just doesn't play on the mic

850
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
It doesn't happen

851
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Yeah, Invisible Woman was a doctor too, right?

852
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Yeah, I am

853
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
All of them, all the Fantastic Four

854
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,040
No, no, no, Invisible Woman, the flame guy, Jesus, I'm not doing well today

855
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Human Torch?

856
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Yes, I understand

857
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,040
I'm not even a dork and I know these names

858
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Honestly, I was going to call her Mrs. Invisible, which I recognize is not okay

859
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,040
Who else did she marry to him?

860
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
I think so, I can't remember exactly

861
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,040
And then The Thing wasn't a doctor, he was just an astronaut or something

862
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Yeah, he was a military guy

863
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
What are we doing?

864
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,040
I think The Thing and Human Torch were like

865
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,040
This is why Discord is beyond us, we're not even, yeah

866
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,040
I think they were cool military guys and then Invisible Woman and Reed Richards were doctors

867
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Yes

868
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
I think

869
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

870
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Still Dr. Doom more powerful

871
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,040
He does have his own country and they never really put him away, you know

872
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Anyway

873
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,040
My point is that if you Google it you'll get a different answer

874
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Okay

875
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Well, who runs the UN?

876
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun

877
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,040
I tried this this morning and it works, we'll see if they've changed it

878
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Guys, please go to Google for TV viewers

879
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Any radio listener can do this

880
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Type in who is the most powerful doctor in the world

881
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,040
And before you even say powerful, who is the most powerful?

882
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
It says Bill Gates

883
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
And they say he is the most powerful doctor

884
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,040
He is in charge and he will do what he will to you

885
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
So this is actually true

886
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,040
If you Google the words who is the world's most powerful doctor

887
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
The results do say Bill Gates

888
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,040
This is because the search terms identically reflect the title of a 2017 Politico article titled

889
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,040
quote, meet the world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates

890
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Okay

891
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,040
The article itself is highly critical of Gates' outsized influence on the World Health Organization

892
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Given his status as a major donor

893
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,040
But it's not critical in the same way that Alex might be

894
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
For instance, the article points out that quote

895
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Rather than focusing on strengthening healthcare in poor countries

896
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,040
That would help, in their view, to contain future outbreaks like the Ebola epidemic

897
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,040
The agency spends a disproportionate amount of its resources on projects with a measurable outcome

898
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,040
That Gates prefers, such as the effort to eradicate polio

899
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Anyway, the fact that this Google search result comes up

900
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,040
You know, it went slightly viral recently

901
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
As it has in the past a couple times

902
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Alex probably just saw it on social media

903
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Now he's complaining about it on his show, which is really sad

904
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Yeah

905
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
He hasn't even read the Politico article

906
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Because if he has, he would recognize that it actually

907
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
He'd be like, oh, that's why it's

908
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,040
But it actually would be like, oh, this is kind of critical of Gates

909
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
Yeah

910
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
That kind of doesn't work for him

911
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Yeah

912
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,040
It really seems far too obvious to say that a billionaire shouldn't have anything to do with

913
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Just about any decisions regarding, well, anything

914
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,040
But especially health in the modern world

915
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah, I think it's a complicated question

916
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,040
And I think that, you know, based on the fact that there are Politico articles like this

917
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,040
There are people who are in the appropriate places asking those sorts of questions

918
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
And wrestling with it

919
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,040
Anyway, because Alex has found this Google search result that he thinks is real cool

920
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Yeah

921
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
He lets himself off the chain a little bit

922
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Okay

923
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
There it is

924
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Who's the most powerful doctor in the world, ladies and gentlemen?

925
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
Bill!

926
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm gonna kill your ass, Bill Gates

927
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Woo!

928
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,040
Meet the world's most powerful doctor

929
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,040
And for four pages it says the same thing

930
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Because he paid in the search results to tell you

931
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,040
I am the big swinging Johnson

932
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,040
I'm gonna put it in ya

933
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Whoa, family show, man, family show

934
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
I'm gonna put it in ya

935
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
The big swinging Johnson

936
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,040
It's not something that I want repeated anywhere

937
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Nah, it's not fun

938
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
So, uh

939
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,040
Also, isn't the title is ironic, or sarcastic at least

940
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Meet the world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates

941
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Yes

942
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,040
He's not a doctor, that's the point of the title

943
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Yes

944
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Is that this is not how it's supposed to be

945
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
There's an irony, yes

946
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Yeah, exactly

947
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Yeah, yeah

948
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,040
So he's taking a sarcastic headline literally

949
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Yep

950
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Yeah, gotcha

951
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Just wanted to be sure about that

952
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Yep

953
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
He's good at this, man

954
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,040
He's great at, reading comprehension is his jam

955
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,040
So now, someone else is good at things

956
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
Like guitar

957
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
Sure

958
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
And being a real creep

959
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,040
I don't know if he's good at those things

960
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Look, I'm not a music scholar, I don't know anything about this

961
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
But Ted Nugent is on the show

962
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
Of course

963
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I gotta say, Uncle Ted sounds like a bit more of a lunatic than usual

964
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Okay

965
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,040
This is an incredible time to be alive, but I'm glad Ted Nugent is there

966
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
Imagine saying that

967
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
Imagine saying that seriously

968
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
Thank you for joining us, sir

969
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,040
My pleasure, Alex, I'm celebrating life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness

970
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
I got my priorities

971
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,040
I think we should quote the greatest philosopher of all times

972
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,040
I think we agree, that was Dirty Harry

973
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,040
When he said, a good man knows his limitations

974
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,040
So as I fight against the curse of self-inflicted apathy and Marxism running amok

975
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
And whatever creature that is

976
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,040
That pretends to be the commander in chief and all his crazy supporters

977
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,040
The Nugent family is living the American dream

978
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
He always sounds like he's on coke

979
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,040
But he claims he's 70 years sober

980
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,040
Yeah, my immediate thought was

981
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
He got about halfway through his sentence

982
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,040
And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

983
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
You just slow it down, buddy

984
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Slow down

985
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,040
You're already going a little too fast to be taken seriously

986
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Yeah

987
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,040
So Ted Nugent seems, I mean like the Motor City madman

988
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Might be a little bit more literal

989
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
Sure

990
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
He sounds nuts

991
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,040
I mean, he doesn't live in the Motor City anymore, so

992
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Well, he does, part time

993
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Oh, fair enough

994
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
Well, somewhere in Michigan it is

995
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,040
He's making this metaphor

996
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
It's pained

997
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,040
I think in this metaphor, Old Yeller is the government

998
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Okay

999
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
Or something

1000
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,040
So you're setting this up as we're going to take a long trip to get to the end of this metaphor

1001
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
You bet

1002
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,040
Okay

1003
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Same group suing, NRA are suing me

1004
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,040
I mean, this is a war and lesser do you know it's a war

1005
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,040
Well, you know, not just spotlighting the cockroaches

1006
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,040
I think the most important lesson has been hidden from generations

1007
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,040
And that's the lesson of Old Yeller

1008
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
We love dogs

1009
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,040
When Old Yeller protects us from the snake and the cougar

1010
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,040
When Old Yeller brings us the newspaper and our slippers

1011
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,040
We give Old Yeller a kiss and a hug and a biscuit

1012
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,040
When Old Yeller, the same dog we love dearly

1013
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,040
Begins foaming at the mouth

1014
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
We know what we have to do to Old Yeller

1015
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,040
But we don't embrace difficult and discomforting decisions in life

1016
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,040
I use the reference of the Germans who pretended they weren't complicit

1017
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,040
By their cult of denial of what happened during the genocide

1018
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,040
There are Americans today that are hiding from the indicators

1019
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
Hiding from the evidence

1020
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
So here's the answer

1021
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Number one, Alex

1022
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Everybody who believes in freedom right now more than ever

1023
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,040
You have to be a member of the National Rifle Association

1024
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
Gun Owners of America

1025
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
The Texas State Rifle Association

1026
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,040
All your state second amendment organizations

1027
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
You have to communicate with your mayor

1028
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
Your senator, your congressman, your governor

1029
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
On a weekly basis

1030
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
I'm just a guitar player

1031
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
Slow down

1032
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
Yeah, you are just a guitar player, sir

1033
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,040
Wait, this is about guns?

1034
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,040
I guess

1035
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,040
I think he's saying we need to overthrow the United States government, right?

1036
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,040
We need to put it down like Old Yeller

1037
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,040
Yeah, that's kind of his point

1038
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Because they want gun regulation now

1039
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
Was that the lesson of Old Yeller?

1040
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,040
Now, when the government just lets you have all the guns you want

1041
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
You give it a pat on the head and give it a biscuit

1042
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,040
I would like to know Ted Nugent's interpretation of Romeo and Juliet

1043
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
I would like his explanation of that

1044
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,040
He's too people mean

1045
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,040
Great piece of literature

1046
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
Too people mean to fall in love, parents are mean

1047
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
Kill themselves, it's all good

1048
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,040
Kill themselves, it's all good

1049
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,040
Yeah, that was weird

1050
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,040
That was weird

1051
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
I guess he's saying that we're not happy about it

1052
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,040
But we gotta kill the government

1053
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,040
Yeah, I guess we just have to kill the government

1054
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
Huh

1055
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,040
Strange metaphor

1056
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,040
Interesting

1057
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:28,040
So, Alex has gone and done this possibly defamatory video about this Catholic charity

1058
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,040
And if I were Ted Nugent, I might not want to sign off on that video

1059
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,040
Just in case

1060
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,040
I don't want to get ensnared

1061
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:39,040
I don't want to actually be on public record being like

1062
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Hey, that was an awesome thing you did

1063
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
That was super cool

1064
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
And I'm glad I helped playing it with you

1065
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,040
We have to fight back on the activist level peacefully

1066
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,040
But communicate on a regular basis

1067
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,040
And yes, Alex, Shamane and I with our Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild show

1068
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
And our Spirit Campfire

1069
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,040
And all the different incredible communication that my wife Shamane accomplishes

1070
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,040
We're coming down to the border because everybody has to know

1071
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,040
That these children are being trafficked

1072
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,040
And when you catch a guy doing it, he plays dumb

1073
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,040
Well, that's not dumb, that's demonic

1074
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,040
We have to spotlight these devil cockroaches

1075
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
These devil cockroaches

1076
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
This is not good

1077
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
This is very not good

1078
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,040
That's not good

1079
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Yeah, Ted Nugent is clearly talking about Alex's video

1080
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
Yeah, absolutely

1081
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
There are a couple of huge problems I have with it

1082
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Number one, obviously, is Ted Nugent is not allowed to say traffic head

1083
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
Traffic head, he says it twice

1084
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
No, unacceptable behavior

1085
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
Unacceptable behavior

1086
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,040
It's very weird

1087
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,040
And I want to know the spelling of demonic

1088
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,040
Because immediately following dumb, it should be D-U-M-B-O-N-I-C, right?

1089
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,040
Dumbonic

1090
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
Yeah, I mean, if it's on paper, probably

1091
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,040
Yeah, it has to be

1092
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,040
So, jumping from there, I mean, he sort of is endorsing Alex's video

1093
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,040
And we have to flush out these folks, these demons

1094
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Obviously

1095
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,040
Now he's sort of saying that they need to kill people

1096
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
Who are like the people in Alex's video

1097
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,040
You know, we've been to Africa many times

1098
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,040
And Shamane has done a lot of interviews with some real heroes of law enforcement and the military

1099
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:20,040
Who have dedicated their lives to saving these women and children that are enslaved and trafficked

1100
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,040
And it's happening on a daily basis

1101
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,040
And thank God, a big salute to you

1102
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,040
Not just from the Nugent family, Alex

1103
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,040
But a lot of people are watching you spotlight these devils

1104
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,040
And we thank you for that

1105
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
But more and more people have to do it

1106
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,040
And then they have to act upon it

1107
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,040
You can't identify a foaming-at-the-mouth dog

1108
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
And then go back to your gardening

1109
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,040
You have to deal with the rabid dog

1110
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,040
You have to eliminate the rabid dog

1111
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,040
And if you're not able to do it, call your wildlife control office

1112
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
But call somebody

1113
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
That metaphor fell apart

1114
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,040
I think that what we're listening to is

1115
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Ted Nugent taking these sort of ideas that Alex has had about

1116
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,040
Everybody's got to go down to the border and, you know, find all this

1117
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,040
And he's going one step further and saying you have to take action

1118
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,040
Against the people who are trafficking

1119
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,040
And boy, you know, that could get really out of hand

1120
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,040
If your standard of who's trafficking people is as low as Alex is

1121
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,040
This is directly inciting

1122
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,040
See, this is why we have my new Pizzagate law

1123
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,040
If you do a Pizzagate, it's against the law

1124
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,040
He was just talking about literal dogs, though

1125
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,040
He was saying that if a dog has

1126
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,040
What if you just have, like, some stuff on your glasses

1127
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,040
And then you just murder a dog

1128
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Maybe you should think a little bit more

1129
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,040
I can't stress enough how, like, I saw that video

1130
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
When it was making the rounds

1131
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,040
I'm like, this sucks

1132
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
But, you know, this is Alex doing what he does

1133
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,040
I hope he gets sued for it

1134
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,040
Then I listen to his show and I'm like

1135
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,040
It sounds like he's kind of encouraging people to go and do what he's doing

1136
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
And I think that's probably bad

1137
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,040
That seems like the kind of behavior he's done in the past

1138
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,040
Nothing could have prepared me for Ted Nugent coming on

1139
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,040
And making this pained metaphor that is so much worse

1140
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,040
That seems to imply that what people need to do

1141
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,040
Is come down there and kill people who are trying to help

1142
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
Asylum seekers and refugees

1143
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,040
Yeah

1144
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,040
It's so fucked up

1145
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,040
Yeah, I don't know if there's anything that could prepare you for

1146
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,040
A sudden appearance of Ted Nugent telling you to murder

1147
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,040
In a bad metaphor

1148
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,040
Yeah, that's something that I

1149
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,040
That's Kool-Aid Man levels of surprise

1150
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,040
Oh no

1151
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,040
Yeah

1152
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
Now, much like the Kool-Aid Man, he barges through walls

1153
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,040
You know that

1154
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,040
We're about to get someone else barging through walls

1155
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
And that is Ted Nugent's son

1156
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,040
Sure, sure

1157
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,040
I want to hear what Ted Nugent's son has to say

1158
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,040
You actually do

1159
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,040
Okay

1160
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Ted Nugent's son is there with him

1161
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
And Alex wants to talk to him a little bit

1162
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,040
Sure

1163
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,040
And, oooh, Nelly

1164
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,040
Here we go

1165
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,040
And Rocco, I know you're an articulate person in your own right

1166
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,040
The great son of Ted Nugent

1167
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
Well, what is your view on all this?

1168
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,040
Man, I'm a little bit more oriented to the metaphysical aspects of it

1169
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,040
I feel like I got this guy on the front lines of the

1170
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
The terrestrial aspect

1171
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,040
And me and some of my friends have been tuned into what you've been doing

1172
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,040
And others, like David Icke

1173
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,040
And I got more interested in like, you know

1174
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
Who's really behind the cabal

1175
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:30,040
Extraterrestrial beings that are hijacking energy fields of the planet

1176
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,040
That are installing slaughterhouses

1177
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,040
That are, you know, the motives

1178
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,040
By the way, I totally agree

1179
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,040
When you hit the bottom of the rabbit hole, whatever it is

1180
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
It's anti-human, it's anti-success

1181
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,040
Yeah

1182
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:46,040
Yeah, so Rocco, Ted Nugent's son, is into the spiritual side of this

1183
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,040
Another new law

1184
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
It should be against the law to grow up rich

1185
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
That's what I heard right there

1186
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,040
No!

1187
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,040
So I wanted to understand this a little bit more

1188
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,040
I had no idea, I'd never heard Ted Nugent's son

1189
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,040
And I was like, oh this is interesting

1190
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
No, it was about, there was a cartoon

1191
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,040
It was Modern Life, something?

1192
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Oh yeah, it's fun

1193
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
Thank you

1194
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,040
So, this guy's modern life

1195
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,040
Apparently consists of putting out YouTube videos

1196
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,040
Where he's driving, you know, you got the camera on you while you're driving

1197
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,040
Oh no, he's doing those?

1198
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,040
Mic down for this

1199
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,040
Oh boy

1200
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:25,040
This was terrifying

1201
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,040
Hello Earth

1202
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,040
And anyone else who may be tuning in

1203
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:41,040
The download to be shared today in this moment

1204
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,040
While the highway is being driven on

1205
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Is a message that just came through

1206
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,040
The reference point many know as Archangel Michael

1207
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:01,040
And my relationship with Archangel Michael has been one of

1208
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,040
He's almost been like the older brother that you didn't really know

1209
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,040
Because you were really young when he was at home

1210
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,040
And then he left for the military or something

1211
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,040
And then you like grew up

1212
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,040
And then he came back and he's all like stern and transformed

1213
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,040
And then he leaves and never comes again

1214
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,040
And so he's like this image in your mind of like discipline

1215
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,040
And yeah, like the little brother, like the big brother

1216
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,040
He's the bigger brother that holds you accountable to your highest potential

1217
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:42,040
And he has this sword, at least in my interfacing with him

1218
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,040
He has a sword that he carries around with him

1219
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,040
And it's like a sword of light

1220
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:55,040
And it seems to also be a sword of the divine masculine personified in a device

1221
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,040
In a moment as a sword

1222
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,040
So it's a dick? Is he saying the sword's a dick?

1223
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:06,040
Yeah, I believe he's saying that the Archangel Michael has a lightsaber shaped like a penis

1224
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,040
Is essentially what I'm hearing

1225
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,040
Yeah, so Ted Nugent's son puts out videos where he rambles about how he talks to angels

1226
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,040
Yeah, somebody should take away his license

1227
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,040
Cool

1228
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Now, I was watching a few of these and there's just a bit of

1229
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,040
Of course you are

1230
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:28,040
There's just a bit of like, you know, sort of that spirituality that is kind of untethered

1231
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,040
And a little bit Project Camelot-y in many ways

1232
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,040
Well, he's talking about the Archangel Michael as that older brother who went away

1233
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,040
In the military and then came back to you and also has a giant lightsaber sword that looks like a dick

1234
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,040
And he gave him a download

1235
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,040
And the download, spoiler alert, is the greatest FOMO

1236
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
You know, the fear of missing out?

1237
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
No

1238
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
No

1239
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,040
No

1240
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,040
You do not

1241
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,040
No, you do not continue, sir

1242
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,040
Sir?

1243
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,040
Sir?

1244
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:01,040
The greatest FOMO is missing out on what you could have been if you didn't get your shit together earlier

1245
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,040
I really, really, really need to throw a thing

1246
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
Yeah

1247
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,040
Archangel Michael coming down with his sword to blow mines

1248
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,040
So now, I was thinking like, okay, I could play some more things from these videos that are just kind of silly

1249
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:23,040
But honestly, like, I don't know, that just kind of, that kind of content is the kind of stuff that I'm like, I gotta go

1250
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,040
Yeah

1251
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,040
I gotta get away from this

1252
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,040
Yeah

1253
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,040
And I figured there's something better I could tell you

1254
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
And that is

1255
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,040
Sure

1256
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
The Ted Nugent's son is also a rapper

1257
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Oh no!

1258
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Oh god

1259
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Don't do this to me

1260
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,040
No

1261
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
No!

1262
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
No!

1263
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
No

1264
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,040
No

1265
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,040
Mmm

1266
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:58,040
Had to tell you no Had to tell you no Had to tell you no Had to say no

1267
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:07,040
I had to walk away I had to talk to me I had lost my faith I had lost myself I had lost my health

1268
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,040
Tearin' in the windows Pay a chance to get help

1269
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,040
Yeah, it's basically that

1270
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:21,040
I, um, yeah, I found that it was a little bit, I mean, it makes a compelling argument for there being, such a thing as too much autotune

1271
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:29,040
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's definitely the case, man, how much would it suck to not even suck as much as Chet Hanks?

1272
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,040
You know, or just suck more than Chet Hanks, like, that's bad

1273
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,040
I feel really bad because I don't want to, like, mock someone's creative outlet

1274
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,040
Sure

1275
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,040
I think that's bad, but also

1276
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,040
I want to mock rich kids' creative output, I'm fine with that

1277
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
Yeah

1278
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,040
Yeah

1279
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,040
I mean, I think that this is not quality music

1280
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,040
Yeah

1281
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
I think it's funny that it's Ted Nugent's son

1282
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,040
Trying to make this nonsense music

1283
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,040
You're not even the best, worst son

1284
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,040
That's the worst part about it

1285
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,040
Oh, man

1286
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,040
Jesus

1287
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,040
Anyway, this has been Get to Know Rocco in his modern life

1288
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,040
Yes, yep

1289
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,040
And now we move on

1290
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,040
Now we would like to un-know

1291
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,040
Yeah

1292
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,040
So they leave, the Nugent family leaves

1293
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,040
Oh, also just remember that Ted Nugent's wife is a really huge QAnon supporter

1294
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1295
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
We went into an argument about it with Alex

1296
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
Of course, of course

1297
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
A couple months back

1298
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,040
Naturally

1299
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,040
Good family

1300
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,040
Yeah

1301
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:30,040
So they leave, and Alex lights a literal candle, but maybe it's also a metaphor

1302
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:35,040
I'm being honest with listeners, I know the metaphysical's real, I know God's real

1303
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:39,040
I know the spirit's like a fire, and you can't just keep that fire under yourself

1304
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,040
You gotta share it with other people, like this candle

1305
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:47,040
I'm lighting here in studio with Ted Nugent right now on TV and radio with his simulcasting

1306
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,040
They want to put America's flame out, they want to put our republic's flame out

1307
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,040
But they can't do it if we continue to share it

1308
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,040
But if they're able to demoralize us and make us be cowards and make us be fearful

1309
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,040
They can put that flame out, but you're aware of them trying it

1310
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,040
They don't have the power to do that anymore

1311
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,040
Alex is becoming more and more of a prop comic

1312
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,040
Yeah

1313
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:15,040
Yeah, so he's doing like one of those Christmas candles where you only burn it for the, you know

1314
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,040
It's like red, green, red, green, red, green, and every day before Christmas you burn the red one off

1315
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,040
And then you turn it out, and then you burn the green one off

1316
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,040
But it's for the end of the republic?

1317
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,040
Something like that

1318
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,040
Okay

1319
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,040
Yeah, just like, you know, when he had that skull and the goblet or whatever

1320
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,040
A lot of people will think, what does this mean?

1321
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,040
And I'm asking you, what does this mean?

1322
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:42,040
I am gonna light this candle because I want to talk about the metaphor of a candle

1323
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,040
But I also want you to be able to see it

1324
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:50,040
I just, because there's a moment before this where he screamed at some 18 year old

1325
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
Get me a candle

1326
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,040
That's the problem here

1327
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,040
I would say there's a pretty good chance

1328
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,040
So Alex has not really covered a lot of news

1329
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,040
But he has a lot of articles in a stack, but who cares

1330
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,040
Well, they're tweets

1331
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:12,040
I could spend an hour on each one of these articles and discover every little piece of it

1332
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,040
And talk about how it works and talk about how it's a deployment

1333
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:23,040
But at the end of the day, you get caught up in making it your god by giving it all your attention

1334
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:28,040
Just know this, whatever comes out of these people's mouths is meant to kill your ass

1335
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
Oh, okay

1336
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Wow

1337
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,040
Okay, we can just make that decision

1338
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:38,040
What you need to know is that I need you emotionally aroused at all times

1339
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,040
But if you learn anything, that will stop

1340
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,040
I don't think that there's any better encapsulation of Alex Jones' sort of style than that

1341
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:52,040
That I could spend an hour on this and all the information, all the minutia

1342
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,040
Get really into the weeds on this

1343
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,040
Yeah, well he's a policy wonk as we know

1344
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:01,040
We could really get into this, but just know that whatever they're saying, they're trying to kill you

1345
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,040
So really, there's no point for me to have any of this in front of me

1346
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,040
So instead of getting into the nitty gritty, being a policy wonk

1347
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,040
Which he could do

1348
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,040
Oh, no, of course

1349
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,040
You just assume that they're just trying to kill you

1350
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:21,040
Instead of getting into the weeds and really figuring this out, he decides to spend his time doing the big work

1351
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,040
And that, of course, means complaining about Saturday Night Live

1352
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,040
We never aired it, I don't know if they could find it

1353
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,040
But it's the Saturday Night Live

1354
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:39,040
And they're like, coming up on Saturday Night Live, black people won't take the vaccine

1355
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,040
So they have a black guy with a British accent, like he's smart, but other black people aren't

1356
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,040
They love British accents

1357
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,040
Don't pull up

1358
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,040
It's the black, a British guy

1359
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,040
You got an engine on fire

1360
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:56,040
Literally going, I'll give you black people barbecue and watermelon or whatever

1361
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,040
If you take the shot, and the black guy has a classic southern voice like that's dumb

1362
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,040
You are no Sully Tullenberger

1363
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:07,040
And it's literally them, caricatures, making fun of black people

1364
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,040
With a black guy with a British accent, being racist to them

1365
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,040
Because of their accent from where they are, saying they're fighting racism

1366
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,040
And then it's on CNN

1367
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,040
I mean, I can't, these people piss me off, man

1368
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,040
And it's constant

1369
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,040
What?

1370
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,040
Okay, so, one

1371
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,040
Did you see that SNL sketch?

1372
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
I saw the first little bit of it

1373
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,040
I got it

1374
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,040
Yeah, yeah

1375
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,040
You get it

1376
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,040
It's not hard to get

1377
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,040
I think that there are some people who took umbrage with it

1378
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,040
And I say huzzah, rightfully so

1379
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,040
That was probably a poorly conceived sketch

1380
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,040
I think that people did not enjoy it

1381
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:52,040
And you can find articles in all sorts of media expressing that sentiment

1382
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,040
That it was maybe poorly constructed and conceived

1383
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1384
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,040
That said, Alex's point about it is outrageous

1385
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,040
I mean, I think he was trying to say that it was a racist sketch

1386
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,040
But he did so by being more racist towards

1387
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Yeah

1388
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,040
Yeah

1389
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,040
The person who's hosting

1390
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,040
Daniel Kaluuya?

1391
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,040
Kaluuya, I believe, yeah

1392
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,040
He is British

1393
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,040
Yes

1394
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,040
But he's not doing a British accent in that sketch

1395
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,040
No, he's not

1396
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,040
No

1397
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,040
And specifically, he's not doing a British accent

1398
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,040
Yes

1399
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,040
Despite having one

1400
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:30,040
And I think that what happened is that Alex just saw like an outrage compilation

1401
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
Right

1402
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Of like some of his jokes from the monologue

1403
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
Right, right, right

1404
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Where he's speaking in his British accent

1405
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
So he knows that the guy is British

1406
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,040
And assumes

1407
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,040
Well, he doesn't know that the guy is British

1408
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,040
And he assumes that that carries over to the sketch as well

1409
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,040
Right, right, right

1410
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,040
Or he doesn't understand how the structure of Saturday Night Live works

1411
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,040
No, absolutely not

1412
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,200
But yeah, so if you haven't seen the sketch, the idea was that there's this guy who is

1413
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,040
a doctor and his family won't take the vaccine

1414
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,040
Right

1415
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,040
And so he's having a game show to get them to take the vaccine

1416
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,040
Yeah

1417
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,040
And he keeps offering money

1418
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1419
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,040
For the correct answer, which is yes

1420
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,040
Yes

1421
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,040
I will take the vaccine

1422
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,040
I will get the vaccine, yes

1423
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:11,040
And so one of his family members played by Keenan

1424
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,040
He asked what he would do with the money if he won

1425
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,040
Sure

1426
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,040
And he says, I'll roll up some joints, smoke some weed

1427
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,040
Sure, sure, sure

1428
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,040
Get a big barbecue block party, go and get a new grill

1429
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,040
Yes

1430
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,040
Or whatever

1431
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,680
And that, Alex has extrapolated out into being like trying to entice black people with barbecue

1432
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,680
and watermelon

1433
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,680
Right, right, right

1434
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,040
He has added an even more racist layers

1435
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,040
That's what I was saying

1436
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,040
Yes

1437
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,040
He didn't need to add the more racist part

1438
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,040
No

1439
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:40,640
And SNL was, you know, like you get it because they were creating that caricature that they

1440
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,740
love to do on Celebrity Jeopardy, but what actually happened is they relied on stereotypes

1441
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,240
to make fun of, yeah

1442
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:56,360
Um, so I think that Alex thinks that because this sketch is clunky and possibly somewhat

1443
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
offensive

1444
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,360
Yeah

1445
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,960
It gives him carte blanche to be even more racist

1446
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,760
I give you the barbecue you take

1447
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,760
No

1448
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,760
No

1449
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,480
Can you imagine if I had a show

1450
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,480
No

1451
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:15,120
And I got up there and I went I give you black people some barbecue, in fact, chew that up

1452
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
if you can

1453
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:22,320
This is what I'm talking about, it is the, everything they say we are is them

1454
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,840
What about Fentanyl the dragon?

1455
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,960
I was gonna say also it kind of sounded like he slipped into Fentanyl the dragon there

1456
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,960
He doesn't have a lot of rage

1457
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:35,920
He's trying to do a racist black person accent and then he slipped into a racist Chinese

1458
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,920
accent

1459
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,920
So that's great

1460
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,920
He's a Caliendo

1461
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,440
No, no, no, no, he is not Rich Little

1462
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,440
No

1463
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,300
So Alex tries to play the clip of it and he fails

1464
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,720
Yeah here it is, let's cue it up, let's cue it up, in fact if you have the audio ready

1465
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,720
you got the audio ready?

1466
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,040
You guys can pull it up really quick and great, they have it, okay here it is, well watch

1467
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,040
this for yourself

1468
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:06,120
It's okay, our computers, hey I only have like a hundred thousand dollar computer in

1469
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,800
there it's not the crew's fault, the hundred thousand dollar computer messes up about one

1470
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,880
percent of the time, the million dollar computer hardly ever messes up so I can't afford the

1471
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,880
million dollar switcher so it just locked up on them but whenever it boots back up we'll

1472
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,880
play it for you

1473
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:19,880
What?

1474
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,600
You gotta boot back up?

1475
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know

1476
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
What?

1477
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,520
You gotta restart it, I mean look it's a million dollar machine but it still runs on Windows

1478
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,520
95

1479
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,920
This is the hundred thousand dollar one, you can't afford the million

1480
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,680
That one doesn't even run on Windows 95, that guy's running DOS prompts

1481
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,920
I wonder if like what actually happened was that there was like a producer in his ear

1482
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:45,280
during that long silence that was like hey those voices that you're doing and the way

1483
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,240
you're characterizing the sketch, if you play the sketch

1484
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,640
This is not gonna go well

1485
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,360
You're gonna be shown to be wrong

1486
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,360
You're a racist

1487
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,240
Yes, this is gonna look bad

1488
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,000
I wonder if that's what happened, it would make sense based on the incredibly long pause

1489
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,520
and then eventually they do play what I think is the outrage compilation, the only thing

1490
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:09,080
that he's aware of, which is the clips of the monologue and then a short clip of that

1491
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,280
sketch and then he's just written a story about it in his head that is more racist than

1492
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,280
the original version

1493
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,720
Wild, wildly racist

1494
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
Yep

1495
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:24,620
So at this point Alex has a reporter named Sheila Gunn-Reed on his show, she is a reporter

1496
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,200
with Rebel Media

1497
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,560
Sure, sure, trustworthy

1498
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,560
Great

1499
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,560
Yeah, yeah

1500
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,600
And she's on to talk about a certain church in Canada that is under attack

1501
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,600
Uh oh

1502
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,880
Well thanks for having me Alex and thanks so much for your ongoing interest in this

1503
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,880
story

1504
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,340
It's truly an international story despite what the mainstream media in my home province

1505
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,340
would have you believe

1506
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:52,720
This church has been the flashpoint for the fight for religious freedom in Canada during

1507
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,720
the pandemic

1508
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,720
I doubt it

1509
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,640
The pastor there, Pastor James Coates, was arrested and incarcerated for 35 days in

1510
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:07,080
a maximum security provincial facility for refusing to limit his congregation to 15%

1511
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,080
of fire code capacity as per the public health orders here in Alberta.

1512
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,760
He refused to comply, he said it violated his religious freedom, so he was taken into

1513
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,760
custody.

1514
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,080
He's been released now, but the crackdown on his church has not stopped

1515
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:27,800
So this is the Grace Life Church in Alberta and like Sheila was saying, the pastor of

1516
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,940
this church James Coates was arrested in February after repeated breaches of COVID safety measures

1517
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:37,480
He was given multiple opportunities and warnings to follow the rules and he refused to do so

1518
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,360
So he got arrested and then released on the condition that he stop breaking the rules

1519
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,040
which he immediately proceeded to break again

1520
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,960
Literally everybody involved was like dude we don't want to do this, you don't want to

1521
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:53,240
do this, well obviously you want to turn yourself into a fucking martyr

1522
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,920
So in response to his trouble, a group of 28 community leaders from various religious

1523
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,920
backgrounds released a statement that quote stress the need to prioritize the well-being

1524
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,160
of all members of society over individual needs during the pandemic and to follow the

1525
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,440
directives of public health officers and the government

1526
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,760
Someone acting Christ-like, kill them!

1527
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,300
Just this week, the Alberta Health Service shut down the church by putting fences up

1528
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:20,280
around it, quote until the church can demonstrate the ability to comply with Alberta's Chief

1529
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,480
Medical Officer of Health's restrictions

1530
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,820
Do you hear what they said?

1531
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:32,640
You are teens, they put you in time out until you can eat your goddamn vegetables, you don't

1532
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,640
get to go to church

1533
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,880
Yeah you can't use the phone until you can learn to not prank call people

1534
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,680
Yeah I mean it's insane

1535
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,680
Yep

1536
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,600
I think closing the church is kind of murky territory honestly and I'm not sure how I

1537
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,000
would proceed if I were in charge there but this is Canada

1538
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,700
If the local folk there in Alberta are terribly opposed to this closure then they can work

1539
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,360
on that with the local government but from everything I've seen pretty much everybody

1540
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:59,440
outside the church itself seems fine with the fact that they, you know, if you're not

1541
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,280
going to follow the restrictions they're not even, the restrictions are 15% capacity

1542
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,280
Yeah

1543
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,280
It's not even closing the church

1544
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,280
You don't even have to close the church

1545
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,280
No

1546
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,760
Just fucking live stream it, dude we don't want to put you in jail, it would be stupid

1547
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,400
this is stupid, you're a child

1548
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,440
Let's find ways to work this out in ways that work for everybody

1549
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,680
Please just go away

1550
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:25,760
Anyway there's a 15% capacity that he's supposed to follow but not everybody has to follow

1551
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,760
that

1552
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:32,000
Because it's 15, one five percent of fire code capacity but the Walmart up the road

1553
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,960
but the Costco up the road they can operate at 30% of fire code capacity so this is why

1554
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:38,960
this is truly amazing

1555
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,960
Your church doesn't sell food

1556
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,460
It knows if you're going to Walmart or if you're going to praise God

1557
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:46,720
This is embarrassing pretending to not understand the different capacities for different things

1558
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,840
No get the fuck out of here

1559
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,040
Like I would totally bet that Walmart would have a 15% capacity order if it were a place

1560
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,440
where people congregated for long periods of time, sat in place and sang

1561
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,440
So stupid

1562
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,600
The things you do at Walmart while you're wearing a mask which they didn't do at this

1563
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,600
church

1564
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,120
Oh that was really surprising to me, I assume that they all still wore masks

1565
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,120
No

1566
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,120
No that's surprising

1567
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,520
You know you're required to wear a mask to enter the Walmart and you walk around and

1568
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,520
leave

1569
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,680
Yeah

1570
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:20,480
That's why maybe you could have 30% capacity there safely as opposed to a building where

1571
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,840
everyone sits and sings

1572
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:30,000
Yeah that is like, listen I know the word is supposed to be mainly geometry based but

1573
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,280
you are being obtuse

1574
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,720
That is ridiculous

1575
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,720
Yeah

1576
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,720
Yeah

1577
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,440
So Alex gets to talking about his Spars conspiracy a little bit

1578
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Sure

1579
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,600
And I thought he was kind of done with Sheila and the church

1580
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
Yeah

1581
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
He is not

1582
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
Yeah

1583
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,840
He does say this and I think it's silly

1584
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:58,240
Emergency Saturday broadcast world shocked by Spars 2025-2028 document 2,000,073,000 views

1585
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,800
Well that sounds great at Bandai Video

1586
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,520
It needs 100 billion views and we beat these people, it's all right there

1587
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,080
But 2 million is a good start

1588
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:14,280
But I'm not doing this and putting my life on the line and flying a helicopter right

1589
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:19,320
on the Mexican border where they shoot at helicopters and doing all this to like lose

1590
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:24,160
Yeah I think that that's really illustrative too, it's like Alex's gauge of being able

1591
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:28,840
to beat the globalists has to do with his metrics, they are traffic related, we will

1592
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,400
win if we get a hundred million

1593
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,400
No you won't

1594
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:38,520
The globalists just watching the view, oh shit he's at 99,999,998, if he gets two more

1595
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
we lose

1596
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,240
Sir, shut down the internet

1597
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,240
Shut the internet down

1598
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,840
Ridiculous

1599
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,840
Yeah

1600
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:55,160
So I thought it was a little bit irresponsible that Alex is you know largely, at least subtly,

1601
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:59,600
maybe not so subtly encouraging people to go down to the border and behave as he did

1602
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,600
Yeah

1603
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:07,440
Yeah just to cost people trying to help, I think that's a, humanity is generally widely

1604
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,240
recognized to have evolved society by killing people trying to help

1605
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,720
And I think that the only effect that that could possibly have is escalating a situation,

1606
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,960
raising the temperature beyond the point where it's easily handled by responsible people

1607
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:21,960
Yeah

1608
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,120
This is not the only instance of him doing this on this show

1609
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:28,960
This should be the Christian Woodstock, everyone in Canada can get there, I'd say the US but

1610
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,240
your borders are so controlled, unless you're a legal alien, everyone should go there, bring

1611
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:38,360
pizzas, bring barbecues, bring, I think if 20,000 people show up it will turn the tide

1612
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,360
against this tyranny

1613
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,640
Don't you agree everyone should come there, tell us where it is

1614
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:48,960
So that church is just west of the capital city of Edmonton, Alberta, it's really just

1615
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:56,000
a couple of miles outside of the city limits, it's very easy to get to, and you know there's

1616
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,160
a public road right there, you can get there and

1617
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:02,720
And for those listening, they must go now, what is the name, what is the address, everyone

1618
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,000
must go now

1619
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,160
It's Grace Life Church

1620
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,040
So yeah everyone's got to go, everyone's got to go to this church, it should be the Christian

1621
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,040
Woodstock

1622
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,040
Uh huh

1623
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,520
So that means Jars of Clay will be performing

1624
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,520
Sure

1625
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,240
DC Talk is going to reunite

1626
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:22,920
Oh it's about time, it's about time, Red Hot Chili Peppers is going to play with just the

1627
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,920
socks on

1628
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,680
Ted Nugent's son is going to sit

1629
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,880
Yeah this seems irresponsible

1630
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,880
Yeah

1631
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:32,880
And it gets kind of worse

1632
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,960
Oh of course

1633
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:45,720
It's 51520 or 51529 A Range Road 262 Spruce Grove AB, is that right?

1634
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,720
Yes

1635
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,240
Alright so here's the deal, instead of being like, I'm not putting you down because you're

1636
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:55,920
just like me, you're like oh thanks for carrying, they've put a fence up and arrested the preacher,

1637
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,920
thanks for carrying

1638
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,920
Sounds insulting

1639
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,400
We're under attack okay, you're under attack so are we, all of us need to go there, if

1640
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:07,040
you're in Canada or if you're near the border, you get in legally, go there peacefully, give

1641
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:13,640
aid and comfort to Christians under CHICOM, Governor, attack the CHICOM agent, I just

1642
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:19,160
showed you him pledging allegiance to Xi Jinping, Trudeau, everyone should go, they're scared

1643
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,160
aren't they?

1644
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,160
Trudeau did no such thing

1645
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,160
No he did not

1646
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:26,400
Um yeah so this is irresponsible and certainly hope that nothing ends up happening there

1647
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:32,880
that Alex might look bad in hindsight, giving the address out and soliciting and inciting

1648
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:40,920
people to go because the church is under attack by the communist Chinese and Justin Trudeau

1649
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,920
fucked up

1650
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,840
Yeah there's no other way for that to, like it goes two ways, it goes with a bunch of

1651
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:51,440
people showing up and being like oh shit this was dumb, or a bunch of people showing up

1652
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,440
and getting whipped into a mob and like let's go down two miles and start wars, you know

1653
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
like that kind of thing

1654
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,100
And when you think you're fighting the fucking literal devil, it seems like the latter is

1655
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,100
more likely

1656
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,100
Yeah

1657
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:08,680
Yeah so I don't know, I don't think this is good, and I mean it's obviously that they

1658
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,680
are fighting the devil

1659
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:16,060
Alex, I've never ever seen overt Satanism in real life before

1660
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,360
Oh yeah you told me one of them said Satan is good, tell people about that

1661
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:26,520
I've never seen overt Satanism like that, as you and I both know the enemy works through

1662
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:32,940
all kinds of people but this person drove by in a pickup truck, screamed at women and

1663
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:38,320
children whose church they're looking at being locked up, so they're distraught and this

1664
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:43,740
guy screams at them that he's happy that their church is being closed and then he yells at

1665
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:52,580
other people and he says to them even the church of Satan follows masking laws and that's

1666
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:53,580
why you should too

1667
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:58,360
As a Christian, if you're telling me that Satan likes it, I'm more inclined to not do

1668
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,320
it but that's the level of public discourse here

1669
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:06,160
Yeah some guy in a truck said that we're Satanists and even we wear masks

1670
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,520
That's the level of overt Satanism

1671
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:18,600
Man, this is the weakest of teas, this is weak tea because I wouldn't even have bought

1672
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,520
it if she was just like he screamed out the window I love Satan because then it's like

1673
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,880
yeah of course you say that shit, they're a bunch of assholes

1674
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,080
She doesn't seem to be as willing to let it fly as Alex

1675
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:38,320
No clue, he's just like hey guys, ostensibly your most evil worshippers in the world are

1676
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,320
still not dumb

1677
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,760
We're more concerned with public health and our fellow man than you

1678
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:49,360
Satanists don't want people to die of disease, do you not understand where you are in this

1679
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,360
situation

1680
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,840
Yeah that seems to be with this Satanist alleged Satanist because you might have been

1681
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,840
just fucking around

1682
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,160
Yeah that sounds more like that

1683
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:02,520
Anyway some guy yelled for him in the truck and all this is going on and so Alex encourages

1684
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,200
something man he should be careful with his language

1685
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:10,080
Well I'm telling my listeners, I'm telling them if you live in Canada whether you're

1686
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:15,020
500 miles away or 20 you must go there, bring some muffins, bring some food, support these

1687
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:20,120
great people because the system has drawn the line here, the enemy has drawn a line

1688
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:27,160
at your church, the enemy's drawn a line and said and so they've chosen this as their Stalingrad

1689
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,560
and I think we should make this their Stalingrad

1690
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,560
Oh boy

1691
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,840
Who's chosen this as their Stalingrad?

1692
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,480
Nobody's chosen this as a Stalingrad, this is way below the level of Stalingrad

1693
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,480
You bet

1694
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,120
Also not for nothing the Soviet Union won that battle

1695
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,120
Well

1696
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:50,480
The communists might want a better metaphor, also Stalingrad was incredibly violent

1697
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,480
Yeah

1698
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,600
I don't know if Alex wants to evoke that kind, I mean obviously he does but it doesn't seem

1699
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:02,000
responsible to evoke that kind of imagery surrounding what he's trying to incite people

1700
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,480
to go be a part of

1701
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:10,520
Yeah I'm gonna be honest here, okay, here's what I'm putting together, on this very episode

1702
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,120
he said literally like everything they're doing, everything they say we're doing is

1703
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,680
what they're doing

1704
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,680
Right

1705
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:25,200
Right, now I would say that that is revelatory about what he's doing and I'm gonna say that

1706
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,360
he worships Satan because this is the behavior of someone who worships Satan

1707
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,080
That was just when he was younger

1708
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,800
I don't think he stopped, why isn't that a possibility?

1709
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,640
That's a long term theory of yours, I understand that

1710
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:45,160
So look dude, I think that this episode is really fucked up, there's multiple incitements

1711
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:51,720
towards listeners going to places that Alex seems to want to get out of hand

1712
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,720
Yeah

1713
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:53,720
A little bit

1714
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,600
Yeah, even if I was the shithead pastor of that church I would be like Alex no, no, no,

1715
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,760
no, no, we don't, no, no, no, no, we don't want that

1716
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,120
We want support but you're, this is bad

1717
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,920
You're bad support

1718
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:12,320
And really honestly, Sheila wants to bring up that this could all be solved if all the

1719
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,640
pastors in the area weren't against this guy

1720
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:22,320
It's very disappointing to see some of the other pastors in the area say well why isn't

1721
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,200
this church making the same sacrifices that I am

1722
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:30,360
Oh they make it a sacrifice not to be shut down, they make it a sacrifice to traffic

1723
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:35,000
kids, they make it a sacrifice to submit, those aren't real churches and God knows it

1724
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,920
Oh boy

1725
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,400
These other pastors, I mean if they can reconcile

1726
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:46,080
These aren't pastors, these are world council of churches, Rockefeller pimps

1727
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:51,160
So this is a point of the episode where I was sort of lost in thought and I started

1728
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:56,680
to think, I have an interesting thought experiment, maybe it's not a thought experiment, rhetorical

1729
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,680
question

1730
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,680
Sure, sure

1731
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,360
Do you think that Alex Jones could name a living member of the Rockefeller family?

1732
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,280
Absolutely not, absolutely not, zero percent chance

1733
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,280
I don't think he could

1734
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:15,480
No, I do like that this also plays into what should be very obvious to anybody is if it

1735
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:21,920
weren't for immigration and racism, Christians would be murdering each other left and right

1736
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,080
They hate each other, they don't believe the same shit, they're all nonsense

1737
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:34,420
Well I mean with this letter of the 28 religious leaders in Alberta, they were all like hey

1738
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,800
come on, let's take this seriously

1739
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,960
Do you know what was in that letter?

1740
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,080
Even the Church of Satan is willing to

1741
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,360
That letter was delivered from a truck

1742
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,400
From a truck, yes

1743
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:55,520
It's rare that you get the Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist communities walking arm-in-arm

1744
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,520
with the Satanists

1745
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,520
Yes, exactly

1746
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,200
But this church is enough of a pain in the ass

1747
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:05,880
Oh my god guys, anyway they're giving us a bad name

1748
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:12,200
Alex is trying to get people to go to this church and have it be their Stalingrad, someone's

1749
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,200
Stalingrad

1750
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,840
Anybody's Stalingrad

1751
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:22,180
In order for this to sound better, he wants Sheila to do it

1752
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:23,180
He wants her

1753
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,720
He wants her to tell everybody to go there

1754
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,720
Yeah, because

1755
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,720
Naturally

1756
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,840
Then he could be like ah, she did it, I didn't do that

1757
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,720
Yeah, absolutely, implicate somebody else in your crime

1758
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,160
She's not as into it as Alex hopes

1759
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:39,280
I feel it, I see it, I think it'll be 5,000 people tomorrow, 10,000 this weekend, I think

1760
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,280
they've jumped the shark

1761
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:45,120
Call, you need to do it, beautiful, beautiful soul, tell people, Sheila Gunn-Reed, come

1762
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,160
peacefully now, call them, tell them

1763
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:52,800
If people are going to come to support Grace Life, they welcome the support, but if you're

1764
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:59,320
coming, come peacefully and come respectfully, but they would appreciate your support, they

1765
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:05,560
need it now more than ever, their church has been seized by the state, they need all the

1766
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,560
support that they can get

1767
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,560
I don't want to be peaceful, but we need you to then call them, say, help us, call them

1768
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,840
Well I don't want to speak for the church, Alex, I really don't want to speak for the

1769
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,840
church

1770
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,520
But just as a Canadian, as a human, I'm just saying that everyone needs to hear you call

1771
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:22,000
for that, I'm calling for it, we call for people to stand up for religious freedom

1772
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Absolutely

1773
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,160
Sheila, I'll go that far

1774
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,160
Yeah

1775
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:31,120
I'll support religious freedom, isn't this what like journalists do?

1776
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,120
I guess

1777
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,760
Is this what Alex thinks reporters do, they come on shows and try and

1778
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:41,640
Demand murders!

1779
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,720
I mean, if she's supposed to be covering this story, it doesn't make sense for the interview

1780
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:51,320
to end with him begging her to call people to come to this church

1781
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,320
Yeah

1782
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,320
That's weird

1783
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,320
Yeah, that's bad

1784
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,880
Yeah, this isn't any kind of reporting

1785
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:04,040
This is, at best, activism, and at worst, and in reality, incitement

1786
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,040
Yeah

1787
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,520
Yeah

1788
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,520
This episode is nuts

1789
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,560
Sheila, you're a bad person

1790
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,800
I mean, I think she's, I don't know enough about her to really have a full picture, but

1791
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,680
based on her behavior, I think she's trying to stay a little more neutral than Alex wants

1792
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,680
her to be

1793
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,040
I do, I do agree with you there

1794
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,840
She doesn't understand that Alex is like, she's talking to a guy who's a parody version

1795
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,840
Yeah

1796
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,640
Of a right-wing media outlet

1797
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,640
Oh boy

1798
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,240
She's used to, you know, uh

1799
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,000
Pretend seriousness

1800
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,360
Oh, and at least like, I don't necessarily want to get sued

1801
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,800
Sure, sure, sure, sure

1802
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,360
Alex doesn't seem to care

1803
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,680
I'm behaving in ways where I clearly want people to fucking sue me

1804
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,520
I fear consequences, and Alex apparently doesn't

1805
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,520
Yeah

1806
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,320
In Canada, we might get consequences

1807
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,280
In America, Alex receives none

1808
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:01,520
Alex has learned over the course of his career not to respect the idea of chickens coming

1809
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,520
home to roost

1810
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,480
Of the law, yeah, yeah, yeah

1811
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,680
And that's why he behaves the way he does

1812
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,680
Yeah, pretty much

1813
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,600
I listened to this episode, and I was blown away by like, okay, I thought that video was

1814
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,600
bad

1815
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,600
Yeah

1816
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,600
I thought it, I still think it's bad

1817
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,600
I think it's terrible

1818
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,600
I think it's terrible

1819
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,720
I think it's legally actionable, and uh, you know, whatever

1820
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,720
Yeah

1821
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:21,120
I didn't expect for the episode afterwards to be worse

1822
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,640
Yeah, I was, I was surprised, I thought we were gonna have a little fun clowning on that

1823
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:32,040
dumb video, I hadn't seen it, so I was, you know, I was waiting for the show, obviously

1824
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,040
And

1825
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,040
There's not much to see

1826
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:39,240
Instead, we got a concentrated bullion cube of racism and incitement to violence

1827
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:47,040
Yeah, yeah, and I really, I mean, I mean this, I hope that nothing happens

1828
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,160
Yeah, me too

1829
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:54,200
His behavior in the past has led to people going and fucking with people and victimizing

1830
01:23:54,200 --> 01:24:00,720
people in ways that are irresponsible and terrible, and for him to have two targets

1831
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,320
of like, everyone's gotta go to these places

1832
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,320
Yeah

1833
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,680
In one day is really, really scary, what it could portend

1834
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,880
No, admittedly, it could lead to nothing

1835
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,600
But the danger is there, and that is, I just don't think it's acceptable to act this way

1836
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:22,640
Yeah, I mean, see, can't you see in a courtroom, like, your honor, in this trial we aim to

1837
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:30,640
prove that Alex Jones did another Pizzagate, so if we prove that, then he goes away forever,

1838
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,640
right?

1839
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,640
That's good

1840
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,640
I don't know

1841
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,640
I'm a bad prosecutor

1842
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,640
Yeah, certainly

1843
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,840
I don't know how you do that in court, but like, just for the sake of like, a podcast

1844
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,840
that explores these things

1845
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,840
Sure

1846
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,560
I think you can definitely say he's behaving in exactly the same ways as he has when things

1847
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,560
have gone bad

1848
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,560
Yeah

1849
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,560
It's bad

1850
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,560
Yeah

1851
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:50,560
Not good

1852
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,640
We should learn from the things that have already happened

1853
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,640
Yep

1854
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,640
I think that would be wise

1855
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:55,640
Yep

1856
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,640
Yeah

1857
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:01,800
So, fingers crossed, things work out okay, and I guess we will find out on our next episode

1858
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,520
I hope calling on people to not go to the border, or that church

1859
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,520
Yes

1860
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,000
I strongly call on everyone to not do either of those things

1861
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,080
Yeah, I'm in favor of people

1862
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,080
Stay home!

1863
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,080
Yeah

1864
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,640
Have a nice little cocktail

1865
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,640
Yeah

1866
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,560
Isn't that better than going to the border or a weird church in Canada?

1867
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,560
Yep

1868
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,560
I think so

1869
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,320
And we will be back, but until then Jordan, we have a website

1870
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,760
We do, it's knowledgefight.com

1871
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,320
Oh wait, I forgot, also

1872
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,320
What's that?

1873
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,120
Like I said, we're gonna, our Monday episode will be on Wednesday

1874
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,360
It'll be on Wednesday, yes

1875
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:37,560
But if I'm feeling better, might put out a little funny fun thing on Monday

1876
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,560
We'll see

1877
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,560
We'll see

1878
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,960
Also, we're gonna be on Twitter

1879
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,440
We are on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.com, go to bed Jordan

1880
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,440
We're also on Facebook

1881
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,440
We are on Facebook

1882
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,200
If you would like to download the show, and if you could, please find a local charity

1883
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,240
or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work

1884
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,240
Yep

1885
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:57,240
