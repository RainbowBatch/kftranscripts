00:13.000 --> 00:18.080
Damn and Jordan, I am sweating

00:18.080 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.320 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight

Knowledgefight

00:25.200 --> 00:27.440
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.440 --> 00:30.040
Shang, we are the bad guys, Knowledgefight

00:30.040 --> 00:32.240
Damn and Jordan, Knowledgefight

00:32.240 --> 00:35.040
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

00:47.240 --> 00:49.440
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:49.440 --> 00:51.840
Hello Alex, I'm a victim caller, I'm a huge fan

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.440 --> 01:02.240
I'm Jordan

01:02.240 --> 01:04.240
We're Gible Dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages

01:04.240 --> 01:06.040
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:06.040 --> 01:07.640
Oh indeed we are, Dan

01:07.640 --> 01:08.040
Jordan

01:08.040 --> 01:08.440
Dan

01:08.440 --> 01:09.040
Jordan

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
Quick question

01:10.040 --> 01:10.840
What's up?

01:10.840 --> 01:11.640
What's your bright spot today?

01:11.640 --> 01:14.640
My bright spot today, Jordan, is, uh, hey

01:14.640 --> 01:17.440
I finally got an appointment to get a vaccine

01:17.440 --> 01:18.640
Yay!

01:18.640 --> 01:19.840
Oh yeah, thank you

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
Very exciting

01:20.840 --> 01:26.240
Um, it's been, I've been, uh, I'm past due in terms of, like, the groupings and what have you

01:26.240 --> 01:30.640
and I've been trying to, uh, find a place where I can go get a shot

01:30.640 --> 01:34.640
and I'm finally, as people are listening to this, it comes out on Friday

01:34.640 --> 01:35.440
Oh that's true

01:35.440 --> 01:36.840
I'm going tomorrow

01:36.840 --> 01:37.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:37.840 --> 01:40.840
to get my shot, so, uh, I'm excited about that

01:40.840 --> 01:42.240
I'm very excited about that

01:42.240 --> 01:45.040
I'm excited about embarking on this next chapter of, uh, life

01:45.040 --> 01:47.040
We're free!

01:47.040 --> 01:49.040
Or something approximating it

01:49.040 --> 01:49.640
Something like that

01:49.640 --> 01:53.640
Yeah, and, uh, also as a sort of byproduct of this, this bright spot

01:53.640 --> 01:57.440
Um, I don't know if there's going to be, you know, any kind of side effects

01:57.440 --> 02:00.640
like a fever or, you know, tiredness or anything

02:00.640 --> 02:06.240
and so, in the interest of that, I'm going to give myself the weekend for just self and rest

02:06.240 --> 02:07.240
Recuperation

02:07.240 --> 02:11.040
Um, and so our Monday episode, uh, will actually come out on Wednesday

02:11.040 --> 02:11.440
Yes

02:11.440 --> 02:13.840
We're gonna push that back just, uh, for the sake of

02:13.840 --> 02:16.040
Safety, better safe than sorry

02:16.040 --> 02:19.840
I'd like to sit around and drink some tea, maybe, or something, you know, like

02:19.840 --> 02:24.240
If there's anything that the pandemic has taught us, it's maybe be overly cautious from time to time

02:24.240 --> 02:29.440
Yeah, you know, it's sort of, uh, I wanna, I wanna be like that image of what my parents thought I was doing

02:29.440 --> 02:31.440
when I stayed home from school sick

02:31.440 --> 02:33.040
When I was in school

02:33.040 --> 02:36.440
Oh, he's just watching the Price is Right like everybody else does

02:36.440 --> 02:37.840
Just sipping soup

02:37.840 --> 02:40.040
Just sitting there with a little blanket on

02:40.040 --> 02:40.840
Just broth

02:40.840 --> 02:41.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:41.840 --> 02:45.840
Letting those, those fumes open up my pores and my, uh

02:45.840 --> 02:46.340
Absolutely

02:46.340 --> 02:46.840
My sinuses

02:46.840 --> 02:47.640
Yeah, you got it

02:47.640 --> 02:49.640
Um, yeah, so that's, that's exciting

02:49.640 --> 02:50.440
That's wonderful

02:50.440 --> 02:51.240
Yeah, how about you?

02:51.240 --> 02:51.840
We're all very excited

02:51.840 --> 02:55.240
Uh, my bright spot, Dan, is, uh, Godspeed You Black Emperor

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
Yeah, you were telling me it's a new album

02:56.240 --> 02:57.240
Has put out a new album

02:57.240 --> 02:59.440
And it is spectacular

02:59.440 --> 02:59.840
Yeah

02:59.840 --> 03:00.840
It is so good

03:00.840 --> 03:01.240
Mhm

03:01.240 --> 03:05.440
They're on, like, almost 25 years as a band or something

03:05.440 --> 03:07.040
They're incredible

03:07.040 --> 03:08.640
It's fantastic

03:08.640 --> 03:10.040
They still got it, Dan

03:10.040 --> 03:13.640
I feel like you and I were supposed to do something and you couldn't because you had to listen to the album on repeat

03:13.640 --> 03:17.240
I was too busy listening to Godspeed

03:17.240 --> 03:19.240
Uh, hey, work can't get done

03:19.240 --> 03:21.240
Sorry, I would, look, I would love to help

03:21.240 --> 03:23.440
But, uh, Godspeed released a new album

03:23.440 --> 03:27.040
So I'm gonna have to listen to this 40-minute opus

03:27.040 --> 03:27.640
I understand

03:27.640 --> 03:28.040
Yeah

03:28.040 --> 03:29.040
I understand

03:29.040 --> 03:32.440
Um, so, Jordan, today we have an interesting, uh, little bit to go over

03:32.440 --> 03:36.440
I don't know if you've been able to keep unaware of some of the news

03:36.440 --> 03:39.640
Some of it I have been unable to stay unaware of

03:39.640 --> 03:41.040
Right, so we'll get into some of that

03:41.040 --> 03:41.640
Alright

03:41.640 --> 03:42.640
Oh, boy

03:42.640 --> 03:46.440
Um, but before we do, let's take a little moment to say hello and thank you to some new wonks

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
Oh, that's a great idea

03:47.440 --> 03:52.040
First, uh, this person, J-D-O, J-D-O, I don't know how to pronounce that

03:52.040 --> 03:53.040
Sure

03:53.040 --> 03:55.040
J-D-O

03:55.040 --> 04:02.640
Um, they, uh, also, uh, were kind enough to mention, uh, keep, uh, tell me about an event that's coming up in Oklahoma

04:02.640 --> 04:03.640
Uh-huh

04:03.640 --> 04:09.240
Where, uh, all kinds of weirdos are speaking and, man, I wanna go

04:09.240 --> 04:10.840
I believe Mike Adams is giving a speech

04:10.840 --> 04:11.840
Oh, no

04:11.840 --> 04:14.440
Uh, I really would like to go, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it

04:14.440 --> 04:16.040
But anyway, thank you, J-D-O

04:16.040 --> 04:17.040
I'm a policy wonk

04:17.040 --> 04:18.040
You're now a policy wonk

04:18.040 --> 04:19.040
Thank you

04:19.040 --> 04:20.040
Next

04:20.040 --> 04:21.040
Oi, hawkin

04:21.040 --> 04:22.040
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:22.040 --> 04:23.040
I'm a policy wonk

04:23.040 --> 04:24.040
Thank you very much

04:24.040 --> 04:25.040
Oi, hawkin

04:25.040 --> 04:28.540
Uh, this person also wanted me to give a shout-out to the Knowledge Fighters

04:28.540 --> 04:32.040
Apparently there's a Discord, uh, uh, server?

04:32.040 --> 04:33.040
Is that what it's called?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.040
I have no idea

04:34.040 --> 04:35.040
Discord is beyond me

04:35.040 --> 04:36.040
Yeah, me too

04:36.040 --> 04:41.040
Um, but, uh, there's apparently a place where, uh, listeners of the show congregate and, uh,

04:41.040 --> 04:42.040
chat, uh, up

04:42.040 --> 04:44.040
And I've heard it's a lot of fun

04:44.040 --> 04:45.040
Oh, that's great!

04:45.040 --> 04:46.040
Yeah, so

04:46.040 --> 04:49.040
That's really great that I'm just now finding out about it

04:49.040 --> 04:50.040
Uh, next

04:50.040 --> 04:51.040
Justice for wonk

04:51.040 --> 04:52.840
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

04:52.840 --> 04:53.840
I'm a policy wonk

04:53.840 --> 04:54.840
Thank you very much

04:54.840 --> 04:55.840
Thank you, next

04:55.840 --> 04:56.840
And that is our rallying cry, Dan

04:56.840 --> 04:57.840
Next

04:57.840 --> 04:58.840
Pee Biggs

04:58.840 --> 05:00.040
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:00.040 --> 05:01.040
I'm a policy wonk

05:01.040 --> 05:02.040
Thanks, Pee Biggs

05:02.040 --> 05:03.040
Thank you

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
Next

05:04.040 --> 05:05.040

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:09.040 --> 05:10.040
I'm a policy wonk

05:10.040 --> 05:11.040
Thank you very much

05:11.040 --> 05:12.040
Durk

05:12.040 --> 05:13.040
Queerdinker

05:13.040 --> 05:14.040
Oh, boy

05:14.040 --> 05:15.040
I think they said that they wanted me to mispronounce

05:15.040 --> 05:16.040
Mispronounce it?

05:16.040 --> 05:17.040
Yeah, okay

05:17.040 --> 05:18.040
Next

05:18.040 --> 05:19.040
Zap

05:19.040 --> 05:20.040

05:22.040 --> 05:23.040
Thank you very much, Zap Rodoser

05:23.040 --> 05:24.040
Rose Dozer

05:24.040 --> 05:25.040
Zap Rose Dozer

05:25.040 --> 05:26.040
Apologies

05:26.040 --> 05:29.040
I, I only hear Zap Brannigan in my head, so that's what I got

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
Next

05:30.040 --> 05:31.040
Jucks

05:31.040 --> 05:32.040
Jucks definitely killed his daughter

05:32.040 --> 05:34.040
Chuck Norris wasn't wearing a wig

05:34.040 --> 05:36.040
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
I'm a policy wonk

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
Thank you so much

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
Thank you very much

05:39.040 --> 05:43.040
And finally, I'd like to say thank you and give a shout out to a new technocrat, this

05:43.040 --> 05:47.040
is, uh, thank you so much, Treadmark, you are now a technocrat

05:47.040 --> 05:48.040
I'm a policy wonk

05:48.040 --> 05:51.040
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

05:51.040 --> 05:53.040
How's your 401k doing, bro?

05:53.040 --> 05:55.040
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

05:55.040 --> 05:57.040
Let's just get down to business

05:57.040 --> 05:59.040
We ain't making that money off that heroin

05:59.040 --> 06:01.040
Why you pimps so good?

06:01.040 --> 06:03.040
My, my neck is freakishly large

06:03.040 --> 06:05.040
I declare info war on you

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
Thank you so much, Treadmark

06:06.040 --> 06:08.040
Yes, thank you very much, Treadmark

06:08.040 --> 06:13.040
Treadmark also wanted me to give a shout out to, uh, Reddit board, ah shit, I forgot the

06:13.040 --> 06:14.040
name of it

06:14.040 --> 06:24.040
Um, R The Donald, I believe was the one that he really wanted to get out there

06:24.040 --> 06:26.040
So Jordan, there's been some news

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
Yes, Dan

06:27.040 --> 06:33.040
So I'd been all ready to go back to 2003 for today's episode, have some fun, learning about

06:33.040 --> 06:34.040
the past and what have you

06:34.040 --> 06:35.040
Of course

06:35.040 --> 06:37.040
But then at the last minute all my plans got thrown into whack

06:37.040 --> 06:39.040
As is always the case

06:39.040 --> 06:42.040
Alex went down to the border, he was looking for a soul to steal

06:42.040 --> 06:47.040
And on Wednesday he released a video of himself accosting somebody who was transporting some

06:47.040 --> 06:50.040
children, possibly recklessly in the back of a station wagon

06:50.040 --> 06:51.040
Sure

06:51.040 --> 06:54.040
Alex, or maybe it was more of a van, I don't know, I don't know car types

06:54.040 --> 06:59.040
Anyway, Alex and his associates yell at the guy driving the car about how he's been caught

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
smuggling people

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
Sure

07:01.040 --> 07:02.040
And it is a huge mess

07:02.040 --> 07:03.040
Uh huh

07:03.040 --> 07:06.040
I don't know what all the details of this situation are at this point, but I do know

07:06.040 --> 07:10.040
that I don't believe for a second that Alex and his dumb posse found someone just smuggling

07:10.040 --> 07:11.040
children casually

07:11.040 --> 07:15.040
I'm gonna wait to dig into this until there's a little bit more public information because

07:15.040 --> 07:18.040
I could see this going a couple different directions

07:18.040 --> 07:21.040
And honestly, Alex better keep his fingers crossed because it looks like a couple things

07:21.040 --> 07:24.040
in that video that he released could be crimes

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
Oh, that's not good

07:25.040 --> 07:29.040
He's sitting there banging like on the roof of a car trying to physically stop it from

07:29.040 --> 07:30.040
leaving

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
Yeah

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
Which could be a problem

07:32.040 --> 07:36.040
He's acting in ways that some might interpret as defamatory

07:36.040 --> 07:43.040
I mean, it does a little bit sound like Alex Jones just started attacking Clark Griswold

07:43.040 --> 07:46.040
on the way to the fucking theme park

07:46.040 --> 07:51.040
I'm not a legal expert, but it really looks like this video is an open and shut case of

07:51.040 --> 07:55.040
defamation against a charity that is alleged to be involved in this smuggling

07:55.040 --> 07:59.040
This is Catholic Charities RGV

07:59.040 --> 08:02.040
Their address and signs are clearly shown in the video

08:02.040 --> 08:03.040
That's not good

08:03.040 --> 08:06.040
And the accusation is very clear from Alex's actions that this charity is essentially a

08:06.040 --> 08:08.040
front for smuggling

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
That's probably defamatory

08:09.040 --> 08:12.040
This organization is the Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley

08:12.040 --> 08:17.040
And the specific building that Alex was staking out was the Humanitarian Crisis Relief Center

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
that they began operating last summer

08:19.040 --> 08:20.040
Right

08:20.040 --> 08:25.040
According to their website, this is at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen, Texas

08:25.040 --> 08:29.040
And quote, the center provides a place for the countless men, women, and children and

08:29.040 --> 08:34.040
infant refugees to rest, have a warm meal, a shower, and change into clean clothing

08:34.040 --> 08:37.040
as well as receive medicine and other supplies before continuing on their journey

08:37.040 --> 08:42.040
So Alex was like, quick, someone's acting Christ-like, destroy them!

08:42.040 --> 08:43.040
Yep

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
Okay

08:44.040 --> 08:47.040
If you look into this specific charity, it becomes a little interesting that Alex would

08:47.040 --> 08:49.040
choose this one to focus on

08:49.040 --> 08:53.040
The organization was started by a nun named Sister Norma Pimentel

08:53.040 --> 08:57.040
who was a very fierce and public critic of Trump's border policies

08:57.040 --> 09:02.040
To her credit, she was also a vocal opponent of Obama's policies, but that probably doesn't matter to Alex

09:02.040 --> 09:06.040
She wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post in February 2020 titled

09:06.040 --> 09:11.040
quote, President Trump don't ignore the suffering at the border caused by your policies

09:11.040 --> 09:15.040
In 2019, she was invited to participate in what was called a roundtable conversation

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
about issues at the border with Trump himself

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
That one was called Back in the Habit, I believe

09:21.040 --> 09:24.040
Sister Pimentel was disappointed by what she experienced

09:24.040 --> 09:27.040
as she discussed in an interview with Texas Monthly

09:27.040 --> 09:31.040
Quote, Trump asked every single person at the table to say something

09:31.040 --> 09:35.040
and I realized that when they were speaking, they were just reaffirming what it was

09:35.040 --> 09:38.040
that he had talked about and congratulating him

09:38.040 --> 09:42.040
I realized that the roundtable was about listening to and reaffirming his plans

09:42.040 --> 09:45.040
He didn't really give local people an opportunity to say anything

09:45.040 --> 09:47.040
That is unsurprising

09:47.040 --> 09:53.040
Very recently, in March 2021, she was featured in an article in the Rio Grande Guardian

09:53.040 --> 09:55.040
that begins like this

09:55.040 --> 09:59.040
Quote, the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley

09:59.040 --> 10:03.040
thanks God for President Biden's decision to reverse the Trump administration's

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
Migrant Protection Protocols policy

10:05.040 --> 10:11.040
Sister Norma Pimentel says it's God's plan to have asylum requests

10:11.040 --> 10:15.040
of unaccompanied minors from Central America fully processed in the United States

10:15.040 --> 10:18.040
Sure, mere days ago, on April 4th

10:18.040 --> 10:21.040
Sister Pimentel was interviewed on Face the Nation

10:21.040 --> 10:25.040
where she discussed how Biden's changes to Trump's policies have changed her work

10:25.040 --> 10:28.040
Okay, so you're saying that a few days ago

10:28.040 --> 10:31.040
Just a few days, perhaps even, what?

10:31.040 --> 10:34.040
One or two days before this incident occurred

10:34.040 --> 10:35.040
Eh, right around

10:35.040 --> 10:42.040
The person who began or started the very charity that Alex will accosted

10:42.040 --> 10:43.040
and defamed

10:43.040 --> 10:48.040
Who has also been a long time public critic of Trump's policies

10:48.040 --> 10:53.040
and again, for the sake of giving it up for moral clarity and consistency

10:53.040 --> 10:56.040
was also a critic of Obama's policies

10:56.040 --> 10:59.040
and is a critic of these new policies not going far enough

10:59.040 --> 11:04.040
but inasmuch as they are representative of progress in the areas that she works in

11:04.040 --> 11:06.040
she is congratulatory of them

11:06.040 --> 11:13.040
So what you have just told me is that this was a completely extemporaneous event

11:13.040 --> 11:19.040
Alex was wandering around and heard the call to action

11:19.040 --> 11:20.040
No, but here's the thing

11:20.040 --> 11:23.040
Instinctively ran to stop this human trafficking from occurring

11:23.040 --> 11:24.040
No, but here's the thing

11:24.040 --> 11:28.040
I can totally believe he doesn't know any of this

11:28.040 --> 11:31.040
I actually can totally believe that too

11:31.040 --> 11:33.040
It could totally be a coincidence

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
Yeah

11:34.040 --> 11:39.040
I was looking into this charity and trying to understand a little bit more about it

11:39.040 --> 11:44.040
and all these things like, oh, this is a person who is someone who Alex absolutely would target

11:44.040 --> 11:45.040
Oh, despise, yeah

11:45.040 --> 11:50.040
But at the same time, I can totally see this just being a situation where

11:50.040 --> 11:54.040
he went to McAllen, Texas

11:54.040 --> 11:57.040
was hanging out outside waiting for the optics to be right

11:57.040 --> 11:58.040
Sure

11:58.040 --> 11:59.040
Then he created a scene

11:59.040 --> 12:00.040
Sure

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
did a publicity stunt

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
and blah, blah, blah, here we go

12:02.040 --> 12:03.040
Yeah, that sounds about right

12:03.040 --> 12:06.040
But, better hope this doesn't go to court

12:06.040 --> 12:09.040
because I think you could make a pretty compelling case

12:09.040 --> 12:15.040
that Alex has a reason to have animus towards this organization

12:15.040 --> 12:17.040
based on their political differences

12:17.040 --> 12:23.040
I'm struggling to live in a world where a judge might disagree with me

12:23.040 --> 12:25.040
on what is very clearly an open and shut case

12:25.040 --> 12:29.040
I don't like living in a world where a judge is like, well, if you interpret that

12:29.040 --> 12:31.040
Nah, nah, nah, this is too obvious

12:31.040 --> 12:32.040
Yeah

12:32.040 --> 12:36.040
So, I don't really care to deconstruct this video in and of itself

12:36.040 --> 12:39.040
because it's just Alex yelling at a guy in a car

12:39.040 --> 12:40.040
It's great

12:40.040 --> 12:43.040
On April 8th, the Catholic Charities released a statement hoping to clarify

12:43.040 --> 12:46.040
the various defamatory claims made by Alex

12:46.040 --> 12:48.040
The response makes total sense

12:48.040 --> 12:49.040
Fuck that guy

12:49.040 --> 12:52.040
The only thing that I think is missing is a threat of legal action

12:52.040 --> 12:53.040
Yeah

12:53.040 --> 12:56.040
But again, this is up to everybody themselves

12:56.040 --> 12:57.040
Of course

12:57.040 --> 13:00.040
to deal with on their own terms and decide whether they want to go through that

13:00.040 --> 13:04.040
rigmarole and that public embarrassment and difficulty

13:04.040 --> 13:07.040
Oh yeah, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy

13:07.040 --> 13:08.040
Nah

13:08.040 --> 13:10.040
I would wish it on Alex though, so never mind

13:10.040 --> 13:12.040
I would wish that on my worst enemy, yeah

13:12.040 --> 13:16.040
I wouldn't wish whatever the person suing him would have to go through

13:16.040 --> 13:17.040
all the difficulty

13:17.040 --> 13:18.040
Yeah

13:18.040 --> 13:22.040
I understand why some people are reluctant to

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
Totally

13:23.040 --> 13:26.040
But boy, this seems like a pretty easy case

13:26.040 --> 13:30.040
It shouldn't take too long to work its way through the courts

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
Yeah

13:31.040 --> 13:37.040
I can imagine Alex giving a blustery speech about how he'll fight this or die

13:37.040 --> 13:38.040
Sure

13:38.040 --> 13:40.040
And then a week later issuing a public apology

13:40.040 --> 13:44.040
Listen, I don't want to get in the way of nuns doing all their business

13:44.040 --> 13:45.040
Love nuns

13:45.040 --> 13:47.040
Nuns are good people, yeah

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
Did you see Sister Act 2 back in the habit?

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
This is how I'm going to poach Jordan's joke

13:51.040 --> 13:52.040
It was pretty great

13:52.040 --> 13:56.040
So yeah, I don't want to talk about that video in and of itself

13:56.040 --> 13:59.040
but what I thought might be interesting is seeing what happens on the 8th

13:59.040 --> 14:06.040
because this is Thursday, this is after he's had the social media flare up

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
over this video

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
Sure, he's had his moment

14:08.040 --> 14:11.040
It's been posted, we went all kinds of viral and stuff

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Yeah, of course

14:12.040 --> 14:15.040
And yeah, I wanted to see where he was at on the 8th

14:15.040 --> 14:16.040
Yeah, sure, let's see what happens

14:16.040 --> 14:18.040
So here's another context drop from this show

14:18.040 --> 14:20.040
I'm not okay

14:20.040 --> 14:23.040
And is anybody the good guy in Ukraine?

14:23.040 --> 14:26.040
They've been killing each other for so long, eastern and western Ukraine

14:26.040 --> 14:29.040
It's like the half-cocks and McCoys

14:29.040 --> 14:30.040
What?

14:30.040 --> 14:36.040
Is anybody the bad guy in Ukraine is a dark question to ask

14:36.040 --> 14:39.040
Well, you're focusing on a different part than I'm focusing on

14:39.040 --> 14:40.040
I understand that

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
The half-cocks and the McCoys?

14:41.040 --> 14:44.040
I don't know what to do with the half-cocks and the McCoys

14:44.040 --> 14:46.040
I just heard that and stroked out

14:46.040 --> 14:49.040
Yeah, I know that the people misspeak and whatever

14:49.040 --> 14:51.040
And I'm not a nitpicker

14:51.040 --> 14:53.040
But this is an out-of-context drop, first of all

14:53.040 --> 14:57.040
And second of all, if there's anything that Alex's persona should know a lot about

14:57.040 --> 14:59.040
Oh, the Hatfields and the McCoys?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.040
Yeah, you think so?

15:00.040 --> 15:01.040
Yes

15:01.040 --> 15:03.040
Not the half-asses and the McCoys?

15:03.040 --> 15:04.040
The half-cocks

15:04.040 --> 15:05.040
Yikes

15:06.040 --> 15:10.040
Oh man, now I want to start a gang called the half-cocks

15:10.040 --> 15:12.040
And just never explain the name

15:12.040 --> 15:13.040
Sure

15:13.040 --> 15:15.040
People are just like, why do they call them the half-cocks?

15:15.040 --> 15:19.040
They say, we should get windbreakers

15:19.040 --> 15:22.040
Unrelated to this conversation entirely

15:22.040 --> 15:25.040
That was just a random thought

15:25.040 --> 15:27.040
We should just get windbreakers

15:27.040 --> 15:29.040
So we're going to start here on April 8th

15:29.040 --> 15:36.040
And I will say, it seems like Alex isn't even thinking about the border, this video, anything

15:36.040 --> 15:37.040
Of course

15:37.040 --> 15:39.040
The alarm bells are hitting

15:39.040 --> 15:43.040
China has now, with aircraft carriers and over a hundred ships

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
Thousands totaled

15:45.040 --> 15:50.040
Encircled Taiwan and has heavy bombers flying over it

15:50.040 --> 15:54.040
The Taiwanese say they may start firing missiles any minute

15:54.040 --> 15:57.040
That was this morning, last night there

15:57.040 --> 16:00.040
All hell is breaking loose

16:00.040 --> 16:05.040
The Russians are massing troops on the edge of Ukraine because Biden's sending in heavy weapons

16:05.040 --> 16:09.040
And there are major artillery battles going on

16:09.040 --> 16:13.040
Between proxy U.S. and Russian forces and we are not the good guys in this

16:13.040 --> 16:16.040
So we got a world war coming together here

16:16.040 --> 16:20.040
Yeah, that does sound pretty much the canary in the coal mine

16:20.040 --> 16:23.040
This seems to be the line that Alex is taking now

16:23.040 --> 16:26.040
Which I find interesting because a couple days prior

16:26.040 --> 16:29.040
He was really going hard on this SPARS document

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
Sure

16:30.040 --> 16:32.040
And then he went to the border and did a giant publicity stunt

16:32.040 --> 16:33.040
Right, right, right

16:33.040 --> 16:34.040
And now it's world war

16:34.040 --> 16:35.040
Now we're moving on

16:35.040 --> 16:37.040
This is confusing

16:37.040 --> 16:39.040
I hear, I hear

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
This is chaotic

16:40.040 --> 16:44.040
What I am hearing while he speaks is the advice of a lawyer in his ear going

16:44.040 --> 16:46.040
Don't explain anything about that

16:46.040 --> 16:47.040
Talk about

16:47.040 --> 16:48.040
The more you talk about it

16:48.040 --> 16:49.040
Something else

16:49.040 --> 16:51.040
Do you remember what happened with the million dollar bounty? Do you remember?

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
Oh no, I mean you're wrong about that

16:53.040 --> 16:56.040
But it's weird that he starts the show like this

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
He does get into the video eventually

16:57.040 --> 16:58.040
Oh okay, well of course

16:58.040 --> 17:01.040
So if there's a lawyer in his ear he forgets about it very quickly

17:01.040 --> 17:03.040
You gotta keep the lawyer in there at all times

17:03.040 --> 17:07.040
I think that one of the reasons that Alex is going on and starting his show

17:07.040 --> 17:11.040
Sort of leading with this idea about world war and all this

17:11.040 --> 17:15.040
Is because that day Biden was giving a speech

17:15.040 --> 17:19.040
About gun control, regulation ideas

17:19.040 --> 17:20.040
Sure

17:20.040 --> 17:26.040
And that fits more in those sets of narratives

17:26.040 --> 17:27.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

17:27.040 --> 17:30.040
I'll make more clear what I mean a little bit later as we go through

17:30.040 --> 17:34.040
But the beginning of this show and a large portion of the top of it

17:34.040 --> 17:38.040
Is Alex playing Biden's speech and then just sort of rambling over it

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
Sure

17:39.040 --> 17:40.040
Thank you for having the courage

17:40.040 --> 17:42.040
He cares so much about violence

17:42.040 --> 17:44.040
That's why Obama fought in the Arab Spring

17:44.040 --> 17:46.040
Fast and furious, killed millions

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
Senator Blumenthal understands it

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
With the guns of what the Middle East and Mexico

17:49.040 --> 17:50.040
A lot of the folks out here understand it

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
He transitioned weapons to terrorists in Mexico

17:52.040 --> 17:53.040
Thank you

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
With Obama

17:54.040 --> 17:57.040
To turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the action

17:57.040 --> 18:00.040
He's a gun running communist Chinese criminal

18:00.040 --> 18:01.040
Enough

18:01.040 --> 18:03.040
Yeah, enough of you funded terrorists

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
You drug dealing pedophile

18:05.040 --> 18:08.040
Oh boy, so it's that, it's that for a while

18:08.040 --> 18:11.040
He's interrupting like Joe Biden is the highwayman

18:11.040 --> 18:15.040
It's a little annoying

18:15.040 --> 18:16.040
Yeah, that's frustrating

18:16.040 --> 18:19.040
Yeah, so he keeps insisting that fast and furious

18:19.040 --> 18:23.040
Is the silver bullet that will take down the O'Biden administration

18:23.040 --> 18:26.040
Ooh, how long did it take to get there?

18:26.040 --> 18:28.040
It seems like that should have happened way earlier

18:28.040 --> 18:31.040
He kept calling Biden Obama and then

18:31.040 --> 18:32.040
And then he just put it together

18:32.040 --> 18:34.040
Yeah, for a while he's been calling

18:34.040 --> 18:35.040
That's so frustrating

18:35.040 --> 18:38.040
Oh, the reason I keep calling him Obama is because it's O'Biden

18:38.040 --> 18:40.040
O'Biden was right there, guys

18:40.040 --> 18:42.040
It was right there

18:42.040 --> 18:44.040
It's not hard to get there

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
Nope

18:45.040 --> 18:48.040
This is Alex doing his level best at being Rush

18:48.040 --> 18:51.040
This is why the right is terrible at comedy

18:51.040 --> 18:54.040
They can't even pick up found jokes

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
Yeah, terrible

18:55.040 --> 18:58.040
I would say that if Alex were to get sued

18:58.040 --> 19:02.040
Over this video where he is, you know, in my opinion

19:02.040 --> 19:04.040
Probably defaming this charity

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
Yeah, almost certainly

19:05.040 --> 19:08.040
One of his best defenses might be that like

19:08.040 --> 19:11.040
Not many people saw it, you know, it's no big deal

19:11.040 --> 19:14.040
Unfortunately, here he is bragging

19:14.040 --> 19:16.040
See, now there's where we get into trouble

19:16.040 --> 19:19.040
And then what happened yesterday, two days ago

19:19.040 --> 19:23.040
We put out the video that has probably 50 million views

19:23.040 --> 19:25.040
I mean, it's just everywhere

19:25.040 --> 19:29.040
And the smuggling going on, it's all illegal

19:29.040 --> 19:31.040
He didn't sign an executive order

19:31.040 --> 19:33.040
He didn't pass a law

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
He didn't repeal a law

19:34.040 --> 19:38.040
He just said, surge us before he even stole the election

19:38.040 --> 19:41.040
And then now he congratulates them on the great job they've done

19:41.040 --> 19:44.040
And then there's the quote Catholic charity that's run by the Democratic Party

19:44.040 --> 19:48.040
Just one of the facilities there in McAllen, Texas

19:48.040 --> 19:52.040
And there they are loading little kids in to a trunk like luggage

19:52.040 --> 19:55.040
And we stop them, the police say, yeah, what you're doing is illegal, take them out

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
They go inside, we catch more cars doing it

19:57.040 --> 20:00.040
We haven't even put that footage out

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
I don't think you will

20:01.040 --> 20:02.040
No, no

20:02.040 --> 20:04.040
I suspect that that footage is not forthcoming

20:04.040 --> 20:05.040
Yeah

20:05.040 --> 20:06.040
We'll see though

20:06.040 --> 20:09.040
Yeah, I mean, he's just bragging about how many people saw this

20:09.040 --> 20:14.040
Which I think works against his eventual probable argument that he's gonna need to make

20:14.040 --> 20:15.040
Yeah, he's not good at this

20:15.040 --> 20:16.040
To downplay this

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
He's not good at this

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
Yeah

20:18.040 --> 20:19.040
This is not good

20:19.040 --> 20:21.040
But then again, if he doesn't get sued and there's no legal trouble

20:21.040 --> 20:22.040
Then I guess he

20:22.040 --> 20:23.040
Wee

20:23.040 --> 20:24.040
Yeah

20:24.040 --> 20:25.040
Yep

20:25.040 --> 20:31.040
Anyway, Alex has this bee in his bonnet about the idea that people are saying that he staged this whole thing

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
He went down to the border and he staged it

20:33.040 --> 20:37.040
Well, it seems like he didn't like capture a coyote

20:37.040 --> 20:38.040
No

20:38.040 --> 20:43.040
So much as found people who were doing exactly what they said they were going to be doing

20:43.040 --> 20:44.040
And accosted them

20:44.040 --> 20:45.040
Yeah

20:45.040 --> 20:51.040
And then how does literally dozens of national newspapers said, Jones probably staged this

20:51.040 --> 20:52.040
There are no crisis

20:52.040 --> 20:54.040
Yeah, I staged the McAllen police

20:54.040 --> 20:56.040
I staged the kids being put in the trunk

20:56.040 --> 21:00.040
I mean, if I could stage something like that with a hundred million dollar budget

21:00.040 --> 21:02.040
I would be better than

21:02.040 --> 21:05.040
Is Joe Rogan gonna pay for it?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.040
The top directors out there

21:07.040 --> 21:09.040
Alex couldn't think of one director

21:09.040 --> 21:13.040
Spielberg, no, he's a globalist

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
Scorsese, no, he's a globalist

21:14.040 --> 21:16.040
Clinton Tarantino, I hate him

21:16.040 --> 21:18.040
I hate that guy

21:18.040 --> 21:22.040
Ryan Johnson, no, I wasn't a fan of The Last Jedi

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
What else do we got?

21:24.040 --> 21:27.040
I'm still bitter that I wasn't in Guardians of the Galaxy

21:27.040 --> 21:28.040
James Scott, yeah

21:28.040 --> 21:30.040
Add that one into the list

21:30.040 --> 21:33.040
All he's got is Clint Eastwood

21:33.040 --> 21:34.040
Probably

21:34.040 --> 21:37.040
So the media didn't say this about Alex

21:37.040 --> 21:43.040
On April 7th, I couldn't find like any media outlets even really covering this publicity stunt

21:43.040 --> 21:46.040
Any actual media outlets, I mean there was like a gateway pundit

21:46.040 --> 21:47.040
Sure, sure, sure, sure

21:47.040 --> 21:49.040
But there were a bunch of random people tweeting about it

21:49.040 --> 21:53.040
And I think that Alex is just pretending that random tweets saying that he probably staged the videos

21:53.040 --> 21:58.040
The same thing as dozens of media outlets and national newspapers covering it

21:58.040 --> 22:04.040
What is new media other than tweets going national, man?

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
That's new media

22:05.040 --> 22:07.040
I think I've come up with this equation

22:07.040 --> 22:13.040
And that is random tweets plus narcissism equals literally dozens of national newspapers

22:13.040 --> 22:15.040
That's a good, that's a good equation

22:15.040 --> 22:17.040
Yeah, I think that's what's going on

22:17.040 --> 22:21.040
So Alex is saying that everybody's saying that he just made this up and he staged it

22:21.040 --> 22:25.040
And it's like back in 2009 when he covered Bilderberg Man

22:25.040 --> 22:27.040
And everybody said that he was making it up

22:27.040 --> 22:29.040
And the New York Times said

22:29.040 --> 22:37.040
It did not exist and that I was having a full schizophrenic breakdown in the parking lot

22:37.040 --> 22:42.040
That's because back then folks Bilderberg didn't exist

22:42.040 --> 22:45.040
Within two years it was all over the news

22:45.040 --> 22:48.040
Because back then the Drudge Report was not I guess run by CNN

22:48.040 --> 22:50.040
I was told that CNN bought it two years ago

22:50.040 --> 22:52.040
I didn't believe it, it looks like it's true

22:52.040 --> 22:56.040
But Drudge, the real Drudge back when Drudge actually owned it

22:56.040 --> 22:58.040
Exposed all that

22:58.040 --> 23:00.040
This is so fucking stupid

23:00.040 --> 23:05.040
A quick search will disprove the idea that the media claimed that Bilderberg didn't exist until 2008

23:05.040 --> 23:07.040
I'm sorry I said 2009 earlier

23:07.040 --> 23:09.040
When Alex and Drudge exposed it

23:09.040 --> 23:13.040
For instance there's a September 2005 article in the BBC titled

23:13.040 --> 23:15.040
Quote inside the secretive Bilderberg group

23:15.040 --> 23:18.040
Or you could look at Jon Ronson's 2001 book

23:18.040 --> 23:20.040
Them Adventures with Extremists

23:20.040 --> 23:23.040
Excerpts of which were published in the Guardian

23:23.040 --> 23:27.040
And it was accompanied by the release of his TV show Secret Rulers of the World

23:27.040 --> 23:31.040
Which featured an episode where he and Alex Jones go to Bohemian Grove

23:31.040 --> 23:35.040
And the other episode of it was about the Bilderberg group

23:35.040 --> 23:37.040
No tweets at the time

23:37.040 --> 23:42.040
Oh there's also a reference to the Bilderberg meetings in a 1999 Wired article you can easily find

23:42.040 --> 23:43.040
Alright, alright

23:43.040 --> 23:46.040
When Alex said that the media said that he was imagining the whole thing

23:46.040 --> 23:52.040
What he means is that no one accepted his imaginary framing of real life events

23:52.040 --> 23:55.040
People didn't say that the meeting or the group itself didn't exist

23:55.040 --> 23:59.040
Just that the stories that Alex was selling his audience about them didn't stand up to scrutiny

23:59.040 --> 24:01.040
That's the accusation

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
Not that he made up the Bilderberg group

24:03.040 --> 24:08.040
Excuse me Alex, you're full of shit can mean many different things

24:08.040 --> 24:13.040
Also I'd like to learn more about how the Drudge report was secretly sold to CNN two years ago

24:13.040 --> 24:16.040
Sounds like another thing that Alex is pulling out of thin fucking air

24:16.040 --> 24:18.040
I would be interested to hear about that

24:18.040 --> 24:20.040
Did you look deep into that?

24:20.040 --> 24:21.040
I didn't

24:21.040 --> 24:24.040
Did you reach out to Drudge for comment?

24:24.040 --> 24:26.040
I looked for tax filings

24:26.040 --> 24:28.040
I don't know

24:28.040 --> 24:29.040
It's nonsense

24:29.040 --> 24:30.040
Yeah, whatever

24:30.040 --> 24:33.040
So I think that there's overlap between this idea of like

24:33.040 --> 24:36.040
When people are accusing Alex of making stuff up

24:36.040 --> 24:38.040
They're not talking about like the actual event

24:38.040 --> 24:39.040
Right, right, right

24:39.040 --> 24:42.040
And so like with the video that he shot down near the border

24:42.040 --> 24:43.040
It's the same thing

24:43.040 --> 24:46.040
It's like you didn't make up that someone got in a car

24:46.040 --> 24:48.040
You're just lying about the surrounding context

24:48.040 --> 24:50.040
9-11 was an inside job, you're full of shit

24:50.040 --> 24:52.040
You don't think 9-11 happened?

24:52.040 --> 24:54.040
No, obviously it happened

24:54.040 --> 24:57.040
Yeah, you may have actually said it didn't happen at some point

24:57.040 --> 24:59.040
Yeah, exactly, that's fair

24:59.040 --> 25:01.040
I gotta review all the tapes

25:01.040 --> 25:04.040
So when Alex is making these accusations, obviously

25:04.040 --> 25:05.040
That's bad

25:05.040 --> 25:08.040
But there are certainly ways that he could make the situation worse

25:08.040 --> 25:10.040
Which he decides to do in this next clip

25:10.040 --> 25:12.040
Putting out a million dollar bounty

25:12.040 --> 25:13.040
I'm not gonna say what we're gonna do

25:13.040 --> 25:16.040
But I'm obviously gonna be going back to the border very soon

25:16.040 --> 25:18.040
I'm not gonna say it's gonna be tomorrow, even this weekend

25:18.040 --> 25:19.040
It might be today

25:19.040 --> 25:20.040
I'm just gonna tell you that

25:20.040 --> 25:21.040
I've already decided when I'm going, I'm going

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
I'm going

25:22.040 --> 25:25.040
I'm not gonna tell this system how or when

25:25.040 --> 25:27.040
And quite frankly

25:27.040 --> 25:31.040
If I had the money, because we're maxed out right now

25:31.040 --> 25:34.040
I would have a full-time team just in McAllen

25:34.040 --> 25:36.040
And in Brownsville, rubbing the Texas border

25:36.040 --> 25:38.040
It is wild, wild west

25:38.040 --> 25:40.040
Insane, illegals everywhere you go

25:40.040 --> 25:42.040
Buses everywhere you go

25:42.040 --> 25:46.040
Total children sleeping in dirt under bridges

25:46.040 --> 25:48.040
We sent a drone in there, they had a geo fenced up

25:48.040 --> 25:50.040
So we couldn't show them in the dirt

25:50.040 --> 25:52.040
But Project Veritas got folks in there

25:52.040 --> 25:53.040
We have all these whistle blowers

25:53.040 --> 25:54.040
All this whistle blower video

25:54.040 --> 25:56.040
People that saw children being raped inside the facilities

25:56.040 --> 25:57.040
We broke that on Monday

25:57.040 --> 25:59.040
Now you see Governor Abbott talking about it

25:59.040 --> 26:02.040
I mean, I flew over with a helicopter

26:02.040 --> 26:05.040
We have hours and hours and hours of this footage

26:05.040 --> 26:08.040
And that's why you need to go to Infowarsstore.com

26:08.040 --> 26:10.040
So we can stay on air

26:10.040 --> 26:11.040
Wow

26:11.040 --> 26:12.040
Now do you see what's happening

26:12.040 --> 26:13.040
As everything we talked about went on

26:13.040 --> 26:16.040
Despite the fact you're trying to censor us and block us

26:16.040 --> 26:19.040
Infowars, I want to report to you our success

26:19.040 --> 26:21.040
So that you understand why you supported us

26:21.040 --> 26:23.040
As the core audience of the core radio stations

26:23.040 --> 26:27.040
That are like, you know, funding us to go out and be the missionaries

26:27.040 --> 26:29.040
To tell the truth against the globalists

26:29.040 --> 26:30.040
That's what you're doing here

26:30.040 --> 26:33.040
So there's something a little bit disgraceful about using this as a

26:33.040 --> 26:35.040
Like directly as a fundraising

26:35.040 --> 26:37.040
Yeah, it's a little bit like holding your audience hostage

26:37.040 --> 26:40.040
Yeah, it also will be difficult for Alex

26:40.040 --> 26:42.040
Were somebody to sue him for this

26:42.040 --> 26:45.040
It would be hard for him to argue that he's not using it

26:45.040 --> 26:46.040
In order to make money

26:46.040 --> 26:47.040
Yeah

26:47.040 --> 26:48.040
Because that's literally what he's doing here

26:48.040 --> 26:49.040
Yeah

26:49.040 --> 26:52.040
And as far as the criminal malicious intent towards the border

26:52.040 --> 26:56.040
Saying, I'm not going to tell the system how or when I'm going to get there

26:56.040 --> 27:00.040
Seems like admitting to a certain amount of suspicious activity at least

27:00.040 --> 27:01.040
I'm going to be sneaky

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
Yeah, exactly

27:02.040 --> 27:05.040
Now, if you want to escalate this even further

27:05.040 --> 27:07.040
Alex has a great idea for you

27:07.040 --> 27:10.040
And that is one of his old tricks

27:10.040 --> 27:12.040
I mean, I have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen

27:12.040 --> 27:13.040
That anybody

27:13.040 --> 27:15.040
Because I don't care about getting the scoop

27:15.040 --> 27:19.040
If Ben Shapiro wanted to go down to McCallum

27:19.040 --> 27:23.040
Or if Tucker Carlson wanted to go down to McCallum

27:23.040 --> 27:25.040
He probably will

27:25.040 --> 27:27.040
Or anywhere

27:27.040 --> 27:29.040
Ted Nugent says he wants to go with me down there

27:29.040 --> 27:35.040
I'm going to take him down there, he's a fellow Texan

27:35.040 --> 27:39.040
You'll sit there for 30 minutes and you'll see kids getting crammed in trunks, okay

27:39.040 --> 27:44.040
I mean, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit smugglers down there

27:44.040 --> 27:48.040
There is a sense that Alex is giving off that is like, you should go

27:48.040 --> 27:49.040
Yeah, of course

27:49.040 --> 27:50.040
Everybody should go

27:50.040 --> 27:52.040
We're all going, it's going to be a great big party

27:52.040 --> 27:59.040
Anybody who goes down there will immediately find proof of this illegal human trafficking ring

27:59.040 --> 28:01.040
And you need to, you know, hey, all these people

28:01.040 --> 28:04.040
If they went, if Ben Shapiro had the nerve to do it

28:04.040 --> 28:05.040
He could get the scoop

28:05.040 --> 28:07.040
I don't care about getting the scoop

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
Everyone should go, you should go

28:09.040 --> 28:11.040
That's a bad thing to do

28:11.040 --> 28:14.040
When you're escalating people's suspicion

28:14.040 --> 28:17.040
And belief that they're fighting the literal devil and all this

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
To such a heightened point

28:19.040 --> 28:21.040
And be like, oh hey, you all should go down there

28:21.040 --> 28:24.040
You'll find direct evidence of all this stuff

28:24.040 --> 28:26.040
I mean, you're asking for trouble

28:26.040 --> 28:28.040
Like he has every single time in the past

28:28.040 --> 28:31.040
I don't want to, like, here's the thing about

28:31.040 --> 28:35.040
You know, you don't want to get into slippery slope arguments with restricting speech, of course

28:35.040 --> 28:37.040
So what I think we should do

28:37.040 --> 28:44.040
Is write a very, very narrow law that puts out step by step what Alex did for Pizzagate

28:44.040 --> 28:46.040
And then is like, you just can't do that

28:46.040 --> 28:49.040
All of that stuff, you can't do it

28:49.040 --> 28:51.040
And then Alex wouldn't be able to do this shit

28:51.040 --> 28:54.040
And you know, the part about it that always gets a little bit muddy

28:54.040 --> 28:57.040
Is that like, yeah, not every time that you behave like this

28:57.040 --> 29:00.040
It causes a horrible outcome like a shooting

29:00.040 --> 29:01.040
Of course

29:01.040 --> 29:02.040
But

29:02.040 --> 29:05.040
We have proof that it can and does from time to time

29:05.040 --> 29:08.040
So stop doing the things that lead there

29:08.040 --> 29:10.040
Here's why it's not a free speech argument

29:10.040 --> 29:13.040
Are you going to or have been

29:13.040 --> 29:16.040
Inspiring people to go commit terrifying acts

29:16.040 --> 29:19.040
And have you really faced any consequences

29:19.040 --> 29:20.040
Yeah, exactly

29:20.040 --> 29:23.040
I would say you've been rewarded

29:23.040 --> 29:24.040
Yes, exactly

29:24.040 --> 29:28.040
Anyway, so Alex spends a lot of time on this episode

29:28.040 --> 29:31.040
Talking about Biden trying to take the guns

29:31.040 --> 29:36.040
Because Biden has some ideas about, you know, hey, it is a little bit terrifying

29:36.040 --> 29:41.040
The prospect of, you know, being able to get kits where you can make a gun

29:41.040 --> 29:44.040
And none of the parts have any kind of serial number

29:44.040 --> 29:45.040
Totally

29:45.040 --> 29:47.040
Completely untraceable guns

29:47.040 --> 29:51.040
It's certainly something that in the wrong hands could lead to a lot of trouble

29:51.040 --> 29:56.040
Also the ability to just, you know, buy guns on the internet

29:56.040 --> 29:59.040
I mean, they trace fucking cold medicine

29:59.040 --> 30:02.040
Yeah, and so he has, you know, he has some ideas

30:02.040 --> 30:04.040
I'm not the biggest expert in the world

30:04.040 --> 30:07.040
But when I was listening to the ideas it didn't sound like anything that was too terrifying

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
No, I think I will be fine

30:09.040 --> 30:15.040
But anyway, Alex thinks that Chidna is trying to use Biden to get the guns

30:15.040 --> 30:17.040
For a specific reason

30:17.040 --> 30:21.040
Really, the big news is the Chicons are trying to cause a civil war

30:21.040 --> 30:23.040
Knowing that this will trigger a civil war

30:23.040 --> 30:27.040
And a bloodbath for everybody, which I'm not looking forward to, which I do not want

30:27.040 --> 30:29.040
But nevertheless, is a fact

30:29.040 --> 30:31.040
So there you go, that's what's going on there

30:31.040 --> 30:34.040
Everybody else in the bay, oh, he wants to save children

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
This doesn't make any sense

30:35.040 --> 30:36.040
No

30:36.040 --> 30:39.040
Now the globalist plan is to start a civil war

30:39.040 --> 30:42.040
Like at the behest of China for some reason

30:42.040 --> 30:44.040
And that's gonna, I guess, kill a lot of people

30:44.040 --> 30:45.040
Yep

30:45.040 --> 30:47.040
I thought their plan was soft killing everyone with vaccines

30:47.040 --> 30:49.040
And then having an orderly extermination

30:49.040 --> 30:53.040
And if that didn't work, then their plan B was to release super bio-weapons just to kill everyone off

30:53.040 --> 30:54.040
Yeah, but that was last week

30:54.040 --> 30:58.040
How does a civil war or world war fit into that plan exactly?

30:58.040 --> 31:01.040
Like, how is gun regulation a part of the bio-weapon plan?

31:01.040 --> 31:07.040
Yeah, it would be a really dumb civil war to have if, like, while you're fighting it

31:07.040 --> 31:10.040
Half of your army is just gonna drop dead from the vaccine at any moment

31:10.040 --> 31:15.040
It seems like if the plan was these bio-weapons, the globalist shouldn't care if you have guns

31:15.040 --> 31:17.040
Like, you can't shoot a virus

31:17.040 --> 31:21.040
I kept this clip in to illustrate how none of Alex's narratives mean anything

31:21.040 --> 31:27.040
Everything is self-serving and meant to escalate whatever he's decided to make his audience afraid of that day

31:27.040 --> 31:30.040
In this case, Biden's giving this speech on gun reform ideas

31:30.040 --> 31:34.040
And thus, the thing to profit off making the listeners scared of is gun confiscation

31:34.040 --> 31:39.040
That narrative doesn't really match up with the whole thing Alex has been doing with vaccine fear-mongering

31:39.040 --> 31:42.040
So he can't really say that the gun regulation is part of the whole bio-weapon thing

31:42.040 --> 31:47.040
Thus, he pretends that, you know, this isn't the entire thing he's been ranting about forever

31:47.040 --> 31:49.040
And now it's time to be scared about war

31:49.040 --> 31:53.040
It's war that we need to be scared about, it's the summer of rage, Dan!

31:53.040 --> 31:59.040
Also, if all Alex's enemies were working for the literal devil, it seems like they wouldn't be all on such different pages

31:59.040 --> 32:05.040
Like, if the devil had this plan that they were supposed to be trying to carry out, why would China mess around with Taiwan

32:05.040 --> 32:08.040
When that could only really get in the way of following through on the larger plan?

32:08.040 --> 32:12.040
That seems really weird, and I would love Alex to explain that

32:12.040 --> 32:18.040
Well, what it is, so it's, what it is, it's a Japanese management strategy that the, that the devil is using here, alright?

32:18.040 --> 32:24.040
You have many different divisions, and you don't share all the information because they're all working for the same end goal

32:24.040 --> 32:30.040
But, they've got their own strategies, that's how you create new solutions to problems, Dan

32:30.040 --> 32:36.040
I feel like the devil, were this devil to be singularly focused on one objective

32:36.040 --> 32:37.040
Sure

32:37.040 --> 32:41.040
I don't know if there would be a need for teams to be working across purposes

32:41.040 --> 32:44.040
But you haven't been reading Japanese management models

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
You do make a fair point

32:45.040 --> 32:46.040
Yeah

32:46.040 --> 32:47.040
So anyway, Biden wants the guns

32:47.040 --> 32:48.040
Sure

32:48.040 --> 32:51.040
And Trump, you know, he said that he wanted red flag laws

32:51.040 --> 32:53.040
Right, right, right, but that didn't happen, so we're good

32:53.040 --> 32:55.040
But also that was, he was being sneaky and it was different

32:55.040 --> 32:58.040
Of course, completely different, completely different

32:58.040 --> 33:04.040
And of course, the red flag laws, you know, Trump was like, oh red flag means if you've been adjudicated mentally ill and you're schizophrenic

33:04.040 --> 33:07.040
And you were, you know, kicked out of the Air Force was the case they brought to him

33:07.040 --> 33:13.040
But he, they never put the Air Force records in that he was dishonorably discharged in an Air Force mental institution for two years

33:13.040 --> 33:19.040
Trump's like, yeah, that guy shouldn't have a gun. Oh, the conservatives, Trump wants to, no, no, no, okay, well Trump's gone

33:19.040 --> 33:22.040
Let's not, bad guy's gone, don't have him to kick anymore

33:22.040 --> 33:28.040
We got Biden saying, if anybody has a concern about you, your guns are gone, you don't get them back most of the time

33:28.040 --> 33:31.040
And you get the SWAT team raid that ensues

33:31.040 --> 33:34.040
So civil war, civil war, civil war

33:34.040 --> 33:40.040
Whoa, so this is how Alex wants to remember Trump's comments on red flag laws, but that's not what Trump said

33:40.040 --> 33:44.040
This was in 2019 after the mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso

33:44.040 --> 33:50.040
Trump said, quote, first we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs

33:50.040 --> 33:56.040
I'm directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies as well as social media companies

33:56.040 --> 34:00.040
To develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike

34:00.040 --> 34:03.040
That doesn't sound like adjudicating someone as mentally ill

34:03.040 --> 34:11.040
That seems like talking to social media, taking the posts from social media to identify people who may be unwell and then getting their guns taken away

34:11.040 --> 34:17.040
It's almost like Alex thinks reality is whatever fits his narrative at any given point in time, it's really weird

34:17.040 --> 34:23.040
Honestly, what Trump was talking about seems way more invasive and draconian than anything that Biden's proposing

34:23.040 --> 34:30.040
Trump went on, quote, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence

34:30.040 --> 34:36.040
And make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement

34:36.040 --> 34:39.040
Seems like Alex should be against that pretty strongly

34:39.040 --> 34:45.040
These people have not committed any crimes, but because some globalist doctor is saying that they might commit one, we should have laws that they get locked up

34:45.040 --> 34:50.040
This is pre-crime, Trump wants to bring in the guys in the tanks from the Tom Cruise movie

34:50.040 --> 34:55.040
Yeah, it's precogs, it's Mission what, not Mission Impossible, Minority Report

34:55.040 --> 34:57.040
Yeah, oh, this is Philip K. Dick shit

34:57.040 --> 34:59.040
They're coming for us

34:59.040 --> 35:05.040
Trump continued, quote, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms

35:05.040 --> 35:09.040
And if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process

35:09.040 --> 35:13.040
That is why I've called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders

35:13.040 --> 35:21.040
Today, I'm also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty

35:21.040 --> 35:27.040
And that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay

35:27.040 --> 35:34.040
As a libertarian type and someone who's insanely anti-government, Alex should be really afraid of a president calling for expedited death sentences

35:34.040 --> 35:39.040
Especially since Alex thinks that most people who commit mass shootings are secretly patsies

35:39.040 --> 35:44.040
Also, that was the speech where Trump said, quote, may God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo

35:44.040 --> 35:49.040
And may God protect them, because he misread a teleprompter, the shooting was in Dayton

35:49.040 --> 35:57.040
Yep. Anyway, the point of this is that Alex has created an ahistorical version of Trump's response to mass shootings and his public support for red flag laws

35:57.040 --> 36:04.040
Because what Trump advocated is directly counter to a lot of what should make sense as Alex's position, so that's kind of messy

36:04.040 --> 36:11.040
I think it's easier to hand wave it away and say the past is the past, let's move on and think about the future

36:11.040 --> 36:15.040
Trump isn't president anymore, we don't need to think about all the stuff he said

36:15.040 --> 36:19.040
We even sputtered through that in that clip

36:19.040 --> 36:22.040
We don't learn from history here, how dare any of you

36:22.040 --> 36:26.040
Let's not deal with what was said realistically, let's just have fun

36:26.040 --> 36:32.040
So, who do you think the world's most powerful doctor is?

36:32.040 --> 36:36.040
The world's most powerful doctor? Doom?

36:36.040 --> 36:38.040
Sure, he has his own country

36:38.040 --> 36:40.040
Exactly, he's pretty powerful

36:40.040 --> 36:41.040
What about Oz?

36:41.040 --> 36:44.040
Dr. Oz? No, I don't think he's very powerful

36:44.040 --> 36:45.040
Dr. Phil is rich as hell

36:45.040 --> 36:46.040
Dr. Phil is pretty powerful

36:46.040 --> 36:49.040
But you couldn't stand up to Dr. Doom, I think you really cheated the game there

36:49.040 --> 36:53.040
Dr. Doom is a little bit of a winner there

36:53.040 --> 36:56.040
He has lightning powers, right? What powers does Dr. Doom have?

36:56.040 --> 37:00.040
No, the super stretch man is a doctor too, he's more powerful than Dr. Doom

37:00.040 --> 37:01.040
Mr. Fantastic?

37:01.040 --> 37:04.040
Yeah, Mr. Fantastic, why do I call him super stretch man? I don't know

37:04.040 --> 37:14.040
Super stretch man

37:14.040 --> 37:15.040
See, this is why people think that I'm not amused by things you said

37:15.040 --> 37:17.040
I was just laughing really hard but silently

37:17.040 --> 37:19.040
Yes, yeah, yeah, naturally

37:19.040 --> 37:21.040
Sometimes it just doesn't play on the mic

37:21.040 --> 37:22.040
It doesn't happen

37:22.040 --> 37:24.040
Yeah, Invisible Woman was a doctor too, right?

37:24.040 --> 37:25.040
Yeah, I am

37:25.040 --> 37:26.040
All of them, all the Fantastic Four

37:26.040 --> 37:30.040
No, no, no, Invisible Woman, the flame guy, Jesus, I'm not doing well today

37:30.040 --> 37:31.040
Human Torch?

37:31.040 --> 37:32.040
Yes, I understand

37:32.040 --> 37:35.040
I'm not even a dork and I know these names

37:35.040 --> 37:40.040
Honestly, I was going to call her Mrs. Invisible, which I recognize is not okay

37:40.040 --> 37:43.040
Who else did she marry to him?

37:43.040 --> 37:45.040
I think so, I can't remember exactly

37:45.040 --> 37:49.040
And then The Thing wasn't a doctor, he was just an astronaut or something

37:49.040 --> 37:51.040
Yeah, he was a military guy

37:51.040 --> 37:52.040
What are we doing?

37:52.040 --> 37:55.040
I think The Thing and Human Torch were like

37:55.040 --> 37:58.040
This is why Discord is beyond us, we're not even, yeah

37:58.040 --> 38:03.040
I think they were cool military guys and then Invisible Woman and Reed Richards were doctors

38:03.040 --> 38:04.040
Yes

38:04.040 --> 38:05.040
I think

38:05.040 --> 38:06.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

38:06.040 --> 38:07.040
Still Dr. Doom more powerful

38:07.040 --> 38:10.040
He does have his own country and they never really put him away, you know

38:10.040 --> 38:11.040
Anyway

38:11.040 --> 38:14.040
My point is that if you Google it you'll get a different answer

38:14.040 --> 38:15.040
Okay

38:15.040 --> 38:16.040
Well, who runs the UN?

38:16.040 --> 38:19.040
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun

38:19.040 --> 38:22.040
I tried this this morning and it works, we'll see if they've changed it

38:22.040 --> 38:24.040
Guys, please go to Google for TV viewers

38:24.040 --> 38:26.040
Any radio listener can do this

38:26.040 --> 38:30.040
Type in who is the most powerful doctor in the world

38:30.040 --> 38:33.040
And before you even say powerful, who is the most powerful?

38:33.040 --> 38:34.040
It says Bill Gates

38:34.040 --> 38:37.040
And they say he is the most powerful doctor

38:37.040 --> 38:41.040
He is in charge and he will do what he will to you

38:41.040 --> 38:43.040
So this is actually true

38:43.040 --> 38:47.040
If you Google the words who is the world's most powerful doctor

38:47.040 --> 38:49.040
The results do say Bill Gates

38:49.040 --> 38:54.040
This is because the search terms identically reflect the title of a 2017 Politico article titled

38:54.040 --> 38:57.040
quote, meet the world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates

38:57.040 --> 38:58.040
Okay

38:58.040 --> 39:03.040
The article itself is highly critical of Gates' outsized influence on the World Health Organization

39:03.040 --> 39:05.040
Given his status as a major donor

39:05.040 --> 39:08.040
But it's not critical in the same way that Alex might be

39:08.040 --> 39:10.040
For instance, the article points out that quote

39:10.040 --> 39:13.040
Rather than focusing on strengthening healthcare in poor countries

39:13.040 --> 39:17.040
That would help, in their view, to contain future outbreaks like the Ebola epidemic

39:17.040 --> 39:22.040
The agency spends a disproportionate amount of its resources on projects with a measurable outcome

39:22.040 --> 39:26.040
That Gates prefers, such as the effort to eradicate polio

39:26.040 --> 39:29.040
Anyway, the fact that this Google search result comes up

39:29.040 --> 39:32.040
You know, it went slightly viral recently

39:32.040 --> 39:34.040
As it has in the past a couple times

39:34.040 --> 39:36.040
Alex probably just saw it on social media

39:36.040 --> 39:39.040
Now he's complaining about it on his show, which is really sad

39:39.040 --> 39:40.040
Yeah

39:40.040 --> 39:41.040
He hasn't even read the Politico article

39:41.040 --> 39:43.040
Because if he has, he would recognize that it actually

39:43.040 --> 39:44.040
He'd be like, oh, that's why it's

39:44.040 --> 39:48.040
But it actually would be like, oh, this is kind of critical of Gates

39:48.040 --> 39:49.040
Yeah

39:49.040 --> 39:51.040
That kind of doesn't work for him

39:51.040 --> 39:52.040
Yeah

39:52.040 --> 39:58.040
It really seems far too obvious to say that a billionaire shouldn't have anything to do with

39:58.040 --> 40:02.040
Just about any decisions regarding, well, anything

40:02.040 --> 40:05.040
But especially health in the modern world

40:05.040 --> 40:07.040
Yeah, I think it's a complicated question

40:07.040 --> 40:11.040
And I think that, you know, based on the fact that there are Politico articles like this

40:11.040 --> 40:15.040
There are people who are in the appropriate places asking those sorts of questions

40:15.040 --> 40:16.040
And wrestling with it

40:16.040 --> 40:21.040
Anyway, because Alex has found this Google search result that he thinks is real cool

40:21.040 --> 40:22.040
Yeah

40:22.040 --> 40:23.040
He lets himself off the chain a little bit

40:23.040 --> 40:24.040
Okay

40:24.040 --> 40:25.040
There it is

40:25.040 --> 40:28.040
Who's the most powerful doctor in the world, ladies and gentlemen?

40:28.040 --> 40:30.040
Bill!

40:30.040 --> 40:33.040
I'm gonna kill your ass, Bill Gates

40:35.040 --> 40:36.040
Woo!

40:36.040 --> 40:39.040
Meet the world's most powerful doctor

40:39.040 --> 40:42.040
And for four pages it says the same thing

40:42.040 --> 40:46.040
Because he paid in the search results to tell you

40:46.040 --> 40:51.040
I am the big swinging Johnson

40:51.040 --> 40:54.040
I'm gonna put it in ya

40:54.040 --> 40:56.040
Whoa, family show, man, family show

40:56.040 --> 40:58.040
I'm gonna put it in ya

40:58.040 --> 40:59.040
The big swinging Johnson

40:59.040 --> 41:03.040
It's not something that I want repeated anywhere

41:03.040 --> 41:05.040
Nah, it's not fun

41:05.040 --> 41:06.040
So, uh

41:06.040 --> 41:12.040
Also, isn't the title is ironic, or sarcastic at least

41:12.040 --> 41:14.040
Meet the world's most powerful doctor, Bill Gates

41:14.040 --> 41:15.040
Yes

41:15.040 --> 41:17.040
He's not a doctor, that's the point of the title

41:17.040 --> 41:18.040
Yes

41:18.040 --> 41:19.040
Is that this is not how it's supposed to be

41:19.040 --> 41:20.040
There's an irony, yes

41:20.040 --> 41:21.040
Yeah, exactly

41:21.040 --> 41:22.040
Yeah, yeah

41:22.040 --> 41:25.040
So he's taking a sarcastic headline literally

41:25.040 --> 41:26.040
Yep

41:26.040 --> 41:27.040
Yeah, gotcha

41:27.040 --> 41:28.040
Just wanted to be sure about that

41:28.040 --> 41:29.040
Yep

41:29.040 --> 41:30.040
He's good at this, man

41:30.040 --> 41:33.040
He's great at, reading comprehension is his jam

41:33.040 --> 41:36.040
So now, someone else is good at things

41:36.040 --> 41:37.040
Like guitar

41:37.040 --> 41:38.040
Sure

41:38.040 --> 41:39.040
And being a real creep

41:39.040 --> 41:43.040
I don't know if he's good at those things

41:43.040 --> 41:47.040
Look, I'm not a music scholar, I don't know anything about this

41:47.040 --> 41:49.040
But Ted Nugent is on the show

41:49.040 --> 41:50.040
Of course

41:50.040 --> 41:56.040
I gotta say, Uncle Ted sounds like a bit more of a lunatic than usual

41:56.040 --> 41:57.040
Okay

41:57.040 --> 42:01.040
This is an incredible time to be alive, but I'm glad Ted Nugent is there

42:01.040 --> 42:02.040
Imagine saying that

42:02.040 --> 42:03.040
Imagine saying that seriously

42:03.040 --> 42:05.040
Thank you for joining us, sir

42:05.040 --> 42:08.040
My pleasure, Alex, I'm celebrating life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness

42:08.040 --> 42:10.040
I got my priorities

42:10.040 --> 42:13.040
I think we should quote the greatest philosopher of all times

42:13.040 --> 42:15.040
I think we agree, that was Dirty Harry

42:15.040 --> 42:18.040
When he said, a good man knows his limitations

42:18.040 --> 42:23.040
So as I fight against the curse of self-inflicted apathy and Marxism running amok

42:23.040 --> 42:25.040
And whatever creature that is

42:25.040 --> 42:29.040
That pretends to be the commander in chief and all his crazy supporters

42:29.040 --> 42:33.040
The Nugent family is living the American dream

42:33.040 --> 42:35.040
He always sounds like he's on coke

42:35.040 --> 42:38.040
But he claims he's 70 years sober

42:38.040 --> 42:41.040
Yeah, my immediate thought was

42:41.040 --> 42:43.040
He got about halfway through his sentence

42:43.040 --> 42:46.040
And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

42:46.040 --> 42:48.040
You just slow it down, buddy

42:48.040 --> 42:49.040
Slow down

42:49.040 --> 42:52.040
You're already going a little too fast to be taken seriously

42:52.040 --> 42:53.040
Yeah

42:53.040 --> 42:56.040
So Ted Nugent seems, I mean like the Motor City madman

42:56.040 --> 42:57.040
Might be a little bit more literal

42:57.040 --> 42:58.040
Sure

42:58.040 --> 42:59.040
He sounds nuts

42:59.040 --> 43:02.040
I mean, he doesn't live in the Motor City anymore, so

43:02.040 --> 43:03.040
Well, he does, part time

43:03.040 --> 43:04.040
Oh, fair enough

43:04.040 --> 43:06.040
Well, somewhere in Michigan it is

43:06.040 --> 43:10.040
He's making this metaphor

43:10.040 --> 43:12.040
It's pained

43:12.040 --> 43:16.040
I think in this metaphor, Old Yeller is the government

43:16.040 --> 43:17.040
Okay

43:17.040 --> 43:18.040
Or something

43:18.040 --> 43:22.040
So you're setting this up as we're going to take a long trip to get to the end of this metaphor

43:22.040 --> 43:23.040
You bet

43:23.040 --> 43:24.040
Okay

43:24.040 --> 43:26.040
Same group suing, NRA are suing me

43:26.040 --> 43:30.040
I mean, this is a war and lesser do you know it's a war

43:30.040 --> 43:33.040
Well, you know, not just spotlighting the cockroaches

43:33.040 --> 43:37.040
I think the most important lesson has been hidden from generations

43:37.040 --> 43:40.040
And that's the lesson of Old Yeller

43:40.040 --> 43:41.040
We love dogs

43:41.040 --> 43:44.040
When Old Yeller protects us from the snake and the cougar

43:44.040 --> 43:47.040
When Old Yeller brings us the newspaper and our slippers

43:47.040 --> 43:50.040
We give Old Yeller a kiss and a hug and a biscuit

43:50.040 --> 43:53.040
When Old Yeller, the same dog we love dearly

43:53.040 --> 43:56.040
Begins foaming at the mouth

43:56.040 --> 43:58.040
We know what we have to do to Old Yeller

43:58.040 --> 44:03.040
But we don't embrace difficult and discomforting decisions in life

44:03.040 --> 44:08.040
I use the reference of the Germans who pretended they weren't complicit

44:08.040 --> 44:12.040
By their cult of denial of what happened during the genocide

44:12.040 --> 44:15.040
There are Americans today that are hiding from the indicators

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
Hiding from the evidence

44:17.040 --> 44:18.040
So here's the answer

44:18.040 --> 44:19.040
Number one, Alex

44:19.040 --> 44:22.040
Everybody who believes in freedom right now more than ever

44:22.040 --> 44:25.040
You have to be a member of the National Rifle Association

44:25.040 --> 44:26.040
Gun Owners of America

44:26.040 --> 44:28.040
The Texas State Rifle Association

44:28.040 --> 44:31.040
All your state second amendment organizations

44:31.040 --> 44:33.040
You have to communicate with your mayor

44:33.040 --> 44:35.040
Your senator, your congressman, your governor

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
On a weekly basis

44:37.040 --> 44:38.040
I'm just a guitar player

44:38.040 --> 44:39.040
Slow down

44:39.040 --> 44:41.040
Yeah, you are just a guitar player, sir

44:41.040 --> 44:43.040
Wait, this is about guns?

44:43.040 --> 44:44.040
I guess

44:44.040 --> 44:48.040
I think he's saying we need to overthrow the United States government, right?

44:48.040 --> 44:49.040
We need to put it down like Old Yeller

44:49.040 --> 44:50.040
Yeah, that's kind of his point

44:50.040 --> 44:51.040
Because they want gun regulation now

44:51.040 --> 44:53.040
Was that the lesson of Old Yeller?

44:53.040 --> 44:56.040
Now, when the government just lets you have all the guns you want

44:56.040 --> 44:58.040
You give it a pat on the head and give it a biscuit

44:58.040 --> 45:01.040
I would like to know Ted Nugent's interpretation of Romeo and Juliet

45:01.040 --> 45:03.040
I would like his explanation of that

45:03.040 --> 45:04.040
He's too people mean

45:04.040 --> 45:05.040
Great piece of literature

45:05.040 --> 45:07.040
Too people mean to fall in love, parents are mean

45:07.040 --> 45:09.040
Kill themselves, it's all good

45:09.040 --> 45:10.040
Kill themselves, it's all good

45:10.040 --> 45:12.040
Yeah, that was weird

45:12.040 --> 45:13.040
That was weird

45:13.040 --> 45:15.040
I guess he's saying that we're not happy about it

45:15.040 --> 45:16.040
But we gotta kill the government

45:16.040 --> 45:19.040
Yeah, I guess we just have to kill the government

45:19.040 --> 45:20.040
Huh

45:20.040 --> 45:21.040
Strange metaphor

45:21.040 --> 45:22.040
Interesting

45:22.040 --> 45:28.040
So, Alex has gone and done this possibly defamatory video about this Catholic charity

45:28.040 --> 45:32.040
And if I were Ted Nugent, I might not want to sign off on that video

45:32.040 --> 45:33.040
Just in case

45:33.040 --> 45:34.040
I don't want to get ensnared

45:34.040 --> 45:39.040
I don't want to actually be on public record being like

45:39.040 --> 45:41.040
Hey, that was an awesome thing you did

45:41.040 --> 45:42.040
That was super cool

45:42.040 --> 45:43.040
And I'm glad I helped playing it with you

45:43.040 --> 45:46.040
We have to fight back on the activist level peacefully

45:46.040 --> 45:48.040
But communicate on a regular basis

45:48.040 --> 45:52.040
And yes, Alex, Shamane and I with our Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild show

45:52.040 --> 45:53.040
And our Spirit Campfire

45:53.040 --> 45:57.040
And all the different incredible communication that my wife Shamane accomplishes

45:57.040 --> 46:00.040
We're coming down to the border because everybody has to know

46:00.040 --> 46:03.040
That these children are being trafficked

46:03.040 --> 46:08.040
And when you catch a guy doing it, he plays dumb

46:08.040 --> 46:11.040
Well, that's not dumb, that's demonic

46:11.040 --> 46:14.040
We have to spotlight these devil cockroaches

46:14.040 --> 46:16.040
These devil cockroaches

46:16.040 --> 46:18.040
This is not good

46:18.040 --> 46:20.040
This is very not good

46:20.040 --> 46:21.040
That's not good

46:21.040 --> 46:25.040
Yeah, Ted Nugent is clearly talking about Alex's video

46:25.040 --> 46:26.040
Yeah, absolutely

46:26.040 --> 46:28.040
There are a couple of huge problems I have with it

46:28.040 --> 46:33.040
Number one, obviously, is Ted Nugent is not allowed to say traffic head

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
Traffic head, he says it twice

46:35.040 --> 46:37.040
No, unacceptable behavior

46:37.040 --> 46:39.040
Unacceptable behavior

46:39.040 --> 46:40.040
It's very weird

46:40.040 --> 46:43.040
And I want to know the spelling of demonic

46:43.040 --> 46:48.040
Because immediately following dumb, it should be D-U-M-B-O-N-I-C, right?

46:48.040 --> 46:50.040
Dumbonic

46:50.040 --> 46:52.040
Yeah, I mean, if it's on paper, probably

46:52.040 --> 46:53.040
Yeah, it has to be

46:53.040 --> 46:58.040
So, jumping from there, I mean, he sort of is endorsing Alex's video

46:58.040 --> 47:01.040
And we have to flush out these folks, these demons

47:01.040 --> 47:02.040
Obviously

47:02.040 --> 47:05.040
Now he's sort of saying that they need to kill people

47:05.040 --> 47:07.040
Who are like the people in Alex's video

47:07.040 --> 47:09.040
You know, we've been to Africa many times

47:09.040 --> 47:13.040
And Shamane has done a lot of interviews with some real heroes of law enforcement and the military

47:13.040 --> 47:20.040
Who have dedicated their lives to saving these women and children that are enslaved and trafficked

47:20.040 --> 47:23.040
And it's happening on a daily basis

47:23.040 --> 47:25.040
And thank God, a big salute to you

47:25.040 --> 47:27.040
Not just from the Nugent family, Alex

47:27.040 --> 47:30.040
But a lot of people are watching you spotlight these devils

47:30.040 --> 47:32.040
And we thank you for that

47:32.040 --> 47:34.040
But more and more people have to do it

47:34.040 --> 47:36.040
And then they have to act upon it

47:36.040 --> 47:39.040
You can't identify a foaming-at-the-mouth dog

47:39.040 --> 47:41.040
And then go back to your gardening

47:41.040 --> 47:44.040
You have to deal with the rabid dog

47:44.040 --> 47:46.040
You have to eliminate the rabid dog

47:46.040 --> 47:50.040
And if you're not able to do it, call your wildlife control office

47:50.040 --> 47:51.040
But call somebody

47:51.040 --> 47:53.040
That metaphor fell apart

47:53.040 --> 47:57.040
I think that what we're listening to is

47:57.040 --> 48:01.040
Ted Nugent taking these sort of ideas that Alex has had about

48:01.040 --> 48:04.040
Everybody's got to go down to the border and, you know, find all this

48:04.040 --> 48:07.040
And he's going one step further and saying you have to take action

48:07.040 --> 48:10.040
Against the people who are trafficking

48:10.040 --> 48:14.040
And boy, you know, that could get really out of hand

48:14.040 --> 48:18.040
If your standard of who's trafficking people is as low as Alex is

48:18.040 --> 48:22.040
This is directly inciting

48:22.040 --> 48:25.040
See, this is why we have my new Pizzagate law

48:25.040 --> 48:28.040
If you do a Pizzagate, it's against the law

48:28.040 --> 48:31.040
He was just talking about literal dogs, though

48:31.040 --> 48:33.040
He was saying that if a dog has

48:33.040 --> 48:37.040
What if you just have, like, some stuff on your glasses

48:37.040 --> 48:39.040
And then you just murder a dog

48:39.040 --> 48:41.040
Maybe you should think a little bit more

48:41.040 --> 48:44.040
I can't stress enough how, like, I saw that video

48:44.040 --> 48:46.040
When it was making the rounds

48:46.040 --> 48:47.040
I'm like, this sucks

48:47.040 --> 48:49.040
But, you know, this is Alex doing what he does

48:49.040 --> 48:51.040
I hope he gets sued for it

48:51.040 --> 48:53.040
Then I listen to his show and I'm like

48:53.040 --> 48:57.040
It sounds like he's kind of encouraging people to go and do what he's doing

48:57.040 --> 48:59.040
And I think that's probably bad

48:59.040 --> 49:02.040
That seems like the kind of behavior he's done in the past

49:02.040 --> 49:06.040
Nothing could have prepared me for Ted Nugent coming on

49:06.040 --> 49:10.040
And making this pained metaphor that is so much worse

49:10.040 --> 49:13.040
That seems to imply that what people need to do

49:13.040 --> 49:16.040
Is come down there and kill people who are trying to help

49:16.040 --> 49:18.040
Asylum seekers and refugees

49:18.040 --> 49:19.040
Yeah

49:19.040 --> 49:20.040
It's so fucked up

49:20.040 --> 49:24.040
Yeah, I don't know if there's anything that could prepare you for

49:24.040 --> 49:27.040
A sudden appearance of Ted Nugent telling you to murder

49:27.040 --> 49:29.040
In a bad metaphor

49:29.040 --> 49:32.040
Yeah, that's something that I

49:32.040 --> 49:35.040
That's Kool-Aid Man levels of surprise

49:35.040 --> 49:36.040
Oh no

49:36.040 --> 49:37.040
Yeah

49:37.040 --> 49:39.040
Now, much like the Kool-Aid Man, he barges through walls

49:39.040 --> 49:40.040
You know that

49:40.040 --> 49:42.040
We're about to get someone else barging through walls

49:42.040 --> 49:44.040
And that is Ted Nugent's son

49:44.040 --> 49:46.040
Sure, sure

49:46.040 --> 49:48.040
I want to hear what Ted Nugent's son has to say

49:48.040 --> 49:49.040
You actually do

49:49.040 --> 49:50.040
Okay

49:50.040 --> 49:52.040
Ted Nugent's son is there with him

49:52.040 --> 49:54.040
And Alex wants to talk to him a little bit

49:54.040 --> 49:55.040
Sure

49:55.040 --> 49:57.040
And, oooh, Nelly

49:57.040 --> 49:58.040
Here we go

49:58.040 --> 50:01.040
And Rocco, I know you're an articulate person in your own right

50:01.040 --> 50:02.040
The great son of Ted Nugent

50:02.040 --> 50:04.040
Well, what is your view on all this?

50:05.040 --> 50:09.040
Man, I'm a little bit more oriented to the metaphysical aspects of it

50:09.040 --> 50:12.040
I feel like I got this guy on the front lines of the

50:12.040 --> 50:14.040
The terrestrial aspect

50:14.040 --> 50:17.040
And me and some of my friends have been tuned into what you've been doing

50:17.040 --> 50:19.040
And others, like David Icke

50:19.040 --> 50:22.040
And I got more interested in like, you know

50:22.040 --> 50:24.040
Who's really behind the cabal

50:24.040 --> 50:30.040
Extraterrestrial beings that are hijacking energy fields of the planet

50:30.040 --> 50:32.040
That are installing slaughterhouses

50:32.040 --> 50:34.040
That are, you know, the motives

50:34.040 --> 50:35.040
By the way, I totally agree

50:35.040 --> 50:37.040
When you hit the bottom of the rabbit hole, whatever it is

50:37.040 --> 50:39.040
It's anti-human, it's anti-success

50:39.040 --> 50:40.040
Yeah

50:40.040 --> 50:46.040
Yeah, so Rocco, Ted Nugent's son, is into the spiritual side of this

50:46.040 --> 50:47.040
Another new law

50:47.040 --> 50:49.040
It should be against the law to grow up rich

50:49.040 --> 50:51.040
That's what I heard right there

50:51.040 --> 50:52.040
No!

50:52.040 --> 50:54.040
So I wanted to understand this a little bit more

50:54.040 --> 50:57.040
I had no idea, I'd never heard Ted Nugent's son

50:57.040 --> 50:59.040
And I was like, oh this is interesting

50:59.040 --> 51:01.040
No, it was about, there was a cartoon

51:01.040 --> 51:03.040
It was Modern Life, something?

51:03.040 --> 51:04.040
Oh yeah, it's fun

51:04.040 --> 51:05.040
Thank you

51:05.040 --> 51:09.040
So, this guy's modern life

51:09.040 --> 51:12.040
Apparently consists of putting out YouTube videos

51:12.040 --> 51:15.040
Where he's driving, you know, you got the camera on you while you're driving

51:15.040 --> 51:16.040
Oh no, he's doing those?

51:16.040 --> 51:17.040
Mic down for this

51:17.040 --> 51:18.040
Oh boy

51:18.040 --> 51:25.040
This was terrifying

51:25.040 --> 51:29.040
Hello Earth

51:29.040 --> 51:35.040
And anyone else who may be tuning in

51:35.040 --> 51:41.040
The download to be shared today in this moment

51:41.040 --> 51:46.040
While the highway is being driven on

51:46.040 --> 51:51.040
Is a message that just came through

51:51.040 --> 51:55.040
The reference point many know as Archangel Michael

51:55.040 --> 52:01.040
And my relationship with Archangel Michael has been one of

52:01.040 --> 52:05.040
He's almost been like the older brother that you didn't really know

52:05.040 --> 52:09.040
Because you were really young when he was at home

52:09.040 --> 52:14.040
And then he left for the military or something

52:14.040 --> 52:16.040
And then you like grew up

52:16.040 --> 52:21.040
And then he came back and he's all like stern and transformed

52:21.040 --> 52:23.040
And then he leaves and never comes again

52:23.040 --> 52:26.040
And so he's like this image in your mind of like discipline

52:26.040 --> 52:31.040
And yeah, like the little brother, like the big brother

52:31.040 --> 52:37.040
He's the bigger brother that holds you accountable to your highest potential

52:37.040 --> 52:42.040
And he has this sword, at least in my interfacing with him

52:42.040 --> 52:45.040
He has a sword that he carries around with him

52:45.040 --> 52:47.040
And it's like a sword of light

52:47.040 --> 52:55.040
And it seems to also be a sword of the divine masculine personified in a device

52:55.040 --> 52:57.040
In a moment as a sword

52:57.040 --> 53:00.040
So it's a dick? Is he saying the sword's a dick?

53:00.040 --> 53:06.040
Yeah, I believe he's saying that the Archangel Michael has a lightsaber shaped like a penis

53:06.040 --> 53:08.040
Is essentially what I'm hearing

53:08.040 --> 53:13.040
Yeah, so Ted Nugent's son puts out videos where he rambles about how he talks to angels

53:13.040 --> 53:16.040
Yeah, somebody should take away his license

53:16.040 --> 53:17.040
Cool

53:17.040 --> 53:21.040
Now, I was watching a few of these and there's just a bit of

53:21.040 --> 53:22.040
Of course you are

53:22.040 --> 53:28.040
There's just a bit of like, you know, sort of that spirituality that is kind of untethered

53:28.040 --> 53:32.040
And a little bit Project Camelot-y in many ways

53:32.040 --> 53:36.040
Well, he's talking about the Archangel Michael as that older brother who went away

53:36.040 --> 53:40.040
In the military and then came back to you and also has a giant lightsaber sword that looks like a dick

53:40.040 --> 53:41.040
And he gave him a download

53:41.040 --> 53:45.040
And the download, spoiler alert, is the greatest FOMO

53:45.040 --> 53:46.040
You know, the fear of missing out?

53:46.040 --> 53:47.040
No

53:47.040 --> 53:48.040
No

53:48.040 --> 53:49.040
No

53:49.040 --> 53:50.040
You do not

53:50.040 --> 53:51.040
No, you do not continue, sir

53:51.040 --> 53:52.040
Sir?

53:52.040 --> 53:53.040
Sir?

53:54.040 --> 54:01.040
The greatest FOMO is missing out on what you could have been if you didn't get your shit together earlier

54:01.040 --> 54:07.040
I really, really, really need to throw a thing

54:07.040 --> 54:08.040
Yeah

54:08.040 --> 54:12.040
Archangel Michael coming down with his sword to blow mines

54:12.040 --> 54:17.040
So now, I was thinking like, okay, I could play some more things from these videos that are just kind of silly

54:17.040 --> 54:23.040
But honestly, like, I don't know, that just kind of, that kind of content is the kind of stuff that I'm like, I gotta go

54:23.040 --> 54:24.040
Yeah

54:24.040 --> 54:25.040
I gotta get away from this

54:25.040 --> 54:26.040
Yeah

54:26.040 --> 54:28.040
And I figured there's something better I could tell you

54:28.040 --> 54:29.040
And that is

54:29.040 --> 54:30.040
Sure

54:30.040 --> 54:32.040
The Ted Nugent's son is also a rapper

54:32.040 --> 54:34.040
Oh no!

54:36.040 --> 54:38.040
Oh god

54:38.040 --> 54:40.040
Don't do this to me

54:40.040 --> 54:41.040
No

54:41.040 --> 54:42.040
No!

54:42.040 --> 54:43.040
No!

54:43.040 --> 54:44.040
No

54:44.040 --> 54:45.040
No

54:45.040 --> 54:50.040
Mmm

54:50.040 --> 54:58.040
Had to tell you no Had to tell you no Had to tell you no Had to say no

54:58.040 --> 55:07.040
I had to walk away I had to talk to me I had lost my faith I had lost myself I had lost my health

55:07.040 --> 55:10.040
Tearin' in the windows Pay a chance to get help

55:10.040 --> 55:12.040
Yeah, it's basically that

55:12.040 --> 55:21.040
I, um, yeah, I found that it was a little bit, I mean, it makes a compelling argument for there being, such a thing as too much autotune

55:21.040 --> 55:29.040
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's definitely the case, man, how much would it suck to not even suck as much as Chet Hanks?

55:29.040 --> 55:32.040
You know, or just suck more than Chet Hanks, like, that's bad

55:32.040 --> 55:36.040
I feel really bad because I don't want to, like, mock someone's creative outlet

55:36.040 --> 55:37.040
Sure

55:37.040 --> 55:39.040
I think that's bad, but also

55:39.040 --> 55:43.040
I want to mock rich kids' creative output, I'm fine with that

55:43.040 --> 55:44.040
Yeah

55:44.040 --> 55:45.040
Yeah

55:45.040 --> 55:48.040
I mean, I think that this is not quality music

55:48.040 --> 55:49.040
Yeah

55:49.040 --> 55:51.040
I think it's funny that it's Ted Nugent's son

55:54.040 --> 55:56.040
Trying to make this nonsense music

55:56.040 --> 55:58.040
You're not even the best, worst son

55:58.040 --> 56:00.040
That's the worst part about it

56:00.040 --> 56:01.040
Oh, man

56:01.040 --> 56:02.040
Jesus

56:02.040 --> 56:05.040
Anyway, this has been Get to Know Rocco in his modern life

56:05.040 --> 56:06.040
Yes, yep

56:06.040 --> 56:08.040
And now we move on

56:08.040 --> 56:09.040
Now we would like to un-know

56:09.040 --> 56:10.040
Yeah

56:10.040 --> 56:13.040
So they leave, the Nugent family leaves

56:13.040 --> 56:17.040
Oh, also just remember that Ted Nugent's wife is a really huge QAnon supporter

56:17.040 --> 56:18.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

56:18.040 --> 56:19.040
We went into an argument about it with Alex

56:19.040 --> 56:20.040
Of course, of course

56:20.040 --> 56:21.040
A couple months back

56:21.040 --> 56:22.040
Naturally

56:22.040 --> 56:23.040
Good family

56:23.040 --> 56:24.040
Yeah

56:24.040 --> 56:30.040
So they leave, and Alex lights a literal candle, but maybe it's also a metaphor

56:30.040 --> 56:35.040
I'm being honest with listeners, I know the metaphysical's real, I know God's real

56:35.040 --> 56:39.040
I know the spirit's like a fire, and you can't just keep that fire under yourself

56:39.040 --> 56:41.040
You gotta share it with other people, like this candle

56:41.040 --> 56:47.040
I'm lighting here in studio with Ted Nugent right now on TV and radio with his simulcasting

56:47.040 --> 56:53.040
They want to put America's flame out, they want to put our republic's flame out

56:53.040 --> 56:55.040
But they can't do it if we continue to share it

56:55.040 --> 57:00.040
But if they're able to demoralize us and make us be cowards and make us be fearful

57:00.040 --> 57:03.040
They can put that flame out, but you're aware of them trying it

57:03.040 --> 57:06.040
They don't have the power to do that anymore

57:06.040 --> 57:09.040
Alex is becoming more and more of a prop comic

57:09.040 --> 57:10.040
Yeah

57:10.040 --> 57:15.040
Yeah, so he's doing like one of those Christmas candles where you only burn it for the, you know

57:15.040 --> 57:21.040
It's like red, green, red, green, red, green, and every day before Christmas you burn the red one off

57:21.040 --> 57:24.040
And then you turn it out, and then you burn the green one off

57:24.040 --> 57:26.040
But it's for the end of the republic?

57:26.040 --> 57:27.040
Something like that

57:27.040 --> 57:28.040
Okay

57:28.040 --> 57:33.040
Yeah, just like, you know, when he had that skull and the goblet or whatever

57:33.040 --> 57:35.040
A lot of people will think, what does this mean?

57:35.040 --> 57:38.040
And I'm asking you, what does this mean?

57:38.040 --> 57:42.040
I am gonna light this candle because I want to talk about the metaphor of a candle

57:42.040 --> 57:44.040
But I also want you to be able to see it

57:44.040 --> 57:50.040
I just, because there's a moment before this where he screamed at some 18 year old

57:50.040 --> 57:52.040
Get me a candle

57:52.040 --> 57:54.040
That's the problem here

57:54.040 --> 57:57.040
I would say there's a pretty good chance

57:57.040 --> 58:00.040
So Alex has not really covered a lot of news

58:00.040 --> 58:03.040
But he has a lot of articles in a stack, but who cares

58:03.040 --> 58:04.040
Well, they're tweets

58:04.040 --> 58:12.040
I could spend an hour on each one of these articles and discover every little piece of it

58:12.040 --> 58:15.040
And talk about how it works and talk about how it's a deployment

58:15.040 --> 58:23.040
But at the end of the day, you get caught up in making it your god by giving it all your attention

58:23.040 --> 58:28.040
Just know this, whatever comes out of these people's mouths is meant to kill your ass

58:28.040 --> 58:29.040
Oh, okay

58:29.040 --> 58:30.040
Wow

58:30.040 --> 58:32.040
Okay, we can just make that decision

58:32.040 --> 58:38.040
What you need to know is that I need you emotionally aroused at all times

58:38.040 --> 58:41.040
But if you learn anything, that will stop

58:41.040 --> 58:46.040
I don't think that there's any better encapsulation of Alex Jones' sort of style than that

58:46.040 --> 58:52.040
That I could spend an hour on this and all the information, all the minutia

58:52.040 --> 58:54.040
Get really into the weeds on this

58:54.040 --> 58:56.040
Yeah, well he's a policy wonk as we know

58:56.040 --> 59:01.040
We could really get into this, but just know that whatever they're saying, they're trying to kill you

59:01.040 --> 59:06.040
So really, there's no point for me to have any of this in front of me

59:06.040 --> 59:10.040
So instead of getting into the nitty gritty, being a policy wonk

59:10.040 --> 59:11.040
Which he could do

59:11.040 --> 59:12.040
Oh, no, of course

59:12.040 --> 59:14.040
You just assume that they're just trying to kill you

59:14.040 --> 59:21.040
Instead of getting into the weeds and really figuring this out, he decides to spend his time doing the big work

59:21.040 --> 59:24.040
And that, of course, means complaining about Saturday Night Live

59:24.040 --> 59:26.040
We never aired it, I don't know if they could find it

59:26.040 --> 59:29.040
But it's the Saturday Night Live

59:29.040 --> 59:39.040
And they're like, coming up on Saturday Night Live, black people won't take the vaccine

59:39.040 --> 59:43.040
So they have a black guy with a British accent, like he's smart, but other black people aren't

59:43.040 --> 59:44.040
They love British accents

59:44.040 --> 59:46.040
Don't pull up

59:46.040 --> 59:48.040
It's the black, a British guy

59:48.040 --> 59:49.040
You got an engine on fire

59:49.040 --> 59:56.040
Literally going, I'll give you black people barbecue and watermelon or whatever

59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.040
If you take the shot, and the black guy has a classic southern voice like that's dumb

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.040
You are no Sully Tullenberger

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:07.040
And it's literally them, caricatures, making fun of black people

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.040
With a black guy with a British accent, being racist to them

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.040
Because of their accent from where they are, saying they're fighting racism

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.040
And then it's on CNN

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.040
I mean, I can't, these people piss me off, man

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.040
And it's constant

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040
What?

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.040
Okay, so, one

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.040
Did you see that SNL sketch?

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040
I saw the first little bit of it

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.040
I got it

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.040
Yeah, yeah

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.040
You get it

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040
It's not hard to get

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.040
I think that there are some people who took umbrage with it

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.040
And I say huzzah, rightfully so

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040
That was probably a poorly conceived sketch

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.040
I think that people did not enjoy it

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.040
And you can find articles in all sorts of media expressing that sentiment

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.040
That it was maybe poorly constructed and conceived

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.040
That said, Alex's point about it is outrageous

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.040
I mean, I think he was trying to say that it was a racist sketch

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.040
But he did so by being more racist towards

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Yeah

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.040
Yeah

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.040
The person who's hosting

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.040
Daniel Kaluuya?

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040
Kaluuya, I believe, yeah

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040
He is British

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040
Yes

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.040
But he's not doing a British accent in that sketch

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.040
No, he's not

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.040
No

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.040
And specifically, he's not doing a British accent

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040
Yes

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040
Despite having one

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.040
And I think that what happened is that Alex just saw like an outrage compilation

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040
Right

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040
Of like some of his jokes from the monologue

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040
Right, right, right

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.040
Where he's speaking in his British accent

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.040
So he knows that the guy is British

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.040
And assumes

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.040
Well, he doesn't know that the guy is British

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.040
And he assumes that that carries over to the sketch as well

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040
Right, right, right

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.040
Or he doesn't understand how the structure of Saturday Night Live works

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.040
No, absolutely not

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.200
But yeah, so if you haven't seen the sketch, the idea was that there's this guy who is

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.040
a doctor and his family won't take the vaccine

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040
Right

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.040
And so he's having a game show to get them to take the vaccine

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040
Yeah

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.040
And he keeps offering money

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040
For the correct answer, which is yes

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040
Yes

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040
I will take the vaccine

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040
I will get the vaccine, yes

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.040
And so one of his family members played by Keenan

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.040
He asked what he would do with the money if he won

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.040
Sure

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.040
And he says, I'll roll up some joints, smoke some weed

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040
Sure, sure, sure

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.040
Get a big barbecue block party, go and get a new grill

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040
Yes

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040
Or whatever

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.680
And that, Alex has extrapolated out into being like trying to entice black people with barbecue

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680
and watermelon

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.680
Right, right, right

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.040
He has added an even more racist layers

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040
That's what I was saying

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040
Yes

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.040
He didn't need to add the more racist part

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.040
No

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.640
And SNL was, you know, like you get it because they were creating that caricature that they

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.740
love to do on Celebrity Jeopardy, but what actually happened is they relied on stereotypes

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.240
to make fun of, yeah

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:56.360
Um, so I think that Alex thinks that because this sketch is clunky and possibly somewhat

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360
offensive

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.360
Yeah

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.960
It gives him carte blanche to be even more racist

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.760
I give you the barbecue you take

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.760
No

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760
No

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.480
Can you imagine if I had a show

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.480
No

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:15.120
And I got up there and I went I give you black people some barbecue, in fact, chew that up

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
if you can

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.320
This is what I'm talking about, it is the, everything they say we are is them

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.840
What about Fentanyl the dragon?

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.960
I was gonna say also it kind of sounded like he slipped into Fentanyl the dragon there

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:29.960
He doesn't have a lot of rage

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.920
He's trying to do a racist black person accent and then he slipped into a racist Chinese

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.920
accent

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920
So that's great

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920
He's a Caliendo

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.440
No, no, no, no, he is not Rich Little

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440
No

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.300
So Alex tries to play the clip of it and he fails

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.720
Yeah here it is, let's cue it up, let's cue it up, in fact if you have the audio ready

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720
you got the audio ready?

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.040
You guys can pull it up really quick and great, they have it, okay here it is, well watch

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040
this for yourself

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:06.120
It's okay, our computers, hey I only have like a hundred thousand dollar computer in

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.800
there it's not the crew's fault, the hundred thousand dollar computer messes up about one

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.880
percent of the time, the million dollar computer hardly ever messes up so I can't afford the

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.880
million dollar switcher so it just locked up on them but whenever it boots back up we'll

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.880
play it for you

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.880
What?

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.600
You gotta boot back up?

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
What?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.520
You gotta restart it, I mean look it's a million dollar machine but it still runs on Windows

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.520
95

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.920
This is the hundred thousand dollar one, you can't afford the million

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:35.680
That one doesn't even run on Windows 95, that guy's running DOS prompts

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.920
I wonder if like what actually happened was that there was like a producer in his ear

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:45.280
during that long silence that was like hey those voices that you're doing and the way

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.240
you're characterizing the sketch, if you play the sketch

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.640
This is not gonna go well

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.360
You're gonna be shown to be wrong

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360
You're a racist

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.240
Yes, this is gonna look bad

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.000
I wonder if that's what happened, it would make sense based on the incredibly long pause

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.520
and then eventually they do play what I think is the outrage compilation, the only thing

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.080
that he's aware of, which is the clips of the monologue and then a short clip of that

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.280
sketch and then he's just written a story about it in his head that is more racist than

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280
the original version

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.720
Wild, wildly racist

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.720
Yep

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:24.620
So at this point Alex has a reporter named Sheila Gunn-Reed on his show, she is a reporter

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:27.200
with Rebel Media

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.560
Sure, sure, trustworthy

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560
Great

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560
Yeah, yeah

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.600
And she's on to talk about a certain church in Canada that is under attack

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.600
Uh oh

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.880
Well thanks for having me Alex and thanks so much for your ongoing interest in this

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880
story

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.340
It's truly an international story despite what the mainstream media in my home province

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.340
would have you believe

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:52.720
This church has been the flashpoint for the fight for religious freedom in Canada during

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.720
the pandemic

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.720
I doubt it

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.640
The pastor there, Pastor James Coates, was arrested and incarcerated for 35 days in

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:07.080
a maximum security provincial facility for refusing to limit his congregation to 15%

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.080
of fire code capacity as per the public health orders here in Alberta.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:15.760
He refused to comply, he said it violated his religious freedom, so he was taken into

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.760
custody.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.080
He's been released now, but the crackdown on his church has not stopped

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:27.800
So this is the Grace Life Church in Alberta and like Sheila was saying, the pastor of

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.940
this church James Coates was arrested in February after repeated breaches of COVID safety measures

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:37.480
He was given multiple opportunities and warnings to follow the rules and he refused to do so

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.360
So he got arrested and then released on the condition that he stop breaking the rules

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.040
which he immediately proceeded to break again

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:47.960
Literally everybody involved was like dude we don't want to do this, you don't want to

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:53.240
do this, well obviously you want to turn yourself into a fucking martyr

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:57.920
So in response to his trouble, a group of 28 community leaders from various religious

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:01.920
backgrounds released a statement that quote stress the need to prioritize the well-being

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.160
of all members of society over individual needs during the pandemic and to follow the

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.440
directives of public health officers and the government

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.760
Someone acting Christ-like, kill them!

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.300
Just this week, the Alberta Health Service shut down the church by putting fences up

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:20.280
around it, quote until the church can demonstrate the ability to comply with Alberta's Chief

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.480
Medical Officer of Health's restrictions

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.820
Do you hear what they said?

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:32.640
You are teens, they put you in time out until you can eat your goddamn vegetables, you don't

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640
get to go to church

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.880
Yeah you can't use the phone until you can learn to not prank call people

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.680
Yeah I mean it's insane

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.680
Yep

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.600
I think closing the church is kind of murky territory honestly and I'm not sure how I

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.000
would proceed if I were in charge there but this is Canada

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.700
If the local folk there in Alberta are terribly opposed to this closure then they can work

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.360
on that with the local government but from everything I've seen pretty much everybody

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:59.440
outside the church itself seems fine with the fact that they, you know, if you're not

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.280
going to follow the restrictions they're not even, the restrictions are 15% capacity

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280
Yeah

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.280
It's not even closing the church

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.280
You don't even have to close the church

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.280
No

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.760
Just fucking live stream it, dude we don't want to put you in jail, it would be stupid

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.400
this is stupid, you're a child

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.440
Let's find ways to work this out in ways that work for everybody

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.680
Please just go away

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.760
Anyway there's a 15% capacity that he's supposed to follow but not everybody has to follow

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.760
that

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:32.000
Because it's 15, one five percent of fire code capacity but the Walmart up the road

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.960
but the Costco up the road they can operate at 30% of fire code capacity so this is why

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.960
this is truly amazing

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960
Your church doesn't sell food

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.460
It knows if you're going to Walmart or if you're going to praise God

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:46.720
This is embarrassing pretending to not understand the different capacities for different things

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.840
No get the fuck out of here

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.040
Like I would totally bet that Walmart would have a 15% capacity order if it were a place

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.440
where people congregated for long periods of time, sat in place and sang

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.440
So stupid

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.600
The things you do at Walmart while you're wearing a mask which they didn't do at this

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.600
church

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.120
Oh that was really surprising to me, I assume that they all still wore masks

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120
No

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120
No that's surprising

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.520
You know you're required to wear a mask to enter the Walmart and you walk around and

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520
leave

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.680
Yeah

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.480
That's why maybe you could have 30% capacity there safely as opposed to a building where

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.840
everyone sits and sings

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:30.000
Yeah that is like, listen I know the word is supposed to be mainly geometry based but

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.280
you are being obtuse

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.720
That is ridiculous

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720
Yeah

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720
Yeah

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.440
So Alex gets to talking about his Spars conspiracy a little bit

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440
Sure

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.600
And I thought he was kind of done with Sheila and the church

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600
Yeah

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.600
He is not

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600
Yeah

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.840
He does say this and I think it's silly

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:58.240
Emergency Saturday broadcast world shocked by Spars 2025-2028 document 2,000,073,000 views

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.800
Well that sounds great at Bandai Video

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.520
It needs 100 billion views and we beat these people, it's all right there

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.080
But 2 million is a good start

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:14.280
But I'm not doing this and putting my life on the line and flying a helicopter right

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.320
on the Mexican border where they shoot at helicopters and doing all this to like lose

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.160
Yeah I think that that's really illustrative too, it's like Alex's gauge of being able

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.840
to beat the globalists has to do with his metrics, they are traffic related, we will

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.400
win if we get a hundred million

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400
No you won't

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:38.520
The globalists just watching the view, oh shit he's at 99,999,998, if he gets two more

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.520
we lose

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.240
Sir, shut down the internet

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240
Shut the internet down

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.840
Ridiculous

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840
Yeah

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:55.160
So I thought it was a little bit irresponsible that Alex is you know largely, at least subtly,

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.600
maybe not so subtly encouraging people to go down to the border and behave as he did

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600
Yeah

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:07.440
Yeah just to cost people trying to help, I think that's a, humanity is generally widely

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.240
recognized to have evolved society by killing people trying to help

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.720
And I think that the only effect that that could possibly have is escalating a situation,

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.960
raising the temperature beyond the point where it's easily handled by responsible people

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960
Yeah

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.120
This is not the only instance of him doing this on this show

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.960
This should be the Christian Woodstock, everyone in Canada can get there, I'd say the US but

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.240
your borders are so controlled, unless you're a legal alien, everyone should go there, bring

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:38.360
pizzas, bring barbecues, bring, I think if 20,000 people show up it will turn the tide

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360
against this tyranny

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.640
Don't you agree everyone should come there, tell us where it is

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:48.960
So that church is just west of the capital city of Edmonton, Alberta, it's really just

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:56.000
a couple of miles outside of the city limits, it's very easy to get to, and you know there's

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.160
a public road right there, you can get there and

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.720
And for those listening, they must go now, what is the name, what is the address, everyone

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.000
must go now

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.160
It's Grace Life Church

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.040
So yeah everyone's got to go, everyone's got to go to this church, it should be the Christian

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040
Woodstock

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.040
Uh huh

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.520
So that means Jars of Clay will be performing

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520
Sure

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.240
DC Talk is going to reunite

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.920
Oh it's about time, it's about time, Red Hot Chili Peppers is going to play with just the

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.920
socks on

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.680
Ted Nugent's son is going to sit

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.880
Yeah this seems irresponsible

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.880
Yeah

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880
And it gets kind of worse

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.960
Oh of course

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:45.720
It's 51520 or 51529 A Range Road 262 Spruce Grove AB, is that right?

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:46.720
Yes

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.240
Alright so here's the deal, instead of being like, I'm not putting you down because you're

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.920
just like me, you're like oh thanks for carrying, they've put a fence up and arrested the preacher,

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920
thanks for carrying

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920
Sounds insulting

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.400
We're under attack okay, you're under attack so are we, all of us need to go there, if

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.040
you're in Canada or if you're near the border, you get in legally, go there peacefully, give

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:13.640
aid and comfort to Christians under CHICOM, Governor, attack the CHICOM agent, I just

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:19.160
showed you him pledging allegiance to Xi Jinping, Trudeau, everyone should go, they're scared

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.160
aren't they?

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.160
Trudeau did no such thing

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.160
No he did not

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.400
Um yeah so this is irresponsible and certainly hope that nothing ends up happening there

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:32.880
that Alex might look bad in hindsight, giving the address out and soliciting and inciting

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:40.920
people to go because the church is under attack by the communist Chinese and Justin Trudeau

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920
fucked up

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.840
Yeah there's no other way for that to, like it goes two ways, it goes with a bunch of

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.440
people showing up and being like oh shit this was dumb, or a bunch of people showing up

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.440
and getting whipped into a mob and like let's go down two miles and start wars, you know

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.440
like that kind of thing

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.100
And when you think you're fighting the fucking literal devil, it seems like the latter is

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.100
more likely

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.100
Yeah

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:08.680
Yeah so I don't know, I don't think this is good, and I mean it's obviously that they

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680
are fighting the devil

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.060
Alex, I've never ever seen overt Satanism in real life before

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.360
Oh yeah you told me one of them said Satan is good, tell people about that

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:26.520
I've never seen overt Satanism like that, as you and I both know the enemy works through

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:32.940
all kinds of people but this person drove by in a pickup truck, screamed at women and

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.320
children whose church they're looking at being locked up, so they're distraught and this

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.740
guy screams at them that he's happy that their church is being closed and then he yells at

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:52.580
other people and he says to them even the church of Satan follows masking laws and that's

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:53.580
why you should too

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:58.360
As a Christian, if you're telling me that Satan likes it, I'm more inclined to not do

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.320
it but that's the level of public discourse here

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.160
Yeah some guy in a truck said that we're Satanists and even we wear masks

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.520
That's the level of overt Satanism

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:18.600
Man, this is the weakest of teas, this is weak tea because I wouldn't even have bought

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.520
it if she was just like he screamed out the window I love Satan because then it's like

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.880
yeah of course you say that shit, they're a bunch of assholes

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.080
She doesn't seem to be as willing to let it fly as Alex

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:38.320
No clue, he's just like hey guys, ostensibly your most evil worshippers in the world are

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.320
still not dumb

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.760
We're more concerned with public health and our fellow man than you

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:49.360
Satanists don't want people to die of disease, do you not understand where you are in this

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.360
situation

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.840
Yeah that seems to be with this Satanist alleged Satanist because you might have been

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:55.840
just fucking around

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.160
Yeah that sounds more like that

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:02.520
Anyway some guy yelled for him in the truck and all this is going on and so Alex encourages

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.200
something man he should be careful with his language

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.080
Well I'm telling my listeners, I'm telling them if you live in Canada whether you're

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.020
500 miles away or 20 you must go there, bring some muffins, bring some food, support these

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:20.120
great people because the system has drawn the line here, the enemy has drawn a line

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:27.160
at your church, the enemy's drawn a line and said and so they've chosen this as their Stalingrad

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.560
and I think we should make this their Stalingrad

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.560
Oh boy

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.840
Who's chosen this as their Stalingrad?

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.480
Nobody's chosen this as a Stalingrad, this is way below the level of Stalingrad

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.480
You bet

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.120
Also not for nothing the Soviet Union won that battle

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.120
Well

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:50.480
The communists might want a better metaphor, also Stalingrad was incredibly violent

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.480
Yeah

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:55.600
I don't know if Alex wants to evoke that kind, I mean obviously he does but it doesn't seem

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:02.000
responsible to evoke that kind of imagery surrounding what he's trying to incite people

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.480
to go be a part of

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:10.520
Yeah I'm gonna be honest here, okay, here's what I'm putting together, on this very episode

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.120
he said literally like everything they're doing, everything they say we're doing is

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.680
what they're doing

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.680
Right

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:25.200
Right, now I would say that that is revelatory about what he's doing and I'm gonna say that

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.360
he worships Satan because this is the behavior of someone who worships Satan

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.080
That was just when he was younger

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.800
I don't think he stopped, why isn't that a possibility?

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.640
That's a long term theory of yours, I understand that

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:45.160
So look dude, I think that this episode is really fucked up, there's multiple incitements

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:51.720
towards listeners going to places that Alex seems to want to get out of hand

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.720
Yeah

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.720
A little bit

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.600
Yeah, even if I was the shithead pastor of that church I would be like Alex no, no, no,

01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.760
no, no, we don't, no, no, no, no, we don't want that

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.120
We want support but you're, this is bad

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.920
You're bad support

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:12.320
And really honestly, Sheila wants to bring up that this could all be solved if all the

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.640
pastors in the area weren't against this guy

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:22.320
It's very disappointing to see some of the other pastors in the area say well why isn't

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.200
this church making the same sacrifices that I am

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.360
Oh they make it a sacrifice not to be shut down, they make it a sacrifice to traffic

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:35.000
kids, they make it a sacrifice to submit, those aren't real churches and God knows it

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.920
Oh boy

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.400
These other pastors, I mean if they can reconcile

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:46.080
These aren't pastors, these are world council of churches, Rockefeller pimps

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.160
So this is a point of the episode where I was sort of lost in thought and I started

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.680
to think, I have an interesting thought experiment, maybe it's not a thought experiment, rhetorical

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680
question

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.680
Sure, sure

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.360
Do you think that Alex Jones could name a living member of the Rockefeller family?

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.280
Absolutely not, absolutely not, zero percent chance

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280
I don't think he could

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:15.480
No, I do like that this also plays into what should be very obvious to anybody is if it

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:21.920
weren't for immigration and racism, Christians would be murdering each other left and right

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.080
They hate each other, they don't believe the same shit, they're all nonsense

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:34.420
Well I mean with this letter of the 28 religious leaders in Alberta, they were all like hey

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.800
come on, let's take this seriously

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.960
Do you know what was in that letter?

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.080
Even the Church of Satan is willing to

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.360
That letter was delivered from a truck

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.400
From a truck, yes

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:55.520
It's rare that you get the Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist communities walking arm-in-arm

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.520
with the Satanists

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.520
Yes, exactly

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.200
But this church is enough of a pain in the ass

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.880
Oh my god guys, anyway they're giving us a bad name

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:12.200
Alex is trying to get people to go to this church and have it be their Stalingrad, someone's

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.200
Stalingrad

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.840
Anybody's Stalingrad

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:22.180
In order for this to sound better, he wants Sheila to do it

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.180
He wants her

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:24.720
He wants her to tell everybody to go there

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.720
Yeah, because

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.720
Naturally

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.840
Then he could be like ah, she did it, I didn't do that

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.720
Yeah, absolutely, implicate somebody else in your crime

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.160
She's not as into it as Alex hopes

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:39.280
I feel it, I see it, I think it'll be 5,000 people tomorrow, 10,000 this weekend, I think

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.280
they've jumped the shark

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:45.120
Call, you need to do it, beautiful, beautiful soul, tell people, Sheila Gunn-Reed, come

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.160
peacefully now, call them, tell them

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:52.800
If people are going to come to support Grace Life, they welcome the support, but if you're

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:59.320
coming, come peacefully and come respectfully, but they would appreciate your support, they

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:05.560
need it now more than ever, their church has been seized by the state, they need all the

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.560
support that they can get

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:11.560
I don't want to be peaceful, but we need you to then call them, say, help us, call them

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.840
Well I don't want to speak for the church, Alex, I really don't want to speak for the

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840
church

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.520
But just as a Canadian, as a human, I'm just saying that everyone needs to hear you call

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.000
for that, I'm calling for it, we call for people to stand up for religious freedom

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Absolutely

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.160
Sheila, I'll go that far

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.160
Yeah

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.120
I'll support religious freedom, isn't this what like journalists do?

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.120
I guess

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.760
Is this what Alex thinks reporters do, they come on shows and try and

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:41.640
Demand murders!

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.720
I mean, if she's supposed to be covering this story, it doesn't make sense for the interview

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:51.320
to end with him begging her to call people to come to this church

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320
Yeah

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.320
That's weird

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.320
Yeah, that's bad

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.880
Yeah, this isn't any kind of reporting

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:04.040
This is, at best, activism, and at worst, and in reality, incitement

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:05.040
Yeah

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.520
Yeah

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.520
This episode is nuts

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.560
Sheila, you're a bad person

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.800
I mean, I think she's, I don't know enough about her to really have a full picture, but

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.680
based on her behavior, I think she's trying to stay a little more neutral than Alex wants

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.680
her to be

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.040
I do, I do agree with you there

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:26.840
She doesn't understand that Alex is like, she's talking to a guy who's a parody version

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.840
Yeah

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.640
Of a right-wing media outlet

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.640
Oh boy

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.240
She's used to, you know, uh

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.000
Pretend seriousness

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.360
Oh, and at least like, I don't necessarily want to get sued

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.800
Sure, sure, sure, sure

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.360
Alex doesn't seem to care

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.680
I'm behaving in ways where I clearly want people to fucking sue me

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.520
I fear consequences, and Alex apparently doesn't

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.520
Yeah

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.320
In Canada, we might get consequences

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.280
In America, Alex receives none

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.520
Alex has learned over the course of his career not to respect the idea of chickens coming

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.520
home to roost

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.480
Of the law, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.680
And that's why he behaves the way he does

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680
Yeah, pretty much

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.600
I listened to this episode, and I was blown away by like, okay, I thought that video was

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:11.600
bad

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600
Yeah

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.600
I thought it, I still think it's bad

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:14.600
I think it's terrible

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:15.600
I think it's terrible

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.720
I think it's legally actionable, and uh, you know, whatever

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.720
Yeah

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.120
I didn't expect for the episode afterwards to be worse

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.640
Yeah, I was, I was surprised, I thought we were gonna have a little fun clowning on that

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:32.040
dumb video, I hadn't seen it, so I was, you know, I was waiting for the show, obviously

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.040
And

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040
There's not much to see

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:39.240
Instead, we got a concentrated bullion cube of racism and incitement to violence

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:47.040
Yeah, yeah, and I really, I mean, I mean this, I hope that nothing happens

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.160
Yeah, me too

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:54.200
His behavior in the past has led to people going and fucking with people and victimizing

01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:00.720
people in ways that are irresponsible and terrible, and for him to have two targets

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:03.320
of like, everyone's gotta go to these places

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.320
Yeah

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.680
In one day is really, really scary, what it could portend

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.880
No, admittedly, it could lead to nothing

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:15.600
But the danger is there, and that is, I just don't think it's acceptable to act this way

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:22.640
Yeah, I mean, see, can't you see in a courtroom, like, your honor, in this trial we aim to

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:30.640
prove that Alex Jones did another Pizzagate, so if we prove that, then he goes away forever,

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.640
right?

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640
That's good

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.640
I don't know

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.640
I'm a bad prosecutor

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.640
Yeah, certainly

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.840
I don't know how you do that in court, but like, just for the sake of like, a podcast

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.840
that explores these things

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:40.840
Sure

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.560
I think you can definitely say he's behaving in exactly the same ways as he has when things

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.560
have gone bad

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.560
Yeah

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.560
It's bad

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.560
Yeah

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560
Not good

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.640
We should learn from the things that have already happened

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.640
Yep

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.640
I think that would be wise

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.640
Yep

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.640
Yeah

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.800
So, fingers crossed, things work out okay, and I guess we will find out on our next episode

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.520
I hope calling on people to not go to the border, or that church

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520
Yes

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.000
I strongly call on everyone to not do either of those things

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.080
Yeah, I'm in favor of people

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080
Stay home!

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.080
Yeah

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.640
Have a nice little cocktail

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.640
Yeah

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.560
Isn't that better than going to the border or a weird church in Canada?

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.560
Yep

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.560
I think so

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.320
And we will be back, but until then Jordan, we have a website

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.760
We do, it's knowledgefight.com

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.320
Oh wait, I forgot, also

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.320
What's that?

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.120
Like I said, we're gonna, our Monday episode will be on Wednesday

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.360
It'll be on Wednesday, yes

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.560
But if I'm feeling better, might put out a little funny fun thing on Monday

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.560
We'll see

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.560
We'll see

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.960
Also, we're gonna be on Twitter

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.440
We are on Twitter, it's at knowledgefight.com, go to bed Jordan

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440
We're also on Facebook

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.440
We are on Facebook

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.200
If you would like to download the show, and if you could, please find a local charity

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.240
or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.240
Yep

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.240
We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZXClark, I'm Daryl Rundis

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.360
So what do you think about them apples?

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.080
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:06.440
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:13.440
I love you
