7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,680
saying we are the bad guys

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm Jordan

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,160
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Alex Jones

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,440
Oh indeed we are, Dan

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Jordan

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Dan

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
Jordan

30
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
Quick question for ya

31
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
What's up?

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
What's your bright spot today?

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
My bright spot today is that I have been vaccinated

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Yay!

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,360
I got it all taken care of and I'm okay

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Yes indeed

37
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,920
At this point, it was an interesting weekend

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,400
I actually, I got my date wrong and ended up getting the vaccine on Saturday

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Yes, yep

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,840
And I had heard from some people, I had some friends who have gotten shot and they've told

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,720
me about like, oh, you know, hey, the next day it's pretty bad or like I had a little

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
bit of, you know, some, some effects

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Sure, sure, sure

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,400
And so you were kind enough to drive me to get the vaccine and I went and immediately

45
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I was very cocky

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Oh!

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I was so cocky

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,520
I was very much like, I'm not even having any side effects, I wanna, I wanna be part

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,560
of the team, everybody's suffering through this

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,800
I appreciated very much the hubris of saying, you know, I feel like I'm not even a part

51
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,720
of the communal experience of the side effects

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Yeah

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,320
And so that evening, Saturday evening, Wrestlemania was on

54
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Right

55
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Saturday and Sunday and it was the return of the live audience at a Wrestlemania and

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,560
there was this weird resonance between, I got vaccinated on the same day as Wrestlemania

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,000
is having crowds return

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sure, sure

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,280
There was sort of a swell of emotion of like normal, pseudo normalcy

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
You can see the horizon

61
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
You can see the horizon over there

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,360
Yeah and so I was watching it and right at about 9.30 I got hit by a train of a fever

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,680
Just a, just a locomotive and so I had a little bit of a fever through the end of Saturday

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,960
night of Wrestlemania and went straight to bed and felt fine, Sunday really

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Yes

67
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
But felt real stupid

68
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,680
Well, I mean, Dan, you got your wish, you joined the communal experience of side effects

69
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Dan

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah

71
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
You and I are both fully vaccinated now

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
I felt really stupid cause I was like looking at my texts to you and I was like, there's

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
no side effects

74
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm fine

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,840
It was very funny

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm a superman

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,200
It was very funny, I didn't feel any like resentment towards you, I was just sitting

78
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,220
there going like, oh, I've heard some people don't have side effects, maybe Dan will be

79
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
one of the ones

80
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,320
In the back of my mind I was like, something's gonna happen

81
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah, it wasn't too bad too, like it wasn't even like a really bad fever, I'm just kind

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
of weak

83
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Yeah

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,360
I'm very soft and a little bit of a fever and I was just like, I need to put on a little

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
hat, a little bedtime hat

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,760
A little bedclothes, nice little sleepy time tea

87
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,040
Yeah, and so also, I just feel like I should do this, a little review of Wrestlemania

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Sure, sure, of course

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
Boo

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,680
That was a very little review

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Yeah

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Wow

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Real bad?

94
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Mm

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,520
How did, we had a conversation about Bray Wyatt and his nonsense, did they do what

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,480
we, I surmised that they would do a movie like that, where they go inside of a, nope

97
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,620
What happened?

98
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,320
So for the listeners who don't watch wrestling, Bray Wyatt was a guy who was a swamp hillbilly

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
cult leader

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Sure

101
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
And was a lot of fun

102
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,840
Unofficial mascot of this podcast, I believe

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Sure, yeah

104
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Our first tweet was, yeah, yeah, yeah

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,580
No, I don't think that was our first tweet, but it was the first one I tagged Alex Jones

106
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,580
in

107
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,580
Yes, yeah, yeah

108
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
He was on Twitter

109
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

110
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,760
So he used to be a swamp hillbilly cult leader, and that was a lot of fun, he gave rambling

111
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,800
sermons, and then he went away and he came back as a children's TV show host

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Sure

113
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It was a little bit creepy

114
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Sure

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,480
At the Firefly Funhouse, and then he also was possessed by a demon called the Fiend

116
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Right

117
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,840
That made him nearly indestructible, and there's a bunch of convoluted nonsense storytelling

118
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Of course

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,200
Then at last year's Wrestlemania, they did a cinematic movie type match, where it was

120
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,640
called a Firefly Funhouse match

121
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
Sure

122
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,560
Where the Fiend deconstructed John Cena's ego in his entire career

123
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Right

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
Through a weird psychological deconstruct- it was amazing

125
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,400
No, no, we- I watched it, this is one of the few things about wrestling that I've ever

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
watched, we watched it together, and I told you this was actually very, very good

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,740
It was a lot of fun, so over the course of this year, the Fiend, the demon guy, he got

128
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,840
burned alive

129
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Sure, sure

130
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Randy

131
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Professional wrestling, correct?

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Okay

133
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,760
Randy Orton set him on fire, and burned him alive, and he disappeared for a bit, but by

134
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,880
that point, he had indoctrinated Alexa Bliss, who was another character on the show

135
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Sure

136
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Sure

137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Into the dark arts, or the evil

138
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
Naturally

139
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Or whatever

140
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Yeah, whatever it is they do

141
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,360
And so she was sort of pestering Randy Orton, and throwing fireballs at him, because she

142
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
can throw fireballs now

143
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Well yeah, but why not?

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Sure

145
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,560
You burned a man alive, you might as well give his buddy the ability to throw fireballs

146
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,560
So at the last pay-per-view, Alexa Bliss had talked Randy Orton into a match with her

147
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Sure

148
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
And of course, this was all a trap

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,440
Well yeah, she shoots fire

150
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,120
And the Fiend came back, and he was all burned and everything

151
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Okay, alright

152
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,040
Charred up, and like, oh my god, he's a zombie, he's back

153
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Sure, sure, sure

154
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,680
You will be visited by three other ghosts immediately following this one

155
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Yes

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Yeah, yeah

157
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,240
So at this WrestleMania, on night two, they had the match between the Fiend and Randy

158
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,400
Orton, and it was like, what the fuck is this gonna be?

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,320
They've already burned him to death

160
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,200
Yeah, yeah, so I would say, you know

161
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
A wrestling match

162
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,440
A chalk and ash bone match

163
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,840
I was like, this is so stupid

164
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,960
And so actually, during the pre-show of night one, I was yelling at the screen, open with

165
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,160
the Fiend match you cowards!

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Yeah

167
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,920
Because it's the worst idea, why would you ever open the show with that match?

168
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Oh, it's a terrible idea

169
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,200
And they opened the show with that match

170
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
They did not

171
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
And it was so dumb

172
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,800
They opened the show with that match, that's a terrible idea

173
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Yeah

174
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh my god

175
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
It was really bad

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Oh boy

177
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,740
Yep, and it started with Bray Wyatt as the Fiend, charred, walking down the hallway

178
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,400
And as he walked down the hallway, all the char dropped off him and he was magically

179
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
healed

180
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
And he regenerated?

181
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Yeah

182
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
He regenerated?

183
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Oh man

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Yep

185
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh shit, that should have been on Easter

186
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Should have been on Easter

187
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,320
The Fiend comes back on Easter Sunday?

188
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
That's the way you do it

189
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,280
I would explain what happened in the match, but I don't really understand it and it was

190
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
dumb

191
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,080
I will say my high point, and this is damning the Wrestlemania with faint praise, my high

192
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,320
point was the rapper Bad Bunny

193
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,200
I have been hearing a lot of people say positive things about a rapper who did some flips

194
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,280
Yes, that was on night one, it might have been when my fever was setting in, but he

195
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
killed it

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,800
It was a lot of fun to watch him have just the best time

197
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,240
Clearly he was having a lot of fun

198
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,800
That didn't happen, I checked with some people before the show and they were like no, Bad

199
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,680
Bunny's never been on Wrestlemania, Dan just had a terrible fever

200
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Oh shit

201
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,700
Dan, your fever was so bad, your brain was torturing itself

202
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,960
On night two they had a great video, like a little piece where Bad Bunny comes walking

203
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,000
up onto a street and Triple H is standing there with a briefcase and he's like you did

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,460
great at Wrestlemania, now you go do what you do

205
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,760
Oh god no

206
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,840
So he hands him the briefcase and he's got a microphone

207
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,240
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
I don't even know anything about Bad Bunny's music and I have been won over, he seems charming

209
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,480
Anyway, this has been my protracted bright spot, how about you Jordan

210
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,360
Dan, my bright spot of all things, there's a new TV show called Made for Love

211
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,880
Features someone who's burned to death, comes back

212
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,300
Close, surprisingly close, it's like a, you know, tech billionaire, he does some stuff,

213
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,000
it's quite funny, but the main thing is Ray Romano is incredible in it

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh yeah

215
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,880
He has turned himself into an actor with a, with a capital Taur

216
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
I think he's always been pretty good

217
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,740
He's always been pretty good, but you wouldn't expect everybody loves Raymond to be this

218
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,140
guy and to pull it off as well as he does

219
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know, have you seen Men of a Certain Age?

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That was pretty good

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Was it?

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Was it Andre Brauer?

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,120
Wait, Men of a Certain Age, which age?

224
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Yeah, Ray Romano, Quantum Leap Guy, Scott Bakula

225
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,120
Scott Bakula is still alive?

226
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
It was a while back, there was a show, I remember

227
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,760
Scott Bakula was alive a while back?

228
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
He was of a certain age

229
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,680
I remember that show being alright, I might be wrong about that

230
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Wait, it was a show?

231
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Yeah

232
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I thought it was like a

233
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
It was on like USA

234
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,840
I thought it was like the Deep Impact to Wild Hogs's Armageddon if you will

235
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,720
You know, Men of a Certain Age and Wild Hogs both came out the same year kind of thing

236
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
There's thematic overlap

237
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Sure

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Aging

239
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Anyway

240
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Okay

241
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Jordan

242
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Yes?

243
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
Today we have an episode to go over

244
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Oh we do

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Yup

246
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Was that what we were doing?

247
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,480
So I had this weekend of, you know, sort of recovery and what have you and convalescence

248
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,560
Even though I probably wasn't nearly as, you know, in need of that as I might have thought

249
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,680
I might need to be

250
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,200
I appreciate everybody allowing us, you know, being cool about Monday on Wednesday this

251
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
week

252
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,920
But as I was getting back to work I was like, I don't want to do this stuff

253
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,400
Like I didn't want to look at the present day

254
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,240
There have been some shootings and, you know, police involved shooting in Minneapolis

255
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,420
And I just, I just didn't have the stomach to jump right back into that with Alex

256
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,000
And so I decided we're going back to 2003

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,840
We're going to dip our toes back in

259
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,560
We'll deal with the present day on Friday

260
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Sure

261
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,180
But I needed to have something that had a little bit less stakes in order to dive back

262
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
in on

263
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,040
And we'll talk about that here in just a moment

264
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,640
But before we do we've got to take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed

265
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,720
up and are supporting the show

266
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
That's a great idea

267
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,960
So first, Scatman AKA Dan, thank you so much

268
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
You are now a policy wonk

269
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm a policy wonk

270
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,040
Thanks Scatman AKA Dan

271
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,500
This is a good point for me to also apologize

272
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,020
It has been brought up to me that I did say on an early episode that if we ever made it

273
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,680
to a point where we were comfortable doing this podcast

274
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
Oh no, we don't bring that up anymore

275
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,560
That I would change my name legally to Scatman

276
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,040
We don't bring that up anymore

277
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm not going to be able to do that

278
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,160
Well, we were not expecting it

279
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Yes

280
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,800
We were putting, we were putting a lot of money on not making any money

281
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,160
I do keep open the possibility of a Scatman John tattoo or just his mustache

282
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Oh yeah

283
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,560
Next, Willard Wonka in the policy factory

284
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

285
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,720
I'm a policy wonk

286
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Thanks Willard Wonka

287
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,920
Next, Courtney B, not a walk-in but I was in a Nelly song

288
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,720
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

289
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm a policy wonk

290
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Thanks Courtney

291
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,400
Good to know that is not a walk-in

292
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
That's not a walk-in

293
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
No

294
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
No

295
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,120
You know Courtney B telling me about a party up in NYC

296
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
I don't

297
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Gotta make it damn right

298
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
I don't

299
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
First flight, first flight, first flight

300
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Ah, come on

301
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Mix the Vanna White

302
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't know

303
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
I'm never going to understand it

304
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm never going to understand it

305
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,240
The world still thought Nelly was a good idea

306
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Must be the money

307
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
They really did

308
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
That's a great song

309
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Okay

310
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,960
Anyway, uh, Toko, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

311
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm a policy wonk

312
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Thanks Toko

313
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Thank you

314
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,320
Next, Davey Pancakes, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

315
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I'm a policy wonk

316
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,440
Thanks, Davey Pancakes

317
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Thank you

318
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,640

Thank you very much

322
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,080
Hey, and finally, uh, I got a little technocrat shout out going out to Conal

323
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,960
Thank you so much, Conal, you are now a technocrat

324
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm a policy wonk

325
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,200
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

326
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,640
How's your 401k doing, bro?

327
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,240
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

328
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,720
Let's just get down to business

329
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,800
We ain't making that money off that heroin

330
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,840
Why you pimps so good?

331
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,480
My neck is freakishly large

332
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,080
I declare info war on you

333
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Thanks so much, Conal

334
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
Yes, thank you very much, Conal

335
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,760
Also, Jordan, I know you know this

336
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
What's up, Dan?

337
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Now, the world needs to know this

338
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Okay

339
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,880
There are two April birthdays, uh, myself

340
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
Indeed they are

341
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Myself

342
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,000
There's one, you have two in April as well this year, I believe

343
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,120
And Dr. Gums, my buddy Dr. Gums also has a, uh, has a April birthday

344
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Alright

345
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
You know who else does?

346
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Brad.

347
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
How's it going, Brad?

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,440
Happy birthday, Brad

349
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,840
Uh, Tyler got in touch with us and wanted us to wish Brad a happy birthday

350
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
So, Brad, happy birthday

351
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Happy birthday, Brad

352
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,240
We didn't say when your birthday was, though

353
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,800
It's just in April at some point

354
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Not important

355
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,300
It doesn't have to be in April

356
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,440
My birthday's in April and so is Dr. Gums, which means that it's the best month

357
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,560
Also, Mandy Moore, Cedric the Entertainer, Kelly Clarkson

358
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Okay

359
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,920
Anyway, Jordan, today we are going over May 5th, 2003

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Alright

361
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,680
You may recall that our last episode was about May 2nd, 2003

362
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,000
And you're like, what the hell, why are we jumping?

363
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We aren't jumping

364
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay

365
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
May 2nd was a Thursday

366
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Uh-huh

367
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It was a Friday

368
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Now we're back on Monday

369
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It was a busy Friday

370
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah

371
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It was a busy Friday

372
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,560
He doesn't have a Sunday show at this point

373
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
Gotcha

374
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,840
So we're just back on Monday here

375
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
And here is an out of context drop from today's show

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Kids are now being arrested for stepping in water puddles

377
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
That's an aggressive move

378
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
That is an aggressive move

379
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
That is an aggressive move

380
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,720
Yep, kids are being arrested for stepping in water puddles

381
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,520
Stepping in water puddles?

382
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Yeah

383
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
How deep are we talking?

384
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
So deep

385
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,480
I want to know, I want to know the regulations on what pools

386
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,760
What is the pool of water in this circumstance?

387
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,360
I regret to inform you that Alex does not get into that

388
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,280
Oh, that's a real bummer

389
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,600
Any of the specific details on that front

390
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Alright

391
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,000
So Alex begins the show complaining about how the bath party is being put in all the

392
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,840
positions of power in Iraq

393
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,520
Which in retrospect sounds really right on

394
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,920
He's right about everything

395
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,120
He will shortly be very, very, very wrong

396
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,040
And then we get an edition of the game that I like to play

397
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,080
That is Where in the World is Saddam Hussein?

398
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,800
And they are setting up a dictatorship

399
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,960
They are putting a regional governors in

400
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,240
All former bath party officials in the 23 ministries

401
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,880
That is official, White House last week

402
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,400
Most of Saddam's former people, most of them trained in the US by the CIA

403
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,760
That was the CIA government under Saddam until they broke

404
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,440
When he followed orders to invade Kuwait

405
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,520
And got a lot of trouble, they set him up

406
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,200
As Saddam said on ITN, now comfortable living in Russia

407
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,560
So apparently Saddam is now comfortable living in Russia

408
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Okay

409
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,760
On our last episode he was in Haiti or was it Cuba?

410
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I believe he was in Cuba

411
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Yeah

412
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
He was in Cuba

413
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,120
So now he's, in the last couple days he's gone from Cuba to Russia

414
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,600
I think there was an Indiana Jones style interstitial

415
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,880
Where there's the plane and the red line going from spot to spot

416
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
I believe

417
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
Yeah

418
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Boy, he gets around

419
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,240
Nobody, nobody has seen him get on any of these flights

420
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
No

421
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Cuba, Russia

422
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Right

423
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
That hole

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
That, yeah

425
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Where he was found

426
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Yes, exactly

427
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Yeah

428
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
Quite a travel itinerary

429
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Yeah

430
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,840
Yeah, so this is interesting the way that this is playing out

431
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:40,440
That Alex is very much on the page of the bath party is going to be in charge of everything

432
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Naturally

433
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,120
It's just going to be very, very wrong in a very short period of time

434
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Yeah

435
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,520
So at this point in Alex's career, he's a different Alex Jones than he is in the present

436
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
day

437
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,600
In some ways and he's the same in some ways

438
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:05,380
Right now in 2021 even as he's being a real dum-dum on air and being very sad and not

439
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,380
great at his job

440
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,480
Just a real shit pile

441
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,920
He's still in a million dollar studio

442
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Yes

443
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,000
He's still got the LED screens behind him

444
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
True

445
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,280
He's the kind of guy who shows up with bullhorns at events that he didn't organize in DC and

446
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
people chant his name

447
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,080
He can afford to hire at least 15, 18 year olds at a time

448
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,440
And you know, he can draw a crowd

449
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,880
He can lead some people from Trump's rally to the Capitol in a way that might look bad

450
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
in hindsight

451
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
We don't need to worry about that

452
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,240
In 2003 he was a little bit different

453
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,800
The kind of bookings Alex was taking back then

454
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Oh no

455
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,080
But before I go any further, a couple quick announcements

456
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,560
I rarely traveled, but I will be up at KCXL 1140 that carries the daytime show

457
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:59,840
KCXL 1140 for the Liberty Factor, May 17th, that's a couple weeks from now on a Saturday

458
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,080
May 17th and that's going to be from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.

459
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,640
Colonel Craig Roberts and others will be there speaking

460
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,060
And I'll be speaking for several hours and doing a presentation and it's going to be

461
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,560
a great event and it's a benefit for KCXL

462
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,320
And I hope to see everybody there

463
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,040
So Alex is basically, he's doing a local radio gig

464
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that

465
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,040
I appreciate that a lot

466
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,280
There's maybe a minor league baseball game somewhere nearby

467
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,280
There's a car dealership opening that he's going to be appearing at

468
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,400
So I was wondering about this station because it's like Alex is going out of his way to

469
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
go to this station

470
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Yeah

471
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
It seems weird

472
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,480
Like what can we find out about this place?

473
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,140
And, well, there's a 2020 article about the station that I thought was a little bit interesting

474
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,880
seeing how things turned out for them

475
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,480
So wait, this was just last year?

476
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Yeah

477
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Okay, alright

478
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,680
So this station is owned by a guy named Pete Chartel and he signed a deal not too long

479
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:12,720
ago with Radio Sputnik to air their broadcasting for six hours a day on this station AM 1140

480
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,800
as well as two other stations he runs for approximately $60,000 a year

481
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,880
Ooh, you know, it's tough keeping a Ma and Pa radio station alive though

482
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Right

483
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,920
So like, you gotta find revenue where you can

484
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Yeah, sure

485
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,640
Yeah, you gotta do what you gotta do

486
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,480
It's interesting, I find that interesting, not necessarily all that damning or anything

487
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
No, no, no

488
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Weird

489
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Yeah

490
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,880
Also, prior to this, this station was airing people like Alex Jones and of course Rick

491
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,080
Wiles who you may remember is that fundamentalist asshole who called the Trump impeachment a

492
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,440
quote Jew coup

493
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,760
Yes

494
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,040
This line in a KCUR profile about him and this station is actually kind of stunning

495
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Quote, Chartel acknowledges that KCXL has at times given platforms to people who quote

496
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,200
seem antisemitic

497
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,000
But Chartel said that he thinks his listeners are well informed and should be able to quote

498
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,840
decide for themselves whether they think something is anti this or anti that whether it's based

499
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,280
on prejudice or upon someone's wrong interpretation of the facts

500
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,920
Now, now I feel like we're misunderstanding a real issue there

501
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,080
I understand it's up to the listener to decide whether or not they believe it is antisemitism

502
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,000
however it is and you put it on the radio, sir

503
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,360
Well, he certainly says it seems like it is

504
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,520
It doesn't get, we don't get to go back from seems, we don't get to go back from seems

505
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,640
you put it on the radio

506
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Yeah

507
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:38,640
And plenty of your listeners were well aware of that it was antisemitism and it was a selling

508
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
point for them

509
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,880
I'm taking up time on my broadcast to air Nazi stuff and I'm gonna, you know, run commercials

510
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
during it

511
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Sure

512
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,920
But I trust that the audience gets that I don't like this

513
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna stump for them

514
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm just gonna give them a place to spread their views without any pushback

515
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,320
Yeah, so that's the station that Alex is going to do

516
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Good stuff

517
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Great

518
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Good stuff

519
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,240
So Alex has some gripes in 2003

520
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,600
He's got some issues but there's one issue that is rises above all of them

521
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Okay

522
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,400
The biggest thing we face is the overnight talk sensation types that talk about deliberate

523
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,680
disinformation on purpose

524
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,920
They'll have five stupid guests for one good guest that talks about real information

525
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,320
What that then does is when the average American hears somebody talk about famous corrupt world

526
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,640
government they've heard that mixed in with the Green Martians from the South Pole or

527
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,720
you know Planet X or whatever and then it neutralizes all of it, it's the poison pill

528
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,800
Whereas everything we talk about here is proven and is documented and is in your face

529
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,640
So the biggest issue that the truth movement or whatever Alex is engaged in at this point

530
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,440
The biggest issue that they face is these opportunistic radio people who talk about

531
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,000
some of the real issues but then mix in stuff like aliens or let's say extra dimensional

532
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,680
demons and fighting the literal devil

533
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,880
Right, right

534
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,040
One could say that he has become everything that he hates most in this exact moment

535
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,080
Alex's biggest problem in 2003 is his future self

536
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Is Alex in 2021

537
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Yeah

538
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Oh boy

539
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Gotta love it

540
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,760
So I heard that and I thought like well that's just good fun

541
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
That is

542
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,440
But this actually leads to what I think is a really interesting moment later in the episode

543
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Okay

544
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,040
There's something that rises this up to a level of relevance that it wouldn't have otherwise

545
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,840
But before we get to that Alex has got to complain a lot about how they're going to

546
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,560
outlaw homeschooling

547
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,960
Okay

548
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,200
I've got the headline right here homeschooling under new law to be abused in California just

549
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,000
says period you homeschool it's abusive

550
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,760
Yes it's the new America folks this is who they're coming after hope you know the terrorism

551
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,600
manual say Christians gun owners homeschoolers word for word and you thought it was the Muslims

552
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,260
oh no they work for the CIA any real Muslim terrorists is flying around in a plane with

553
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,800
bars of gold from your tax money

554
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
What?

555
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Any real

556
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,560
By the way Senate reports before I end this segment you want to find out about those Muslim

557
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,520
terrorists that work for the CIA get 911 the road to tyranny and part two of that the masters

558
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
of terror

559
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Interesting add pivots

560
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Wow

561
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
That's the way it worked back then

562
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,920
If you want to find out about the Muslims terrorists

563
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,040
Flying around with bars of gold

564
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,280
With bars of gold from your tax money

565
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Okay

566
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Yeah

567
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,400
So all the terrorists without bars of gold are fake Muslim terrorists?

568
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:54,040
I think that Alex is saying that there aren't really any except for CIA run Muslim terrorists

569
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
yeah it's interesting

570
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
That is interesting

571
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Yeah

572
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Okay

573
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,840
So they're gonna they're gonna get rid of homeschooling they're calling it abuse

574
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:11,240
I mean I have a problem with homeschooling as a way to avoid learning that's a big issue

575
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,320
where they're like I don't want my kid learning any of that devil math that's an issue

576
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Right

577
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,080
So they should learn the math of the spheres

578
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,800
Yeah homeschooling in and of itself isn't necessarily abusive but it can be an element

579
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:31,280
of abuse if you're keeping your child in a you know raising them in some kind of absurd

580
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
way

581
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Perhaps

582
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,560
Let's say homeschooling could be an element of that but just because someone decides to

583
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,000
homeschool does not necessarily equate to that

584
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah

585
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,160
And I think that Alex likes to play the margins there likes to pretend that everybody is saying

586
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,120
that homeschool is intrinsically

587
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Sure

588
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Inactive abuse

589
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
I mean yeah

590
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,280
I don't think that those are the arguments that people are making

591
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,880
You know I mean in my small community growing up we had a couple I had I had that but I

592
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,440
think we had both ends of the spectrum of homeschool kids the kids who are homeschooled

593
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,440
who were clearly way overachievers and you meet them and they're six years old and you're

594
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,120
like yeah you shouldn't be in with the rest of the chattel you need to be raised by your

595
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,720
weirdo parents to become a math genius that's fine

596
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,160
And then the other end of that was the like well okay so they know everything about the

597
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,360
Bible and then beyond that we're in real dicey territory

598
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Sure

599
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Yeah

600
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,120
And I think one of the difficulties and challenges of homeschooling is obviously like socialization

601
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,360
and I think people have figured out ways around that with like you know groups and

602
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
strategies and stuff like that

603
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah yeah yeah yeah the whole thing

604
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,160
Yeah but I don't know the way that I look at it is like yeah there's some homeschool

605
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,600
stuff that's bad and there's some stuff that's fine

606
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Yeah

607
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,000
Alex on the other hand when he looks at school

608
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,120
Sure

609
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
It's all bad

610
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,400
Oh well and all over the country cesspools like California run by socialists and gun

611
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,160
grabbing creatures like Davis are first saying oh we're gonna rescue you homeschool we don't

612
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,000
have a teaching certificate not a law they just say it same thing in Illinois they're

613
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,320
trying it all over now even some southern states it's all about intimidation it's less

614
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,000
than 1% it's to scare you than to be highly publicized we've talked to Christopher before

615
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,720
he's given us this great analysis and I agree with him it's what they're doing now though

616
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,400
they're trying to put it into law and call it child abuse where they just refuse the

617
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,040
school refused to give you quote your form then you don't put your child in their abusive

618
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,600
system where your child learns how to be a crack whore or learns how to worship world

619
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,520
government or learns how to report mommy and daddy thrown in guns

620
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,320
Are they the only three?

621
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,520
Christianity is seen as a cult religion but they teach you how to be a Muslim I mean it

622
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
goes on and on

623
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
What?

624
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,540
The nightmares in these schools when your kid gets arrested if they're caught playing

625
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,040
tag or dodge ball

626
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,960
These are weird examples

627
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,680
Yeah this is a very strange dystopia that he's painting a picture that if that were

628
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:05,760
real you would that's some very weird adults doing some weird stuff like as a whole

629
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,320
Yeah I don't know how public education teaches you to be and I don't like this term but as

630
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,880
Alex is calling it a crack whore

631
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,040
A crack sex worker

632
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:24,520
I don't know what that educational curriculum is like I also think yeah I mean like obviously

633
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:31,480
tag and dodge ball that's just those right wing talking points around this time and periodically

634
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,320
whenever they want to deploy those yeah it's weird

635
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,040
Yeah I don't think I remember any classes growing up that was just like okay we're gonna

636
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,280
watch the wire and then you figure out what character you want to be and we'll build a

637
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,600
curricula based on that

638
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah I also don't know I don't know what classes ever have been like Christianity is a cult

639
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,920
and oh here's how you become a Muslim

640
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,360
I don't know if I've ever read it yet

641
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
It's a little

642
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
That's not very

643
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,200
It seems a little bit like a caricature

644
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,200
I feel like he might be describing a women's studies course in a very wrong way

645
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,000
I don't know so Alex has an example though of like the way that this is out of control

646
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,040
in the schools the schools are out of control they're trying to get everyone jammed up

647
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Okay

648
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,240
Like here in Austin Texas if you're late to class three times that's considered truancy

649
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,280
they criminally charge you in one school over half the kids have been charged though the

650
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,000
state law says 12 to 14 truancies in a semester they're not even following the law anymore

651
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,080
I met a lady she showed me the documents and she actually works for someone in my family

652
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,600
and she brought she showed me the documentation her child was in kindergarten six years ago

653
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,320
and was out for a week with pneumonia they have now criminally charged her for truancy

654
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,080
in kindergarten and we went look at the statute of limitations it's like six months because

655
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,960
there's not even a criminal charge and they're now criminally charging her they're not even

656
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,460
following laws now sir

657
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,120
What?

658
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:09,200
That seems uh if true I am outraged sir

659
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,920
Yeah I don't believe this

660
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,520
So the first thing that I find troubling about this story is that a week is a pretty quick

661
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,360
recovery time for a kindergartner to get over pneumonia

662
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,520
As easy

663
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
That seems fishy

664
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,760
That's a strong kindergartner

665
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,960
Also Jordan I would ask you this question what is truancy if you're a kindergartner?

666
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,720
Those kids are between four and six years old so it's not like they're even able to

667
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
skip class

668
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,320
They stopped watching The Wire all right they turned around

669
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,880
If there's an unexplained absence of a child in kindergarten that's an issue with the parents

670
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,280
a six-year-old is not responsible for getting themselves to class like a high schooler might

671
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,880
be so pretending there's an equivalence in terms of truancy is just ridiculous

672
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,200
The kindergarten hires a guy in a van to drive around outside all 7-elevens and be like hey

673
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,640
you you're it's your one day you gotta be in school get in there

674
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,560
According to the Texas Board of Education there are a bunch of steps that are taken

675
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,200
before any kind of court would come into play with truancy issues as it stands now

676
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,840
These rules were changed to get rid of any possible criminal charges back in 2015 but

677
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,240
even prior to that the worst that would really happen to a student is that they would be

678
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,920
charged with a Class C misdemeanor

679
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Sure

680
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,280
That they could get out of control and we'll discuss that in a second

681
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Right right right

682
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,460
I'm not sure how I feel about any of this but I'm also pretty sure from what I've read

683
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,800
on the subject that this is only something that currently is done after there are attempts

684
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,720
to resolve the truancy issue and those attempts have failed

685
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Sure

686
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,160
And it's not even how this stuff works anymore

687
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,160
This is one of those interesting things about Alex in the past though where he he's actually

688
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,840
covering a murky subject but he's sensationalizing it so far past the point where it can be taken

689
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
seriously

690
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah

691
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,880
So people can and should discuss what approaches are appropriate to take in terms of encouraging

692
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,800
attendance in school and how chronic truancy is often an indication of a larger problem

693
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,520
that should not be ignored and kids need help with

694
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,560
Yeah if chronic truancy the problem is not you're not in school often enough

695
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Right

696
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
There's a way bigger problem somewhere

697
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,560
It usually is a sign of something that someone could use some kind of assistance with

698
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,480
Is imposing fines on high schoolers who skip class all the time a good strategy or is it

699
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,680
overly punitive and counterproductive?

700
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,520
That is a fine conversation and I think that it's worth having

701
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Sure

702
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,680
Where it falls apart and why Alex is a terrible source of information about anything is the

703
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,680
point where he makes this about a kindergartner who had pneumonia being criminally charged

704
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
for being out of school

705
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,840
That's absurd and even according to the debatably too harsh rules that Texas operated under

706
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,560
at the time these truancy rules only applied to students in first through 12th grade

707
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,440
Alex is making up an extreme example of some anecdote that he's heard that's so severe

708
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,200
that it creates an image in the audience's head about this policy that he's looking to

709
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,600
demonize

710
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,340
He does this because that's easier than it would be to look over data and come up with

711
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,400
an argument against the policy as it exists

712
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,840
If you can just paint a dramatic overly emotionally charged picture in your audience's head you

713
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,520
don't have to do the work of making an actual point

714
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Yeah

715
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,600
Yeah that'd be like I remember whenever they took away three three a day practices when

716
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,220
I was in high school doing football and I and people were all like oh no you're making

717
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,040
the kids soft and all of that stuff and yeah that was probably the best decision to take

718
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,240
that away but this would be like if Alex got on and he was like yeah they said you only

719
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:33,000
have to do two and this coach he went ahead and did three anyways so they fucking killed

720
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,320
him they just killed him they murdered him on the spot they're not even following the

721
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,320
laws anymore

722
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
There's no due process

723
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
They just murdered the coach on the field

724
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Honestly my problem is the lack of due process

725
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,480
Exactly it's due process

726
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,640
So also by framing the issue that Alex is discussing like this he can sidestep the uncomfortable

727
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,880
reality that this kind of program disproportionately victimizes students without means

728
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,440
If you skip school and you're fined for it and you can't pay the fine what happens then?

729
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,000
A 2015 article on Buzzfeed discussed the case of an 11th grader in Texas who couldn't pay

730
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,200
and was quote offered jail credit at a rate of three hundred dollars per day

731
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,160
This is an incredibly flawed system and the conversation about it is done a disservice

732
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,960
by having Alex try to grandstand about imaginary kindergartners

733
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,560
Thankfully there are other adults discussing these sorts of issues in terms of reality

734
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,960
and adjustments were made no thanks to Alex's idiotic fake advocacy

735
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,440
Yeah yeah like it's such a huge issue too when you consider the school to prison pipeline

736
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,840
and how so many things are meant to criminalize children at an early enough age so you can

737
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,120
just keep them criminals forever and use them as fuel for the capitalist mill

738
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,080
But Alex clearly one only cares about white kids so there's a problem there

739
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,880
And two is just he's not dealing with any of the larger problem he's just like ah they're

740
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,880
criminalizing kindergartners and you're like oh fuck

741
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,520
I think that this has an interesting intersection of that school to prison pipeline idea which

742
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,920
is definitely real and an issue

743
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Totally

744
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,480
And also misguided but well intentioned ideas

745
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Yes

746
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,360
I do think that some people who may not be trying to criminalize children think they're

747
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,160
like okay if you're in high school and you skip school and you get a fine maybe you'll

748
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,800
be less likely to skip high school

749
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Sure

750
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,120
You know encouraging the right behavior the wrong way

751
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Yeah

752
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,600
I think that there is an element of that but even so no matter what no matter where more

753
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
of the weight lies

754
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Yeah

755
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Whatever Alex is doing is pointless

756
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah

757
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
And it doesn't help solve any of the problems

758
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,200
Yeah no and you can totally imagine like I can get inside the mind of the person who

759
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,240
offered the kid like oh so we'll give you credit for doing jail and that person was

760
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,020
probably thinking they were a genius like see you can't afford to pay it you just do

761
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
some jail

762
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,020
Right

763
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,240
I'm helping you out instead of somebody who should have been slapped in the face the moment

764
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
they had that thought

765
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Yeah it's

766
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
You know

767
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Yeah

768
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,960
The moment you're like hey how about do some time in jail instead of paying me the money

769
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,680
that doesn't make any sense for you to pay me in the first place

770
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,320
Yeah reading that kind of stuff it doesn't make a lot of sense why you would continue

771
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,080
down this road of this policy

772
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Yeah

773
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,880
Yeah anyway Alex mentioned a guy named Chris there and he's a guy named Chris Klicka who's

774
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,840
a lawyer for an organization that is a staunchly conservative Christian organization that is

775
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
all about homeschool

776
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,120
That's terrible that's terrible because I would listen to MC Chris Klicka instantly

777
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,160
I would listen to his mixtape

778
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
You would not

779
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,320
He drops that oh man

780
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,800
Here's what most of his songs are about

781
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay

782
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,560
Those who oppose us those who are anti-parent and the pro-child forces and I don't mean

783
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,040
that in a positive way they're they're trying to take our children through whatever means

784
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
they can

785
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,240
Well let's face it there's also a big move to take people's children to give it to homosexuals

786
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
Oh yeah

787
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Oh boy

788
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Oh yeah

789
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Okay

790
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Oh boy

791
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,960
So yeah this is this is the way this manifested in 2003

792
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,240
Yeah that's not as good of a mixtape as I was hoping

793
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
No

794
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,560
No no that was not the coloring book that was

795
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:22,800
Yeah so apparently this a lot of this stuff with these schools and the truancy and the

796
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,080
punishment and the that gets the social services involved and all this and part of it is that

797
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,840
there's a major push to take your kids and give them to homosexuals

798
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Sure sure

799
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Again

800
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:39,080
The homosexual agenda is running amok in 2003 because that is where the edge that the conservative

801
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
panic is playing

802
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,360
Yep yep these people are silly children

803
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Mm-hmm

804
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,440
They it's so weird to go back into the past and listen to these people and think you're

805
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,680
still allowed to talk aren't you people still listen to you you listen to that and you're

806
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,600
like really we're doing that back then yeah and you're still around

807
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
It's pretty wild

808
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
How?

809
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Mm-hmm

810
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,600
And it's just a conservative edge grift mill is just so endless

811
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Yep

812
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
And it's the same shit

813
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,080
Yep it's the same it's the same shit with just slightly different window dressing

814
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,800
Put different little ingredients into the same stew

815
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Yep

816
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Shit

817
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,880
So if you go to the hospital and you're gonna give birth

818
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Sure

819
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,120
These social service people

820
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,640
I'm gonna take the yeah no I'm gonna steal those kids and I'm gonna give them to homosexuals

821
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
I believe

822
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,880
They're very least gonna take the kids

823
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Yeah well

824
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,320
Yeah this is worse than the Soviet Union

825
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Oh yeah

826
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,000
You go and you have what's that already is here they're stalking the hospitals they've

827
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,960
got plants in there they get a cut and the people look ignorant man their kids are gone

828
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
That's right

829
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,200
I mean if you look ignorant man it's oh they walk in and go please sign here well what

830
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,600
are you doing just work with us everything will be all right you sign it they grab your

831
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,160
kid and go ha ha ha I mean literally

832
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,560
Uh-huh

833
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,960
I don't know and Alex does not expound on what it means to look ignorant in this in

834
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
this case

835
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Yeah I think we

836
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,240
I don't know I honestly don't know what he means it it does not make sense

837
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,280
It's true that's true it really doesn't make any sense

838
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Nope

839
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Nope

840
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,200
I just don't you know people listen to that and they don't hear people who are whining

841
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,600
like crazy people like this is insane like do you know what's going on now I went to

842
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,840
the DMV to re-up my license and instead of giving me a new license they shit in my mouth

843
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,960
they shit directly into my mouth

844
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Literally

845
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,300
The lid you know they put me down they held me down they had me on a gurney and somebody

846
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,320
shit directly into my mouth

847
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
I have documents

848
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,480
From it was they were on a ladder and it was it dropped for a while

849
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,840
I have a notarized witnesses signature

850
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah it's like what are you talking about right you sound ridiculous

851
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yeah

852
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You're children

853
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,360
Yeah yeah it's it's pretty wild and and when you talk about that it gets into like okay

854
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,160
well obviously Alex nowadays would call them the devil

855
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Yeah yeah

856
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,360
That's what he would do nowadays

857
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Yep

858
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,880
But in 2003 people who mix that stuff up

859
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,520
Oh they're they're

860
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
That's the poison pill

861
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
It's too far

862
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,000
That's how you make the Patriots and all this look bad

863
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah

864
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,240
A caller calls in and wants to talk about the social service workers and he thinks that

865
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
they are demons

866
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,040
Okay okay here we go

867
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,320
Now here is Alex's response

868
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
All right

869
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:29,740
When people hear statements that these people are diabolic they are of the devil just listening

870
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:36,720
to you talk about the guidelines when you went through your training proves that they

871
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,440
are your first three guidelines were totally unscriptural anti-scriptural it goes against

872
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,080
the creator and our instructions for life and they are of the devil and Alex you're

873
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,160
right on the money with that these people are

874
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,720
I'm gonna be honest I've covered them been around them and you know this is a news program

875
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,360
but when you're around them they really are demonic I mean I'm gonna be I mean these are

876
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,240
at least what I've seen these are degenerate scum that's all I can say about them

877
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,800
That's kind of measured

878
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Yeah

879
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,440
They're demonic that's an adjective this is a news show

880
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Isn't that interesting

881
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,920
I too appreciate that

882
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
He's trying to walk a line

883
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Yeah

884
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,840
He knows he knows that like I can't fucking present myself as a guy who's saying that

885
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,920
my enemies politically are devils

886
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,520
Yeah I won't be taken seriously I won't be taken seriously

887
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,360
Yeah I have some pretense of wanting to be respected

888
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
Yeah

889
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,880
Oh man I think I might be able to get a show on an actual network at some point

890
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,420
Yeah that is that is interesting and I mean what's kind of interesting about it is that

891
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:52,800
at the time I think he's right you couldn't be out and out the demons are coming to kill

892
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
us all

893
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah probably not

894
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
And people wouldn't take you seriously

895
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,600
Well I think Alex certainly didn't have a big enough career

896
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Right

897
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,760
He wasn't a big enough star to be able to absorb whatever blow might come from that

898
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,160
And then I would say probably right around what like the tea party movement whenever

899
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,760
they swept in 2010 that's really when it all was like started a change where you could

900
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,040
just talk about demons all all you want

901
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,640
Well I mean what is that Hunter S. Thompson quote when the going gets weird the weird

902
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
turn pro

903
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
The weird turn pro you got it

904
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,200
You know when the normal is the tea party on the right

905
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Yeah

906
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,400
You know whatever you are as Alex Jones

907
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Gotta go weirder

908
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,560
Gotta escalate a little bit

909
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
Yep

910
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:36,320
Yeah I don't know I obviously don't know for sure if that is when sort of more overt conversation

911
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,920
about demons and shit happen

912
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
Yeah

913
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,720
Because I don't think it did I think it was later

914
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
You think so?

915
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,400
Yeah I think that we did not see nearly as much these people are the fucking devil when

916
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,840
we were looking at 2015

917
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,200
That's true that is true

918
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,080
So I think I think it might be more recent than that

919
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Yeah

920
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:01,120
But I find I find this glimpse at 2003 really really interesting and this next clip I think

921
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,000
Alex has to stop himself

922
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Interesting

923
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,160
From saying that these people are demons

924
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
Okay

925
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,960
And this clip would not stick out to me at all if I didn't know what he does now

926
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:18,960
So so what you're telling me is that like a demon trying to get out he wants to call

927
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,240
these people demons okay just just putting that out there

928
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,240
And so imagine being at the hospital you've already got your four other kids with family

929
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:36,120
and friends you're there your babies are hanging on for life and literal I'm sorry creatures

930
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:42,040
show up and are cornering you with their beady eyes what parent frankly what parent wouldn't

931
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,320
probably fluff out at that point

932
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
Doesn't that sound

933
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,840
Literal demons he was about to say literal demons

934
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
He was

935
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:55,360
About to say literal demons I'm screaming at you through the future you I mean you were

936
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,720
there the whole time

937
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,520
Doesn't that sound almost like someone had told him dude don't fucking say that you're

938
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,680
fighting the devil we need like Ted Anderson told him there's no way we're gonna be able

939
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,120
to sell gold with you yelling about the literal devil because he said sorry he said literal

940
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,680
long pause sorry creatures

941
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:23,140
Yep wild and see this is this is a piece of evidence circumstantial obviously yes not

942
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:29,000
definitive but it works towards answering the question that I have had for a while which

943
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,800
is is Alex's I'm fighting the devil thing a new thing right or is it something that

944
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,520
was there underneath all along and he was pretending that that wasn't what he believed

945
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,600
and I kind of think that this looks like

946
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,240
It's not smoking gun but I'll be goddamn if it doesn't really sound like you're on the

947
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,240
right track gumshoe

948
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,640
It feels like that is at least a minor indication that Alex has this idea that his enemies are

949
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,280
literal demons yeah and he was covering that belief up for the sake of appearing respectable

950
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,520
yeah yeah and I'm interested to see if there's any more flickers of that indications but

951
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,960
that made me that's laugh really hard

952
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,320
perks your ears up yeah yeah but isn't it interesting too that like that clip would

953
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:22,080
not be at all it wouldn't sound off any alarms unless you knew that 18 years later yeah screaming

954
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,200
about literal demons everywhere all the time all the time yeah that's so ridiculous yeah

955
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,240
I'm oh that's annoying I don't I don't like that he's a liar I'm mad at him in the past

956
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,200
for lying to me Dan you should be up front if you think your enemies are literal demons

957
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,720
you should tell me yeah front yeah I think it would be more responsible to the audience

958
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:49,360
yeah because don't you don't you tell me that you're hiding that there are literal demons

959
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,800
everywhere because you're supposed to be the truth teller right on your own show yeah and

960
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,040
you're pulling back whenever you know that literal demons are killing everybody don't

961
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,620
Trojan horse the literal demons at the talk of like the Federal Reserve and all this stuff

962
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:08,960
that's not fair to the audience totally anyway yeah Alex is a guy who's against the Iraq

963
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,080
war totally totally against the Iraq war but since it weirdly fine with the idea of deposing

964
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,120
Saddam Hussein in this next I mean you gotta I tell you what I just got I just I can't

965
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:24,280
believe it I can't believe people we had operation Iraqi freedom okay great Saddam's a thug great

966
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,080
can't we have operation American freedom yeah why not you know Bush wanted to turn all this

967
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,640
around here but he didn't he put more funding into the Department of Education all these

968
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,760
other groups and I can't we we have the conservative the real conservative backbone to do it how

969
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,320
Chris do we force the Republicans that control everything now to finally get rid of abortion

970
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:52,560
to finally just acts these social workers how do we do it so apparently we want operation

971
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,820
American freedom right in the mold of operation Iraqi free exactly and that involves getting

972
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:06,320
rid of social workers right abortion there we go okay we did it that is a complex series

973
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,160
of steps you need to get to those three things being related to each other at all I don't

974
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,600
like it no I don't like it I don't like these callers I don't like this guest no no I think

975
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:25,120
these people are literal demons no no I've been hiding that belief this whole time so

976
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:31,240
this caller has some bad things to say sure I'll just say bad sure sure sitting here listening

977
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:36,880
to Alex you asked him a few of the questions he answered for me one aspect about this demonic

978
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,040
side of it one place in the scripture where Messiah got very angry and that was when with

979
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,520
children he said you suffer these children to come to me for such as the kingdom of heaven

980
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,720
and these people are not letting them come to him they're like doing what Alex said they

981
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:59,000
learning Islam and all kinds of a multi cultural crap it's called math Virginia Chris I'm in

982
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,960
Virginia weird weird question that's a very strange thing yeah that's a very strange thing

983
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,760
to add on hey hey where are you by the way yeah I think that this is a bit more anti-Muslim

984
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,080
than I expected it to be yeah because I think the presentation that Alex has is very much

985
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:21,840
like and I had no problem with Islam or anything like and I think I got the sense that his

986
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,680
his anti-islam stuff kind of escalated yeah and to be fair you know that's coming from

987
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:35,800
his caller yeah but yeah yeah that doesn't surprise me I'm I would be Islam in the schools

988
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,640
saying that Islam is just multicultural crap yeah like it's what the fuck is this freedom

989
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,240
prize just yeah whatever you want just just fucking shut up yeah so this caller wants

990
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,880
to know where in Virginia Chris's organization is and they Alex has to stop now I'll tell

991
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,400
you they told my son to find the square root of something roots are in the backyard my

992
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,420
friend that's devil worship that's what I'm telling you right now go find the square root

993
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:06,760
of Vega get digging why don't you go find a switch so yeah they chat about where they

994
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:13,680
are in Virginia and Alex has to be like guys what are we doing why did you ask him so unfortunately

995
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,840
they end up stopping that very pleasant conversation it does sound nice to take another call that

996
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:24,280
might have been a mistake oh very good guest you got on there today I wanted to ask him

997
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:30,300
a couple of questions because I know that there is that the when we won when an American

998
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,600
becomes a 14th amendment citizen our status of law changes because we are no longer sovereign

999
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,200
freemen and have exercised sovereignty are talking about privileges instead of rights

1000
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,440
and you only have about a minute left what's your other question well I wanted to ask him

1001
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,000
how he approaches the legal defense standpoint for you know from that particular thing he

1002
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,520
got asked this question a year ago on this show and he said from a constitutional perspective

1003
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,560
correct that's right that does not answer the question no no it seems like there's a

1004
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,680
fair amount of sovereign citizen callers at this point I like this career it is it is

1005
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:10,160
funny because it seems like he also really doesn't like them the well I think he recognizes

1006
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,680
how silly a lot of the arguments are and how they make it look bad what he's doing at the

1007
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,640
same time he's making a show that is essentially catering directly to sovereign citizens yeah

1008
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,040
yeah there's a lot of yeah and actually there I didn't have any clips of this because it

1009
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,000
was just too all over the place but a good maybe half hour of this episode is dedicated

1010
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,340
to Alex arguing with a caller about the Republic of Texas sure there's this idea that like

1011
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,160
Texas should secede and he's like yeah I tried to support all that stuff but everybody kept

1012
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:47,340
declaring themselves the president it's really funny but at the same time there was no way

1013
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:53,080
to cut clips in a way that would make it work it's so funny it's so all right fine I could

1014
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:58,100
just declare myself a president maybe I'm a general I don't know who to get in touch

1015
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:04,940
with and he keeps calling them fruitcakes I he called he uses the term fruitcakes to

1016
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:10,520
describe the Republic of Texas people like maybe five or six times yeah very specific

1017
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,820
wording yeah made me think maybe he has a personal beef with somebody it's it is it's

1018
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:22,640
kind of funny it's it's a little bit like somebody like starting a roller rink and then

1019
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:29,320
like just hating people who roller skate yeah or like hating hating people who use like

1020
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:36,760
uh inline skates yeah yeah yeah this is a four wheel only yes yeah yeah the law says

1021
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:44,220
I have to let you skate okay this is America not according to the Magna Carta what so Chris

1022
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:50,200
Chris leaves he was not that much of an interesting guest just kind of like very reactionary against

1023
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:56,760
social workers pro homeschooling did not drop a mixtape did not yeah warned everyone about

1024
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,920
the homosexuals come to take your children sure sure very different cool so Alex gets

1025
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,760
to some headlines and this one is a load of shit we're back live we're going into a world

1026
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,720
where you're a good decent person you're an enemy of the state because you're not you're

1027
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,180
not a criminal they can't trust you you might fight what they're doing you might fight the

1028
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:24,240
world they're setting up that's right that's what happens when the evil are in control

1029
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:31,020
government lawyers say burglars need protection this is one independent by Robert Verkart

1030
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:36,960
legal affairs correspondent government lawyers trying to keep the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin

1031
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,460
behind bars will tell a high court judge tomorrow that burglars are members of the public who

1032
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:49,420
must be protected from violent house holders so Alex is misrepresenting this case that

1033
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,680
he's covering to make it appear that it the system is now just out to protect criminals

1034
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,520
and punish the good people which is code for white Christians hey if people aren't committing

1035
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,920
crimes you can't trust him so this is an article about Tony Martin a man from the UK who shot

1036
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,480
at two young men who were breaking into his house which resulted in the death of one of

1037
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,440
them the issue here isn't that Tony was wrong to practice self-defense it's that the court

1038
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,280
didn't believe that he was acting in self-defense in the shooting the incident happened in 1999

1039
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,400
at which point Martin did not have a license for the shotgun he used in the shooting problem

1040
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,320
number one he'd lost it five years prior when he supposedly found a man stealing apples

1041
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,440
from his orchard and proceeded to shoot at him leaving a hole in the man's vehicle hey

1042
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:35,060
a point of order you you know added to this was Martin's very publicly known hatred of

1043
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,340
the Romani people who which was referenced in a Guardian article from 2000 quote apart

1044
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:45,160
from thieves Martin's pet hate was gypsies nor which crown court heard that the farmer

1045
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,600
had talked of putting gypsies in the middle of a field surrounding it with barbed wire

1046
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,120
and machine gunning them the article goes on to say that Martin had said quote Hitler

1047
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,080
was right about these people and also points out that Martin's uncle Andrew Fontaine was

1048
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,840
one of the founders of the straight-up fascist National Front right right right so he was

1049
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:09,120
a Nazi the prosecution the problem here the prosecution successfully argued that the shooting

1050
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,920
was not an act of self-defense but that Martin had laid in wait and shot these intruders

1051
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,020
without first giving a warning this wasn't the sort of case that Alex is portraying it

1052
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,560
to be where the burglar is hurt by someone practicing legitimate self-defense and then

1053
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,200
sues the homeowner for it it's a clearly unhinged lunatic with a history of shooting at people

1054
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,580
with a clearly racist past using deadly force against intruders to his home who had not

1055
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:37,920
presented a mortal danger to him and according to the British courts that was not an acceptable

1056
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,200
use of self-defense yeah I'm gonna go with yeah yeah so I don't know I Alex tries to

1057
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,000
play this game where it's like yeah you know if someone breaks into your house and they

1058
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,240
slip on a banana peel they can sue you or something like no they can't no no they really

1059
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,920
really can't you have to kind of go way out of your way to be the one who's convicted

1060
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:03,600
of a crime in that scenario and that's what this guy did yeah if someone is like presenting

1061
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,840
a danger to you you do have the right to self-defense if someone does not and they're in your house

1062
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,960
you have to tell them to leave before you shoot them dead I would try I would I would

1063
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:21,880
open with excuse me that would be yeah so Alex has some very interesting similar problems

1064
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:29,400
in his life in 2003 as he does in the present sure one is that boy these calls just don't

1065
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:37,680
work out the difference though is in 2003 Alex could handle it sure grace yeah let's

1066
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:46,840
just go ahead and talk to go ahead and talk to yes Mike in Illinois and then tip Oh Tim

1067
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:58,960
in Texas is next okay well you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna talk to Mike in Illinois

1068
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:07,160
Mike in Illinois are you there okay he's not there who did you want me to go to Tim in

1069
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:14,800
Texas all righty you're on the air Tim Alex how you doing pretty good I quit wow wow

1070
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,640
that is such a normal that's a breath of fresh air just being like oh this is a minor setback

1071
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,240
and we're off to the next one I quit not a big deal we're just going to rebroadcast

1072
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,240
this is annoying but hey everybody bear with me yeah that's the vibe that I got there everybody

1073
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,280
bear with me as opposed to doing a live radio show all failed me yeah we're doing live radio

1074
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,240
show sometimes there's a little bit of a hiccup this happens yeah that's normal that's called

1075
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:47,360
professionally Alex present-day not normal no no no so you know there was that talk with

1076
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:55,960
the Texas folks about how they're all weirdos and sure one's the president yeah but everybody

1077
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:03,720
can secede if they want sure Alex is very pro secession natural 2003 yeah Indiana you

1078
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,620
know has the right to secede it's not just Texas or Hawaii Texas and Hawaii have stronger

1079
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:13,780
cases because from the beginning they never signed the contracts but but but but still

1080
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,960
sir it's a Civil War question they will send federal troops in they will lay seas they

1081
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,620
will burn cities and the average person people were a hundred times more educated about real

1082
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:33,620
politics and liberty in the 1860s and they are now that's correct in the 1860s the Confederacy

1083
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:38,220
was full of New World Order moles was designed to lose from the beginning responded by the

1084
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,900
British to break the country up both sides were controlled in that that's true so apparently

1085
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:52,120
the the confederacy was full of globalists I do I do like how people who study the Civil

1086
00:56:52,120 --> 00:57:00,040
War so obsessively change their story all the time quite quite frequently usually when

1087
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,880
you study something you refine it and the story becomes clearer and the picture is easier

1088
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:11,080
to understand and you have a full awareness of what's going on New World Order moles whereas

1089
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,300
it seems as though their study of the Civil War involves just rewriting it to whatever

1090
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:22,540
it is you want it to be at any given point in time even if it's the same day what if

1091
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,580
it's like you what if you find something that sounds more fun how can you be global how

1092
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:32,980
can you be Confederate royalty if your royalty is just infiltrated by New World Order globalist

1093
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:38,540
it's not like everybody was New World Order and how is it possible for everyone to be

1094
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:45,540
just so well informed when the national rate of reading is like 10% listen it was the New

1095
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,700
World Order was run in the Confederacy okay fair enough uh look dude false flag Civil

1096
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:55,260
War that's pretty much what he said yes yeah he said it was a false flag Civil War everything

1097
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:05,100
is fake nothing is real except Alex's conviction to the truth yes yes yeah yep yep wow oh boy

1098
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,620
Confederate false flag Civil War yep should have seen it coming I should have so there's

1099
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,340
a commercial for the Genesis Communications Network sure and I think that this I just

1100
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:18,020
wanted to play this a little bit of it because it sounds really weird is mainstream media

1101
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,420
telling you everything you should know about the war on terror what is our real interest

1102
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,980
in Iraq and Saddam Hussein who stands to gain if we give up our freedoms in the name of

1103
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:32,020
national security who's behind the manipulation of our financial markets and why we're the

1104
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,940
jury you be the judge we're the GCN radio network are you tired of being lied to by

1105
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:42,380
mainstream media well so are we and we're doing something about it we're the jury you're

1106
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:50,540
the judge uh what does that mean we've already decided and you have to pass the sentencing

1107
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:59,340
who's the executioner uh double back to we again also the jury doesn't talk are you like

1108
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:06,740
the prosecution metaphor sucks uh your honor the jury has something to say and they say

1109
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:12,340
no no the jury does not the audience is the jury you do not get to be the jury we're

1110
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:19,660
the attorneys you're the jury somebody on the jury just stands up hey I think I can

1111
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,540
do a better job of this lawyer and shit get this prosecutor out of here somebody wrote

1112
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:27,440
that because like judge jury and executioner is an expression it's like this sounds pretty

1113
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:35,980
good yeah uh didn't think about it for even one second no no using good job GCN Ted probably

1114
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:41,860
wrote that so Alex comes back and he's got to be in his bonnet because there's a holiday

1115
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:49,340
that bush right uh-huh George W the evil one yeah he's got this holiday well I mean they're

1116
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,660
both evil he's got this holiday the whole family's dude honest it's not about them it's

1117
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,800
about this holiday about the holiday listen to this one neo colonialism is the new world

1118
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,600
order and they're coming right out with this in mainstream news oh don't worry the White

1119
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:07,660
House is going to have loyalty day loyalty to the government day to be celebrated in

1120
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:14,140
all the schools and nationwide that's terrifying it says our children will be taught that the

1121
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:19,180
nation is a force for good in the world extending hope and freedom to others being part of the

1122
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:25,020
Imperial Army to grab all natural resources and enslave everyone's children sure loyalty

1123
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,420
day coach and the person that sent me this email and I went to the White House and got

1124
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,700
the actual article that written by the White House it said when do I get my black boots

1125
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:38,200
and dagger you know like the Nazis right right right right but it sounds real good loyalty

1126
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,540
learning that we're this this good force in the world now loyalty to the government so

1127
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:47,620
two things that jumped out at me there like the first is that in 2003 Alex is clearly

1128
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:52,500
fully aware of the colonial exploitation that is part of our country's history yeah he completely

1129
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,560
denies totally in the present and the second thing I was thinking is like man he would

1130
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,220
be totally fine with a holiday called loyalty day if it was like a nationalist extreme right-wing

1131
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,860
government everyone had to be loyal yeah yeah on loyalty day we have a big military parade

1132
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:13,260
oh I love loyalty days my favorite day there's bombs yeah if it was his thing what a what

1133
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:18,100
a fucked up thing to have a loyalty day do you know how that's so fucked up it would

1134
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:24,660
be like if every morning kids had to go to school and recite some sort of yeah every

1135
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:30,020
morning that would be so fucked up be very weird yeah loyalty day is just one yeah also

1136
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:34,100
I would be remiss if I didn't point out that loyalty day is a holiday that's existed since

1137
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:39,980
1921 and it was an attempt to replace the communist leaning May Day or as it's also

1138
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,640
known International Workers Day that holiday marks the date of the Haymarket riot which

1139
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,060
was something that the American government in the early 1900s was eager to not glorify

1140
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:55,420
we don't want to talk about workers uniting we are still mad there's a weekend so yeah

1141
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,700
they didn't want to endorse workers rights which of course was communism and so there

1142
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:05,360
was this idea of loyalty day coming in on May 1st to take over for May Day yep the holiday

1143
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:10,220
itself didn't catch on until 1955 during the Cold War Red Scare when Eisenhower made it

1144
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:15,080
an official holiday in the United States and every president since 1958 has recognized

1145
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:20,040
and proclaimed the holiday see if you can guess who said this quote now therefore I

1146
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,220
Donald J Trump president of the United States of America do hereby proclaim May 1st 2017

1147
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:30,180
as loyalty day this loyalty day I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate

1148
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,220
ceremonies in our schools and other public places including the recitation of the Pledge

1149
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:38,460
of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America I also call upon all government

1150
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,180
officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings and grounds

1151
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:51,420
on that day who said it ah I gotta go with Clinton do so close Trump oh every time yeah

1152
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:56,260
I thought you were trying to trick me nope it was not a trick so the very ideology that

1153
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:01,080
created Alex Jones is the same ideology that created the idea of a holiday called loyalty

1154
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,380
day to express loyalty to the United States in the face of a communist menace exactly

1155
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,860
Alex understands so little about the hysteria and insanity that created his political identity

1156
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:16,020
that here he is rambling about the direct result of his ideological forefathers and

1157
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,280
pretending it's some kind of an evil event that Bush wanted to create he's much more

1158
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,460
palatable and seems happier in 2003 and he doesn't freak out when he can't get to a caller

1159
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:29,900
but he's still a total idiot yeah it's almost as if conservative reactionary ideology is

1160
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:35,420
essentially an ouroboros that creates an outrage and then later on gets outraged when they're

1161
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:40,780
outraged created a thing for them to get outraged about yeah and as I understand in 2017 there

1162
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:45,460
was like some people who were you know like Trump is creating loyalty day is a fucked

1163
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:50,780
up holiday the pledge of allegiance yeah but if you trick yourself into thinking that this

1164
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,940
is the first one ever or whatever or you present it that way then you deprive all the context

1165
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:01,640
of it yeah and you're just using it as a as a prop yeah and it's it also seems almost

1166
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:08,020
a little insulting I think to to imagine that in whatever year it is that was the first

1167
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:13,880
year they thought of loyalty day listen we've had plenty of fascists run in America for

1168
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,960
a long time they've thought of loyalty day every time workers tried to unite they were

1169
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,940
like okay here's what we got to do pledge loyalty the to the 120 hour work week like

1170
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:29,180
that's what they were doing yeah it's the it's the byproduct of anti-communist freak

1171
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:38,540
out yeah and so is Alex yeah exactly yeah so stupid yep so one of the other differences

1172
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:43,940
that I found when I was looking at this episode between present-day Alex and back then is

1173
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:48,980
he seems like to understand that movies aren't real at least a little bit interesting folks

1174
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:53,940
we're in the twilight zone somebody listen to me it's it's like in the 1950s version

1175
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,840
of the body snackers you know where the doctor goes to town they've taken over he bust out

1176
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:05,920
he's running he's in traffic up the highway wake up they're after you there we're in danger

1177
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:16,700
somebody listen to us oh it's so scary it's like that yes yes it's similar to this it

1178
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:22,660
is not a reference the plan and they were not telling it to you by releasing that movie

1179
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:27,940
yeah yeah it's uh that's just a corollary yeah there's a disconnect between this idea

1180
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:35,180
that's represented in media and reality as opposed to them merging together in some weird

1181
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:43,100
to use an Alex Jones word gestalt yeah yeah it's nice to hear people know the difference

1182
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:48,980
between movies and realities it's comforting yeah at least because when I listen to this

1183
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:56,780
I can be like all right we all agree that we breathe air yeah that's there the time

1184
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:03,940
moves yes entropy is real yeah okay and that's comforting because I don't feel bad in the

1185
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:09,520
present I definitely don't it is it is a real bummer going into the past and finding things

1186
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,460
that are more positive than the present because you're like you want to live in a place where

1187
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:19,060
hope exists but when we do this we're like man isn't that nice and then you remember

1188
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:23,460
where it goes and you're like oh it could happen it could happen to you it could happen

1189
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:29,100
to all of us at any point in time you could just forget how movies work yeah that is that

1190
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:34,140
is a little bit scary it's it's humbling you know there but for the grace of uh literal

1191
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:39,460
demons go high we should all be careful to not hide uh that we secretly think that we're

1192
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:45,060
fighting demons if you think you are fighting demons tell someone yes you try to keep it

1193
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:51,460
a secret for too long you turn into Alex Alex in the present yeah we've got a perfect example

1194
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:56,820
oh boy you are what you pretend to be gonna figure out a way to make an infomercial out

1195
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:02,540
of that lesson not sure or not an infomercial like uh sure what am I thinking of uh psa

1196
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:10,380
that's it yeah psa yep yep so Alex believes that the us is evil sure but he loves the

1197
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,000
united states there is a problem there I was listening to this next clip and I just got

1198
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,980
confused this is a such an evil evil country I love this country but when you really face

1199
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:26,040
how bad things have gotten and how there's this icky facade everything's good mom and

1200
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:31,400
apple pie patriotism it's not real it's as fake as those plastic chinese flags it's as

1201
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,420
fake as the boxes that said made in usa and st louis when bush gave that speech with the

1202
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:44,220
made in china taped over it is a rotten facade under it is maggots and rotten meat the stench

1203
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:52,420
of this thing is just everywhere it's freaking me out we gotta warn people we gotta stand

1204
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:58,740
up for america we gotta fight with this country I just love this country so much I love my

1205
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:04,620
family so much and I can't believe we let it get to this when Alex fake cries in 2003

1206
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,660
he's doing a Clinton impression I was I was like is that Phil Hartman doing Clinton yeah

1207
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:15,340
is that a wonder I really heard Phil Hartman there yeah when he's faking emotion it sounds

1208
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:23,340
like a bad Clinton now bill I think that you're doing a great job yeah we gotta warn people

1209
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:26,920
it's ridiculous it's so silly so I thought that was weird and I thought that was like

1210
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:33,980
a completely artificial presentation of emotion and sincerity totally but I started to think

1211
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:41,500
like okay so there's some there's some patriotism and apple pie and all this is is a facade

1212
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:47,580
yeah and underneath it is just rotting maggots and what have you sure what do you love them

1213
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:57,620
like what do you think he loves it's right there in the title if he's saying that like

1214
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:05,240
this country is evil right right but he loves it right but it's a rotten thing like a fake

1215
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:10,740
lid on it yeah isn't he is he just saying I love the lid yeah he likes the lid make

1216
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:14,420
that why not make the whole plane out of the black box Dan what do you what do you not

1217
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,740
understand I don't fully understand what it is that like he's hoping hoping to save if

1218
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:26,640
it's rotting underneath with a fake yeah it seems like yeah you'd expose the you take

1219
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,900
the lid off and you'd realize oh yeah maybe we should go I don't need I don't need what's

1220
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:37,940
in this rotting it seems weird I don't yeah I don't feel fully that I understand yeah

1221
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:43,140
yet from listening to this like what it is that's like what is what isn't rotten totally

1222
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,940
to be saved right I would guess that it's guns sure property rights loyalty to your

1223
01:09:48,940 --> 01:10:00,740
country no absolutely not not yet yeah hating school sure sure sure whites only yeah yeah

1224
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:06,980
I don't I don't have a full grasp of like Alex's entire policy set in 2003 yeah like

1225
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:13,260
I think I understand a lot of stuff through the prism of like listening to thousands of

1226
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:17,120
hours of his other content but like there there's gonna be some stuff that's gonna be

1227
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,520
surprising and I don't want to make too many assumptions yeah you know I was I was listening

1228
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:28,100
to that clip and thinking about all the stories of people who listen to him at this time period

1229
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:34,580
and we're we're kind of drawn in by that and I was thinking about my understanding of politics

1230
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:41,180
at that time like as the Iraq war is going on it totally felt like I was the first person

1231
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:46,620
to discover how evil America was totally it was like I had been told all of this stuff

1232
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:51,820
all the way up until I'm 16 years old and then the Iraq war happens and they're like

1233
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:56,480
maybe you should read what real history is and not your school stuff and then I it really

1234
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,740
did feel like oh man but this is before red pilling became the meme that it was but it

1235
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:05,980
did feel like that and then you listen to Alex go like this is a rotting thing and you

1236
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:12,460
can you can really get that sense of like yeah that's how I feel yeah I don't have sophisticated

1237
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:17,740
political opinions yet I just know that this is some bullshit yeah yeah you know on a on

1238
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:25,260
a pretty surface level there is a presentation that is almost perfect yes for exploiting

1239
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:30,700
disillusionment yes and and that is definitely a period where there's a lot of people who

1240
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:37,100
are feeling alienated and disillusioned from uh what they had the world as they had been

1241
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,700
brought up to understand it totally and I think that you and I though we're a few years

1242
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:46,580
apart we're both you know a certain men of a certain age when the Iraq war sure sure

1243
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:52,260
we were not wild hogs yet we were youth yes and and that's that's a period where people

1244
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,260
are generally they go through a period of disillusionment of course of course and to

1245
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:02,740
have that compounded by something as something that should disillusion and yeah yeah yeah

1246
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:08,340
yeah it's it's it's something where you know those feelings that you're having you could

1247
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:15,280
see them mirrored in something like Alex talking about the the rotten core in the facade over

1248
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:20,780
it yeah you could you could see that and you could gravitate towards that yeah it's interesting

1249
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:24,580
to think about how much goes along with it that you might not realize that you're also

1250
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:29,540
accepting yeah of course like that homosexuals want to take your children worse absolutely

1251
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:34,260
yeah yeah because you that's how liberals got tricked into thinking he wasn't I mean

1252
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:40,020
you're driving you you're listening to this you're you're on a 20-minute drive right you

1253
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:46,960
pop on Infowars because you're like I'm disillusioned and this guy's pretty funny and and you only

1254
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,220
get 20 minutes where he's doing the anti-Iraq war stuff and you don't listen to the half

1255
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:55,900
hour he does with the gays are coming to steal your children you know and you're like arguing

1256
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:01,780
about the Republic of Texas yeah exactly like you you could totally be sucked into that

1257
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:08,500
and and it's it's much more believable like as like the the notion of like him having

1258
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,420
a large audience if you listen to it in the presence like yeah fuck what in God's name

1259
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,700
yeah it's much more believable when you look back at this totally not petulantly having

1260
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:23,340
outbursts all the time right the presentation of emotion is generally within like where

1261
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:29,360
he would want it to be to make a point yes yeah and he's still got that dynamic range

1262
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:34,220
of like he can get it up there high and he can yeah but it's it's not out of control

1263
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:39,980
yeah yeah although it is silly that when he's feigning sincerity he sounds like Clinton

1264
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:45,940
that is a little bit weird I don't know yeah that was that was very strange yeah so you

1265
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:51,460
know the Civil War was a false flag we we learned this yeah and it also it turns out

1266
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:56,460
that you know in grocery stores they're putting in the self-checkout line sure right that's

1267
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:01,720
how they steal your children right well eventually okay but first they're going to transition

1268
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,340
these self-checkout lanes into fingerprint scanners where you're gonna have to have some

1269
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:10,100
sort of a mark of the beast or whatever in order to buy groceries we're never not gonna

1270
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:14,020
do mark of the beast I want to be done with mark of the beast can't we do about I'm telling

1271
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,920
you we just got to be done with you can't do it they're gonna do this biometric scanning

1272
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,940
stuff at the grocery store and then you're gonna have some sort of a Christian who's

1273
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:29,020
gonna go bomb biometric sure natural it will be a false flag right right this is presaging

1274
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:35,740
our people are going to bomb 5g towers and it's going to be a false flag yep yeah this

1275
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:42,800
is not inevitable but you have to lead the charge you have to go boycott H-E-B and Kroger

1276
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,940
and Safeway when they put thumb scanners in for self-checkout lanes because they put in

1277
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,620
the self-checkout lane first then they tear out all the lanes and make you thumb scan

1278
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:56,460
it's already happening Home Depot already starting it we're still doing self-checkers

1279
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:00,140
and about six months later they put in the thumb scanner then they get rid of all the

1280
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:03,740
employees make you do your own bagging but that's a sub reason why we're against it what

1281
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:09,020
really against this because of the taxation the control the tracking if you go and you

1282
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:13,980
fight it now we can stop it you wait till it goes in everywhere folks then it's then

1283
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,340
the government's gonna blow stuff up and claim there's a Christian right-wing group it's

1284
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:21,580
against the biometrics and so if you're protesting it you must be really with this group that's

1285
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,580
gonna be the plan there I hate to give them ideas but they already have the idea I can

1286
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:32,860
tell where they're going that's what they're gonna do you're against pro-abortion stuff

1287
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:37,080
it turned out the feds have done all the bombings sure it's always the government one guy actually

1288
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:42,460
did some that admitted he did it and we don't know if he's mind control or not oh okay okay

1289
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:49,180
we're talking about uh sure I don't know who could be anybody just talking about there

1290
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:53,380
but like yeah okay so all all the abortion clinic attacks that have happened it's all

1291
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:57,020
the facts except for that one guy and we don't know if he's my we don't even know if he's

1292
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:02,500
mind controlled so it could still be the feds that one's on the fence oh boy that's as close

1293
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,900
as I get to admitting that it could possibly not be a false flag everything that was on

1294
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:11,540
the foot everything's fucking fake that's that's the thing that I find really exhausting

1295
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:17,740
about this uh this glimpse into 2003 is like everybody is a fucking communist and everything

1296
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:24,260
is fake yeah he's talking about like all kinds of folks like uh uh joe scarbrough is an ultra

1297
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:31,140
communist well that's that's turned out to be a prophetic uh prediction there who's the

1298
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:35,980
other person to be labeled a communist on this episode fuck I can't remember it was

1299
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:42,620
another it was another right wing guy I can't get over the pettiness of like look oh no

1300
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:48,100
it was chris matthews chris matthews well but he's he's an ultra commie obviously no

1301
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,820
I just love the like they're putting finger scanners in there they're gonna do all this

1302
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:57,140
shit second problem I don't want to do my own bagging side issue that's a side issue

1303
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:01,460
I'm putting that in there and no it seems petty right now compared to the fingerprint

1304
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:07,860
scanner that is not the patriot's main complaint it is a complaint we do not want to bag our

1305
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:16,180
own groceries it is inconvenient I always put the eggs in first I only ever get 10 eggs

1306
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:24,300
I've never been trained on how to bag things these people have training um yeah silly also

1307
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:29,660
great prediction uh that they put in the self-checkout stuff and then the next thing is a thumb scanner

1308
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:33,940
I don't think that I've ever scanned my thumb at the grocery store I've never scanned my

1309
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:38,900
thumb at a grocery store I would I would almost prefer it to scanning a credit card eight

1310
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:44,440
years eight years on self-checkout uh pretty ubiquitous yeah thumb scanning not even really

1311
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,340
in the conversation I don't think in terms of and nobody you know most people's problem

1312
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:52,420
with uh self-checkout line isn't doing your own bagging it's when you get stuck behind

1313
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:56,140
somebody who shouldn't be using the self-checkout when they have too many items well not just

1314
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:03,940
that whenever they're clearly uh not bagging material if you will wow yeah um I don't have

1315
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:10,420
many complaints about self-checkout I kind of take everything in stride sure you do so

1316
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,420
yeah everything's false flag uh there's gonna be Christian groups that are gonna bomb biometric

1317
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:18,440
places and it's gonna be all fake all these predictions have been fantastic yeah Alex

1318
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,000
Jones is constantly right about everything I'm gonna be real mad if the when we do start

1319
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,020
getting those biometric chips because we there are there are biometric things in little augments

1320
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:32,660
that you can have you can put little electromagnets in your fingers and stuff like that yes sooner

1321
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:37,620
or later we're going to have an implantable chip of some sort and some that are available

1322
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:44,060
now I know but like one that will be uh that final that like ipod moment of an implantable

1323
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:49,260
chip you know where all of a sudden this thing didn't exist and then it's everywhere and

1324
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:54,220
it should be called the mark of the beast I think it's possible that that that technology

1325
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:59,700
will go along that line but it's equally possible that it doesn't I don't know I don't know

1326
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:03,900
I don't know if there will be an ipod moment like that I don't know but it better be called

1327
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:08,900
the mark of the beast we got Soylent that's real yeah and we don't talk about Soylent

1328
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,780
start uh I don't know we gotta find out but it became real so why not the mark of the

1329
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:16,180
beast you gotta find that episode of Alex's show he's gotta be furious about that would

1330
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:20,800
he be furious about that yeah that would be fun definitely okay next thing you know this

1331
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,540
guy is gonna be starting a business where he uh has robot trash trucks go get the bodies

1332
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:28,580
any moment now they're gonna have implantable chips and it's gonna be called the mark of

1333
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:32,820
the beast listen yeah I've been taking the piss out of Alex a little bit on this episode

1334
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:39,100
really just sort of mocking yeah some of this is stupid it is but you have to recognize

1335
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:45,100
Alex Jones is a hero and in this last clip we learn about something that maybe isn't

1336
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:53,500
in the history books but it should be Alex saved a lot of lives you laugh you laugh okay

1337
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:59,300
okay where'd we where'd we save all these lives Dan you gotta stand up for this country

1338
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:04,180
and you gotta do it now they're trying to pass hate crimes legislation but it's just

1339
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:09,140
like the smallpox shot the truth was out on that grassroots the people refused and now

1340
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:13,660
the government launching a smallpox attack which they were planning to do guaranteed

1341
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:20,340
has been stalled they didn't do it Alex stopped a smallpox attack by publicizing information

1342
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:27,780
about smallpox attacks he stopped it you could I mean look he said it obviously it's true

1343
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:34,500
he saved so many lives I do you mock look sit here and you laugh at a hero some of the

1344
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:39,060
benefits of having a narcissistic personality disorder in that you can't invent your own

1345
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:45,380
crisis is to become the hero of hey it's amazing that is nice I've never felt like a hero well

1346
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:49,300
quite in the way of saving millions of people from a small time maybe you should pretend

1347
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:55,300
that you stopped I really think that would probably make me feel better yeah I mean if

1348
01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:01,020
you're doing a costume or like a pro-con kind of analysis of your career sure in the pros

1349
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:07,420
are things like that yeah I'm a hero yeah I'm a hero I've saved the world ten times

1350
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:12,260
over yeah no matter how many things you've bungled it's kind of easy to convince yourself

1351
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:18,380
it's a net positive fake it's all worth it because I saved the world from a smallpox

1352
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:23,380
attack yeah yeah love that kind of stuff nice yeah so this was this was a little bit of

1353
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:32,520
a fun trip 2003 in order to you know get our toes back in the water for for what will probably

1354
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:38,380
be an unpleasant present-day episode certainly disgusting nonsense spouted by a monster not

1355
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:44,300
looking forward to it yeah but it will happen it's gonna now I think if I had to sum this

1356
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:50,860
up like the reason that I thought that this episode was like really key sure it's that

1357
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:57,460
moment where Alex says literal sorry yeah yeah when he stops himself from saying literal

1358
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:05,980
demons it's so important it's right there yeah it is if we can demonstrate if we can

1359
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:10,340
find more instances of Alex stopping himself from talking about the literal devil in the

1360
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:16,160
past I'm I'm gonna my mind's gonna be blown so you're saying that you're gonna be the
