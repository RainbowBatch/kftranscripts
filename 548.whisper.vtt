00:27.120 --> 00:28.680
saying we are the bad guys

00:28.680 --> 00:30.000

00:56.880 --> 00:59.320
I love you

00:59.320 --> 01:01.360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
I'm Jordan

01:02.360 --> 01:05.160
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
Alex Jones

01:06.160 --> 01:07.440
Oh indeed we are, Dan

01:07.440 --> 01:08.440
Jordan

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440
Dan

01:09.440 --> 01:10.440
Jordan

01:10.440 --> 01:11.440
Quick question for ya

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
What's up?

01:12.440 --> 01:13.440
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
My bright spot today is that I have been vaccinated

01:14.440 --> 01:15.440
Yay!

01:15.440 --> 01:19.360
I got it all taken care of and I'm okay

01:19.360 --> 01:20.360
Yes indeed

01:20.360 --> 01:22.920
At this point, it was an interesting weekend

01:22.920 --> 01:29.400
I actually, I got my date wrong and ended up getting the vaccine on Saturday

01:29.400 --> 01:30.400
Yes, yep

01:30.400 --> 01:36.840
And I had heard from some people, I had some friends who have gotten shot and they've told

01:36.840 --> 01:40.720
me about like, oh, you know, hey, the next day it's pretty bad or like I had a little

01:40.720 --> 01:42.640
bit of, you know, some, some effects

01:42.640 --> 01:43.640
Sure, sure, sure

01:43.640 --> 01:50.400
And so you were kind enough to drive me to get the vaccine and I went and immediately

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
I was very cocky

01:51.400 --> 01:52.400
Oh!

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
I was so cocky

01:53.400 --> 01:57.520
I was very much like, I'm not even having any side effects, I wanna, I wanna be part

01:57.520 --> 01:59.560
of the team, everybody's suffering through this

01:59.560 --> 02:05.800
I appreciated very much the hubris of saying, you know, I feel like I'm not even a part

02:05.800 --> 02:08.720
of the communal experience of the side effects

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Yeah

02:09.720 --> 02:13.320
And so that evening, Saturday evening, Wrestlemania was on

02:13.320 --> 02:14.320
Right

02:14.320 --> 02:19.200
Saturday and Sunday and it was the return of the live audience at a Wrestlemania and

02:19.200 --> 02:25.560
there was this weird resonance between, I got vaccinated on the same day as Wrestlemania

02:25.560 --> 02:27.000
is having crowds return

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Sure, sure

02:28.000 --> 02:33.280
There was sort of a swell of emotion of like normal, pseudo normalcy

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
You can see the horizon

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
You can see the horizon over there

02:35.280 --> 02:36.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:36.280 --> 02:44.360
Yeah and so I was watching it and right at about 9.30 I got hit by a train of a fever

02:44.360 --> 02:51.680
Just a, just a locomotive and so I had a little bit of a fever through the end of Saturday

02:51.680 --> 02:56.960
night of Wrestlemania and went straight to bed and felt fine, Sunday really

02:56.960 --> 02:57.960
Yes

02:57.960 --> 02:58.960
But felt real stupid

02:58.960 --> 03:04.680
Well, I mean, Dan, you got your wish, you joined the communal experience of side effects

03:04.680 --> 03:05.680
Dan

03:05.680 --> 03:06.680
Yeah

03:06.680 --> 03:07.680
You and I are both fully vaccinated now

03:07.680 --> 03:11.680
I felt really stupid cause I was like looking at my texts to you and I was like, there's

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
no side effects

03:12.680 --> 03:14.680
I'm fine

03:14.680 --> 03:15.840
It was very funny

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
I'm a superman

03:16.840 --> 03:21.200
It was very funny, I didn't feel any like resentment towards you, I was just sitting

03:21.200 --> 03:25.220
there going like, oh, I've heard some people don't have side effects, maybe Dan will be

03:25.220 --> 03:26.220
one of the ones

03:26.220 --> 03:29.320
In the back of my mind I was like, something's gonna happen

03:29.320 --> 03:33.840
Yeah, it wasn't too bad too, like it wasn't even like a really bad fever, I'm just kind

03:33.840 --> 03:34.840
of weak

03:34.840 --> 03:35.840
Yeah

03:35.840 --> 03:42.360
I'm very soft and a little bit of a fever and I was just like, I need to put on a little

03:42.360 --> 03:43.800
hat, a little bedtime hat

03:43.800 --> 03:46.760
A little bedclothes, nice little sleepy time tea

03:46.760 --> 03:53.040
Yeah, and so also, I just feel like I should do this, a little review of Wrestlemania

03:53.040 --> 03:54.040
Sure, sure, of course

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
Boo

03:55.040 --> 03:57.680
That was a very little review

03:57.680 --> 03:58.680
Yeah

03:58.680 --> 03:59.680
Wow

03:59.680 --> 04:00.680
Real bad?

04:00.680 --> 04:01.680
Mm

04:01.680 --> 04:08.520
How did, we had a conversation about Bray Wyatt and his nonsense, did they do what

04:08.520 --> 04:14.480
we, I surmised that they would do a movie like that, where they go inside of a, nope

04:14.480 --> 04:15.620
What happened?

04:15.620 --> 04:21.320
So for the listeners who don't watch wrestling, Bray Wyatt was a guy who was a swamp hillbilly

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
cult leader

04:22.320 --> 04:23.320
Sure

04:23.320 --> 04:24.320
And was a lot of fun

04:24.320 --> 04:26.840
Unofficial mascot of this podcast, I believe

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
Sure, yeah

04:27.840 --> 04:29.840
Our first tweet was, yeah, yeah, yeah

04:29.840 --> 04:33.580
No, I don't think that was our first tweet, but it was the first one I tagged Alex Jones

04:33.580 --> 04:34.580
in

04:34.580 --> 04:35.580
Yes, yeah, yeah

04:35.580 --> 04:36.580
He was on Twitter

04:36.580 --> 04:37.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

04:37.580 --> 04:41.760
So he used to be a swamp hillbilly cult leader, and that was a lot of fun, he gave rambling

04:41.760 --> 04:48.800
sermons, and then he went away and he came back as a children's TV show host

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
Sure

04:49.800 --> 04:50.800
It was a little bit creepy

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
Sure

04:51.800 --> 04:55.480
At the Firefly Funhouse, and then he also was possessed by a demon called the Fiend

04:55.480 --> 04:56.480
Right

04:56.480 --> 05:00.840
That made him nearly indestructible, and there's a bunch of convoluted nonsense storytelling

05:00.840 --> 05:01.840
Of course

05:01.840 --> 05:06.200
Then at last year's Wrestlemania, they did a cinematic movie type match, where it was

05:06.200 --> 05:07.640
called a Firefly Funhouse match

05:07.640 --> 05:08.640
Sure

05:08.640 --> 05:12.560
Where the Fiend deconstructed John Cena's ego in his entire career

05:12.560 --> 05:13.560
Right

05:13.560 --> 05:16.040
Through a weird psychological deconstruct- it was amazing

05:16.040 --> 05:20.400
No, no, we- I watched it, this is one of the few things about wrestling that I've ever

05:20.400 --> 05:24.080
watched, we watched it together, and I told you this was actually very, very good

05:24.080 --> 05:31.740
It was a lot of fun, so over the course of this year, the Fiend, the demon guy, he got

05:31.740 --> 05:32.840
burned alive

05:32.840 --> 05:33.840
Sure, sure

05:33.840 --> 05:34.840
Randy

05:34.840 --> 05:35.840
Professional wrestling, correct?

05:35.840 --> 05:36.840
Okay

05:36.840 --> 05:41.760
Randy Orton set him on fire, and burned him alive, and he disappeared for a bit, but by

05:41.760 --> 05:45.880
that point, he had indoctrinated Alexa Bliss, who was another character on the show

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
Sure

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
Sure

05:47.880 --> 05:48.880
Into the dark arts, or the evil

05:48.880 --> 05:49.880
Naturally

05:49.880 --> 05:50.880
Or whatever

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
Yeah, whatever it is they do

05:51.880 --> 05:55.360
And so she was sort of pestering Randy Orton, and throwing fireballs at him, because she

05:55.360 --> 05:56.360
can throw fireballs now

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
Well yeah, but why not?

05:57.360 --> 05:58.360
Sure

05:58.360 --> 06:03.560
You burned a man alive, you might as well give his buddy the ability to throw fireballs

06:03.560 --> 06:08.560
So at the last pay-per-view, Alexa Bliss had talked Randy Orton into a match with her

06:08.560 --> 06:09.560
Sure

06:09.560 --> 06:10.560
And of course, this was all a trap

06:10.560 --> 06:12.440
Well yeah, she shoots fire

06:12.440 --> 06:15.120
And the Fiend came back, and he was all burned and everything

06:15.120 --> 06:16.120
Okay, alright

06:16.120 --> 06:20.040
Charred up, and like, oh my god, he's a zombie, he's back

06:20.040 --> 06:21.040
Sure, sure, sure

06:21.040 --> 06:24.680
You will be visited by three other ghosts immediately following this one

06:24.680 --> 06:25.680
Yes

06:25.680 --> 06:26.680
Yeah, yeah

06:26.680 --> 06:31.240
So at this WrestleMania, on night two, they had the match between the Fiend and Randy

06:31.240 --> 06:33.400
Orton, and it was like, what the fuck is this gonna be?

06:33.400 --> 06:35.320
They've already burned him to death

06:35.320 --> 06:37.200
Yeah, yeah, so I would say, you know

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
A wrestling match

06:38.200 --> 06:41.440
A chalk and ash bone match

06:41.440 --> 06:44.840
I was like, this is so stupid

06:44.840 --> 06:50.960
And so actually, during the pre-show of night one, I was yelling at the screen, open with

06:50.960 --> 06:53.160
the Fiend match you cowards!

06:53.160 --> 06:54.160
Yeah

06:54.160 --> 06:58.920
Because it's the worst idea, why would you ever open the show with that match?

06:58.920 --> 06:59.920
Oh, it's a terrible idea

06:59.920 --> 07:01.200
And they opened the show with that match

07:01.200 --> 07:02.200
They did not

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
And it was so dumb

07:03.200 --> 07:05.800
They opened the show with that match, that's a terrible idea

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
Yeah

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
Oh my god

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
It was really bad

07:08.800 --> 07:09.800
Oh boy

07:09.800 --> 07:15.740
Yep, and it started with Bray Wyatt as the Fiend, charred, walking down the hallway

07:15.740 --> 07:21.400
And as he walked down the hallway, all the char dropped off him and he was magically

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
healed

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
And he regenerated?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.400
Yeah

07:24.400 --> 07:25.400
He regenerated?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.400
Oh man

07:26.400 --> 07:27.400
Yep

07:27.400 --> 07:28.400
Oh shit, that should have been on Easter

07:28.400 --> 07:29.400
Should have been on Easter

07:29.400 --> 07:32.320
The Fiend comes back on Easter Sunday?

07:32.320 --> 07:33.320
That's the way you do it

07:33.320 --> 07:37.280
I would explain what happened in the match, but I don't really understand it and it was

07:37.280 --> 07:38.280
dumb

07:38.280 --> 07:43.080
I will say my high point, and this is damning the Wrestlemania with faint praise, my high

07:43.080 --> 07:46.320
point was the rapper Bad Bunny

07:46.320 --> 07:51.200
I have been hearing a lot of people say positive things about a rapper who did some flips

07:51.200 --> 07:56.280
Yes, that was on night one, it might have been when my fever was setting in, but he

07:56.280 --> 07:57.280
killed it

07:57.280 --> 08:01.800
It was a lot of fun to watch him have just the best time

08:01.800 --> 08:05.240
Clearly he was having a lot of fun

08:05.240 --> 08:09.800
That didn't happen, I checked with some people before the show and they were like no, Bad

08:09.800 --> 08:12.680
Bunny's never been on Wrestlemania, Dan just had a terrible fever

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
Oh shit

08:13.680 --> 08:17.700
Dan, your fever was so bad, your brain was torturing itself

08:17.700 --> 08:22.960
On night two they had a great video, like a little piece where Bad Bunny comes walking

08:22.960 --> 08:29.000
up onto a street and Triple H is standing there with a briefcase and he's like you did

08:29.000 --> 08:31.460
great at Wrestlemania, now you go do what you do

08:31.460 --> 08:32.760
Oh god no

08:32.760 --> 08:34.840
So he hands him the briefcase and he's got a microphone

08:34.840 --> 08:40.240
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

08:40.240 --> 08:44.240
I don't even know anything about Bad Bunny's music and I have been won over, he seems charming

08:44.240 --> 08:47.480
Anyway, this has been my protracted bright spot, how about you Jordan

08:47.480 --> 08:53.360
Dan, my bright spot of all things, there's a new TV show called Made for Love

08:53.360 --> 08:57.880
Features someone who's burned to death, comes back

08:57.880 --> 09:05.300
Close, surprisingly close, it's like a, you know, tech billionaire, he does some stuff,

09:05.300 --> 09:10.000
it's quite funny, but the main thing is Ray Romano is incredible in it

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh yeah

09:11.000 --> 09:15.880
He has turned himself into an actor with a, with a capital Taur

09:15.880 --> 09:16.880
I think he's always been pretty good

09:16.880 --> 09:20.740
He's always been pretty good, but you wouldn't expect everybody loves Raymond to be this

09:20.740 --> 09:23.140
guy and to pull it off as well as he does

09:23.140 --> 09:25.000
I don't know, have you seen Men of a Certain Age?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
That was pretty good

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Was it?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Was it Andre Brauer?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.120
Wait, Men of a Certain Age, which age?

09:30.120 --> 09:34.080
Yeah, Ray Romano, Quantum Leap Guy, Scott Bakula

09:34.080 --> 09:36.120
Scott Bakula is still alive?

09:36.120 --> 09:38.120
It was a while back, there was a show, I remember

09:38.120 --> 09:39.760
Scott Bakula was alive a while back?

09:39.760 --> 09:41.120
He was of a certain age

09:41.120 --> 09:45.680
I remember that show being alright, I might be wrong about that

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
Wait, it was a show?

09:46.680 --> 09:47.680
Yeah

09:47.680 --> 09:48.680
I thought it was like a

09:48.680 --> 09:49.680
It was on like USA

09:49.680 --> 09:53.840
I thought it was like the Deep Impact to Wild Hogs's Armageddon if you will

09:53.840 --> 09:57.720
You know, Men of a Certain Age and Wild Hogs both came out the same year kind of thing

09:57.720 --> 09:59.720
There's thematic overlap

09:59.720 --> 10:00.720
Sure

10:00.720 --> 10:01.720
Aging

10:01.720 --> 10:02.720
Anyway

10:02.720 --> 10:03.720
Okay

10:03.720 --> 10:04.720
Jordan

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
Yes?

10:05.720 --> 10:06.920
Today we have an episode to go over

10:06.920 --> 10:07.920
Oh we do

10:07.920 --> 10:08.920
Yup

10:08.920 --> 10:09.920
Was that what we were doing?

10:09.920 --> 10:16.480
So I had this weekend of, you know, sort of recovery and what have you and convalescence

10:16.480 --> 10:22.560
Even though I probably wasn't nearly as, you know, in need of that as I might have thought

10:22.560 --> 10:24.680
I might need to be

10:24.680 --> 10:29.200
I appreciate everybody allowing us, you know, being cool about Monday on Wednesday this

10:29.200 --> 10:30.200
week

10:30.200 --> 10:36.920
But as I was getting back to work I was like, I don't want to do this stuff

10:36.920 --> 10:39.400
Like I didn't want to look at the present day

10:39.400 --> 10:46.240
There have been some shootings and, you know, police involved shooting in Minneapolis

10:46.240 --> 10:51.420
And I just, I just didn't have the stomach to jump right back into that with Alex

10:51.420 --> 10:54.000
And so I decided we're going back to 2003

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Okay

10:55.000 --> 10:56.840
We're going to dip our toes back in

10:56.840 --> 10:58.560
We'll deal with the present day on Friday

10:58.560 --> 10:59.560
Sure

10:59.560 --> 11:05.180
But I needed to have something that had a little bit less stakes in order to dive back

11:05.180 --> 11:06.180
in on

11:06.180 --> 11:08.040
And we'll talk about that here in just a moment

11:08.040 --> 11:10.640
But before we do we've got to take a moment to say thank you to some folks who have signed

11:10.640 --> 11:11.720
up and are supporting the show

11:11.720 --> 11:12.720
That's a great idea

11:12.720 --> 11:15.960
So first, Scatman AKA Dan, thank you so much

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
You are now a policy wonk

11:16.960 --> 11:18.360
I'm a policy wonk

11:18.360 --> 11:20.040
Thanks Scatman AKA Dan

11:20.040 --> 11:22.500
This is a good point for me to also apologize

11:22.500 --> 11:27.020
It has been brought up to me that I did say on an early episode that if we ever made it

11:27.020 --> 11:29.680
to a point where we were comfortable doing this podcast

11:29.680 --> 11:31.320
Oh no, we don't bring that up anymore

11:31.320 --> 11:33.560
That I would change my name legally to Scatman

11:33.560 --> 11:35.040
We don't bring that up anymore

11:35.040 --> 11:36.600
I'm not going to be able to do that

11:36.600 --> 11:39.160
Well, we were not expecting it

11:39.160 --> 11:40.160
Yes

11:40.160 --> 11:44.800
We were putting, we were putting a lot of money on not making any money

11:44.800 --> 11:50.160
I do keep open the possibility of a Scatman John tattoo or just his mustache

11:50.160 --> 11:51.160
Oh yeah

11:51.160 --> 11:53.560
Next, Willard Wonka in the policy factory

11:53.560 --> 11:55.560
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

11:55.560 --> 11:56.720
I'm a policy wonk

11:56.720 --> 11:57.720
Thanks Willard Wonka

11:57.720 --> 12:01.920
Next, Courtney B, not a walk-in but I was in a Nelly song

12:01.920 --> 12:03.720
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:03.720 --> 12:04.840
I'm a policy wonk

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
Thanks Courtney

12:05.840 --> 12:07.400
Good to know that is not a walk-in

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
That's not a walk-in

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
No

12:09.400 --> 12:10.400
No

12:10.400 --> 12:12.120
You know Courtney B telling me about a party up in NYC

12:12.120 --> 12:13.120
I don't

12:13.120 --> 12:14.120
Gotta make it damn right

12:14.120 --> 12:15.120
I don't

12:15.120 --> 12:16.120
First flight, first flight, first flight

12:16.120 --> 12:17.120
Ah, come on

12:17.120 --> 12:18.120
Mix the Vanna White

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
I don't know

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
I'm never going to understand it

12:20.120 --> 12:21.800
I'm never going to understand it

12:21.800 --> 12:24.240
The world still thought Nelly was a good idea

12:24.240 --> 12:25.240
Must be the money

12:25.240 --> 12:26.240
They really did

12:26.240 --> 12:27.400
That's a great song

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
Okay

12:28.400 --> 12:30.960
Anyway, uh, Toko, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:30.960 --> 12:31.960
I'm a policy wonk

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
Thanks Toko

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
Thank you

12:33.960 --> 12:36.320
Next, Davey Pancakes, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

12:36.320 --> 12:37.320
I'm a policy wonk

12:37.320 --> 12:38.440
Thanks, Davey Pancakes

12:38.440 --> 12:39.440
Thank you

12:39.440 --> 12:42.640
Next, evil commie feminist witch definitely coming for your guns, thank you so much,

12:42.640 --> 12:43.920
you are now a policy wonk

12:43.920 --> 12:44.920
I'm a policy wonk

12:44.920 --> 12:45.920
Thank you very much

12:45.920 --> 12:51.080
Hey, and finally, uh, I got a little technocrat shout out going out to Conal

12:51.080 --> 12:53.960
Thank you so much, Conal, you are now a technocrat

12:53.960 --> 12:54.960
I'm a policy wonk

12:54.960 --> 12:58.200
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

12:58.200 --> 12:59.640
How's your 401k doing, bro?

12:59.640 --> 13:02.240
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson, alright?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.720
Let's just get down to business

13:03.720 --> 13:05.800
We ain't making that money off that heroin

13:05.800 --> 13:07.840
Why you pimps so good?

13:07.840 --> 13:09.480
My neck is freakishly large

13:09.480 --> 13:12.080
I declare info war on you

13:12.080 --> 13:13.080
Thanks so much, Conal

13:13.080 --> 13:14.320
Yes, thank you very much, Conal

13:14.320 --> 13:15.760
Also, Jordan, I know you know this

13:15.760 --> 13:16.760
What's up, Dan?

13:16.760 --> 13:17.760
Now, the world needs to know this

13:17.760 --> 13:18.760
Okay

13:18.760 --> 13:20.880
There are two April birthdays, uh, myself

13:20.880 --> 13:22.320
Indeed they are

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
Myself

13:23.320 --> 13:26.000
There's one, you have two in April as well this year, I believe

13:26.000 --> 13:30.120
And Dr. Gums, my buddy Dr. Gums also has a, uh, has a April birthday

13:30.120 --> 13:31.120
Alright

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
You know who else does?

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
Brad.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.120
How's it going, Brad?

13:35.120 --> 13:36.440
Happy birthday, Brad

13:36.440 --> 13:39.840
Uh, Tyler got in touch with us and wanted us to wish Brad a happy birthday

13:39.840 --> 13:40.840
So, Brad, happy birthday

13:40.840 --> 13:41.840
Happy birthday, Brad

13:41.840 --> 13:43.240
We didn't say when your birthday was, though

13:43.240 --> 13:44.800
It's just in April at some point

13:44.800 --> 13:45.800
Not important

13:45.800 --> 13:47.300
It doesn't have to be in April

13:47.300 --> 13:50.440
My birthday's in April and so is Dr. Gums, which means that it's the best month

13:50.440 --> 13:54.560
Also, Mandy Moore, Cedric the Entertainer, Kelly Clarkson

13:54.560 --> 13:55.560
Okay

13:55.560 --> 13:59.920
Anyway, Jordan, today we are going over May 5th, 2003

13:59.920 --> 14:00.920
Alright

14:00.920 --> 14:04.680
You may recall that our last episode was about May 2nd, 2003

14:04.680 --> 14:07.000
And you're like, what the hell, why are we jumping?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
We aren't jumping

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Okay

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
May 2nd was a Thursday

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Uh-huh

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
It was a Friday

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Now we're back on Monday

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
It was a busy Friday

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
It was a busy Friday

14:16.000 --> 14:17.560
He doesn't have a Sunday show at this point

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
Gotcha

14:18.560 --> 14:19.840
So we're just back on Monday here

14:19.840 --> 14:21.600
And here is an out of context drop from today's show

14:21.600 --> 14:25.000
Kids are now being arrested for stepping in water puddles

14:25.000 --> 14:26.200
That's an aggressive move

14:26.200 --> 14:27.200
That is an aggressive move

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
That is an aggressive move

14:28.200 --> 14:31.720
Yep, kids are being arrested for stepping in water puddles

14:31.720 --> 14:33.520
Stepping in water puddles?

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
Yeah

14:34.520 --> 14:35.520
How deep are we talking?

14:35.520 --> 14:36.520
So deep

14:36.520 --> 14:39.480
I want to know, I want to know the regulations on what pools

14:39.480 --> 14:43.760
What is the pool of water in this circumstance?

14:43.760 --> 14:46.360
I regret to inform you that Alex does not get into that

14:46.360 --> 14:48.280
Oh, that's a real bummer

14:48.280 --> 14:50.600
Any of the specific details on that front

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
Alright

14:51.600 --> 14:58.000
So Alex begins the show complaining about how the bath party is being put in all the

14:58.000 --> 15:00.840
positions of power in Iraq

15:00.840 --> 15:04.520
Which in retrospect sounds really right on

15:04.520 --> 15:05.920
He's right about everything

15:05.920 --> 15:10.120
He will shortly be very, very, very wrong

15:10.120 --> 15:14.040
And then we get an edition of the game that I like to play

15:14.040 --> 15:19.080
That is Where in the World is Saddam Hussein?

15:19.080 --> 15:20.800
And they are setting up a dictatorship

15:20.800 --> 15:23.960
They are putting a regional governors in

15:23.960 --> 15:28.240
All former bath party officials in the 23 ministries

15:28.240 --> 15:31.880
That is official, White House last week

15:31.880 --> 15:35.400
Most of Saddam's former people, most of them trained in the US by the CIA

15:35.400 --> 15:38.760
That was the CIA government under Saddam until they broke

15:38.760 --> 15:41.440
When he followed orders to invade Kuwait

15:41.440 --> 15:43.520
And got a lot of trouble, they set him up

15:43.520 --> 15:47.200
As Saddam said on ITN, now comfortable living in Russia

15:47.200 --> 15:49.560
So apparently Saddam is now comfortable living in Russia

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
Okay

15:50.560 --> 15:53.760
On our last episode he was in Haiti or was it Cuba?

15:53.760 --> 15:54.760
I believe he was in Cuba

15:54.760 --> 15:55.760
Yeah

15:55.760 --> 15:56.760
He was in Cuba

15:56.760 --> 16:02.120
So now he's, in the last couple days he's gone from Cuba to Russia

16:02.120 --> 16:05.600
I think there was an Indiana Jones style interstitial

16:05.600 --> 16:08.880
Where there's the plane and the red line going from spot to spot

16:08.880 --> 16:09.880
I believe

16:09.880 --> 16:10.880
Yeah

16:10.880 --> 16:11.880
Boy, he gets around

16:11.880 --> 16:18.240
Nobody, nobody has seen him get on any of these flights

16:18.240 --> 16:19.240
No

16:19.240 --> 16:20.240
Cuba, Russia

16:20.240 --> 16:21.240
Right

16:21.240 --> 16:22.240
That hole

16:22.240 --> 16:23.240
That, yeah

16:23.240 --> 16:24.240
Where he was found

16:24.240 --> 16:25.240
Yes, exactly

16:25.240 --> 16:26.240
Yeah

16:26.240 --> 16:28.040
Quite a travel itinerary

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
Yeah

16:29.040 --> 16:32.840
Yeah, so this is interesting the way that this is playing out

16:32.840 --> 16:40.440
That Alex is very much on the page of the bath party is going to be in charge of everything

16:40.440 --> 16:41.440
Naturally

16:41.440 --> 16:46.120
It's just going to be very, very wrong in a very short period of time

16:46.120 --> 16:47.120
Yeah

16:47.120 --> 16:52.520
So at this point in Alex's career, he's a different Alex Jones than he is in the present

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
day

16:53.520 --> 16:56.600
In some ways and he's the same in some ways

16:56.600 --> 17:05.380
Right now in 2021 even as he's being a real dum-dum on air and being very sad and not

17:05.380 --> 17:06.380
great at his job

17:06.380 --> 17:07.480
Just a real shit pile

17:07.480 --> 17:09.920
He's still in a million dollar studio

17:09.920 --> 17:10.920
Yes

17:10.920 --> 17:13.000
He's still got the LED screens behind him

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
True

17:14.000 --> 17:20.280
He's the kind of guy who shows up with bullhorns at events that he didn't organize in DC and

17:20.280 --> 17:21.480
people chant his name

17:21.480 --> 17:26.080
He can afford to hire at least 15, 18 year olds at a time

17:26.080 --> 17:28.440
And you know, he can draw a crowd

17:28.440 --> 17:33.880
He can lead some people from Trump's rally to the Capitol in a way that might look bad

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
in hindsight

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
We don't need to worry about that

17:35.880 --> 17:38.240
In 2003 he was a little bit different

17:38.240 --> 17:40.800
The kind of bookings Alex was taking back then

17:40.800 --> 17:41.800
Oh no

17:41.800 --> 17:45.080
But before I go any further, a couple quick announcements

17:45.080 --> 17:52.560
I rarely traveled, but I will be up at KCXL 1140 that carries the daytime show

17:52.560 --> 17:59.840
KCXL 1140 for the Liberty Factor, May 17th, that's a couple weeks from now on a Saturday

17:59.840 --> 18:06.080
May 17th and that's going to be from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.640
Colonel Craig Roberts and others will be there speaking

18:09.640 --> 18:15.060
And I'll be speaking for several hours and doing a presentation and it's going to be

18:15.060 --> 18:19.560
a great event and it's a benefit for KCXL

18:19.560 --> 18:23.320
And I hope to see everybody there

18:23.320 --> 18:26.040
So Alex is basically, he's doing a local radio gig

18:26.040 --> 18:28.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that

18:28.680 --> 18:30.040
I appreciate that a lot

18:30.040 --> 18:33.280
There's maybe a minor league baseball game somewhere nearby

18:33.280 --> 18:38.280
There's a car dealership opening that he's going to be appearing at

18:38.280 --> 18:43.400
So I was wondering about this station because it's like Alex is going out of his way to

18:43.400 --> 18:44.400
go to this station

18:44.400 --> 18:45.400
Yeah

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
It seems weird

18:46.400 --> 18:49.480
Like what can we find out about this place?

18:49.480 --> 18:55.140
And, well, there's a 2020 article about the station that I thought was a little bit interesting

18:55.140 --> 18:56.880
seeing how things turned out for them

18:56.880 --> 18:59.480
So wait, this was just last year?

18:59.480 --> 19:00.480
Yeah

19:00.480 --> 19:01.480
Okay, alright

19:01.480 --> 19:05.680
So this station is owned by a guy named Pete Chartel and he signed a deal not too long

19:05.680 --> 19:12.720
ago with Radio Sputnik to air their broadcasting for six hours a day on this station AM 1140

19:12.720 --> 19:16.800
as well as two other stations he runs for approximately $60,000 a year

19:16.800 --> 19:21.880
Ooh, you know, it's tough keeping a Ma and Pa radio station alive though

19:21.880 --> 19:22.880
Right

19:22.880 --> 19:24.920
So like, you gotta find revenue where you can

19:24.920 --> 19:25.920
Yeah, sure

19:25.920 --> 19:27.640
Yeah, you gotta do what you gotta do

19:27.640 --> 19:32.480
It's interesting, I find that interesting, not necessarily all that damning or anything

19:32.480 --> 19:33.480
No, no, no

19:33.480 --> 19:34.480
Weird

19:34.480 --> 19:35.480
Yeah

19:35.480 --> 19:38.880
Also, prior to this, this station was airing people like Alex Jones and of course Rick

19:38.880 --> 19:43.080
Wiles who you may remember is that fundamentalist asshole who called the Trump impeachment a

19:43.080 --> 19:44.440
quote Jew coup

19:44.440 --> 19:45.760
Yes

19:45.760 --> 19:51.040
This line in a KCUR profile about him and this station is actually kind of stunning

19:51.040 --> 19:57.040
Quote, Chartel acknowledges that KCXL has at times given platforms to people who quote

19:57.040 --> 19:59.200
seem antisemitic

19:59.200 --> 20:03.000
But Chartel said that he thinks his listeners are well informed and should be able to quote

20:03.000 --> 20:07.840
decide for themselves whether they think something is anti this or anti that whether it's based

20:07.840 --> 20:11.280
on prejudice or upon someone's wrong interpretation of the facts

20:11.280 --> 20:14.920
Now, now I feel like we're misunderstanding a real issue there

20:14.920 --> 20:20.080
I understand it's up to the listener to decide whether or not they believe it is antisemitism

20:20.080 --> 20:23.000
however it is and you put it on the radio, sir

20:23.000 --> 20:25.360
Well, he certainly says it seems like it is

20:25.360 --> 20:29.520
It doesn't get, we don't get to go back from seems, we don't get to go back from seems

20:29.520 --> 20:30.640
you put it on the radio

20:30.640 --> 20:31.640
Yeah

20:31.640 --> 20:38.640
And plenty of your listeners were well aware of that it was antisemitism and it was a selling

20:38.640 --> 20:39.640
point for them

20:39.640 --> 20:45.880
I'm taking up time on my broadcast to air Nazi stuff and I'm gonna, you know, run commercials

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
during it

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
Sure

20:47.880 --> 20:49.920
But I trust that the audience gets that I don't like this

20:49.920 --> 20:53.440
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna stump for them

20:53.440 --> 20:57.680
I'm just gonna give them a place to spread their views without any pushback

20:57.680 --> 21:01.320
Yeah, so that's the station that Alex is going to do

21:01.320 --> 21:02.320
Good stuff

21:02.320 --> 21:03.320
Great

21:03.320 --> 21:04.320
Good stuff

21:04.320 --> 21:07.240
So Alex has some gripes in 2003

21:07.240 --> 21:11.600
He's got some issues but there's one issue that is rises above all of them

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
Okay

21:12.600 --> 21:17.400
The biggest thing we face is the overnight talk sensation types that talk about deliberate

21:17.400 --> 21:19.680
disinformation on purpose

21:19.680 --> 21:25.920
They'll have five stupid guests for one good guest that talks about real information

21:25.920 --> 21:31.320
What that then does is when the average American hears somebody talk about famous corrupt world

21:31.320 --> 21:38.640
government they've heard that mixed in with the Green Martians from the South Pole or

21:38.640 --> 21:45.720
you know Planet X or whatever and then it neutralizes all of it, it's the poison pill

21:45.720 --> 21:50.800
Whereas everything we talk about here is proven and is documented and is in your face

21:50.800 --> 21:55.640
So the biggest issue that the truth movement or whatever Alex is engaged in at this point

21:55.640 --> 22:01.440
The biggest issue that they face is these opportunistic radio people who talk about

22:01.440 --> 22:06.000
some of the real issues but then mix in stuff like aliens or let's say extra dimensional

22:06.000 --> 22:08.680
demons and fighting the literal devil

22:08.680 --> 22:10.880
Right, right

22:10.880 --> 22:15.040
One could say that he has become everything that he hates most in this exact moment

22:15.040 --> 22:18.080
Alex's biggest problem in 2003 is his future self

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
Is Alex in 2021

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
Yeah

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
Oh boy

22:21.080 --> 22:22.080
Gotta love it

22:22.080 --> 22:24.760
So I heard that and I thought like well that's just good fun

22:24.760 --> 22:25.760
That is

22:25.760 --> 22:31.440
But this actually leads to what I think is a really interesting moment later in the episode

22:31.440 --> 22:32.440
Okay

22:32.440 --> 22:39.040
There's something that rises this up to a level of relevance that it wouldn't have otherwise

22:39.040 --> 22:43.840
But before we get to that Alex has got to complain a lot about how they're going to

22:43.840 --> 22:45.560
outlaw homeschooling

22:45.560 --> 22:48.960
Okay

22:48.960 --> 22:55.200
I've got the headline right here homeschooling under new law to be abused in California just

22:55.200 --> 22:59.000
says period you homeschool it's abusive

22:59.000 --> 23:03.760
Yes it's the new America folks this is who they're coming after hope you know the terrorism

23:03.760 --> 23:10.600
manual say Christians gun owners homeschoolers word for word and you thought it was the Muslims

23:10.600 --> 23:15.260
oh no they work for the CIA any real Muslim terrorists is flying around in a plane with

23:15.260 --> 23:17.800
bars of gold from your tax money

23:17.800 --> 23:18.800
What?

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
Any real

23:19.800 --> 23:24.560
By the way Senate reports before I end this segment you want to find out about those Muslim

23:24.560 --> 23:29.520
terrorists that work for the CIA get 911 the road to tyranny and part two of that the masters

23:29.520 --> 23:30.520
of terror

23:30.520 --> 23:31.520
Interesting add pivots

23:31.520 --> 23:32.520
Wow

23:32.520 --> 23:33.520
That's the way it worked back then

23:33.520 --> 23:35.920
If you want to find out about the Muslims terrorists

23:35.920 --> 23:38.040
Flying around with bars of gold

23:38.040 --> 23:39.280
With bars of gold from your tax money

23:39.280 --> 23:40.280
Okay

23:40.280 --> 23:41.280
Yeah

23:41.280 --> 23:47.400
So all the terrorists without bars of gold are fake Muslim terrorists?

23:47.400 --> 23:54.040
I think that Alex is saying that there aren't really any except for CIA run Muslim terrorists

23:54.040 --> 23:55.040
yeah it's interesting

23:55.040 --> 23:56.040
That is interesting

23:56.040 --> 23:57.040
Yeah

23:57.040 --> 23:59.040
Okay

23:59.040 --> 24:03.840
So they're gonna they're gonna get rid of homeschooling they're calling it abuse

24:03.840 --> 24:11.240
I mean I have a problem with homeschooling as a way to avoid learning that's a big issue

24:11.240 --> 24:16.320
where they're like I don't want my kid learning any of that devil math that's an issue

24:16.320 --> 24:17.320
Right

24:17.320 --> 24:19.080
So they should learn the math of the spheres

24:19.080 --> 24:24.800
Yeah homeschooling in and of itself isn't necessarily abusive but it can be an element

24:24.800 --> 24:31.280
of abuse if you're keeping your child in a you know raising them in some kind of absurd

24:31.280 --> 24:32.280
way

24:32.280 --> 24:33.280
Perhaps

24:33.280 --> 24:37.560
Let's say homeschooling could be an element of that but just because someone decides to

24:37.560 --> 24:41.000
homeschool does not necessarily equate to that

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Yeah

24:42.000 --> 24:46.160
And I think that Alex likes to play the margins there likes to pretend that everybody is saying

24:46.160 --> 24:48.120
that homeschool is intrinsically

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
Sure

24:49.120 --> 24:50.120
Inactive abuse

24:50.120 --> 24:51.120
I mean yeah

24:51.120 --> 24:53.280
I don't think that those are the arguments that people are making

24:53.280 --> 24:57.880
You know I mean in my small community growing up we had a couple I had I had that but I

24:57.880 --> 25:02.440
think we had both ends of the spectrum of homeschool kids the kids who are homeschooled

25:02.440 --> 25:07.440
who were clearly way overachievers and you meet them and they're six years old and you're

25:07.440 --> 25:12.120
like yeah you shouldn't be in with the rest of the chattel you need to be raised by your

25:12.120 --> 25:15.720
weirdo parents to become a math genius that's fine

25:15.720 --> 25:21.160
And then the other end of that was the like well okay so they know everything about the

25:21.160 --> 25:25.360
Bible and then beyond that we're in real dicey territory

25:25.360 --> 25:26.360
Sure

25:26.360 --> 25:27.360
Yeah

25:27.360 --> 25:31.120
And I think one of the difficulties and challenges of homeschooling is obviously like socialization

25:31.120 --> 25:36.360
and I think people have figured out ways around that with like you know groups and

25:36.360 --> 25:37.360
strategies and stuff like that

25:37.360 --> 25:39.040
Yeah yeah yeah yeah the whole thing

25:39.040 --> 25:45.160
Yeah but I don't know the way that I look at it is like yeah there's some homeschool

25:45.160 --> 25:47.600
stuff that's bad and there's some stuff that's fine

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
Yeah

25:48.600 --> 25:51.000
Alex on the other hand when he looks at school

25:51.000 --> 25:52.120
Sure

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
It's all bad

25:53.120 --> 25:59.400
Oh well and all over the country cesspools like California run by socialists and gun

25:59.400 --> 26:06.160
grabbing creatures like Davis are first saying oh we're gonna rescue you homeschool we don't

26:06.160 --> 26:10.000
have a teaching certificate not a law they just say it same thing in Illinois they're

26:10.000 --> 26:14.320
trying it all over now even some southern states it's all about intimidation it's less

26:14.320 --> 26:20.000
than 1% it's to scare you than to be highly publicized we've talked to Christopher before

26:20.000 --> 26:24.720
he's given us this great analysis and I agree with him it's what they're doing now though

26:24.720 --> 26:29.400
they're trying to put it into law and call it child abuse where they just refuse the

26:29.400 --> 26:34.040
school refused to give you quote your form then you don't put your child in their abusive

26:34.040 --> 26:37.600
system where your child learns how to be a crack whore or learns how to worship world

26:37.600 --> 26:40.520
government or learns how to report mommy and daddy thrown in guns

26:40.520 --> 26:42.320
Are they the only three?

26:42.320 --> 26:45.520
Christianity is seen as a cult religion but they teach you how to be a Muslim I mean it

26:45.520 --> 26:46.520
goes on and on

26:46.520 --> 26:47.520
What?

26:47.520 --> 26:49.540
The nightmares in these schools when your kid gets arrested if they're caught playing

26:49.540 --> 26:51.040
tag or dodge ball

26:51.040 --> 26:52.960
These are weird examples

26:52.960 --> 26:58.680
Yeah this is a very strange dystopia that he's painting a picture that if that were

26:58.680 --> 27:05.760
real you would that's some very weird adults doing some weird stuff like as a whole

27:05.760 --> 27:11.320
Yeah I don't know how public education teaches you to be and I don't like this term but as

27:11.320 --> 27:12.880
Alex is calling it a crack whore

27:12.880 --> 27:16.040
A crack sex worker

27:16.040 --> 27:24.520
I don't know what that educational curriculum is like I also think yeah I mean like obviously

27:24.520 --> 27:31.480
tag and dodge ball that's just those right wing talking points around this time and periodically

27:31.480 --> 27:34.320
whenever they want to deploy those yeah it's weird

27:34.320 --> 27:38.040
Yeah I don't think I remember any classes growing up that was just like okay we're gonna

27:38.040 --> 27:43.280
watch the wire and then you figure out what character you want to be and we'll build a

27:43.280 --> 27:44.600
curricula based on that

27:44.600 --> 27:50.000
Yeah I also don't know I don't know what classes ever have been like Christianity is a cult

27:50.000 --> 27:51.920
and oh here's how you become a Muslim

27:51.920 --> 27:54.360
I don't know if I've ever read it yet

27:54.360 --> 27:55.360
It's a little

27:55.360 --> 27:56.360
That's not very

27:56.360 --> 27:58.200
It seems a little bit like a caricature

27:58.200 --> 28:02.200
I feel like he might be describing a women's studies course in a very wrong way

28:02.200 --> 28:09.000
I don't know so Alex has an example though of like the way that this is out of control

28:09.000 --> 28:15.040
in the schools the schools are out of control they're trying to get everyone jammed up

28:15.040 --> 28:16.040
Okay

28:16.040 --> 28:20.240
Like here in Austin Texas if you're late to class three times that's considered truancy

28:20.240 --> 28:25.280
they criminally charge you in one school over half the kids have been charged though the

28:25.280 --> 28:30.000
state law says 12 to 14 truancies in a semester they're not even following the law anymore

28:30.000 --> 28:37.080
I met a lady she showed me the documents and she actually works for someone in my family

28:37.080 --> 28:43.600
and she brought she showed me the documentation her child was in kindergarten six years ago

28:43.600 --> 28:50.320
and was out for a week with pneumonia they have now criminally charged her for truancy

28:50.320 --> 28:55.080
in kindergarten and we went look at the statute of limitations it's like six months because

28:55.080 --> 28:58.960
there's not even a criminal charge and they're now criminally charging her they're not even

28:58.960 --> 29:00.460
following laws now sir

29:00.460 --> 29:02.120
What?

29:02.120 --> 29:09.200
That seems uh if true I am outraged sir

29:09.200 --> 29:11.920
Yeah I don't believe this

29:11.920 --> 29:16.520
So the first thing that I find troubling about this story is that a week is a pretty quick

29:16.520 --> 29:19.360
recovery time for a kindergartner to get over pneumonia

29:19.360 --> 29:20.520
As easy

29:20.520 --> 29:21.520
That seems fishy

29:21.520 --> 29:22.760
That's a strong kindergartner

29:22.760 --> 29:27.960
Also Jordan I would ask you this question what is truancy if you're a kindergartner?

29:27.960 --> 29:32.720
Those kids are between four and six years old so it's not like they're even able to

29:32.720 --> 29:33.720
skip class

29:33.720 --> 29:38.320
They stopped watching The Wire all right they turned around

29:38.320 --> 29:42.880
If there's an unexplained absence of a child in kindergarten that's an issue with the parents

29:42.880 --> 29:47.280
a six-year-old is not responsible for getting themselves to class like a high schooler might

29:47.280 --> 29:51.880
be so pretending there's an equivalence in terms of truancy is just ridiculous

29:51.880 --> 29:58.200
The kindergarten hires a guy in a van to drive around outside all 7-elevens and be like hey

29:58.200 --> 30:02.640
you you're it's your one day you gotta be in school get in there

30:02.640 --> 30:05.560
According to the Texas Board of Education there are a bunch of steps that are taken

30:05.560 --> 30:10.200
before any kind of court would come into play with truancy issues as it stands now

30:10.200 --> 30:14.840
These rules were changed to get rid of any possible criminal charges back in 2015 but

30:14.840 --> 30:18.240
even prior to that the worst that would really happen to a student is that they would be

30:18.240 --> 30:19.920
charged with a Class C misdemeanor

30:19.920 --> 30:20.920
Sure

30:20.920 --> 30:23.280
That they could get out of control and we'll discuss that in a second

30:23.280 --> 30:24.280
Right right right

30:24.280 --> 30:27.460
I'm not sure how I feel about any of this but I'm also pretty sure from what I've read

30:27.460 --> 30:31.800
on the subject that this is only something that currently is done after there are attempts

30:31.800 --> 30:34.720
to resolve the truancy issue and those attempts have failed

30:34.720 --> 30:35.720
Sure

30:35.720 --> 30:38.160
And it's not even how this stuff works anymore

30:38.160 --> 30:42.160
This is one of those interesting things about Alex in the past though where he he's actually

30:42.160 --> 30:46.840
covering a murky subject but he's sensationalizing it so far past the point where it can be taken

30:46.840 --> 30:47.840
seriously

30:47.840 --> 30:48.840
Yeah

30:48.840 --> 30:52.880
So people can and should discuss what approaches are appropriate to take in terms of encouraging

30:52.880 --> 30:57.800
attendance in school and how chronic truancy is often an indication of a larger problem

30:57.800 --> 31:00.520
that should not be ignored and kids need help with

31:00.520 --> 31:04.560
Yeah if chronic truancy the problem is not you're not in school often enough

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
Right

31:05.560 --> 31:06.880
There's a way bigger problem somewhere

31:06.880 --> 31:12.560
It usually is a sign of something that someone could use some kind of assistance with

31:12.560 --> 31:16.480
Is imposing fines on high schoolers who skip class all the time a good strategy or is it

31:16.480 --> 31:18.680
overly punitive and counterproductive?

31:18.680 --> 31:22.520
That is a fine conversation and I think that it's worth having

31:22.520 --> 31:23.520
Sure

31:23.520 --> 31:27.680
Where it falls apart and why Alex is a terrible source of information about anything is the

31:27.680 --> 31:31.680
point where he makes this about a kindergartner who had pneumonia being criminally charged

31:31.680 --> 31:32.680
for being out of school

31:32.680 --> 31:37.840
That's absurd and even according to the debatably too harsh rules that Texas operated under

31:37.840 --> 31:42.560
at the time these truancy rules only applied to students in first through 12th grade

31:42.560 --> 31:46.440
Alex is making up an extreme example of some anecdote that he's heard that's so severe

31:46.440 --> 31:50.200
that it creates an image in the audience's head about this policy that he's looking to

31:50.200 --> 31:51.600
demonize

31:51.600 --> 31:55.340
He does this because that's easier than it would be to look over data and come up with

31:55.340 --> 31:58.400
an argument against the policy as it exists

31:58.400 --> 32:02.840
If you can just paint a dramatic overly emotionally charged picture in your audience's head you

32:02.840 --> 32:05.520
don't have to do the work of making an actual point

32:05.520 --> 32:06.520
Yeah

32:06.520 --> 32:11.600
Yeah that'd be like I remember whenever they took away three three a day practices when

32:11.600 --> 32:16.220
I was in high school doing football and I and people were all like oh no you're making

32:16.220 --> 32:23.040
the kids soft and all of that stuff and yeah that was probably the best decision to take

32:23.040 --> 32:27.240
that away but this would be like if Alex got on and he was like yeah they said you only

32:27.240 --> 32:33.000
have to do two and this coach he went ahead and did three anyways so they fucking killed

32:33.000 --> 32:36.320
him they just killed him they murdered him on the spot they're not even following the

32:36.320 --> 32:37.320
laws anymore

32:37.320 --> 32:38.320
There's no due process

32:38.320 --> 32:39.320
They just murdered the coach on the field

32:39.320 --> 32:41.320
Honestly my problem is the lack of due process

32:41.320 --> 32:43.480
Exactly it's due process

32:43.480 --> 32:48.640
So also by framing the issue that Alex is discussing like this he can sidestep the uncomfortable

32:48.640 --> 32:53.880
reality that this kind of program disproportionately victimizes students without means

32:53.880 --> 32:58.440
If you skip school and you're fined for it and you can't pay the fine what happens then?

32:58.440 --> 33:03.000
A 2015 article on Buzzfeed discussed the case of an 11th grader in Texas who couldn't pay

33:03.000 --> 33:08.200
and was quote offered jail credit at a rate of three hundred dollars per day

33:08.200 --> 33:12.160
This is an incredibly flawed system and the conversation about it is done a disservice

33:12.160 --> 33:15.960
by having Alex try to grandstand about imaginary kindergartners

33:15.960 --> 33:19.560
Thankfully there are other adults discussing these sorts of issues in terms of reality

33:19.560 --> 33:23.960
and adjustments were made no thanks to Alex's idiotic fake advocacy

33:23.960 --> 33:30.440
Yeah yeah like it's such a huge issue too when you consider the school to prison pipeline

33:30.440 --> 33:35.840
and how so many things are meant to criminalize children at an early enough age so you can

33:35.840 --> 33:42.120
just keep them criminals forever and use them as fuel for the capitalist mill

33:42.120 --> 33:47.080
But Alex clearly one only cares about white kids so there's a problem there

33:47.080 --> 33:52.880
And two is just he's not dealing with any of the larger problem he's just like ah they're

33:52.880 --> 33:55.880
criminalizing kindergartners and you're like oh fuck

33:55.880 --> 34:02.520
I think that this has an interesting intersection of that school to prison pipeline idea which

34:02.520 --> 34:04.920
is definitely real and an issue

34:04.920 --> 34:05.920
Totally

34:05.920 --> 34:10.480
And also misguided but well intentioned ideas

34:10.480 --> 34:11.480
Yes

34:11.480 --> 34:17.360
I do think that some people who may not be trying to criminalize children think they're

34:17.360 --> 34:22.160
like okay if you're in high school and you skip school and you get a fine maybe you'll

34:22.160 --> 34:23.800
be less likely to skip high school

34:23.800 --> 34:24.800
Sure

34:24.800 --> 34:27.120
You know encouraging the right behavior the wrong way

34:27.120 --> 34:28.120
Yeah

34:28.120 --> 34:33.600
I think that there is an element of that but even so no matter what no matter where more

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
of the weight lies

34:34.600 --> 34:35.600
Yeah

34:35.600 --> 34:36.600
Whatever Alex is doing is pointless

34:36.600 --> 34:37.600
Yeah

34:37.600 --> 34:38.600
And it doesn't help solve any of the problems

34:38.600 --> 34:43.200
Yeah no and you can totally imagine like I can get inside the mind of the person who

34:43.200 --> 34:49.240
offered the kid like oh so we'll give you credit for doing jail and that person was

34:49.240 --> 34:54.020
probably thinking they were a genius like see you can't afford to pay it you just do

34:54.020 --> 34:55.020
some jail

34:55.020 --> 34:56.020
Right

34:56.020 --> 34:59.240
I'm helping you out instead of somebody who should have been slapped in the face the moment

34:59.240 --> 35:00.240
they had that thought

35:00.240 --> 35:01.240
Yeah it's

35:01.240 --> 35:02.240
You know

35:02.240 --> 35:03.240
Yeah

35:03.240 --> 35:05.960
The moment you're like hey how about do some time in jail instead of paying me the money

35:05.960 --> 35:08.680
that doesn't make any sense for you to pay me in the first place

35:08.680 --> 35:14.320
Yeah reading that kind of stuff it doesn't make a lot of sense why you would continue

35:14.320 --> 35:16.080
down this road of this policy

35:16.080 --> 35:17.080
Yeah

35:17.080 --> 35:22.880
Yeah anyway Alex mentioned a guy named Chris there and he's a guy named Chris Klicka who's

35:22.880 --> 35:29.840
a lawyer for an organization that is a staunchly conservative Christian organization that is

35:29.840 --> 35:30.840
all about homeschool

35:30.840 --> 35:36.120
That's terrible that's terrible because I would listen to MC Chris Klicka instantly

35:36.120 --> 35:38.160
I would listen to his mixtape

35:38.160 --> 35:39.160
You would not

35:39.160 --> 35:40.320
He drops that oh man

35:40.320 --> 35:41.800
Here's what most of his songs are about

35:41.800 --> 35:42.800
Okay

35:42.800 --> 35:48.560
Those who oppose us those who are anti-parent and the pro-child forces and I don't mean

35:48.560 --> 35:54.040
that in a positive way they're they're trying to take our children through whatever means

35:54.040 --> 35:55.040
they can

35:55.040 --> 36:00.240
Well let's face it there's also a big move to take people's children to give it to homosexuals

36:00.240 --> 36:01.240
Oh yeah

36:01.240 --> 36:02.240
Oh boy

36:02.240 --> 36:03.240
Oh yeah

36:03.240 --> 36:04.240
Okay

36:04.240 --> 36:05.240
Oh boy

36:05.240 --> 36:07.960
So yeah this is this is the way this manifested in 2003

36:07.960 --> 36:11.240
Yeah that's not as good of a mixtape as I was hoping

36:11.240 --> 36:12.240
No

36:12.240 --> 36:15.560
No no that was not the coloring book that was

36:15.560 --> 36:22.800
Yeah so apparently this a lot of this stuff with these schools and the truancy and the

36:22.800 --> 36:28.080
punishment and the that gets the social services involved and all this and part of it is that

36:28.080 --> 36:30.840
there's a major push to take your kids and give them to homosexuals

36:30.840 --> 36:31.840
Sure sure

36:31.840 --> 36:32.840
Again

36:32.840 --> 36:39.080
The homosexual agenda is running amok in 2003 because that is where the edge that the conservative

36:39.080 --> 36:40.080
panic is playing

36:40.080 --> 36:43.360
Yep yep these people are silly children

36:43.360 --> 36:44.360
Mm-hmm

36:44.360 --> 36:48.440
They it's so weird to go back into the past and listen to these people and think you're

36:48.440 --> 36:53.680
still allowed to talk aren't you people still listen to you you listen to that and you're

36:53.680 --> 36:58.600
like really we're doing that back then yeah and you're still around

36:58.600 --> 36:59.600
It's pretty wild

36:59.600 --> 37:00.600
How?

37:00.600 --> 37:01.600
Mm-hmm

37:01.600 --> 37:05.600
And it's just a conservative edge grift mill is just so endless

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
Yep

37:06.600 --> 37:07.600
And it's the same shit

37:07.600 --> 37:12.080
Yep it's the same it's the same shit with just slightly different window dressing

37:12.080 --> 37:14.800
Put different little ingredients into the same stew

37:14.800 --> 37:15.800
Yep

37:15.800 --> 37:16.800
Shit

37:16.800 --> 37:18.880
So if you go to the hospital and you're gonna give birth

37:18.880 --> 37:19.880
Sure

37:19.880 --> 37:21.120
These social service people

37:21.120 --> 37:24.640
I'm gonna take the yeah no I'm gonna steal those kids and I'm gonna give them to homosexuals

37:24.640 --> 37:25.640
I believe

37:25.640 --> 37:26.880
They're very least gonna take the kids

37:26.880 --> 37:27.880
Yeah well

37:27.880 --> 37:29.320
Yeah this is worse than the Soviet Union

37:29.320 --> 37:30.320
Oh yeah

37:30.320 --> 37:34.000
You go and you have what's that already is here they're stalking the hospitals they've

37:34.000 --> 37:38.960
got plants in there they get a cut and the people look ignorant man their kids are gone

37:38.960 --> 37:39.960
That's right

37:39.960 --> 37:43.200
I mean if you look ignorant man it's oh they walk in and go please sign here well what

37:43.200 --> 37:46.600
are you doing just work with us everything will be all right you sign it they grab your

37:46.600 --> 37:48.160
kid and go ha ha ha I mean literally

37:48.160 --> 37:49.560
Uh-huh

37:49.560 --> 37:54.960
I don't know and Alex does not expound on what it means to look ignorant in this in

37:54.960 --> 37:55.960
this case

37:55.960 --> 37:56.960
Yeah I think we

37:56.960 --> 38:00.240
I don't know I honestly don't know what he means it it does not make sense

38:00.240 --> 38:03.280
It's true that's true it really doesn't make any sense

38:03.280 --> 38:04.280
Nope

38:04.280 --> 38:05.280
Nope

38:05.280 --> 38:12.200
I just don't you know people listen to that and they don't hear people who are whining

38:12.200 --> 38:17.600
like crazy people like this is insane like do you know what's going on now I went to

38:17.600 --> 38:22.840
the DMV to re-up my license and instead of giving me a new license they shit in my mouth

38:22.840 --> 38:24.960
they shit directly into my mouth

38:24.960 --> 38:25.960
Literally

38:25.960 --> 38:30.300
The lid you know they put me down they held me down they had me on a gurney and somebody

38:30.300 --> 38:32.320
shit directly into my mouth

38:32.320 --> 38:33.320
I have documents

38:33.320 --> 38:37.480
From it was they were on a ladder and it was it dropped for a while

38:37.480 --> 38:39.840
I have a notarized witnesses signature

38:39.840 --> 38:44.000
Yeah it's like what are you talking about right you sound ridiculous

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Yeah

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
You're children

38:46.000 --> 38:55.360
Yeah yeah it's it's pretty wild and and when you talk about that it gets into like okay

38:55.360 --> 38:59.160
well obviously Alex nowadays would call them the devil

38:59.160 --> 39:00.160
Yeah yeah

39:00.160 --> 39:01.360
That's what he would do nowadays

39:01.360 --> 39:02.360
Yep

39:02.360 --> 39:04.880
But in 2003 people who mix that stuff up

39:04.880 --> 39:06.520
Oh they're they're

39:06.520 --> 39:07.520
That's the poison pill

39:07.520 --> 39:08.520
It's too far

39:08.520 --> 39:11.000
That's how you make the Patriots and all this look bad

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah

39:12.000 --> 39:17.240
A caller calls in and wants to talk about the social service workers and he thinks that

39:17.240 --> 39:18.240
they are demons

39:18.240 --> 39:20.040
Okay okay here we go

39:20.040 --> 39:22.320
Now here is Alex's response

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
All right

39:23.320 --> 39:29.740
When people hear statements that these people are diabolic they are of the devil just listening

39:29.740 --> 39:36.720
to you talk about the guidelines when you went through your training proves that they

39:36.720 --> 39:42.440
are your first three guidelines were totally unscriptural anti-scriptural it goes against

39:42.440 --> 39:48.080
the creator and our instructions for life and they are of the devil and Alex you're

39:48.080 --> 39:50.160
right on the money with that these people are

39:50.160 --> 39:56.720
I'm gonna be honest I've covered them been around them and you know this is a news program

39:56.720 --> 40:01.360
but when you're around them they really are demonic I mean I'm gonna be I mean these are

40:01.360 --> 40:06.240
at least what I've seen these are degenerate scum that's all I can say about them

40:06.240 --> 40:07.800
That's kind of measured

40:07.800 --> 40:08.800
Yeah

40:08.800 --> 40:15.440
They're demonic that's an adjective this is a news show

40:15.440 --> 40:16.440
Isn't that interesting

40:16.440 --> 40:17.920
I too appreciate that

40:17.920 --> 40:19.680
He's trying to walk a line

40:19.680 --> 40:20.680
Yeah

40:20.680 --> 40:25.840
He knows he knows that like I can't fucking present myself as a guy who's saying that

40:25.840 --> 40:27.920
my enemies politically are devils

40:27.920 --> 40:31.520
Yeah I won't be taken seriously I won't be taken seriously

40:31.520 --> 40:35.360
Yeah I have some pretense of wanting to be respected

40:35.360 --> 40:36.360
Yeah

40:36.360 --> 40:40.880
Oh man I think I might be able to get a show on an actual network at some point

40:40.880 --> 40:46.420
Yeah that is that is interesting and I mean what's kind of interesting about it is that

40:46.420 --> 40:52.800
at the time I think he's right you couldn't be out and out the demons are coming to kill

40:52.800 --> 40:53.800
us all

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
Yeah probably not

40:54.800 --> 40:55.800
And people wouldn't take you seriously

40:55.800 --> 40:58.600
Well I think Alex certainly didn't have a big enough career

40:58.600 --> 40:59.600
Right

40:59.600 --> 41:03.760
He wasn't a big enough star to be able to absorb whatever blow might come from that

41:03.760 --> 41:08.160
And then I would say probably right around what like the tea party movement whenever

41:08.160 --> 41:13.760
they swept in 2010 that's really when it all was like started a change where you could

41:13.760 --> 41:16.040
just talk about demons all all you want

41:16.040 --> 41:19.640
Well I mean what is that Hunter S. Thompson quote when the going gets weird the weird

41:19.640 --> 41:20.640
turn pro

41:20.640 --> 41:21.640
The weird turn pro you got it

41:21.640 --> 41:24.200
You know when the normal is the tea party on the right

41:24.200 --> 41:25.200
Yeah

41:25.200 --> 41:26.400
You know whatever you are as Alex Jones

41:26.400 --> 41:27.400
Gotta go weirder

41:27.400 --> 41:28.560
Gotta escalate a little bit

41:28.560 --> 41:29.560
Yep

41:29.560 --> 41:36.320
Yeah I don't know I obviously don't know for sure if that is when sort of more overt conversation

41:36.320 --> 41:37.920
about demons and shit happen

41:37.920 --> 41:38.920
Yeah

41:38.920 --> 41:40.720
Because I don't think it did I think it was later

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
You think so?

41:41.720 --> 41:47.400
Yeah I think that we did not see nearly as much these people are the fucking devil when

41:47.400 --> 41:48.840
we were looking at 2015

41:48.840 --> 41:50.200
That's true that is true

41:50.200 --> 41:53.080
So I think I think it might be more recent than that

41:53.080 --> 41:54.080
Yeah

41:54.080 --> 42:01.120
But I find I find this glimpse at 2003 really really interesting and this next clip I think

42:01.120 --> 42:03.000
Alex has to stop himself

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Interesting

42:04.000 --> 42:06.160
From saying that these people are demons

42:06.160 --> 42:07.160
Okay

42:07.160 --> 42:11.960
And this clip would not stick out to me at all if I didn't know what he does now

42:11.960 --> 42:18.960
So so what you're telling me is that like a demon trying to get out he wants to call

42:18.960 --> 42:22.240
these people demons okay just just putting that out there

42:22.240 --> 42:27.240
And so imagine being at the hospital you've already got your four other kids with family

42:27.240 --> 42:36.120
and friends you're there your babies are hanging on for life and literal I'm sorry creatures

42:36.120 --> 42:42.040
show up and are cornering you with their beady eyes what parent frankly what parent wouldn't

42:42.040 --> 42:43.320
probably fluff out at that point

42:43.320 --> 42:44.320
Doesn't that sound

42:44.320 --> 42:46.840
Literal demons he was about to say literal demons

42:46.840 --> 42:47.840
He was

42:47.840 --> 42:55.360
About to say literal demons I'm screaming at you through the future you I mean you were

42:55.360 --> 42:56.720
there the whole time

42:56.720 --> 43:03.520
Doesn't that sound almost like someone had told him dude don't fucking say that you're

43:03.520 --> 43:07.680
fighting the devil we need like Ted Anderson told him there's no way we're gonna be able

43:07.680 --> 43:13.120
to sell gold with you yelling about the literal devil because he said sorry he said literal

43:13.120 --> 43:15.680
long pause sorry creatures

43:15.680 --> 43:23.140
Yep wild and see this is this is a piece of evidence circumstantial obviously yes not

43:23.140 --> 43:29.000
definitive but it works towards answering the question that I have had for a while which

43:29.000 --> 43:34.800
is is Alex's I'm fighting the devil thing a new thing right or is it something that

43:34.800 --> 43:39.520
was there underneath all along and he was pretending that that wasn't what he believed

43:39.520 --> 43:41.600
and I kind of think that this looks like

43:41.600 --> 43:46.240
It's not smoking gun but I'll be goddamn if it doesn't really sound like you're on the

43:46.240 --> 43:51.240
right track gumshoe

43:51.240 --> 43:56.640
It feels like that is at least a minor indication that Alex has this idea that his enemies are

43:56.640 --> 44:02.280
literal demons yeah and he was covering that belief up for the sake of appearing respectable

44:02.280 --> 44:07.520
yeah yeah and I'm interested to see if there's any more flickers of that indications but

44:07.520 --> 44:09.960
that made me that's laugh really hard

44:09.960 --> 44:14.320
perks your ears up yeah yeah but isn't it interesting too that like that clip would

44:14.320 --> 44:22.080
not be at all it wouldn't sound off any alarms unless you knew that 18 years later yeah screaming

44:22.080 --> 44:27.200
about literal demons everywhere all the time all the time yeah that's so ridiculous yeah

44:27.200 --> 44:33.240
I'm oh that's annoying I don't I don't like that he's a liar I'm mad at him in the past

44:33.240 --> 44:38.200
for lying to me Dan you should be up front if you think your enemies are literal demons

44:38.200 --> 44:43.720
you should tell me yeah front yeah I think it would be more responsible to the audience

44:43.720 --> 44:49.360
yeah because don't you don't you tell me that you're hiding that there are literal demons

44:49.360 --> 44:53.800
everywhere because you're supposed to be the truth teller right on your own show yeah and

44:53.800 --> 44:58.040
you're pulling back whenever you know that literal demons are killing everybody don't

44:58.040 --> 45:02.620
Trojan horse the literal demons at the talk of like the Federal Reserve and all this stuff

45:02.620 --> 45:08.960
that's not fair to the audience totally anyway yeah Alex is a guy who's against the Iraq

45:08.960 --> 45:14.080
war totally totally against the Iraq war but since it weirdly fine with the idea of deposing

45:14.080 --> 45:18.120
Saddam Hussein in this next I mean you gotta I tell you what I just got I just I can't

45:18.120 --> 45:24.280
believe it I can't believe people we had operation Iraqi freedom okay great Saddam's a thug great

45:24.280 --> 45:29.080
can't we have operation American freedom yeah why not you know Bush wanted to turn all this

45:29.080 --> 45:33.640
around here but he didn't he put more funding into the Department of Education all these

45:33.640 --> 45:40.760
other groups and I can't we we have the conservative the real conservative backbone to do it how

45:40.760 --> 45:46.320
Chris do we force the Republicans that control everything now to finally get rid of abortion

45:46.320 --> 45:52.560
to finally just acts these social workers how do we do it so apparently we want operation

45:52.560 --> 45:57.820
American freedom right in the mold of operation Iraqi free exactly and that involves getting

45:57.820 --> 46:06.320
rid of social workers right abortion there we go okay we did it that is a complex series

46:06.320 --> 46:12.160
of steps you need to get to those three things being related to each other at all I don't

46:12.160 --> 46:18.600
like it no I don't like it I don't like these callers I don't like this guest no no I think

46:18.600 --> 46:25.120
these people are literal demons no no I've been hiding that belief this whole time so

46:25.120 --> 46:31.240
this caller has some bad things to say sure I'll just say bad sure sure sitting here listening

46:31.240 --> 46:36.880
to Alex you asked him a few of the questions he answered for me one aspect about this demonic

46:36.880 --> 46:43.040
side of it one place in the scripture where Messiah got very angry and that was when with

46:43.040 --> 46:47.520
children he said you suffer these children to come to me for such as the kingdom of heaven

46:47.520 --> 46:51.720
and these people are not letting them come to him they're like doing what Alex said they

46:51.720 --> 46:59.000
learning Islam and all kinds of a multi cultural crap it's called math Virginia Chris I'm in

46:59.000 --> 47:02.960
Virginia weird weird question that's a very strange thing yeah that's a very strange thing

47:02.960 --> 47:10.760
to add on hey hey where are you by the way yeah I think that this is a bit more anti-Muslim

47:10.760 --> 47:15.080
than I expected it to be yeah because I think the presentation that Alex has is very much

47:15.080 --> 47:21.840
like and I had no problem with Islam or anything like and I think I got the sense that his

47:21.840 --> 47:27.680
his anti-islam stuff kind of escalated yeah and to be fair you know that's coming from

47:27.680 --> 47:35.800
his caller yeah but yeah yeah that doesn't surprise me I'm I would be Islam in the schools

47:35.800 --> 47:40.640
saying that Islam is just multicultural crap yeah like it's what the fuck is this freedom

47:40.640 --> 47:46.240
prize just yeah whatever you want just just fucking shut up yeah so this caller wants

47:46.240 --> 47:50.880
to know where in Virginia Chris's organization is and they Alex has to stop now I'll tell

47:50.880 --> 47:55.400
you they told my son to find the square root of something roots are in the backyard my

47:55.400 --> 47:59.420
friend that's devil worship that's what I'm telling you right now go find the square root

47:59.420 --> 48:06.760
of Vega get digging why don't you go find a switch so yeah they chat about where they

48:06.760 --> 48:13.680
are in Virginia and Alex has to be like guys what are we doing why did you ask him so unfortunately

48:13.680 --> 48:18.840
they end up stopping that very pleasant conversation it does sound nice to take another call that

48:18.840 --> 48:24.280
might have been a mistake oh very good guest you got on there today I wanted to ask him

48:24.280 --> 48:30.300
a couple of questions because I know that there is that the when we won when an American

48:30.300 --> 48:35.600
becomes a 14th amendment citizen our status of law changes because we are no longer sovereign

48:35.600 --> 48:40.200
freemen and have exercised sovereignty are talking about privileges instead of rights

48:40.200 --> 48:44.440
and you only have about a minute left what's your other question well I wanted to ask him

48:44.440 --> 48:50.000
how he approaches the legal defense standpoint for you know from that particular thing he

48:50.000 --> 48:53.520
got asked this question a year ago on this show and he said from a constitutional perspective

48:53.520 --> 48:59.560
correct that's right that does not answer the question no no it seems like there's a

48:59.560 --> 49:04.680
fair amount of sovereign citizen callers at this point I like this career it is it is

49:04.680 --> 49:10.160
funny because it seems like he also really doesn't like them the well I think he recognizes

49:10.160 --> 49:14.680
how silly a lot of the arguments are and how they make it look bad what he's doing at the

49:14.680 --> 49:20.640
same time he's making a show that is essentially catering directly to sovereign citizens yeah

49:20.640 --> 49:24.040
yeah there's a lot of yeah and actually there I didn't have any clips of this because it

49:24.040 --> 49:29.000
was just too all over the place but a good maybe half hour of this episode is dedicated

49:29.000 --> 49:34.340
to Alex arguing with a caller about the Republic of Texas sure there's this idea that like

49:34.340 --> 49:39.160
Texas should secede and he's like yeah I tried to support all that stuff but everybody kept

49:39.160 --> 49:47.340
declaring themselves the president it's really funny but at the same time there was no way

49:47.340 --> 49:53.080
to cut clips in a way that would make it work it's so funny it's so all right fine I could

49:53.080 --> 49:58.100
just declare myself a president maybe I'm a general I don't know who to get in touch

49:58.100 --> 50:04.940
with and he keeps calling them fruitcakes I he called he uses the term fruitcakes to

50:04.940 --> 50:10.520
describe the Republic of Texas people like maybe five or six times yeah very specific

50:10.520 --> 50:15.820
wording yeah made me think maybe he has a personal beef with somebody it's it is it's

50:15.820 --> 50:22.640
kind of funny it's it's a little bit like somebody like starting a roller rink and then

50:22.640 --> 50:29.320
like just hating people who roller skate yeah or like hating hating people who use like

50:29.320 --> 50:36.760
uh inline skates yeah yeah yeah this is a four wheel only yes yeah yeah the law says

50:36.760 --> 50:44.220
I have to let you skate okay this is America not according to the Magna Carta what so Chris

50:44.220 --> 50:50.200
Chris leaves he was not that much of an interesting guest just kind of like very reactionary against

50:50.200 --> 50:56.760
social workers pro homeschooling did not drop a mixtape did not yeah warned everyone about

50:56.760 --> 51:01.920
the homosexuals come to take your children sure sure very different cool so Alex gets

51:01.920 --> 51:08.760
to some headlines and this one is a load of shit we're back live we're going into a world

51:08.760 --> 51:12.720
where you're a good decent person you're an enemy of the state because you're not you're

51:12.720 --> 51:18.180
not a criminal they can't trust you you might fight what they're doing you might fight the

51:18.180 --> 51:24.240
world they're setting up that's right that's what happens when the evil are in control

51:24.240 --> 51:31.020
government lawyers say burglars need protection this is one independent by Robert Verkart

51:31.020 --> 51:36.960
legal affairs correspondent government lawyers trying to keep the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin

51:36.960 --> 51:43.460
behind bars will tell a high court judge tomorrow that burglars are members of the public who

51:43.460 --> 51:49.420
must be protected from violent house holders so Alex is misrepresenting this case that

51:49.420 --> 51:53.680
he's covering to make it appear that it the system is now just out to protect criminals

51:53.680 --> 51:57.520
and punish the good people which is code for white Christians hey if people aren't committing

51:57.520 --> 52:02.920
crimes you can't trust him so this is an article about Tony Martin a man from the UK who shot

52:02.920 --> 52:06.480
at two young men who were breaking into his house which resulted in the death of one of

52:06.480 --> 52:11.440
them the issue here isn't that Tony was wrong to practice self-defense it's that the court

52:11.440 --> 52:16.280
didn't believe that he was acting in self-defense in the shooting the incident happened in 1999

52:16.280 --> 52:20.400
at which point Martin did not have a license for the shotgun he used in the shooting problem

52:20.400 --> 52:24.320
number one he'd lost it five years prior when he supposedly found a man stealing apples

52:24.320 --> 52:28.440
from his orchard and proceeded to shoot at him leaving a hole in the man's vehicle hey

52:28.440 --> 52:35.060
a point of order you you know added to this was Martin's very publicly known hatred of

52:35.060 --> 52:40.340
the Romani people who which was referenced in a Guardian article from 2000 quote apart

52:40.340 --> 52:45.160
from thieves Martin's pet hate was gypsies nor which crown court heard that the farmer

52:45.160 --> 52:48.600
had talked of putting gypsies in the middle of a field surrounding it with barbed wire

52:48.600 --> 52:53.120
and machine gunning them the article goes on to say that Martin had said quote Hitler

52:53.120 --> 52:58.080
was right about these people and also points out that Martin's uncle Andrew Fontaine was

52:58.080 --> 53:02.840
one of the founders of the straight-up fascist National Front right right right so he was

53:02.840 --> 53:09.120
a Nazi the prosecution the problem here the prosecution successfully argued that the shooting

53:09.120 --> 53:12.920
was not an act of self-defense but that Martin had laid in wait and shot these intruders

53:12.920 --> 53:17.020
without first giving a warning this wasn't the sort of case that Alex is portraying it

53:17.020 --> 53:21.560
to be where the burglar is hurt by someone practicing legitimate self-defense and then

53:21.560 --> 53:26.200
sues the homeowner for it it's a clearly unhinged lunatic with a history of shooting at people

53:26.200 --> 53:30.580
with a clearly racist past using deadly force against intruders to his home who had not

53:30.580 --> 53:37.920
presented a mortal danger to him and according to the British courts that was not an acceptable

53:37.920 --> 53:42.200
use of self-defense yeah I'm gonna go with yeah yeah so I don't know I Alex tries to

53:42.200 --> 53:46.000
play this game where it's like yeah you know if someone breaks into your house and they

53:46.000 --> 53:51.240
slip on a banana peel they can sue you or something like no they can't no no they really

53:51.240 --> 53:56.920
really can't you have to kind of go way out of your way to be the one who's convicted

53:56.920 --> 54:03.600
of a crime in that scenario and that's what this guy did yeah if someone is like presenting

54:03.600 --> 54:08.840
a danger to you you do have the right to self-defense if someone does not and they're in your house

54:08.840 --> 54:13.960
you have to tell them to leave before you shoot them dead I would try I would I would

54:13.960 --> 54:21.880
open with excuse me that would be yeah so Alex has some very interesting similar problems

54:21.880 --> 54:29.400
in his life in 2003 as he does in the present sure one is that boy these calls just don't

54:29.400 --> 54:37.680
work out the difference though is in 2003 Alex could handle it sure grace yeah let's

54:37.680 --> 54:46.840
just go ahead and talk to go ahead and talk to yes Mike in Illinois and then tip Oh Tim

54:46.840 --> 54:58.960
in Texas is next okay well you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna talk to Mike in Illinois

54:58.960 --> 55:07.160
Mike in Illinois are you there okay he's not there who did you want me to go to Tim in

55:07.160 --> 55:14.800
Texas all righty you're on the air Tim Alex how you doing pretty good I quit wow wow

55:14.800 --> 55:20.640
that is such a normal that's a breath of fresh air just being like oh this is a minor setback

55:20.640 --> 55:26.240
and we're off to the next one I quit not a big deal we're just going to rebroadcast

55:26.240 --> 55:32.240
this is annoying but hey everybody bear with me yeah that's the vibe that I got there everybody

55:32.240 --> 55:37.280
bear with me as opposed to doing a live radio show all failed me yeah we're doing live radio

55:37.280 --> 55:41.240
show sometimes there's a little bit of a hiccup this happens yeah that's normal that's called

55:41.240 --> 55:47.360
professionally Alex present-day not normal no no no so you know there was that talk with

55:47.360 --> 55:55.960
the Texas folks about how they're all weirdos and sure one's the president yeah but everybody

55:55.960 --> 56:03.720
can secede if they want sure Alex is very pro secession natural 2003 yeah Indiana you

56:03.720 --> 56:07.620
know has the right to secede it's not just Texas or Hawaii Texas and Hawaii have stronger

56:07.620 --> 56:13.780
cases because from the beginning they never signed the contracts but but but but still

56:13.780 --> 56:18.960
sir it's a Civil War question they will send federal troops in they will lay seas they

56:18.960 --> 56:25.620
will burn cities and the average person people were a hundred times more educated about real

56:25.620 --> 56:33.620
politics and liberty in the 1860s and they are now that's correct in the 1860s the Confederacy

56:33.620 --> 56:38.220
was full of New World Order moles was designed to lose from the beginning responded by the

56:38.220 --> 56:43.900
British to break the country up both sides were controlled in that that's true so apparently

56:43.900 --> 56:52.120
the the confederacy was full of globalists I do I do like how people who study the Civil

56:52.120 --> 57:00.040
War so obsessively change their story all the time quite quite frequently usually when

57:00.040 --> 57:05.880
you study something you refine it and the story becomes clearer and the picture is easier

57:05.880 --> 57:11.080
to understand and you have a full awareness of what's going on New World Order moles whereas

57:11.080 --> 57:16.300
it seems as though their study of the Civil War involves just rewriting it to whatever

57:16.300 --> 57:22.540
it is you want it to be at any given point in time even if it's the same day what if

57:22.540 --> 57:26.580
it's like you what if you find something that sounds more fun how can you be global how

57:26.580 --> 57:32.980
can you be Confederate royalty if your royalty is just infiltrated by New World Order globalist

57:32.980 --> 57:38.540
it's not like everybody was New World Order and how is it possible for everyone to be

57:38.540 --> 57:45.540
just so well informed when the national rate of reading is like 10% listen it was the New

57:45.540 --> 57:49.700
World Order was run in the Confederacy okay fair enough uh look dude false flag Civil

57:49.700 --> 57:55.260
War that's pretty much what he said yes yeah he said it was a false flag Civil War everything

57:55.260 --> 58:05.100
is fake nothing is real except Alex's conviction to the truth yes yes yeah yep yep wow oh boy

58:05.100 --> 58:09.620
Confederate false flag Civil War yep should have seen it coming I should have so there's

58:09.620 --> 58:13.340
a commercial for the Genesis Communications Network sure and I think that this I just

58:13.340 --> 58:18.020
wanted to play this a little bit of it because it sounds really weird is mainstream media

58:18.020 --> 58:22.420
telling you everything you should know about the war on terror what is our real interest

58:22.420 --> 58:26.980
in Iraq and Saddam Hussein who stands to gain if we give up our freedoms in the name of

58:26.980 --> 58:32.020
national security who's behind the manipulation of our financial markets and why we're the

58:32.020 --> 58:36.940
jury you be the judge we're the GCN radio network are you tired of being lied to by

58:36.940 --> 58:42.380
mainstream media well so are we and we're doing something about it we're the jury you're

58:42.380 --> 58:50.540
the judge uh what does that mean we've already decided and you have to pass the sentencing

58:50.540 --> 58:59.340
who's the executioner uh double back to we again also the jury doesn't talk are you like

58:59.340 --> 59:06.740
the prosecution metaphor sucks uh your honor the jury has something to say and they say

59:06.740 --> 59:12.340
no no the jury does not the audience is the jury you do not get to be the jury we're

59:12.340 --> 59:19.660
the attorneys you're the jury somebody on the jury just stands up hey I think I can

59:19.660 --> 59:23.540
do a better job of this lawyer and shit get this prosecutor out of here somebody wrote

59:23.540 --> 59:27.440
that because like judge jury and executioner is an expression it's like this sounds pretty

59:27.440 --> 59:35.980
good yeah uh didn't think about it for even one second no no using good job GCN Ted probably

59:35.980 --> 59:41.860
wrote that so Alex comes back and he's got to be in his bonnet because there's a holiday

59:41.860 --> 59:49.340
that bush right uh-huh George W the evil one yeah he's got this holiday well I mean they're

59:49.340 --> 59:53.660
both evil he's got this holiday the whole family's dude honest it's not about them it's

59:53.660 --> 59:57.800
about this holiday about the holiday listen to this one neo colonialism is the new world

59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.600
order and they're coming right out with this in mainstream news oh don't worry the White

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.660
House is going to have loyalty day loyalty to the government day to be celebrated in

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:14.140
all the schools and nationwide that's terrifying it says our children will be taught that the

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:19.180
nation is a force for good in the world extending hope and freedom to others being part of the

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:25.020
Imperial Army to grab all natural resources and enslave everyone's children sure loyalty

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.420
day coach and the person that sent me this email and I went to the White House and got

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.700
the actual article that written by the White House it said when do I get my black boots

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:38.200
and dagger you know like the Nazis right right right right but it sounds real good loyalty

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.540
learning that we're this this good force in the world now loyalty to the government so

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:47.620
two things that jumped out at me there like the first is that in 2003 Alex is clearly

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:52.500
fully aware of the colonial exploitation that is part of our country's history yeah he completely

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.560
denies totally in the present and the second thing I was thinking is like man he would

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.220
be totally fine with a holiday called loyalty day if it was like a nationalist extreme right-wing

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.860
government everyone had to be loyal yeah yeah on loyalty day we have a big military parade

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:13.260
oh I love loyalty days my favorite day there's bombs yeah if it was his thing what a what

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:18.100
a fucked up thing to have a loyalty day do you know how that's so fucked up it would

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:24.660
be like if every morning kids had to go to school and recite some sort of yeah every

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:30.020
morning that would be so fucked up be very weird yeah loyalty day is just one yeah also

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:34.100
I would be remiss if I didn't point out that loyalty day is a holiday that's existed since

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:39.980
1921 and it was an attempt to replace the communist leaning May Day or as it's also

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.640
known International Workers Day that holiday marks the date of the Haymarket riot which

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.060
was something that the American government in the early 1900s was eager to not glorify

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:55.420
we don't want to talk about workers uniting we are still mad there's a weekend so yeah

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.700
they didn't want to endorse workers rights which of course was communism and so there

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:05.360
was this idea of loyalty day coming in on May 1st to take over for May Day yep the holiday

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.220
itself didn't catch on until 1955 during the Cold War Red Scare when Eisenhower made it

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:15.080
an official holiday in the United States and every president since 1958 has recognized

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.040
and proclaimed the holiday see if you can guess who said this quote now therefore I

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.220
Donald J Trump president of the United States of America do hereby proclaim May 1st 2017

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:30.180
as loyalty day this loyalty day I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:34.220
ceremonies in our schools and other public places including the recitation of the Pledge

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.460
of Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America I also call upon all government

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.180
officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings and grounds

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:51.420
on that day who said it ah I gotta go with Clinton do so close Trump oh every time yeah

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:56.260
I thought you were trying to trick me nope it was not a trick so the very ideology that

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:01.080
created Alex Jones is the same ideology that created the idea of a holiday called loyalty

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.380
day to express loyalty to the United States in the face of a communist menace exactly

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.860
Alex understands so little about the hysteria and insanity that created his political identity

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:16.020
that here he is rambling about the direct result of his ideological forefathers and

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.280
pretending it's some kind of an evil event that Bush wanted to create he's much more

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.460
palatable and seems happier in 2003 and he doesn't freak out when he can't get to a caller

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:29.900
but he's still a total idiot yeah it's almost as if conservative reactionary ideology is

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:35.420
essentially an ouroboros that creates an outrage and then later on gets outraged when they're

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:40.780
outraged created a thing for them to get outraged about yeah and as I understand in 2017 there

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:45.460
was like some people who were you know like Trump is creating loyalty day is a fucked

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:50.780
up holiday the pledge of allegiance yeah but if you trick yourself into thinking that this

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:55.940
is the first one ever or whatever or you present it that way then you deprive all the context

01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:01.640
of it yeah and you're just using it as a as a prop yeah and it's it also seems almost

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:08.020
a little insulting I think to to imagine that in whatever year it is that was the first

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:13.880
year they thought of loyalty day listen we've had plenty of fascists run in America for

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.960
a long time they've thought of loyalty day every time workers tried to unite they were

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.940
like okay here's what we got to do pledge loyalty the to the 120 hour work week like

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.180
that's what they were doing yeah it's the it's the byproduct of anti-communist freak

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:38.540
out yeah and so is Alex yeah exactly yeah so stupid yep so one of the other differences

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:43.940
that I found when I was looking at this episode between present-day Alex and back then is

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:48.980
he seems like to understand that movies aren't real at least a little bit interesting folks

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:53.940
we're in the twilight zone somebody listen to me it's it's like in the 1950s version

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.840
of the body snackers you know where the doctor goes to town they've taken over he bust out

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:05.920
he's running he's in traffic up the highway wake up they're after you there we're in danger

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:16.700
somebody listen to us oh it's so scary it's like that yes yes it's similar to this it

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:22.660
is not a reference the plan and they were not telling it to you by releasing that movie

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:27.940
yeah yeah it's uh that's just a corollary yeah there's a disconnect between this idea

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:35.180
that's represented in media and reality as opposed to them merging together in some weird

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:43.100
to use an Alex Jones word gestalt yeah yeah it's nice to hear people know the difference

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:48.980
between movies and realities it's comforting yeah at least because when I listen to this

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:56.780
I can be like all right we all agree that we breathe air yeah that's there the time

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:03.940
moves yes entropy is real yeah okay and that's comforting because I don't feel bad in the

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:09.520
present I definitely don't it is it is a real bummer going into the past and finding things

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.460
that are more positive than the present because you're like you want to live in a place where

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:19.060
hope exists but when we do this we're like man isn't that nice and then you remember

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:23.460
where it goes and you're like oh it could happen it could happen to you it could happen

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:29.100
to all of us at any point in time you could just forget how movies work yeah that is that

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:34.140
is a little bit scary it's it's humbling you know there but for the grace of uh literal

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:39.460
demons go high we should all be careful to not hide uh that we secretly think that we're

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:45.060
fighting demons if you think you are fighting demons tell someone yes you try to keep it

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:51.460
a secret for too long you turn into Alex Alex in the present yeah we've got a perfect example

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:56.820
oh boy you are what you pretend to be gonna figure out a way to make an infomercial out

01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:02.540
of that lesson not sure or not an infomercial like uh sure what am I thinking of uh psa

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:10.380
that's it yeah psa yep yep so Alex believes that the us is evil sure but he loves the

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:14.000
united states there is a problem there I was listening to this next clip and I just got

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.980
confused this is a such an evil evil country I love this country but when you really face

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:26.040
how bad things have gotten and how there's this icky facade everything's good mom and

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.400
apple pie patriotism it's not real it's as fake as those plastic chinese flags it's as

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:36.420
fake as the boxes that said made in usa and st louis when bush gave that speech with the

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:44.220
made in china taped over it is a rotten facade under it is maggots and rotten meat the stench

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:52.420
of this thing is just everywhere it's freaking me out we gotta warn people we gotta stand

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:58.740
up for america we gotta fight with this country I just love this country so much I love my

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:04.620
family so much and I can't believe we let it get to this when Alex fake cries in 2003

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:09.660
he's doing a Clinton impression I was I was like is that Phil Hartman doing Clinton yeah

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:15.340
is that a wonder I really heard Phil Hartman there yeah when he's faking emotion it sounds

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:23.340
like a bad Clinton now bill I think that you're doing a great job yeah we gotta warn people

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.920
it's ridiculous it's so silly so I thought that was weird and I thought that was like

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:33.980
a completely artificial presentation of emotion and sincerity totally but I started to think

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:41.500
like okay so there's some there's some patriotism and apple pie and all this is is a facade

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:47.580
yeah and underneath it is just rotting maggots and what have you sure what do you love them

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:57.620
like what do you think he loves it's right there in the title if he's saying that like

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:05.240
this country is evil right right but he loves it right but it's a rotten thing like a fake

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.740
lid on it yeah isn't he is he just saying I love the lid yeah he likes the lid make

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.420
that why not make the whole plane out of the black box Dan what do you what do you not

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:19.740
understand I don't fully understand what it is that like he's hoping hoping to save if

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:26.640
it's rotting underneath with a fake yeah it seems like yeah you'd expose the you take

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.900
the lid off and you'd realize oh yeah maybe we should go I don't need I don't need what's

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:37.940
in this rotting it seems weird I don't yeah I don't feel fully that I understand yeah

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:43.140
yet from listening to this like what it is that's like what is what isn't rotten totally

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:48.940
to be saved right I would guess that it's guns sure property rights loyalty to your

01:09:48.940 --> 01:10:00.740
country no absolutely not not yet yeah hating school sure sure sure whites only yeah yeah

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:06.980
I don't I don't have a full grasp of like Alex's entire policy set in 2003 yeah like

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:13.260
I think I understand a lot of stuff through the prism of like listening to thousands of

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:17.120
hours of his other content but like there there's gonna be some stuff that's gonna be

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.520
surprising and I don't want to make too many assumptions yeah you know I was I was listening

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:28.100
to that clip and thinking about all the stories of people who listen to him at this time period

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:34.580
and we're we're kind of drawn in by that and I was thinking about my understanding of politics

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:41.180
at that time like as the Iraq war is going on it totally felt like I was the first person

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:46.620
to discover how evil America was totally it was like I had been told all of this stuff

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.820
all the way up until I'm 16 years old and then the Iraq war happens and they're like

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:56.480
maybe you should read what real history is and not your school stuff and then I it really

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.740
did feel like oh man but this is before red pilling became the meme that it was but it

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:05.980
did feel like that and then you listen to Alex go like this is a rotting thing and you

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:12.460
can you can really get that sense of like yeah that's how I feel yeah I don't have sophisticated

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:17.740
political opinions yet I just know that this is some bullshit yeah yeah you know on a on

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:25.260
a pretty surface level there is a presentation that is almost perfect yes for exploiting

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:30.700
disillusionment yes and and that is definitely a period where there's a lot of people who

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:37.100
are feeling alienated and disillusioned from uh what they had the world as they had been

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.700
brought up to understand it totally and I think that you and I though we're a few years

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:46.580
apart we're both you know a certain men of a certain age when the Iraq war sure sure

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:52.260
we were not wild hogs yet we were youth yes and and that's that's a period where people

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.260
are generally they go through a period of disillusionment of course of course and to

01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:02.740
have that compounded by something as something that should disillusion and yeah yeah yeah

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:08.340
yeah it's it's it's something where you know those feelings that you're having you could

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:15.280
see them mirrored in something like Alex talking about the the rotten core in the facade over

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.780
it yeah you could you could see that and you could gravitate towards that yeah it's interesting

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:24.580
to think about how much goes along with it that you might not realize that you're also

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:29.540
accepting yeah of course like that homosexuals want to take your children worse absolutely

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:34.260
yeah yeah because you that's how liberals got tricked into thinking he wasn't I mean

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:40.020
you're driving you you're listening to this you're you're on a 20-minute drive right you

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:46.960
pop on Infowars because you're like I'm disillusioned and this guy's pretty funny and and you only

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.220
get 20 minutes where he's doing the anti-Iraq war stuff and you don't listen to the half

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:55.900
hour he does with the gays are coming to steal your children you know and you're like arguing

01:12:55.900 --> 01:13:01.780
about the Republic of Texas yeah exactly like you you could totally be sucked into that

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:08.500
and and it's it's much more believable like as like the the notion of like him having

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.420
a large audience if you listen to it in the presence like yeah fuck what in God's name

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:16.700
yeah it's much more believable when you look back at this totally not petulantly having

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:23.340
outbursts all the time right the presentation of emotion is generally within like where

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:29.360
he would want it to be to make a point yes yeah and he's still got that dynamic range

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:34.220
of like he can get it up there high and he can yeah but it's it's not out of control

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:39.980
yeah yeah although it is silly that when he's feigning sincerity he sounds like Clinton

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:45.940
that is a little bit weird I don't know yeah that was that was very strange yeah so you

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:51.460
know the Civil War was a false flag we we learned this yeah and it also it turns out

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:56.460
that you know in grocery stores they're putting in the self-checkout line sure right that's

01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:01.720
how they steal your children right well eventually okay but first they're going to transition

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:06.340
these self-checkout lanes into fingerprint scanners where you're gonna have to have some

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:10.100
sort of a mark of the beast or whatever in order to buy groceries we're never not gonna

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:14.020
do mark of the beast I want to be done with mark of the beast can't we do about I'm telling

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:16.920
you we just got to be done with you can't do it they're gonna do this biometric scanning

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.940
stuff at the grocery store and then you're gonna have some sort of a Christian who's

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:29.020
gonna go bomb biometric sure natural it will be a false flag right right this is presaging

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:35.740
our people are going to bomb 5g towers and it's going to be a false flag yep yeah this

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:42.800
is not inevitable but you have to lead the charge you have to go boycott H-E-B and Kroger

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.940
and Safeway when they put thumb scanners in for self-checkout lanes because they put in

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.620
the self-checkout lane first then they tear out all the lanes and make you thumb scan

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:56.460
it's already happening Home Depot already starting it we're still doing self-checkers

01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.140
and about six months later they put in the thumb scanner then they get rid of all the

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.740
employees make you do your own bagging but that's a sub reason why we're against it what

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:09.020
really against this because of the taxation the control the tracking if you go and you

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:13.980
fight it now we can stop it you wait till it goes in everywhere folks then it's then

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.340
the government's gonna blow stuff up and claim there's a Christian right-wing group it's

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:21.580
against the biometrics and so if you're protesting it you must be really with this group that's

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:24.580
gonna be the plan there I hate to give them ideas but they already have the idea I can

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:32.860
tell where they're going that's what they're gonna do you're against pro-abortion stuff

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:37.080
it turned out the feds have done all the bombings sure it's always the government one guy actually

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:42.460
did some that admitted he did it and we don't know if he's mind control or not oh okay okay

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:49.180
we're talking about uh sure I don't know who could be anybody just talking about there

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:53.380
but like yeah okay so all all the abortion clinic attacks that have happened it's all

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:57.020
the facts except for that one guy and we don't know if he's my we don't even know if he's

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:02.500
mind controlled so it could still be the feds that one's on the fence oh boy that's as close

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.900
as I get to admitting that it could possibly not be a false flag everything that was on

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:11.540
the foot everything's fucking fake that's that's the thing that I find really exhausting

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:17.740
about this uh this glimpse into 2003 is like everybody is a fucking communist and everything

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:24.260
is fake yeah he's talking about like all kinds of folks like uh uh joe scarbrough is an ultra

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:31.140
communist well that's that's turned out to be a prophetic uh prediction there who's the

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:35.980
other person to be labeled a communist on this episode fuck I can't remember it was

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:42.620
another it was another right wing guy I can't get over the pettiness of like look oh no

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:48.100
it was chris matthews chris matthews well but he's he's an ultra commie obviously no

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.820
I just love the like they're putting finger scanners in there they're gonna do all this

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:57.140
shit second problem I don't want to do my own bagging side issue that's a side issue

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:01.460
I'm putting that in there and no it seems petty right now compared to the fingerprint

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:07.860
scanner that is not the patriot's main complaint it is a complaint we do not want to bag our

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:16.180
own groceries it is inconvenient I always put the eggs in first I only ever get 10 eggs

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:24.300
I've never been trained on how to bag things these people have training um yeah silly also

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:29.660
great prediction uh that they put in the self-checkout stuff and then the next thing is a thumb scanner

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:33.940
I don't think that I've ever scanned my thumb at the grocery store I've never scanned my

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:38.900
thumb at a grocery store I would I would almost prefer it to scanning a credit card eight

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:44.440
years eight years on self-checkout uh pretty ubiquitous yeah thumb scanning not even really

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.340
in the conversation I don't think in terms of and nobody you know most people's problem

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:52.420
with uh self-checkout line isn't doing your own bagging it's when you get stuck behind

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:56.140
somebody who shouldn't be using the self-checkout when they have too many items well not just

01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:03.940
that whenever they're clearly uh not bagging material if you will wow yeah um I don't have

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:10.420
many complaints about self-checkout I kind of take everything in stride sure you do so

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.420
yeah everything's false flag uh there's gonna be Christian groups that are gonna bomb biometric

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:18.440
places and it's gonna be all fake all these predictions have been fantastic yeah Alex

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.000
Jones is constantly right about everything I'm gonna be real mad if the when we do start

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.020
getting those biometric chips because we there are there are biometric things in little augments

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.660
that you can have you can put little electromagnets in your fingers and stuff like that yes sooner

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:37.620
or later we're going to have an implantable chip of some sort and some that are available

01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:44.060
now I know but like one that will be uh that final that like ipod moment of an implantable

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:49.260
chip you know where all of a sudden this thing didn't exist and then it's everywhere and

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:54.220
it should be called the mark of the beast I think it's possible that that that technology

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.700
will go along that line but it's equally possible that it doesn't I don't know I don't know

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:03.900
I don't know if there will be an ipod moment like that I don't know but it better be called

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:08.900
the mark of the beast we got Soylent that's real yeah and we don't talk about Soylent

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.780
start uh I don't know we gotta find out but it became real so why not the mark of the

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:16.180
beast you gotta find that episode of Alex's show he's gotta be furious about that would

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:20.800
he be furious about that yeah that would be fun definitely okay next thing you know this

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.540
guy is gonna be starting a business where he uh has robot trash trucks go get the bodies

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.580
any moment now they're gonna have implantable chips and it's gonna be called the mark of

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:32.820
the beast listen yeah I've been taking the piss out of Alex a little bit on this episode

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:39.100
really just sort of mocking yeah some of this is stupid it is but you have to recognize

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:45.100
Alex Jones is a hero and in this last clip we learn about something that maybe isn't

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:53.500
in the history books but it should be Alex saved a lot of lives you laugh you laugh okay

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:59.300
okay where'd we where'd we save all these lives Dan you gotta stand up for this country

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:04.180
and you gotta do it now they're trying to pass hate crimes legislation but it's just

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:09.140
like the smallpox shot the truth was out on that grassroots the people refused and now

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:13.660
the government launching a smallpox attack which they were planning to do guaranteed

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:20.340
has been stalled they didn't do it Alex stopped a smallpox attack by publicizing information

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:27.780
about smallpox attacks he stopped it you could I mean look he said it obviously it's true

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:34.500
he saved so many lives I do you mock look sit here and you laugh at a hero some of the

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:39.060
benefits of having a narcissistic personality disorder in that you can't invent your own

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:45.380
crisis is to become the hero of hey it's amazing that is nice I've never felt like a hero well

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:49.300
quite in the way of saving millions of people from a small time maybe you should pretend

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:55.300
that you stopped I really think that would probably make me feel better yeah I mean if

01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:01.020
you're doing a costume or like a pro-con kind of analysis of your career sure in the pros

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:07.420
are things like that yeah I'm a hero yeah I'm a hero I've saved the world ten times

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:12.260
over yeah no matter how many things you've bungled it's kind of easy to convince yourself

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:18.380
it's a net positive fake it's all worth it because I saved the world from a smallpox

01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:23.380
attack yeah yeah love that kind of stuff nice yeah so this was this was a little bit of

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:32.520
a fun trip 2003 in order to you know get our toes back in the water for for what will probably

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:38.380
be an unpleasant present-day episode certainly disgusting nonsense spouted by a monster not

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:44.300
looking forward to it yeah but it will happen it's gonna now I think if I had to sum this

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:50.860
up like the reason that I thought that this episode was like really key sure it's that

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:57.460
moment where Alex says literal sorry yeah yeah when he stops himself from saying literal

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:05.980
demons it's so important it's right there yeah it is if we can demonstrate if we can

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:10.340
find more instances of Alex stopping himself from talking about the literal devil in the

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:16.160
past I'm I'm gonna my mind's gonna be blown so you're saying that you're gonna be the

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:22.580
jury and I'll be the judge and then the audience will be the execute executioners I don't know

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:31.860
I don't know how this works we will we will be court reporters okay and the audience could

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:37.220
be an audience can I can I be the stenographer I want to play with one of those ticket you
