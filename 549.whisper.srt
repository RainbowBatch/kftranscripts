00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,440
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,800
Probably but not in the right direction.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:47,080
I love your work, it's TimeToPray!

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,380
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,880
Hello Alex, I'm a victim caller, I'm a huge fan.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
I love your work.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Knowledge Fight.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Nom nom nom nom nom nom.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Knowledgefight.com.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
I love you.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,380
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm Jordan.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,080
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,580
Jordan.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,080
Dan.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,580
Jordan.

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,080
Quick question for you.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,580
What's up?

25
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,580
What's your bright spot today?

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,080
My bright spot today is a little slice of life moment.

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,580
A little slice of life moment.

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,580
Little moment, just laying in bed, hanging out.

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,580
Celine, the cat, comes over, stares at me while I'm laying there.

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,580
Just like, what are you doing?

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,080
What are you doing, cat? You weirdo.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,580
Yeah.

33
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,580
And then she just, she's just standing there.

34
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,080
Uh huh.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,580
And then, just with no warning, plops over on her side.

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Just floomp.

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,580
Just falls over.

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,580
Like a horse that was tranquilized.

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,080
Yes!

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,580
Just goes...

41
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,580
Ka thunk.

42
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
Yeah, okay.

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,080
Just immediately dead weight is the cutest thing.

44
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,080
It happens from time to time, but I really enjoyed it last night.

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
And then, uh...

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
It is like how that battery goes out.

47
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,580
Where it's not, it's like a sustained and then boom, it's just off.

48
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah.

49
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,580
Yeah.

50
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,080
And then she'll lay there for like maybe five minutes and then get bored and go lay somewhere else.

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Sure, well, yes.

52
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,580
I understand.

53
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,080
That thunk moment is really nice.

54
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
It's beautiful.

55
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
I enjoy that.

56
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,580
How about you?

57
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,080
It's a lovely slice of life, Dan.

58
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,580
Thank you.

59
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,080
My bright spot is twofold.

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,580
One, Brockhampton has a new album out.

61
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,080
It's great.

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,580
Great.

63
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:23,580
And two, I just found out that there's this show that I've never heard of that ran for like six some odd seasons or something like that called Superstore.

64
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,080
And it's actually really good.

65
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
What about Walmart?

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
It's kind of about Walmart.

67
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,580
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,580
It's like a...

69
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,080
I was surprised to see how much labor issues were like...

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
You'd never heard of that show?

71
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,580
I'd never heard of that show before.

72
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,080
I swear to you, I've never heard of it.

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
It was all over the place.

74
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,580
Really?

75
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,080
Yep.

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Hahahaha!

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Yeah, it was...

78
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
Where?

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Where was it all over?

80
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
It was probably on network TV, of course.

81
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
The place that you would normally...

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,580
The one place that I would never go, yes.

83
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Oh, that's all dumb.

84
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,580
It's all dumb comedy.

85
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,580
I just don't have cable.

86
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,080
I don't have...

87
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,580
I'm not gonna cut the cord.

88
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,080
Sure.

89
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
I cut it.

90
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Hahahaha!

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
But even if someone had come up to you and been like,

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,580
Hey, there's this show on basic cable that is so good.

93
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,080
You gotta check it out.

94
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,580
You'd have been like,

95
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,080
Oh, fuck yourself.

96
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,580
I'm gonna watch...

97
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,080
What? No!

98
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,580
Parks and Rec was on basic cable.

99
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm gonna watch artistic prestige television.

100
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
No.

101
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,080
The first run of Full House was on basic cable.

102
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
These are shows that everyone enjoys.

103
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
In 30 years, you have two examples.

104
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes, exactly.

105
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Congratulations.

106
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Yep, you got it.

107
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying Superstore.

108
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
It's great.

109
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Great.

110
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
So, Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over.

111
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
We're in the present day because chaos is afoot.

112
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Yes, naturally.

113
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
And we'll get into some of that chaos here in a moment.

114
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
But before we do, let's take a little moment to christen some new wonks.

115
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Oh, that's great.

116
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
So first, Dr. Destructodome.

117
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Thank you so much.

118
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
You are now a policy wonk.

119
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm a policy wonk.

120
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Thank you, Dr. Destructodome.

121
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Thank you.

122
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Next, I'm moving to Canada and changing my name to Joe Kickass.

123
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Thank you so much.

124
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
You are now a policy wonk.

125
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm a policy wonk.

126
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Thank you very much, future Joe Kickass.

127
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Thank you.

128
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Next, Gwendolyn.

129
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Thank you so much.

130
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
You are now a policy wonk.

131
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
I'm a policy wonk.

132
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Thanks, Gwendolyn.

133
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Thank you.

134
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Next, The Sheep Mafia.

135
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Thank you so much.

136
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
You are now a policy wonk.

137
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
I'm a policy wonk.

138
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
Oh, thank you very much, Sheep Mafia.

139
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Thank you.

140
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,080
And then I got a couple of technocrat shout-outs to give out today.

141
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
First, WTF is an NFT.

142
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm also confused.

143
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
That's totally right.

144
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
You are now a technocrat.

145
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
And Backyard Widow Farm.

146
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Thank you so much.

147
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
You are also a technocrat.

148
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I'm a policy wonk.

149
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Crikey, mate.

150
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
That's fantastic.

151
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Have yourself a brew.

152
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
How's your 401k doing, bro?

153
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,080
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

154
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Let's just get down to business.

155
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

156
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Why are you pimps so good?

157
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
My neck is freakishly large.

158
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,080
I declare info war on you.

159
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Thank you so much.

160
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

161
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Also, Jordan, I don't know if you know this, but there's two April birthdays.

162
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Just me and Dr. Gums.

163
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Yes, correct.

164
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,080
And also who could forget about Kelly Clarkson, Cedric, you know, Taylor Swift.

165
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Well, no, of course, nobody could forget about those two, actually.

166
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Well, we have one more to add to the list.

167
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
Okay.

168
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Actually, we missed this email.

169
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
This was sent in and I missed it and I apologize.

170
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
But Rex, happy birthday.

171
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Happy birthday, Rex.

172
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Welcome to the pantheon of April birthdays.

173
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Along with myself, Dr. Gums, Kelly Clarkson, Cedric the Entertainer, and Mandy Moore.

174
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
And a couple others.

175
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
I can't remember other celebrities.

176
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Oh, Tyson Ritter.

177
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Oh, sure.

178
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
The lead singer of All American Rejects.

179
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Sure.

180
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Naturally.

181
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Everybody remembers his birthday.

182
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Move along.

183
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
And commemorated by...

184
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
I'm sorry.

185
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,080
I've heard very little of what you said because I can't get past Backyard Widow Farm.

186
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
That sounds like murder, right?

187
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I don't know.

188
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I think it's a farm.

189
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,080
I like to believe it's a farm, maybe run by widows.

190
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
That sounds nice.

191
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I don't know.

192
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
That sounds nice.

193
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
I don't know.

194
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
You could put an ominous or benign spin on it.

195
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Sure, that's true.

196
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
However you want to play it.

197
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
I guess I have a bad temperament because I went ominous first.

198
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes.

199
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,080
So Jordan, we return today to the present day of Alex Jones' content.

200
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,080
He's deep in rambling about the border and about that Spars document from Johns Hopkins

201
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
that apparently is a smoking gun.

202
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Which is nothing of the sort.

203
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,080
I was really worried that we would get into today's content and we'd start looking at

204
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
this stuff back in the present.

205
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
It'll be so boring and repetitive.

206
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,080
A lot of these issues are things that we've done at least three or four laps with Alex

207
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
on before.

208
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Oh yeah.

209
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
A lot of recycled narratives just about fairly present issues.

210
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
The words ad nauseum come to mind.

211
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Yes.

212
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Or as Alex would say, at nauseum.

213
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Yes, at nauseum.

214
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
But then, Jordan.

215
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Yes, sir.

216
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,080
On Tuesday evening at the end of the War Room, Alex called into his own show from home.

217
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Oh no.

218
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
I guess the War Room isn't his show, but whatever the case.

219
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
He owns all shows.

220
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
We've got big breaking news.

221
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Uh oh.

222
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,080
All right, they're bringing us in with the classic-

223
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Song.

224
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Slimball intro music.

225
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Still great.

226
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Alex Jones here, ladies and gentlemen.

227
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,080
On this 13th day, on this Tuesday transmission, we were going to have a special report shot

228
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
by now, but I ended up going too long.

229
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,080
I was going to shoot like a two minute quick video, but I ended up doing like 10 minutes.

230
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,080
So that'll be up in about 45 minutes or so at infowars.com or newswars.com.

231
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,080
So the breaking news is that Alex rambled too long in a special report that he shot

232
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,080
about this breaking news, so the well-produced version of it isn't going to come out for

233
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
like 45 minutes or so, and Alex is just going to have to come in and do it on the phone.

234
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
All right.

235
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Breaking news.

236
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,080
I'm struggling here, if I understand correctly.

237
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Alex is going to give us a thing that he already knew in the past.

238
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Yeah, but he talked about it.

239
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,080
He meant to talk about it for two minutes so they could have a special report here on

240
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
the show, but he talked too long.

241
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
He rambled too long.

242
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,080
So then an hour later, you're going to see a better version of what he's going to do

243
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
for you now.

244
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Exactly.

245
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,080
And it's so important that you cannot possibly wait one more hour.

246
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,080
No, we have to get into live programming.

247
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
This has got to be done.

248
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
We've got to break in.

249
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
This is Infowars, God damn it.

250
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,080
We can't wait another 45 minutes for this information.

251
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
I feel like if it was as important as he thinks, he could have kept it tight.

252
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
He could have.

253
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
So he can get this special report together.

254
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Or he could have just spent two minutes on it in the middle of his rambles.

255
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Also great that Rush has been dead for two months and Alex is already stealing his aesthetics.

256
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
I think it's a good idea.

257
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Stealing his intro music.

258
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Steal it up.

259
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Steal it up.

260
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,080
I do like that that clearly wasn't Alex's choice, though, because he calls it out.

261
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
That's true.

262
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
He's like, oh, coming in with some Rush Limbaugh music.

263
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

264
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Someone else did that and he kind of ruined the illusion that they weren't stealing.

265
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,080
There is a secret hero on the staff, I swear.

266
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,080
The more music we hear at the right time, the more I'm like, somebody is watching us.

267
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,080
So, you know, he rambled too long in that special report that he tried to shoot, but

268
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
we don't really know what this news is that's so important.

269
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Sure.

270
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
So let's see if he gets to it.

271
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
What's we got?

272
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,580
A lot of this we knew was coming.

273
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,080
But now here it is, Sam Montoya for us, about three years.

274
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
He's a he's a great.

275
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
My daughter just came in here.

276
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Hello, honey.

277
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
I love you.

278
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
He just he just came in breaking news.

279
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
My daughter just came running in here.

280
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
We can't wait an hour.

281
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I have that.

282
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Let me just go outside.

283
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
I thought she was gonna be in the other room.

284
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
This has to happen right now.

285
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
I just got home.

286
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Sorry.

287
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Long story short, we were going to air in this segment.

288
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
This report, but it's not ready yet.

289
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
It'll be a band on video.

290
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,080
InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com here in 30 minutes, 45 minutes or so.

291
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,080
OK, so I guess the news so far is that Sam Montoya is a really good guy.

292
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
He's a great guy.

293
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
And that Alex, he's trying to innovate in ways he can make his show impressively unprofessional.

294
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
It's kind of incredible.

295
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
It really is.

296
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
It really is.

297
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,080
So far, we have spent far more time talking about his daughters than we have the breaking

298
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
news that he had to call in.

299
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Yeah, breaking news.

300
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,080
I talked too long about it in the special report in order to fit it into here.

301
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
Sure.

302
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
So I'm going to talk about it now.

303
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Wow.

304
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Yeah.

305
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Yep.

306
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Yep.

307
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
This is good.

308
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
This is good stuff.

309
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Oh, man.

310
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Almost a parody.

311
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
So, you know, there is a story here.

312
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Sure.

313
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
So let's see if we can get to it.

314
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
What do we got?

315
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Well, we knew this was coming and I've talked to a lot of smart folks and they concur with

316
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
my analysis.

317
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,920
Sam Montoya, he is a great guy and he went to the Capitol that day.

318
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,080
He was separate from our main crew because he ended up we didn't take him on a trip with

319
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
us.

320
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
Go ahead.

321
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Go on his own.

322
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,400
So he went up there to the January 6 event and then he ended up going to the Capitol

323
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
once it was open.

324
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,080
And once I guess the police wave, you'd be as we told me, and he got the tragic footage

325
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,580
of and was the first person put it out of actually Babbitt being executed, by the way,

326
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,600
we don't know the name of the police officer still had executed her.

327
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,920
But we do know the name of the police officer that just shot this guy at a traffic stop

328
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,240
in Minnesota during all the riots.

329
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,120
So just an example of how the feds and the media are all going along with this to demonize

330
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,440
local police for domestic takeovers is a very, very systematic criminal operation.

331
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
So here's the deal.

332
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,960
The story that Alex is trying not to cover is that Sam, his cameraman, got arrested and

333
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,720
charged for his actions on January 6th at the Capitol.

334
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Sure.

335
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Alex doesn't want to just say that.

336
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,480
So instead here he is just reiterating that Sam's a good guy and he's trying to come up

337
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,520
with every possible Dodge he can think of in order to not deal with the reality here.

338
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,120
That clip was less than a minute and here are a list of the qualifiers that Alex is

339
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,920
trying to bake into this story before even telling the audience what has happened.

340
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Give me a list.

341
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,120
One, Sam is a good guy.

342
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
He's a good guy.

343
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
Two, Sam was separate from Alex's main crew.

344
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Never heard of that guy.

345
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,040
Three, Sam went into the Capitol on his own.

346
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,920
I swear to you, this man, I've never seen him before in my life.

347
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,360
Four, Sam only went to the Capitol after police waved him in according to what Alex claims

348
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,640
Sam told him.

349
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,600
Frankly, I'm pretty sure he's a ghost.

350
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,160
Five, Sam was the first to get the footage of Ashley Babbitt being shot.

351
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Incidentally, I don't think this is true.

352
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
And if you watch Sam's live stream from that day, you'll see him trying to negotiate with

353
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,720
John Sullivan, AKA Jaden X, who had captured footage of the shooting.

354
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,360
He was trying to get the footage from him.

355
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Let me get the footage.

356
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Yeah.

357
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,920
Six, for some reason it's nefarious that we don't know the name of the officer who shot

358
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,400
Babbitt, but we do know the name of the officer who shot Daunte Wright in Minnesota.

359
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,240
I have no idea what that has to do with anything.

360
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,120
No, it has nothing to do with anything, but it's always a good idea to jangle the keys

361
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,780
of racism away from the very real problems that you are dealing with.

362
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,400
You can see pretty clearly how Alex's primary motivation in telling this story is to make

363
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,520
sure the audience knows that Sam's a good guy.

364
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Sam's a good guy.

365
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,880
Even if he went into the Capitol, he wasn't wrong to do it.

366
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,600
And if people say he was wrong to do it, then he did it without Alex even knowing or telling

367
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
him to do it.

368
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,360
Fairly certain I've never heard of this guy.

369
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,880
Alex hasn't even told the audience that Sam got arrested yet, and we already have multiple

370
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,120
claims that Alex had nothing to do with this shit.

371
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,480
This whole thing is a simulation.

372
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,240
I put the world on trial.

373
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,400
This is fucking Shadowgate.

374
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
This is bad.

375
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
This is Shadowgate.

376
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Listen, he's a great guy.

377
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Never heard of him.

378
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Didn't tell him to do anything.

379
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,880
No idea what he's talking about.

380
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Good guy!

381
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,920
Speaking of Shadowgate, I've realized that the Matt Gaetz thing could be the Gate of

382
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Gates.

383
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,360
It does seem like the Gate of Gates.

384
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
It sure does.

385
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I don't like that.

386
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,680
I think we're in a situation similar to that where I imagine it took Joel Greenberg exactly

387
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,200
five seconds to give up Matt Gaetz.

388
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,640
I think it might have been even less than that.

389
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,080
The FBI went to his door and he was like, y'all want Matt Gaetz?

390
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Sure!

391
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
I'll give him to you.

392
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,640
Sam Portnoy is not protecting Alex in this circumstance.

393
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,880
Me and a friend had this joke that we would always tell each other, like we would smoke

394
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
together.

395
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,120
We'd have blunts and we'd be sitting around passing back and forth and having fun listening

396
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
to music.

397
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Sure.

398
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Doing the good stuff.

399
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
And one of the things we would always do is tell each other about how we were going to

400
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
rat each other out.

401
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,600
We'd always just joke about how if we were in public, we'd be like, officer, he got weed!

402
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Yes.

403
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Yes.

404
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
That's how I imagine it.

405
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
That is how it's going.

406
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Absolutely.

408
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,960
We all have our way to fuck over each other.

409
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
That's how I feel like Matt Gaetz and his buddies.

410
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,840
I can tell you shit about Matt Gaetz that you ain't never even, you didn't even want

411
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
to know this stuff.

412
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,360
He got weed!

413
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,640
So now we finally get to the part here of this episode, or this special breaking news

414
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,760
where we find out that he got arrested.

415
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Yeah.

416
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
That Sam is arrested.

417
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Breaking news.

418
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Long story short, I was sitting there this morning at about nine o'clock trying to get

419
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,440
into shape with some weights and got a call that the FBI with 30 people had raided his

420
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,440
little apartment here in Austin, Texas.

421
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,280
And that was crazy because we knew they'd already been harassing one of our other employees

422
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:34,660
named Rob, not Rob Dewey, the other Rob, who didn't even go to DC on the 6th.

423
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,640
And so we were just like, this is a crazy dragnet.

424
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,720
But Sam had gone in and the journalists, you know, there was other journalists in there

425
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
as well.

426
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,680
Jaden X had got $70,000 from CNN and others saying, burn down the Capitol.

427
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
But he's okay.

428
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
He's been released.

429
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
So that's, that's fine.

430
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
He, he tell, you know, lead the attack, the evidence I think is pretty overwhelming in

431
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
my opinion.

432
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,960
Not only was Sam arrested, but 30 FBI agents came to get him and other reinforced staff

433
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,480
have been harassed and Jaden X is totally free.

434
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,640
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

435
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,040
I've been trying, but I can't find any proof that the arrest went down the way that Alex

436
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,200
has claimed.

437
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,360
He's shown a picture of a door that has a hole punched in it, but I don't know if that

438
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,120
was from police ramming it or a random person kicking it.

439
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
I have no idea.

440
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Sure, sure.

441
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,760
As for Jaden X or John Sullivan, that's what's going to be Alex's main defense and the longer

442
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,640
special report that he rambled too long during.

443
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,240
Alex has decided that John Sullivan led the attack on the Capitol, which is absolutely

444
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
not true.

445
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
Sounds true.

446
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,360
And then he was paid by CNN to be there and he got off scot free.

447
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
That's definitely true.

448
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
All of that is bullshit.

449
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh.

450
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,240
Sullivan has been released with conditions, but he's definitely still facing some very

451
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,580
serious charges and they have not been dropped.

452
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,320
He's, I mean, he's just out.

453
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,120
Yeah, no, that's, it's, yeah.

454
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
He's still in trouble.

455
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
That's part of the legal system.

456
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,840
You can, you can get out while awaiting trial.

457
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,180
CNN did not pay Sullivan to be at the Capitol.

458
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,960
Alex goes on to repeat the figure $70,000 as the amount that Sullivan was paid, but

459
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,240
this is just a misrepresentation of the fact that CNN and NBC both bought his footage from

460
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
inside the Capitol, each for $35,000.

461
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Right, right, right.

462
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,400
There wasn't a preexisting contract or agreement.

463
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,440
It was just CNN and NBC acting exactly the way that Alex's cameraman, Sam, did when he

464
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,680
tried to get the footage from Sullivan inside the Capitol.

465
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Yes, correct.

466
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,400
Uh, so yeah, I don't, I don't know.

467
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,920
According to a CNN spokesperson, quote, on January 6th, CNN was contacted by a reputable

468
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,420
agent regarding an eyewitness video from the Capitol Hill riots.

469
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,000
The company entered into a one week agreement for use of 44 seconds of key content, which

470
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
was attributed to the witness on air.

471
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
When his role in the event was later called into question, the company informed staff

472
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,160
to cease all use of the video.

473
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Oh, that makes sense.

474
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Yeah, totally.

475
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Yeah.

476
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,980
So Alex's main strategy is going to be to point at John Sullivan and pretend that Sullivan

477
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,360
instigated the riots, that he was paid by CNN to do so, and that he isn't facing any

478
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
consequences.

479
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,000
And yet here poor Sam the cameraman is getting arrested just for being a good reporter.

480
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,260
It's all nonsense, but it's about the only angle you can take here that heightens the

481
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,240
feelings of agreement correctly and you can profit off of.

482
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,360
I mean, I can't even really think of it because you don't want to turn Sam into a persecution

484
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
too much.

485
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,160
You know, you don't want to turn him into too much of a hero as long as then people

486
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
will give him money.

487
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Well, we'll see.

488
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Hold on.

489
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
So you don't want to give Sam defense funding.

490
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,720
Well, I mean like you do want to make him a victim if you can make it really all about

491
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
yourself.

492
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Exactly.

493
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
If you can manage to do that.

494
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Yes.

495
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,400
And we are dealing with a world class make it about himself-er.

496
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,480
I wonder if that's what the whole next episode is going to be about.

497
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
It could be.

498
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
It could be.

499
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
It could be.

500
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
It could be.

501
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
It could be.

502
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
It could be.

503
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
It could be.

504
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Anyway, here's the last clip from Alex's breaking into the war room.

505
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,240
So we're going to have a detailed report on that coming up soon again at man.videoinfowars.com.

506
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,640
But this just shows you where the country is and what's going on and what's unfolding

507
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
in the persecution press.

508
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,120
It's not a detailed report and we're not going to listen to it because it's just longer but

509
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,960
about the same stuff and just kind of yelling about John Sullivan over and over again.

510
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,760
So now let us jump to April 14th because I wanted to see how Alex is coping with this

511
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
situation.

512
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Sure.

513
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,200
One of his employees just got arrested and charged with a riot.

514
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,440
What's the new story he's going to tell about it?

515
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,720
Now one of the things that I think is really interesting is that we've been aware that

516
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,960
Alex had that cameraman who was inside, like we knew on the 6th.

517
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Yeah.

518
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
We knew the whole time.

519
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,440
There wasn't really much of a secret around it and they released the footage of him yelling

520
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,040
infowars.com while he went in the Capitol.

521
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,160
Well that's because the FBI is just full of great investigators.

522
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,880
Well I actually kind of figured they probably were aware of this and it just didn't rise

523
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,800
to the level of someone they would want to charge.

524
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,240
Yeah it does seem like that.

525
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,080
And to me it's actually kind of surprising that there was a charge.

526
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,720
I don't think he's going to get in any trouble.

527
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,240
I think he'll be probably released maybe a slap on the wrist, who knows.

528
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,760
So it is kind of surprising to me that they did end up charging him but I'm not surprised

529
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
to hear that there could be a charge.

530
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Oh totally.

531
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Yeah yeah yeah.

532
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,980
So anyway Alex, I just don't, I didn't know how it was going to land.

533
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,080
Outside of I was pretty sure he was going to make it about himself.

534
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Yeah totally.

535
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,040
And we'll get to that but before we do, you know John Bowne has been a long time boring

536
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
voice man.

537
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Indeed.

538
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
For Alex.

539
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
He's got special reports.

540
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Yes he does.

541
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,240
And Alex will play those special reports generally in the first six minutes of the show.

542
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Right.

543
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Get him out of the way.

544
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,440
Those often don't go out on the radio.

545
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
Get your vegetables out of the way.

546
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,800
A lot of stations air their own sort of station identification and news stuff at the top of

547
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
the hour.

548
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,360
So Alex has this first segment that just is kind of no man's land.

549
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,540
And he'll usually play some John Bowne reports there with his dumb boring voice.

550
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,120
But there's a guy who's been really making waves.

551
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Guy named Greg Reese.

552
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,920
He's never heard of him.

553
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,000
He's another guy who's got these special reports that he does.

554
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,440
He's another little video maker down in Austin at the Infowars.

555
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,080
And I think he's making a run at the crown of the weird voice special report guy.

556
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
All right.

557
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Here we go.

558
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,660
Immediately following the death of Nikola Tesla, Dr. John Trump, an electrical engineer

559
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:10,020
with the National Defense Research Committee of the Office of Scientific Research and Development.

560
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,160
And interestingly, President Donald Trump's uncle was called in to analyze the Tesla papers.

561
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Is that interesting?

562
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Or boring?

563
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,680
In a few days, John Trump officially concluded that Tesla's work was primarily speculative

564
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,240
and did not include workable methods.

565
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,040
We are then told that most of Tesla's papers disappeared, but his work most definitely

566
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,320
quietly continued.

567
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,680
All right, man.

568
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,360
I hear that driving music behind you.

569
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,220
What is this special report about?

570
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
This is about Tesla, man.

571
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,180
This is about how Tesla's work is the underpinning for all of our futuristic technology that

572
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,680
was stolen from him and hidden from the public.

573
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,440
Yeah, I didn't know what was going on, but I was excited.

574
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Yeah.

575
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,320
I was like, this is how the show is starting?

576
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Yeah.

577
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
With this special report?

578
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
This is weird.

579
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,840
I'm really more interested in Tesla than I am in whatever other bullshit they're going

580
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
to spout.

581
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Sure.

582
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
So let's hear this Tesla shit.

583
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,840
So Greg Reese, he wants to blow some minds talking about some of this physics stuff and

584
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,560
wireless energy, mysterious stuff that Tesla has figured out.

585
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
The whole thing.

586
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Teleportation.

587
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,600
The Palmas spinning ball experiment from 1977 is simple enough for anyone to repeat.

588
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,820
Two steel balls are repeatedly launched with equal force.

589
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,960
One is spinning.

590
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,580
The other is not.

591
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:36,260
The spinning ball consistently flies higher and falls faster than the other.

592
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,160
This is in direct violation of both Newton's laws and Einstein's relativity.

593
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Really modern science.

594
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,480
You ever see a curve ball for this energy?

595
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Yeah.

596
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,960
You ever see a curve ball?

597
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,600
You ever see a major league baseball pitcher throw a curve ball?

598
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,720
You know, one of those things that's on TV during the summer 162 times.

599
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
This is amazing.

600
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Yeah.

601
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,520
Modern science has plenty of explanations for why this phenomenon could be seen in different

602
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,880
rates of speed between spinning and non-spinning objects.

603
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,440
The issue is that there's no difference for these objects when you try to conduct the

604
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
experiment in a vacuum.

605
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,440
You know, like if you didn't have other forces at play, then they would travel at the same

606
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,520
speed whether they were spinning or not, but because in nature, in the world, there's other

607
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,960
forces that come to bear on the object, and they understand that.

608
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Yes.

609
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Scientists are not stupid.

610
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
No.

611
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,160
The force that Greg Rees is ignoring here is called the Magnus effect, and it's basically

612
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,600
the reason why pitchers can throw bending pitches or why tennis players add spin.

613
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,080
The spinning object in the air exerts a force on the air that it's traveling through, and

614
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,200
in the process, its path of motion is affected.

615
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,240
This is a well-understood phenomenon, and it's completely compatible with Newtonian

616
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
physics.

617
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Yeah.

618
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
I guess Greg Rees didn't really look into this before deciding that spinning balls are

619
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,320
somehow proof that physics is a lie.

620
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,080
It would be very hard to research the American baseball pastime.

621
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,280
Yeah, or you can find countless videos of people doing this, like dropping things from

622
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,560
really high heights, because it is really cool.

623
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Yeah, it's cool.

624
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
It's really cool to look at.

625
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
It's cool.

626
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Yeah.

627
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Yes.

628
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,480
Is there any spinning force stuff that no one can explain?

629
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
No one.

630
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
No one can explain.

631
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Only Tesla.

632
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Maybe.

633
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Oh.

634
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
But we don't know.

635
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
John Trump didn't look at those papers.

636
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
That's true.

637
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
That's true.

638
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
So, John Trump's uncle is involved in a cover-up.

639
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,880
Did you know that Bruce De Palma is Brian De Palma's uncle?

640
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
What?

641
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Isn't that interesting?

642
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
No.

643
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Nope.

644
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
I also don't think that's true.

645
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,760
So, apparently, the spin creates this magical force.

646
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Magic.

647
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Or whatever.

648
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Yeah.

649
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,520
This magical force somehow to create UFOs.

650
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,040
These patents look very similar to what whistleblowers claim have been in production for years by

651
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,520
weapons manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin Skunk Works.

652
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,480
The same UFO-like craft that whistleblowers claim are being prepared to stage a fake alien

653
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
invasion.

654
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,320
So, we've got a fake alien invasion coming.

655
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Yeah.

656
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah.

657
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,160
And these spinning things.

658
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,920
You ever see a knuckleball, Dan?

659
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,680
It was an interesting special report.

660
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Yeah.

661
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah, yeah.

662
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,640
I think that the music really does a lot of work.

663
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,680
I think the music does more work than Greg.

664
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,760
I think our greatest scientists are going to use a split-finger fastball to develop

665
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
UFOs.

666
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
Yeah.

667
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
That's pretty fun.

668
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,680
Also, I would question what this has to do with the globalist's plans.

669
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't know how a false flag alien invasion fits in with the larger schemes that we're

670
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
supposed to be afraid of.

671
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,520
It does seem like the plan B being kill all of the people would kind of negate the need

672
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,000
for the UFO part.

673
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yep.

674
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,120
That would just be like, hey, look, we're going to do the super bioweapon thing, but

675
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,360
let's have a little fun.

676
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,320
I mean, you know what, I will give it up to the devil in this sense.

677
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,360
It does seem like he's got a lot of plans up in the air at the same time, and if he's

678
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,680
juggling that many plans, that's a talent in and of itself.

679
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,880
That's a management issue, and he's killing it.

680
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,040
But you know, I think back when we did stand up, sometimes you'd have somebody who's like,

681
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,920
I'm going to start my own show, animate a clothing line going, and then start a video

682
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
blog.

683
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Right.

684
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Well, you've got to brand yourself.

685
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Well, there's a lot of plans.

686
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
There are a lot of plans.

687
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,740
Sometimes if you have too many plans, you're not going to do any of those things, and maybe

688
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,760
that's the issue that the devil's running into.

689
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
That's the ultimate weakness of the devil.

690
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
He's got the false flag aliens.

691
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,320
He's got the super bioweapons.

692
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,640
He doesn't follow through on anything.

693
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,040
He didn't even kill Eve, you know?

694
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
What was the point?

695
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
No.

696
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Stupid.

697
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,920
Also, what do you think you should be more afraid of?

698
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,440
Extermination or world government?

699
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,260
Ooh, depends.

700
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
What kind of extermination?

701
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,140
Well, because I feel like in Alex's scheme now with the devil's plan, world government

702
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,220
is not a necessary step towards extermination.

703
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,780
That's true.

704
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
That is true.

705
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,240
So I don't know why the devil would need to push for that anymore.

706
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,920
Well, if you had... Okay, so if the devil obtains world government, he's gotten through

707
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:24,080
the loophole that God set that keeps him from limiting human free will, maybe?

708
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
I don't know.

709
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,960
Because the government can do the free will limiting, and he just gets to exterminate

710
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
people?

711
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,440
I don't know, man.

712
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,040
Yeah, this is what happens when Greg Reese starts the show.

713
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,400
This is a problem with both, I guess, UFOs and the Bible.

714
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,040
So Alex comes in, and he breaks things off with some real serious headlines.

715
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Sure.

716
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,820
Let me tell you what we got for you.

717
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,560
Everyone is starting to call out Fauci as a fraud, and mainstream news is now reporting

718
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:05,360
that he ran the Wuhan lab, which they're now confirming is where COVID-19 came from.

719
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,880
Absolutely huge.

720
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,800
And then people say, well, I thought you said COVID's not that deadly, but they want to

721
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,640
own it, and they want to have version one, and version two, and version three.

722
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,560
They've got super deadly versions.

723
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,920
This was just the drill.

724
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,560
So Alex is just talking about a Washington Times headline that doesn't prove the claims

725
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,240
that are in the headline, or are speculated about in the headline.

726
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Yeah.

727
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
I don't know who that is.

728
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I was pretty disappointed.

729
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,200
He doesn't talk about it until fairly a ways later.

730
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Right.

731
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,760
Well, I did see that the CIA would refuse to confirm that it wasn't created in a lab,

732
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:47,280
so people have taken that as speculation that they're probably looking into it, I guess.

733
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,400
But I think that all along, it's not been excluded as a possibility, but it's not the

734
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,200
most likely possibility, and there is not evidence that it was.

735
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Right.

736
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
That's the issue.

737
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,200
There are a lot of issues, yeah.

738
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Yeah.

739
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Yeah.

740
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Anyway, Alex-

741
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
And I don't trust the CIA.

742
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Fine.

743
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Yeah.

744
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,960
I didn't know whether or not we were going to get into the Sam issue early or late.

745
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
I didn't know.

746
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,640
It turns out that Alex dives right in.

747
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,400
The FBI yesterday morning raided one of our crew members, I'll tell you about that coming

748
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,560
up next segment, and the media is just in ecstasy, oh my God, we're so close to arresting

749
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Jones.

750
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
We want to shut down Infowars.

751
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Think about that.

752
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,720
It's not just take us off the internet, not try to block our bank accounts.

753
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,120
Now it's, we want Jones in jail.

754
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,140
He masterminded the capital attacks, you've been hearing that since it happened a few

755
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:50,840
months ago, three months ago, and now they're just fixing the intelligence to go in line

756
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
with all of that.

757
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,880
So I guess this is the first instance of him making it all about himself.

758
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Yep.

759
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Yep.

760
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
And it happens immediately.

761
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Yep.

762
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Yep.

763
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,000
They got Sam, which is actually about me as always.

764
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,880
I wouldn't be happy about this if I were Sam.

765
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
No, no, no, no.

766
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
I would flip on him.

767
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,400
I would take this as an insult.

768
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Yep.

769
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Yep.

770
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,640
So Alex gets to talking about his charges, what Sam's been charged with, and he might

771
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,360
be a little bit off.

772
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,760
As far as reporters, Sam arrested for covering January 6th Capitol riot Montoya.

773
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
So I talked to Sam's dad yesterday.

774
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
He was here.

775
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,200
Guess what he's charged with?

776
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,760
They said making loud utterances.

777
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,040
So Sam wasn't charged with making loud utterances.

778
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,240
The charging documents are public and he's facing five charges.

779
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,400
One, entering and remaining in a restricted building.

780
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Sounds like he did that.

781
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,480
Two, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building.

782
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Almost certainly.

783
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,360
Three, violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building.

784
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Yeah, that's true.

785
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,460
Four, impeding passage through the Capitol grounds or Capitol buildings.

786
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,680
No other way to be a mob in front of the door.

787
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,280
And five, parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.

788
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,080
I could be wrong, but I don't think that Sam's going to get in any real trouble about this,

789
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,840
unless there's some kind of information that the state has that I'm not privy to, like

790
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,440
where he was in greater coordination with people than we know.

791
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,700
I don't know.

792
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,320
Unless that's the case, I would guess he's going to get a slap on the wrist and maybe

793
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,280
not even that.

794
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,160
One of the charges about disorderly conduct and violent entry is described like this in

795
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
the filing.

796
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,600
Quote, to willfully and knowingly utter loud threatening and abusive language or engage

797
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,020
in disorderly or disruptive conduct at any place on the grounds or in the Capitol buildings

798
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,040
with the intent to impede, disrupt, or disturb the orderly conduct of a session of Congress

799
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,440
or either House of Congress or the orderly conduct in that building of a hearing before

800
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,240
or any deliberations of a committee of Congress or either House of Congress.

801
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
Right.

802
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,840
You can't go in there and scream, go fuck yourself.

803
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Yeah.

804
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,320
But framing that as him getting charged for loud utterances is fun because it makes it

805
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,360
seem like the government's trying to punish Sam for yelling, but that's not what happened.

806
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,700
Yeah, it makes it seem like the government's trying to punish him for yelling, go fuck

807
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,080
yourself to Nancy Pelosi.

808
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Right.

809
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Yeah.

810
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
That's not quite the same thing.

811
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
You kind of lose the context of it.

812
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
A little bit.

813
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,880
And, you know, Alex is just saying that he's getting charged with making loud utterances.

814
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,240
It's like, there's five charges.

815
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,840
The documents are right there.

816
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Yeah.

817
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Stop playing games.

818
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
They're public too.

819
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,640
Man, everybody's trying to jam Alex up and this is just a part of it.

820
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
Sure.

821
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,640
They've had all the major mainstream media, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all of

822
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,080
them, uh, approach people and offer them money to lie about us.

823
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,660
They've had the big tabloids do it.

824
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,960
They have done Facebook scan searches on any body that even ever took a photo with me and

825
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,040
people that take selfies.

826
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,480
Uh, if I'm randomly at a restaurant, uh, these women will get a call from the Wall Street

827
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,080
Journal, the New York Times saying you have a relationship with Alex Jones.

828
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,600
They go, no, I don't know Alex Jones.

829
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,360
I mean, I met him once took a photo with him, with my husband that go, okay, well we heard

830
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
he raped you.

831
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
What?

832
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,040
No, this is a preposterous and we then get calls from these people and have confirmed

833
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
it.

834
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:03,040
So thousands of people are called by the Savage criminal operators of just the actual leftist

835
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,240
intelligence agency crime Lords.

836
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,640
And then they control the FBI and order the FBI to then go and reverse engineer it.

837
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,160
So these media entities, the mainstream media are essentially leftist crime Lords and they

838
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,840
run the FBI.

839
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,340
And so the media comes up with this stuff and then they reverse engineer an investigation

840
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,240
through the FBI to jam someone up.

841
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:35,320
I think, I think that Alex is used to people he knows like Jacob Wall and James O'Keefe

842
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,720
operating like this where they're trying to set traps and that's the news that they're

843
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,640
doing what we're doing, even though we're the ones doing it and they aren't.

844
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,200
I think that because those people that are in his sphere do this stuff that he thinks

845
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,080
that everybody does.

846
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah.

847
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,600
And I think that he thinks that's how media and news operate and that's scary.

848
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,940
Which is one of the big things that we can see as a problem with Jacob Wall and the ilk

849
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:10,440
there because that undermines confidence in any and all media outlets if you are so brazenly

850
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,920
corrupt about it.

851
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Yeah.

852
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,200
And if people have it in their mind to equate the two.

853
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Yeah, of course.

854
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,280
As if the people of that ilk are in any way analogous to the media.

855
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Yeah, no.

856
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:30,040
Real journalism is lying your way into buildings to surreptitiously record people and then

857
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,660
edit together misleadingly.

858
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,000
That's what people believe.

859
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Mm-hmm.

860
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah.

861
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Mm-hmm.

862
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That's great.

863
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
That's good.

864
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That's good for the fourth estate, damn.

865
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Sure.

866
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah.

867
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So there's a CNN article about Matt Gaetz, The Gate of Gaetz.

868
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Sure.

869
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes.

870
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And...

871
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Never heard of the guy.

872
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,380
Well, Alex maybe didn't actually read this article.

873
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
That could be a problem.

874
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,960
I saw a CNN article.

875
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,180
Gaetz attended parties with drugs and it'd be some huge party in Miami or a big hotel

876
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,780
suite party and the women went to the media to say he was really nice and he didn't give

877
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,360
us money and we didn't even see him using drugs.

878
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,960
One woman said, I saw him take a pill once, but he was really nice and the women were

879
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
all 25, 30.

880
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,960
But that's at the end of the article.

881
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,560
And then other women go, yeah, I'm getting offered money to say Gaetz did something to

882
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
me.

883
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
And it's not that Gaetz is perfect.

884
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
He's a rich kid.

885
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
He's a smart guy.

886
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
He's admitted he's a party animal.

887
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,960
Hell, he's for drug legalization and I'm not endorsing any of that, but I'm not a hypocrite.

888
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,340
I've never been a drug problem person, but I've been, let's just say it, I'm pretty much

889
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,940
an alcoholic off and on.

890
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,720
That it doesn't need to go down like this.

891
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,080
It doesn't.

892
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
It's unnecessary.

893
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,000
Why are you involving yourself in the story?

894
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,380
We would all be like, that's fine.

895
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,480
There's no way Alex is involved with this Matt Gaetz story if you wouldn't keep involving

896
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
yourself.

897
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Hey look, I love the booze.

898
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
Hey, I'm an alcoholic.

899
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,740
Why did you tell me that?

900
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:57,440
So the actual headline of this CNN story is quote, women detailed drug use, sex, and payments

901
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,680
after late night parties with Gaetz and others.

902
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,480
That does seem like a different headline than the one that I was presented with.

903
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Slightly, slightly different.

904
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Yeah, that is a little bit different.

905
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,120
The article relies on the stories told by multiple women who claim to have been at these

906
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
parties.

907
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,520
There is a mention of Gaetz behaving quote, like a frat type of party boy, sometimes taking

908
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,920
pills she believed were recreational drugs.

909
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,600
This person saw him taking pills that were believed to be recreational drugs.

910
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah.

911
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,440
So the article mentions these women being paid by Joel Greenberg, but not directly ever

912
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,800
by Gaetz, and they quote, said they never saw anyone at the parties who appeared to

913
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
be underage.

914
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,440
Additionally, the women disputed the characterizations of what they were aware of happening as being

915
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
sex trafficking.

916
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Sure, sure, sure.

917
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Which is fine.

918
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Could just be sex work.

919
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Yeah.

920
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,560
I don't know why, like I said, Alex can't even just touch this story, get into it at

921
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,040
all without some personal thing about himself.

922
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
It's very weird.

923
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:58,560
Yeah, it is feeling a little like, oh no, my son is in trouble, I gotta protect this

924
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
poor idiot.

925
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
It's very weird.

926
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

927
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
I wouldn't do that.

928
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
No!

929
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,920
I would do anything else but get involved and then tell everyone I'm an alcoholic

930
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
on air.

931
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,280
Now, speaking of things you would or would not do.

932
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Sure.

933
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,560
If you were Alex's lawyer, what would you tell him to say publicly about the whole Sam

934
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
issue?

935
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,680
Ooh, I would tell him probably to say something along the lines of, we don't believe these

936
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,920
charges are accurate and we are fighting against these, my lawyer has advised me to say nothing

937
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
beyond that.

938
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,880
Now, if you were Alex's lawyer and you advised him not to say anything, you probably wouldn't

939
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
want to hear this.

940
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
This could be an issue.

941
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,200
But my lawyers and people are like, I would not talk about this at all.

942
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,720
Oh, just so it's all over the news and they can lie and say I sent him in there and he

943
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,560
had flame throwers and hand grenades and cut Pelosi's head off.

944
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm not going to sit there and wait for that crap.

945
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,160
I'm going to put out a million dollar bounty.

946
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,640
So yeah, Alex is going to set the record straight before people can say he had grenades and

947
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
stuff.

948
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Yeah, okay.

949
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,280
Now my lawyer told me not to say anything, so here we go, I'm going to say I'm a bunch

950
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
of shit.

951
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,920
All right, here we go.

952
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,580
Shoot that shotgun of bullshit at us.

953
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,560
So here comes, here's what Alex is, here's his story and he's going to be sticking to

954
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
it.

955
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm sure this is going to be very consistent, fully.

956
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,600
So here's what happened.

957
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,680
Um, everybody wanted to go to DC and had a carnival atmosphere.

958
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,000
And I told Harrison Smith, you can go on the next trip out of here.

959
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,840
You here to do the shows while we're all there and to cut to us life.

960
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,360
Well Sam, who almost fired for it, but he's a likable guy, so I didn't do it, but he came

961
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
as close.

962
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,320
He's a good guy and said, well, if Alex isn't going to send me, I'm going to go with the,

963
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
my pillow people.

964
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,560
And he got press passes, White House press passes from them for the main event.

965
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,520
And then I find out later he's in the Capitol that day and got the footage of like Sam got

966
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
footage of the woman being killed.

967
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,480
And I had a huge meltdown on the rooftop, sort of cussing at people.

968
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,200
I said, I didn't, I ain't supposed to be in Austin running things.

969
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
He's got footage of these.

970
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
And I go, yeah, here it is already on Twitter.

971
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,400
Then I go, why is it on Twitter and not on us?

972
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,640
What the hell?

973
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:10,580
So Alex said Sam couldn't go, Alex as your counsel, Sam said Alex can't go, or Alex said

974
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580
Sam can't go.

975
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,760
You and Harrison Smith need to stay here and throw to us while we're there.

976
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Gotta do whatever it is you were doing.

977
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,280
I know it's going to be a carnival, but you got to work.

978
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Yeah.

979
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Sam says, fuck that.

980
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,040
I'm going to go talk to Mike Lindell and apparently goes to the Capitol with Mike Lindell.

981
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Right.

982
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
The my pillow people.

983
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Right.

984
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Yeah.

985
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Okay.

986
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Sure.

987
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
So then Alex.

988
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,000
Well, I mean, everybody that works for Infowars, I assume is now an independent contractor

989
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
completely.

990
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,160
So Alex is unaware that Sam has gone with the my pillow people.

991
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,400
Honestly, he's never met Sam before in his life.

992
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,880
So he finds out that Sam is in Washington DC when he finds out that he has footage of

993
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,000
the woman being shot.

994
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,140
But at the same time, Sam was along with Tyler Hansen at the time who was burning a Black

995
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:02,280
Lives Matter flag with Owen Schroyer the night before and had shared a hotel room with Owen.

996
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
You would think.

997
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
Seems like they might've.

998
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,100
They might've had text messages.

999
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,760
Or maybe Sam was there when they burned the Black Lives Matter flag.

1000
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Sure seems like it.

1001
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Who might've been hanging out.

1002
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
It seems weird.

1003
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Yeah.

1004
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,840
That whole burning the Black Lives Matter flag kind of puts it out of carnival atmosphere

1005
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,520
and more into bloodthirsty mob atmosphere.

1006
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,320
I don't believe for a fucking second that there wasn't an awareness that he was there

1007
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
in DC.

1008
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Absolutely.

1009
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
That's ridiculous.

1010
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
No.

1011
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
I don't know what it means that he went with the my pillow people.

1012
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,960
He went with the my pillow people.

1013
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,300
You know who you should investigate?

1014
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,560
Mike Lindell.

1015
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
That's who you should investigate.

1016
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
Boy doesn't feel like that.

1017
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,840
You should go see the my pillow people.

1018
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
They're the ones.

1019
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,080
In other words I'm mad that he didn't give me the footage.

1020
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,960
I wish he had given me the footage until this moment when I definitely don't wish he gave

1021
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
me that footage.

1022
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,440
So the next day after the 6th on the 7th Alex is talking with Sam and he's like hey dude

1023
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
shit's fucked up.

1024
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Bruh.

1025
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Bruh.

1026
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
This was a terrible idea.

1027
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Right bruh?

1028
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Bruh.

1029
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Bruh.

1030
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
You fucked.

1031
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
You gonzo.

1032
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
And Sam was like hey buddy.

1033
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
I get it.

1034
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
It's all good.

1035
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Look I'm with the my pillow people now.

1036
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
No it's all good man.

1037
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,640
You shit.

1038
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,520
And then Sam talks to me I guess the next day and I go Sam.

1039
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,360
You're probably gonna get in a lot of trouble even though you didn't do anything.

1040
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,800
You know as a journalist did you do anything wrong in there and he goes no no it's fine

1041
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
everything's fine.

1042
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,040
I said that's not the case Sam but we'll see.

1043
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,520
And here we are a couple months three months later and you see what's unfolding since January

1044
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
6th.

1045
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Okay.

1046
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
So.

1047
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Yep.

1048
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,400
I really don't think the people on the right really understand what unfolded on January

1049
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,640
6th.

1050
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,480
And if they do they are lying about it.

1051
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,680
Well I think one of the problems is the you know the ripples of the fake shit that they

1052
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,040
came up with to make excuses about it.

1053
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Sure.

1054
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,720
It's taken a while to catch up with the reality of you know reality keeping on existing.

1055
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,680
Yeah it keeps going whether you like it or not.

1056
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,400
So Alex heard that Sam got arrested.

1057
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Sure.

1058
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Right?

1059
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Yeah.

1060
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,000
And even though he told him he was gonna be in trouble on the 7th.

1061
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Right.

1062
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,640
And then last night in 2021.

1063
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Sure.

1064
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,360
Last night he interrogated people at Infowars Studios.

1065
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
What was Sam up to?

1066
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
Get the fuck out.

1067
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,880
So then I got to interrogate some people here last night and check their messages and make

1068
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,380
damn sure when I tell you the story it's what the truth is and I said I thought I said they

1069
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,040
had to stay here and run the shows.

1070
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,760
Well he told me he was going with my pillow people and if he got footage he'd give it

1071
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,800
to us and maybe we'd reimburse him if he asked for receipts or something and I said so again

1072
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,860
as usual no one does what I tell them.

1073
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,040
That's why I blow up.

1074
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
Okay.

1075
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,940
As usual when facing legal troubles I really want to check the messages and make sure I

1076
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,280
am telling the truth and there are a few other times when I do this.

1077
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,280
And I have literally no control over anything.

1078
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Nope.

1079
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Nobody knows what I'm doing.

1080
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,760
I don't know what anybody's doing.

1081
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,000
This is an anarchist outfit.

1082
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,720
Legally no one listens to me.

1083
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Legally.

1084
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,520
I have never met any of these people.

1085
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,320
So it seems strange to me that Alex would have talked to Sam on January 7th and then

1086
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,020
in April he's interrogating people and checking messages about something that he clearly knows

1087
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,020
what happened.

1088
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,240
Has no idea it was a cold case, Stan.

1089
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I don't understand.

1090
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,320
He's starting a podcast to investigate Sam's involvement.

1091
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Get the piano out.

1092
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,680
Yes, it's a new serialized podcast.

1093
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,640
Uh, yeah, but look dude.

1094
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Sure.

1095
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,880
I mean this story doesn't make sense.

1096
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
No it doesn't.

1097
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,880
What?

1098
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
Who cares?

1099
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Good point.

1100
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Sam sucks.

1101
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
Plus, Sam is not that extended.

1102
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
He's not a good guy anymore?

1103
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,840
He's a video editor, low level, camera guy, been here three years and I'd say he's, you

1104
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
know, second string.

1105
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,480
He's a great guy, but he's not gotten trained up to that point.

1106
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
It takes time.

1107
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,160
And sure enough, he went on his own volition, went in there and I don't, I don't say that.

1108
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,080
To like me, oh, you know, I didn't tell him to go in there even.

1109
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,660
No, I mean, I didn't, but it doesn't matter.

1110
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,660
He didn't do anything wrong.

1111
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,720
It really sounds like Alex is trying to be like, I didn't have anything to do with this

1112
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
shit.

1113
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,040
This is like a story that Avon Barksdale's lawyer is telling.

1114
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,920
Like listen, my client has never been anywhere near drugs.

1115
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,760
He's never seen any of these people before.

1116
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,160
I don't know why you are trying to malign a businessman and large character in the community.

1117
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,440
Quite frankly, Bodhi is a second string.

1118
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,280
Listen, if he was part of my crew, I would tell you he was only a mid-level manager.

1119
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,680
He didn't have much going on.

1120
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,560
He was selling drugs on his own and even if he wasn't, then I wasn't wrong.

1121
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
I don't know.

1122
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,320
He had just got his own coroner, he was, he was moving up in the world, but he wasn't

1123
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
any good yet.

1124
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,920
I would say that if I were Sam, I wouldn't like to hear that.

1125
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,720
I would be real unhappy.

1126
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,080
Yeah, here I am in prison for info wars and Alex is on air saying I'm second string.

1127
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,920
Yeah, I think we're going to see a little bit of a Shadowgate fall out of this one.

1128
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,640
Unfortunately Sam has been let go.

1129
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,040
If I were Alex, I would be going out of my way to say everything positive about this

1130
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
guy.

1131
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,040
Totally.

1132
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
He's worked there for three fucking years.

1133
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,360
You know, you know what Roger Stone said about Trump when he got arrested?

1134
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,120
The nicest things anyone has ever said.

1135
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,720
Oh my God.

1136
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,160
He prayed for pardons?

1137
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,520
No, and look at it the other way.

1138
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,080
Trump said nice things about Roger.

1139
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
Exactly.

1140
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
When Roger got arrested.

1141
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Yes, because you don't want nobody telling nothing.

1142
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
No.

1143
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Exactly.

1144
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,040
That's what the lawyer from The Wire would suggest.

1145
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:40,520
So Sam got jammed up because one of his family members tipped off the enforcement that...

1146
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,720
They needed a family member to tip people off?

1147
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,840
I guess they weren't watching info wars.

1148
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,360
Oh, that's fair.

1149
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,880
It's not something I would recommend most serious people do.

1150
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
That is fair.

1151
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,680
But Alex is all over the place talking about Sam's family.

1152
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,280
And I was this close and I said, you know, Sam's a nice guy.

1153
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,900
I'm not going to, I'm not going to fire him.

1154
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,200
And then I got to learn that his family member, we know who it is because he told us how she

1155
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,600
won't even come to family dinners because he's a conservative and his dad is, they're

1156
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
big Trump supporters.

1157
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Is that it?

1158
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,600
His family member, one of his siblings won't even come to dinner with him for years because

1159
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,600
of Trump.

1160
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,960
Sam's a big Trump supporter.

1161
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,800
I mean, you see Sam at the RNC five years ago talking to me, shaking my hand in videos

1162
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
that Eric Andre shot.

1163
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,760
I mean, he's like, he's, he's, he's, he's been around, he's a big fan and so we're praying

1164
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,760
for him.

1165
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
We support him.

1166
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,760
He's in jail.

1167
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,760
Okay.

1168
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
This is all over the place, man.

1169
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
This is weird.

1170
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Yeah.

1171
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
A more important person.

1172
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,640
Perhaps somebody not on the second string would be getting a nice little defense fund

1173
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,640
boost.

1174
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,680
We're setting something up to help him instead.

1175
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,040
Sam just gets a nice little, we're praying for him.

1176
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,560
Obviously we hope he's doing well.

1177
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,560
He will definitely be working here when he gets out of jail 100%.

1178
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,960
I will not be firing him immediately.

1179
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,600
We've sort of talked to his dad.

1180
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,360
But again, it's important to remember that what's at stake here and what's real about

1181
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,280
this story is not, it doesn't even involve Sam at all.

1182
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
No.

1183
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
It involves Alex.

1184
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
Of course.

1185
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,280
So we're praying for him.

1186
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,280
We support him.

1187
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,080
He's in jail, uh, for raising his voice in the Capitol and they've got the quotes about

1188
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,900
woo woo, America standing up, all this stuff, but he was wearing two hats.

1189
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,900
He's a journalist.

1190
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,080
He had a presidential, uh, uh, uh, media pass.

1191
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,520
He thought the president was going there.

1192
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,400
The police opened the doors and waved him in.

1193
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,520
That's why he went in and covered it.

1194
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,760
He got the footage of the woman dying.

1195
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,520
He had other mainstream media there.

1196
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,480
So they have to all be indicted if he's indicted.

1197
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,320
It's all a fraud in a hope, obviously, to keep him in jail for a nonviolent offense

1198
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,400
to try to have him turn state's evidence and make stuff up about me so they can put me

1199
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,880
in prison and shut down info wars.

1200
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,120
And that's their admitted goal.

1201
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,120
Wow.

1202
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,600
So that was a lot for them to have as a goal of sure.

1203
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Yeah.

1204
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,000
They didn't process this story except as it being part of an elaborate plan to get him.

1205
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,860
If I were Sam, I would be a bit worried about how my arrest was being used as a prop to

1206
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,400
justify Alex's completely out of control narcissism.

1207
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
You'd think.

1208
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,360
I want to take this clip piece by piece.

1209
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Okay.

1210
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,280
The first little piece here is that Alex is claiming that Sam just said, woo woo, America

1211
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,280
is standing up.

1212
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,280
That is not true.

1213
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280
That doesn't sound right.

1214
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,160
Here's some of the quotes from the charging documents.

1215
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Okay.

1216
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
Quote, we've had enough.

1217
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,080
We're not going to take your fucking vaccines.

1218
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,480
We're not going to take all your bullshit.

1219
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,400
The people are standing up.

1220
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,200
That sounds like something he might say.

1221
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,280
Quote, here we are in the US Capitol in Washington DC in the Capitol building.

1222
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,680
It has officially been stormed by Trump supporters.

1223
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,760
Again, the US Capitol building in Washington DC has officially been stormed by Trump supporters.

1224
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,760
And here we are taking our the people's house back.

1225
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,120
I wouldn't want that anywhere where people would have that on recording.

1226
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,000
I especially wouldn't want to say be recording myself while I was saying those things.

1227
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,760
It's not in the list of quotes in the charging document, but my favorite quote from Sam's

1228
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,940
live stream was when he was walking in, entering the Capitol building and he does a plug for

1229
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,840
Info Wars store.

1230
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
It seems weird.

1231
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:08,000
Like maybe if he was there with my pillow, he should have plugged them, but I didn't

1232
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,120
send him down there.

1233
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,240
I guess, I guess loyalty runs deep, but it's also a one way street because Alex doesn't

1234
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
give a shit.

1235
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,620
This dude's second string.

1236
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,620
That's brutal.

1237
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,720
The next piece is that Alex is claiming that Sam had a press pass.

1238
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,340
That is also not true.

1239
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,920
From the charging document quote, the director of the congressional press galleries within

1240
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,000
the Senate press office did a name check on Samuel Christopher Montoya and confirmed that

1241
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,600
no one by that name has congressional press credentials as an individual or via any other

1242
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,600
organizations.

1243
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,560
I have no idea what Alex is trying to claim, but there's no way that Sam had a press pass

1244
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,420
to be where he was.

1245
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,680
That's complete bullshit.

1246
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,440
And there also wasn't any other like mainstream media where Sam was.

1247
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,640
The videos that have come out have been played on other outlets or things that people purchased

1248
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,640
from the folks who were there.

1249
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,920
The media isn't going to be like, Hey, let's go wander inside the middle of this blood

1250
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,680
thirsty mob that hates the media.

1251
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,680
Uh huh.

1252
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,680
Yeah.

1253
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,680
Uh, yeah.

1254
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,760
Wear one of those hats with a little card from the coverage I can find in any real outlets.

1255
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,320
It really feels like Alex is heightening this to a point of absurdity.

1256
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,480
This is my area of interest and what I cover.

1257
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,840
And honestly, I don't think I care nearly as much about the arrest as I do about Alex's

1258
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,080
response.

1259
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,200
It's complete sensation, a sensationalization where Alex is trying to walk this interesting

1260
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,640
line where he has nothing to do with Sam's actions, but the consequences that are coming

1261
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,280
to Sam are secretly an attack on him.

1262
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
Yes.

1263
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,480
This is how a narcissistic mind would interpret something like this.

1264
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,240
Like Alex is blameless and all negative consequences are secretly a plot against him.

1265
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Yes.

1266
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,240
And if I were Sam, I would realize this is a plot and I am being used.

1267
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,200
I would immediately go, Oh, he's a vicious narcissist.

1268
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,480
Oh, why would I think that he was anything but that who would help me out in my hour

1269
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,480
of need?

1270
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,960
No, but I mean, look, it's all about getting Alex.

1271
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,560
Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.

1272
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,600
So there are now hundreds of news articles proliferating like mushrooms going, Oh, Alex

1273
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,080
Jones is going to get arrested.

1274
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,520
Alex Jones is finally going to get it.

1275
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
We're going to shut him up.

1276
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,280
He sent in one of his reporters to attack the capital of the most vicious attack on

1277
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,960
the U S since Pearl Harbor.

1278
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,000
You know, they're actually saying that this was as bad as Pearl Harbor asinine.

1279
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,240
Again, Alex is making this all about himself.

1280
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,840
I failed to find any mainstream media articles that fit the description of what he's talking

1281
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,840
about.

1282
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,640
But again, if he actually means random tweets when he says media articles, then there's

1283
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,260
nothing I can really do about that.

1284
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,000
It's just the delusions of a liar.

1285
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

1286
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,560
Also about that Pearl Harbor thing.

1287
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,140
This is just Alex misrepresenting comments made by Chuck Schumer after the storming quote.

1288
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,620
It's very, very difficult to put into words what has transpired today.

1289
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,400
I've never lived through or even imagined an experience like the one we've just witnessed

1290
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,960
in this Capitol.

1291
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,840
President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy.

1292
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,780
Unfortunately we can now add January 6th, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American

1293
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,700
history that will live forever in infamy.

1294
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,720
Alex has taken this and twisted it into Schumer saying that the storming of the Capitol was

1295
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,600
worse than Pearl Harbor when he said no such thing.

1296
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Yeah.

1297
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,520
Interestingly, there was a recent comment about Pearl Harbor that you might find interesting.

1298
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Hmm.

1299
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,520
Quote, we went through the worst attack we've ever had in our country.

1300
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,720
This is the worst attack we've ever had.

1301
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,040
This is worse than Pearl Harbor.

1302
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,760
It's worse than the World Trade Center.

1303
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,680
There's never been an attack like this.

1304
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:38,440
Ooh, I'm going to go with Paul Ryan about something 10 years ago.

1305
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,840
No, it was Trump talking about COVID-19 in May of last year.

1306
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
There it was.

1307
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,960
I'd like Alex's comments on that.

1308
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,600
I'd like to see what he thinks about Trump saying that COVID-19 is worse than Pearl Harbor

1309
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,600
in 9-11.

1310
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,080
Well, you know, you don't need to worry about the things that Trump says.

1311
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,800
It's more about the vibe he gives to it.

1312
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,800
Right, right, right.

1313
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,280
Speaking of vibes, Alex has this vibe, right?

1314
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,320
Sure.

1315
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,720
Sam got popped.

1316
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,920
So Alex has nothing to do with this.

1317
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,840
However, Sam was there the night before with Owen.

1318
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,320
Well, I don't know.

1319
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,880
Actually, I'm not 100% sure Sam was there the night before.

1320
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,440
When Sam was in the Capitol, Tyler Hansen was there as well at the same place, and Tyler

1321
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,040
was sharing a hotel room, hanging out with Owen, and burning a Black Lives Matter flag.

1322
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,320
They all knew they were there.

1323
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:32,200
It seems like there's a very clear associate chain of people.

1324
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Right, right, right.

1325
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,080
Sorry about distracting you.

1326
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:41,280
So Sam got popped, and Alex has this vibe that's like, it's unfair.

1327
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,320
Other people protest at the Capitol, and they don't get arrested.

1328
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,920
I don't need to say that I didn't send Sam in there because I need to protect myself.

1329
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,040
I'm saying it because it's the truth.

1330
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,480
But it doesn't matter because you saw Kavanaugh hearings where they took over, blocked the

1331
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,480
halls through things, chased Congress people onto elevators, blocked the elevators, did

1332
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,480
all that stuff, and nothing happened to those people.

1333
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,400
But when a couple hundred people go in behind a few dozen morons that were violent and who

1334
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,920
did do wrong, they don't all deserve to then be indicted when the police officers wave

1335
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,520
Sam Motea in.

1336
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,360
That's the second time Alex has gotten his name wrong.

1337
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,360
Sam Motea.

1338
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Yeah.

1339
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,240
The guy who definitely is a good guy.

1340
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,880
Second string, Sam Motea.

1341
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Yeah.

1342
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,760
Boy, if I were Sam, I would be like, I'm racking my brain for shit that's unrelated to the

1343
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,760
six.

1344
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,320
I'm going through any crime I can think.

1345
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,280
I think he embezzled 50 bucks one time.

1346
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,680
He took it from petty cash.

1347
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,960
It was Alex.

1348
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,840
As for the Kavanaugh protesters, it feels like no one got arrested there to Alex because

1349
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
he doesn't care.

1350
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,840
Right.

1351
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,460
And acknowledging that there were arrests would hurt his narratives.

1352
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,160
In reality, you can find articles about mass arrests that took place around the Kavanaugh

1353
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,160
hearings.

1354
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,800
CNN had an article on October 5th, 2018 about 293 people being arrested by the Capitol Police

1355
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,760
for unlawful demonstrations.

1356
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,240
A Mother Jones article lists the arrests at Kavanaugh protests.

1357
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,040
And if you add them all up, not including the group one from that CNN article, you end

1358
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,440
up with 662 arrests at Kavanaugh protests.

1359
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,900
That's a ton.

1360
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:18,080
And the main difference between then and now is that these anti-Kavanaugh protesters didn't

1361
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,340
try to take over the fucking Capitol.

1362
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,060
How many people did they kill?

1363
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,000
Alex pretends that no one got arrested protesting Kavanaugh because if he acknowledged that

1364
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,920
they did, he'd either have to argue that they shouldn't have and then be defending evil

1365
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,520
leftists, or he'd have to accept that there are consequences for people's actions.

1366
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,600
And currently, Sam is experiencing what a lot of others before him have.

1367
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,560
It was a risk that he either knowingly or unknowingly accepted when he decided to film

1368
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,560
himself going into the Capitol with a bunch of lunatics, and recognizing that dynamic

1369
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,720
is a big threat to Alex's entire pitch about how they're all victims.

1370
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,720
Yeah.

1371
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,120
The right has no idea what it means to actually protest.

1372
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,120
No.

1373
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,440
Like, they just don't get that.

1374
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:04,480
They don't understand the idea about accepting consequences when you put yourself in these

1375
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,480
situations.

1376
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,480
That's the point.

1377
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,560
You are accepting that something will happen to you in order to stand beside a ton of people.

1378
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,720
You can't take all of us.

1379
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:19,880
The cause is important enough to you that you risk whatever consequence may come.

1380
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:26,880
It's illegal to occupy this space and sit in the Capitol, let's say, for example.

1381
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,400
And you do that knowing that the consequence could be that you get arrested because it

1382
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,440
will bring attention to whatever cause you are there protesting.

1383
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,360
Yeah, I think they're just so used to getting whatever they fucking want.

1384
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,360
Yeah.

1385
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:46,000
It's so bizarre for people who are just so interested in personal responsibility to not

1386
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,600
understand this dynamic.

1387
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Yeah.

1388
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Oh well.

1389
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
It's not bizarre.

1390
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,260
People who are really interested in personal responsibility are usually really interested

1391
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,880
in it for other people.

1392
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,280
Yeah, maybe.

1393
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:04,300
So mike down for this clip because it was so weird, but another defense of Sam is that

1394
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,560
he's got a lot of hats.

1395
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,600
He's wearing hats.

1396
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,880
He was wearing a MAGA hat when he was there, literally, but he was also wearing a journalist

1397
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,400
hat and also just like a, hey, I'm cool guy hat.

1398
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,720
And he got really, really dramatic footage.

1399
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,600
And so we left it up because he was operating as a journalist.

1400
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,000
So they're going to try to say, well, he's not a journalist when he's making political

1401
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
comments.

1402
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,360
Well, everybody can wear two or three hats.

1403
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,040
You can be out playing golf and then say something to the news cameras about your view on apartheid.

1404
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,940
You know, 30 years ago, you can be at a star Wars premiere and say something about animal

1405
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,940
rights if you want.

1406
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,440
It's two different hats.

1407
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Okay.

1408
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,040
I'm guessing that Alex is referencing Gary player.

1409
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,160
Yeah, something, but man, that's a weird poll for him to make as an example of someone wearing

1410
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,160
two hats.

1411
00:56:50,160 --> 00:57:04,880
I think that was on Alex's mind because Trump gave a Gary player a medal of freedom or whatever.

1412
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,880
That's too predictable.

1413
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,960
I hate people like this.

1414
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Yeah.

1415
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,960
So that's weird.

1416
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,040
I think that there's a slight difference between a golfer giving a unpopular opinion or you

1417
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,880
making some kind of a political comment when you're on a red carpet.

1418
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,760
I think those are a little bit different than you being, uh, in the middle of an inactive

1419
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,800
participant in the storming of the Capitol, but you're a journalist because you have a

1420
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
camera.

1421
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Yeah.

1422
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,200
They like to pretend that it wasn't a massive bloodthirsty attempt to take over the entire

1423
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,760
country, hopefully triggering Trump to Institute martial law.

1424
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,200
So you have a, everything under your control, they don't like to deal with that part.

1425
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,340
Well, the circumstances are a little bit weird to me because it's not analogous to someone

1426
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,680
at like a movie premiere saying something political.

1427
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:53,600
No, the, the version that I think would be really funny is if someone was, let's say

1428
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,600
storming the Capitol.

1429
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
Sure.

1430
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,600
But they were wearing like Godzilla versus Kong merch, so they argued they were just

1431
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
doing promotion.

1432
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Yeah.

1433
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,600
There's two hats.

1434
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
Yeah.

1435
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,480
I'm a marketing major and also I am attempting to overthrow a country.

1436
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
Right, right, right.

1437
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Yeah.

1438
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,480
Yeah.

1439
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,440
I think I remember that and Marquis de Sade, whenever they stormed the Bastille came out

1440
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,600
with copies of his book and he's like, just while I'm here, look, where is there

1441
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,080
going to be more free press attention than at the storming of the Capitol?

1442
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,360
You want to get the word out about your movie?

1443
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,720
That's the place.

1444
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,960
Has anybody ever said no press is bad press, my friends, because that's the truth.

1445
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,120
I don't, I don't, I don't think that this argument holds up in my mind that he's wearing

1446
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,120
two hats.

1447
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:41,080
How long before that's a legitimate advertising strategy, fucking Disney is like, okay, here's

1448
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,080
what we do.

1449
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,400
We're going to storm the United States Capitol and then after we've done all this damage,

1450
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,120
we're going to remove our shirts all at once and it's going to be the next Pocahontas movie.

1451
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,280
And everyone's going to blame soy bomb.

1452
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,280
Yeah.

1453
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,060
Yeah, that sounds right.

1454
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,820
So I got this real sense and I think it's kind of a normal sense to get in situations

1455
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,640
like this that Alex is obviously making this all about himself.

1456
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,640
Sure.

1457
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,640
Duh.

1458
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:11,900
But as Alex talked more, I really got a feeling that it kind of felt like he is mad that it's

1459
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,840
not him.

1460
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,160
It seems like he wishes it was him who got arrested.

1461
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
Good enough.

1462
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
Martyr.

1463
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,160
Mm hmm.

1464
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
Yeah.

1465
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,920
Disrupting would be blocking him, blocking the door, shutting down the hearing quickly.

1466
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,280
He's talking about when he went to Congress and yelled at Sundar Pichai.

1467
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,280
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

1468
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,320
I don't believe you should do that, but particularly I got angry also because the, in the hearings

1469
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,680
they'd been talking about me, they did talk about me in that hearing.

1470
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,920
I was in there for five angry hours and they said my name at least six, seven times and

1471
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,180
they had Congress people pointing me out in the back row with Roger Stone going, there's

1472
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,560
the Russians, there's the spies right there.

1473
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,740
I'm not a Russian spy, you trash.

1474
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,440
And you know it, you're the globalist butcher in this country.

1475
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,440
Sure.

1476
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:06,180
So again, what I did was 10 times more aggressive than Sam and if he is indicted, I deserve

1477
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,120
to be indicted for what happened.

1478
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,000
I see, that's how I operate.

1479
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I am Spartacus.

1480
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,240
The law is a fraud, the whole application of it's a fraud, it's garbage.

1481
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,800
So please arrest me, please.

1482
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,600
I want to be a martyr, it would give me so much attention.

1483
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,720
Secondary attention is not good enough.

1484
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,520
Uh-uh, what is this, what is this?

1485
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,720
Just a second string cameraman that's getting arrested, I can't turn him into a martyr that

1486
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,720
leads the movement?

1487
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,720
I did 10 times worse.

1488
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,760
I am the worst person here, he says confidently knowing he won't be arrested or inconvenienced

1489
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,760
in any way.

1490
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,760
So silly.

1491
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,760
Yeah.

1492
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:47,040
So we get now to that Washington Post, I'm sorry, Washington Times, quite different.

1493
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,040
Yeah, hold on.

1494
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,520
Headline that Alex was talking about earlier in the episode.

1495
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,920
Is Dr. Fauci the father of the pandemic?

1496
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:01,040
An incredible Washington Times article out just yesterday, admitting he basically ran

1497
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:07,120
the Wuhan lab, it had hundreds of groups funding it, but his program with Obama continuing

1498
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,880
under Trump till he pulled out of it two years before COVID launched, about a year into Trump,

1499
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,880
Trump pulled out of it.

1500
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,480
We showed you those documents last week, to his credit, that he got back into it by then

1501
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,940
supporting their damn vaccine, it's a terrible idea, but that's the facts.

1502
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:22,940
That's the facts?

1503
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,120
Those are the facts?

1504
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,240
What facts are those?

1505
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,320
I think that that makes Trump look worse.

1506
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,800
That makes him look incredibly stupid.

1507
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,960
Yeah, if any of that were true, which it's not, that would make Trump like a willing

1508
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,880
participant in bio warfare against the American people.

1509
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,680
Because it's not him just letting the program continue, it's him being like, I got to stop

1510
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,720
this program, and then a couple of years later, them being like, come on, let's kill everybody.

1511
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,360
And he's like, I'm tired, sure, go for it.

1512
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,720
That makes him real, real bad.

1513
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1514
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:59,360
So we know from looking at past episodes of Alex's show that when Alex first learned about

1515
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,440
Anthony Fauci towards the beginning of the pandemic, huge fan, loved him, he's a great

1516
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,440
guy.

1517
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,440
Didn't do him, he's a legend.

1518
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,600
He's a man among men.

1519
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,600
One of the best.

1520
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,960
Trump's got him out there, he's going to- Best person to lead the fight.

1521
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,840
Right, because he was, Alex thought that Fauci was saying stuff that worked for his conspiracies.

1522
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
Right.

1523
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,880
Turned out it didn't, so he threw Fauci under the bus pretty quick.

1524
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,920
Also we know from listening to past episodes, Steve Pachanik used to think that Anthony

1525
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,040
Fauci was one of the best in the business.

1526
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,040
True.

1527
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,600
Because they went to Columbia together.

1528
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,600
Yeah, exactly.

1529
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,600
Or Cornell.

1530
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Or Cornell together.

1531
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,640
And that has changed that tone.

1532
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,640
Right.

1533
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,640
Turns out we have a new villain backstory.

1534
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,240
How do I know Fauci's in charge?

1535
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,180
He's been involved running these attacks and bioweapon attacks against Africa and others

1536
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,240
since before Gates was even out of college.

1537
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,960
Gates has worked directly under him.

1538
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,960
Fauci is the guy that actually runs the operational programs.

1539
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,760
He's been doing it for 40 years at least.

1540
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,760
And his, because I read transcripts, his word for word stuff a week before, a month before,

1541
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,120
a day before, will word for word come out of Gigi Pink's dirty mouth and out of the

1542
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,000
UN's dirty mouth, the WHO's murderous mouth.

1543
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,260
He's in charge.

1544
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,340
He's the one.

1545
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,340
He's the one.

1546
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,340
He's the one.

1547
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,340
Look at him.

1548
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,340
Look at him.

1549
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,340
Look at him.

1550
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,340
Look at him.

1551
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:23,900
He looks like an academic and we hate those.

1552
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:29,840
So Fauci's been running bioweapon attacks for like 40 years and yet Steve Pachanik,

1553
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,920
the great insider who knows everything in his overthrown countries, secretly the Forrest

1554
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:41,320
Gump of world history, thought he was a great guy until like just now.

1555
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,600
No, I would say that Steve Pachanik thought he was a great guy until he was the first

1556
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,240
person to be infected with COVID-19.

1557
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,600
He cured himself.

1558
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:55,320
So once he got infected, he realized that Fauci had been lying to him the whole time,

1559
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,040
even since he was young, because Fauci was actually recruited into this program when

1560
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,440
he was zero years old.

1561
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,880
He was grown in a lab, Dan.

1562
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,480
Since he was zero and a half years old, he was also exactly five foot eight at the time,

1563
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,480
et cetera.

1564
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,480
Yep.

1565
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,480
I think I proved it.

1566
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,480
That sounds right.

1567
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,480
Yeah.

1568
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,480
Yeah.

1569
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,080
I feel like the more and more you try to parody what Alex is talking about.

1570
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,560
It's going to say it next week.

1571
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,560
Yeah.

1572
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,040
It's not far off enough to actually be funny.

1573
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,000
I just don't know how far I can go.

1574
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,080
We're just basically in comic book territory at this point.

1575
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,080
That is true.

1576
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:33,600
So Alex is complaining about this article, not really dealing with it at all, but the

1577
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,600
headline's fun for him.

1578
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,600
Sure.

1579
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,600
Sure.

1580
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,600
So that's great.

1581
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,600
Yeah.

1582
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
And then Alex reads another headline.

1583
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
I'm a clinical lab scientist.

1584
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,600
COVID-19 is fake.

1585
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,600
Wake up.

1586
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,600
And it continues on from there.

1587
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,600
It continues on from there.

1588
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,600
It continues on from there.

1589
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,400
Dan, does it continue on from there?

1590
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,400
It does.

1591
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,600
Would that continuation perhaps provide context for this headline?

1592
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,600
Yeah.

1593
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,280
That headline is just the first line of a meme post that's been going around on message

1594
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,240
boards and Facebook since at least early December.

1595
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,560
It was initially attributed to an anonymous doctor, but since it's been claimed to have

1596
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:06,800
been written by Dr. Rob Oswald, a virologist and immunologist at Cornell University's Department

1597
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,800
of Molecular Medicine.

1598
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,840
Man, Cornell is out of its mind-growing lunatics at us.

1599
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,080
Oswald didn't write that.

1600
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Oh, okay.

1601
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,080
And he doesn't agree with the sentiment.

1602
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,080
Sure.

1603
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,840
But people get tricked more easily when you pretend that someone with expertise in a particular

1604
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,000
field is saying something, as opposed to some random idiot on the internet.

1605
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'm pretty sure Thomas Jefferson said that.

1606
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,080
This is what Alex is covering in his stack of news.

1607
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,400
This is something that passed the test of what should be printed off and covered on

1608
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,320
this program, which is just pathetic.

1609
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,320
It's a meme.

1610
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,040
You got to share memes, otherwise they won't become powerful.

1611
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,040
It's not even new.

1612
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:42,200
New memes are just old memes waiting to be reused.

1613
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,200
Great.

1614
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,760
Something else that's getting reused is Norm fucking Pattis.

1615
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,120
Oh, no.

1616
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,120
No.

1617
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,120
Really?

1618
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,120
Norm Pattis.

1619
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,120
Oh, man.

1620
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,280
He's a lawyer extraordinaire, guy who had to sit silently and awkwardly while Alex put

1621
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,560
a bounty out on his ass, and he hooked enemies.

1622
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,560
There's got to be...

1623
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,160
I think at this point, Pattis has to be in it for the stories.

1624
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:08,400
You know, like 20 years from now, he's sitting at a bar just being like, I can tell you tales,

1625
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,400
man.

1626
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,880
I suspect that maybe he's flown too close to the sun with Alex.

1627
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,440
And he can't go anywhere else.

1628
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,440
Might realize...

1629
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,320
It might be starting to realize like, ah, shit.

1630
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,320
I don't know.

1631
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,800
Maybe it's part of a book thing that he's trying to write.

1632
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:27,400
Like, you know how some strippers or sex workers or the like, they're like, oh, I do this.

1633
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,520
And then they write a book and they go on Oprah.

1634
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,840
That's what Norm Pattis is going to do.

1635
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,840
I don't know.

1636
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:37,060
Because the more that I hear Norm, the more I feel like he's being more willing to say

1637
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,060
Infowars-y stuff.

1638
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,060
That's true.

1639
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,520
Whereas before, it seemed like he had a little bit of restraint.

1640
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,940
It seemed a little more professional.

1641
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,820
He seems like a real fucking shithead in this interview.

1642
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,820
That's not good.

1643
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,820
Yeah.

1644
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:54,520
So anyway, Alex introduces him and he also gets Sam's name wrong again.

1645
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,520
Great.

1646
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,720
I wanted to get Norm Pattis as a famous criminal lawyer and constitutional lawyer and also

1647
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,940
does work for us on the first amendment issue quite a bit on, you know, he doesn't know

1648
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,640
all the facts and this all just happened yesterday.

1649
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:15,280
So he's going to be limited on what he talks about with our Infowars reporter, Sam Motea.

1650
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,560
Wow.

1651
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,080
Sam, you got to listen to this broadcast.

1652
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,580
This is one that's going to change things for you.

1653
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,200
This broadcast is going to put you on a path to a better life.

1654
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Alex is trying to do you dirty.

1655
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,200
Yeah.

1656
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,640
And one of the funny things about Norm's appearance here on the show is that you get a real sense

1657
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:35,000
that he's kind of trying to reassure Alex that like you're clean.

1658
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Okay.

1659
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You're good, man.

1660
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,360
What I know in Mr. Montoya's case is that he was arrested for his conduct on the Capitol

1661
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,360
that day.

1662
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,080
I understand he had a press pass.

1663
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,400
Federal authorities may or may not be aware of that.

1664
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,920
The press pass may or may not have protected him from all the consequences of what he was

1665
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,320
doing that day.

1666
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,200
That's a question that will have to be sorted out in a court of law.

1667
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,400
You know, I represent you, obviously, my primary concern is you.

1668
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:05,960
I do not believe there are facts sufficient to warrant a further investigation of you

1669
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,960
or much less an arrest.

1670
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,680
I'm prepared to wage that fight when the time comes, if it comes.

1671
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,680
Yeah.

1672
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:18,040
I don't know, from everything I can see publicly available, Norm's probably right.

1673
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,040
Yeah.

1674
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,200
Like, he was promoting Infowars while he was live streaming going into the Capitol.

1675
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Sure.

1676
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,920
But who's to say if Alex asked him to do that or is even aware that he was doing that?

1677
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1678
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,520
Yeah, that is something that will have to be seen.

1679
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,840
But it is interesting that there's like, yeah, yeah, he's gonna have to go to court.

1680
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,840
You're cool.

1681
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Yeah.

1682
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,840
Hey, buddy, buddy.

1683
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,840
My primary concern is you.

1684
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,840
He's not my client.

1685
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,440
He doesn't pay me.

1686
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,440
You do.

1687
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,840
And let me tell you something right now, you keep saying what you're saying, you never

1688
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,840
met the guy.

1689
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,840
You're cool.

1690
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:51,840
We're gonna have a good night.

1691
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:58,960
So they get to talking about the shooting of Daunte Wright in Minneapolis, or in Minnesota.

1692
01:08:58,960 --> 01:08:59,960
Yeah, sure.

1693
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,840
I want to get my lawyer buddy on to do that, yeah.

1694
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:08,120
This takes a turn for the uncomfortable.

1695
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Let's talk about this.

1696
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,360
This is just now breaking.

1697
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:14,680
We know the name of the female police officer who said, get ready Taser.

1698
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,080
And then she shot and killed Daunte Wright.

1699
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,520
He's in the middle of rioting.

1700
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,560
He's got a warrant out for armed robbery.

1701
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,200
The city's burning, the police station shot up.

1702
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,520
He's kicking police flailing.

1703
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,860
She absolutely shoots him in the fog of war.

1704
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:28,860
That's what happens.

1705
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,860
I'm not glad it happened.

1706
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,200
But he's a thug waving guns around on the internet.

1707
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,200
You know, all this, he's dead.

1708
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,200
Now, what does he expect?

1709
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,680
You go to a riot, you're probably gonna get killed by somebody.

1710
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,880
Surprisingly, one person got killed.

1711
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,640
Fox is making up almost all of the details of this shooting.

1712
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,240
Daunte wasn't at a riot.

1713
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,880
He was pulled over for having expired tags on his license plates and having hanging air

1714
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,640
fresheners that blocked his mirrors.

1715
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,900
Very minor things.

1716
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,500
He wasn't fighting with the police, though it does appear that he was trying to get back

1717
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,880
into his car before he was shot.

1718
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,440
There was a misdemeanor warrant for Wright's arrest, but it was unrelated to an aggravated

1719
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,400
robbery charge he'd gotten in December 2019.

1720
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,120
It had to do with missing a court date for a misdemeanor of carrying a pistol without

1721
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,400
a permit, something Alex should not think is a crime.

1722
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,040
There's a conversation to have about this shooting, but it's literally impossible to

1723
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,820
deal with any of the real underlying issues if you're like Alex and you insist on creating

1724
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:22,720
a completely fictional version of events to tell your audience.

1725
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,920
It's important to understand that Alex does this all the time.

1726
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,480
Real events become fiction, with his addition of tons of details and subplots that aren't

1727
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,480
real.

1728
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:36,400
And it's critical to understand how he uses fictional augmentation of real stories, because

1729
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,920
it's one of the easiest ways to see his biases.

1730
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,640
When it's a black man who's killed, the story is supplemented with all sorts of extenuating

1731
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:48,960
circumstances and details that make it so sad that the guy kinda had it coming.

1732
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,620
We've seen this play out over and over again recently with George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.

1733
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,760
The opposite is done when it's a white person who's killed, as we saw so grotesquely in

1734
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,640
the case of Kate Steinle.

1735
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,640
In reality, an immigrant found a gun wrapped in a rag that he didn't even realize was a

1736
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:08,120
gun, he picked it up, the gun discharged, and a ricocheting bullet accidentally and

1737
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,220
tragically hit Steinle.

1738
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:14,140
Alex's retelling of the story became a tale where this immigrant saw Steinle with her

1739
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:18,400
dad who the immigrant thought was her older boyfriend and the immigrant was jealous that

1740
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,920
she was with, he was with someone so beautiful and he couldn't have her so he killed her.

1741
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,840
These strategies are intentional because reality isn't what's real to Alex.

1742
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,080
What's real is this white supremacist ideology and archetypes that he can try to justify

1743
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,140
by using real life events and tragedies as props.

1744
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,160
And you see that and it's very, very obvious.

1745
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,080
So I mean, one of the things that I think is really important whenever we're talking

1746
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:48,260
about Alex Jones and the things that he does is often times it's less important to look

1747
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:54,040
at what is being done as like the structure of why these things are being done.

1748
01:11:54,040 --> 01:12:00,600
Alex is creating side stories and details about the story of this shooting in order

1749
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,840
to make it more palatable for his audience to not care.

1750
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,280
And he does the reverse when it's a white person who has been shot.

1751
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:13,620
It's just very obvious whenever Alex says something like, where, how am I racist?

1752
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,280
This is a key example.

1753
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,760
This strategy and this tactic is a fingerprint.

1754
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:25,240
Yeah, I mean it's immediately obvious simply because his argument, even if he says it's

1755
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,940
not okay for the cops to kill people, his argument always boils down to it's more okay

1756
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,440
for the cops to kill black people than white people.

1757
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,440
Yeah.

1758
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,440
Yeah.

1759
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,800
His behavior dictates that that is his position.

1760
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,400
That has to be true in his situation.

1761
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,680
So there you go.

1762
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,040
You're a racist piece of shit.

1763
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:47,320
Alex is taking issue too with the fact that the name of the police officer in Minnesota

1764
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:54,360
was released and that the officer who shot Ashley Babbitt in the Capitol has not been

1765
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,360
released.

1766
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,360
Sure.

1767
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,360
And then Norm chimes in.

1768
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,800
The department of justice closes investigation, the death of Ashley Babbitt.

1769
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,480
And they say, since when do you have an investigation?

1770
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,560
Like it's national security, like it's the CIA and we don't even, they've closed the

1771
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,480
investigation and we don't even know the person's name.

1772
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,400
This is a very dangerous precedent here, Norm.

1773
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,760
What do you think is going on here?

1774
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,760
I have no idea.

1775
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,040
I mean, and that's the problem.

1776
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,400
It's not transparent.

1777
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,060
I know that had she been black and there were no charges, no transparency, there might be

1778
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:31,080
more riots in the streets and then we'd be talking about the need for a so-called racial

1779
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,080
reckoning.

1780
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,080
Are you a lawyer?

1781
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:41,960
Man, you know, the past few years have really made me think that passing the bar is not

1782
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,840
as hard as it has been advertised.

1783
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,840
Cool, Norm.

1784
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,840
Jesus Christ.

1785
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,840
Wow.

1786
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,920
A racial reckoning.

1787
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,920
Yeah.

1788
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:56,560
He's saying that the reason that no one is concerned with who the Capitol police officer,

1789
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,360
and I don't even know if I'm going to allow that stipulation to stand, but he's saying

1790
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,200
that we would ever want to be up in arms if it was a black person who had gotten shot.

1791
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,240
That's wow.

1792
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,240
This guy's a lawyer.

1793
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,240
That's not good.

1794
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,240
Nope.

1795
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,240
That's not good.

1796
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,240
Nope.

1797
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,640
So if there's ghosts in the neighborhood, there's something strange in the neighborhood.

1798
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,640
Sure, sure, sure.

1799
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,640
Who are you going to call?

1800
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,300
I would call the Ghostbusters.

1801
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,300
That is correct.

1802
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,840
Who would other people call?

1803
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,960
Now, if there's a rustling in your house at night, maybe if it was a burglar, who would

1804
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,960
you call?

1805
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,520
I would still call the Ghostbusters.

1806
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,080
Those proton packs are fucking powerful, man.

1807
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,080
Do they affect people?

1808
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,080
I don't know.

1809
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,080
I've never...

1810
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,640
I mean, if you cross them, they'll make something come to life, I guess.

1811
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,640
You'd call the police.

1812
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,200
I would totally call the police.

1813
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,200
Yes.

1814
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,200
And in that, you and Norm...

1815
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,200
Wait, what?

1816
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,200
No, I would never call the police.

1817
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,240
I would die before calling the police instantly.

1818
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,880
Norm would call the police.

1819
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,200
Calling the police is essentially attempted murder at this point.

1820
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,200
But I'll tell you something.

1821
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,880
If I hear a rustle at the door tonight and somebody's trying to enter my home, I'm calling

1822
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,880
911.

1823
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,920
I'm not calling Black Lives Matter.

1824
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:05,840
That's the kind of statement that I hear and my only response is, okay, all right, all

1825
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,840
right, man.

1826
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,840
Yeah.

1827
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,840
Cool.

1828
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,160
Why would you call Black Lives Matter if someone's breaking in your house?

1829
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,960
They're not a police organization.

1830
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,320
They're not law enforcement.

1831
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,560
I don't know.

1832
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,560
I just don't...

1833
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,900
I just don't know.

1834
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,880
Are you really going to use that as a thing that's acceptable to say?

1835
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:28,920
Well, it's really bizarre because I think we might be dealing with a Norm who's trying

1836
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,960
to get into a second line of work.

1837
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,120
Oh, he's looking for that Milly Weaver slot that opened up.

1838
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,440
No, I think he's trying to get into standup.

1839
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,440
Oh, no.

1840
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:43,640
I tried my debut at standup comedy the other night at a small club in Connecticut and I

1841
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,720
ended my riff with the following, hey, you know, I tried to buy woke insurance the other

1842
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,720
day.

1843
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,720
The crowd looked at me.

1844
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,720
What's woke insurance?

1845
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,840
Well, woke insurance is what you need if you're a white man because I'm reading the paper

1846
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,600
and everything that's wrong with this country is my fault.

1847
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,240
How am I going to pay for all of this?

1848
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,100
I need woke insurance.

1849
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:06,160
And we're at a point where that sort of humor isn't necessarily farcical any longer.

1850
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,400
He's going to fit right in and stand up.

1851
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,400
Wow.

1852
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,400
Wow.

1853
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,400
Listen.

1854
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,400
Listen.

1855
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,940
He's not funny and he is a bitter white dude.

1856
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,040
He's going to go straight to the top.

1857
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:23,040
Or at least straight to every single open mic I've ever been to in my entire life.

1858
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah.

1859
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,680
Then the bitterness is going to keep on growing.

1860
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,480
Oh, it's never going to stop.

1861
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,480
Wow.

1862
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,480
It's never going to stop.

1863
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,480
I don't know.

1864
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,400
I feel like if I were interviewing my lawyer and they decided to get into racist, hacky

1865
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,760
standup, I might be considering a change in representation.

1866
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,760
Yeah.

1867
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,760
Yeah.

1868
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:41,760
Yeah.

1869
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,760
Yeah.

1870
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,760
Yeah.

1871
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,020
I guess I'm going to call Saul Goodman from here on out.

1872
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,020
Better.

1873
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,020
This is not good.

1874
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,020
This is not good.

1875
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,020
No.

1876
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,020
Don't tell me.

1877
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,020
Don't tell me that you started doing it.

1878
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,400
I don't want anyone to tell me they started doing standup.

1879
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
No.

1880
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,960
Especially not Norm fucking Pattis.

1881
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,160
Definitely not Norm Pattis.

1882
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,160
Not a good bit.

1883
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,160
Oh yeah.

1884
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
Are there problems?

1885
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,160
Yeah.

1886
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
Yeah.

1887
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,160
I would go with the structure.

1888
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,080
So if you're buying woke insurance, let's explore this.

1889
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,080
Okay.

1890
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
Let's do this.

1891
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,080
So let's say you're a woke insurance agent.

1892
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,080
Right.

1893
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,080
Right.

1894
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,080
Right.

1895
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,080
I'm a door to door woke insurance salesman.

1896
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
Right.

1897
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,080
So you come to my door.

1898
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,080
You're white.

1899
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,080
Right.

1900
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
Okay.

1901
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,080
So I need woke insurance.

1902
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
Right.

1903
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,080
What does this protect me from?

1904
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,720
It protects you from if people are rioting.

1905
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,200
So flood insurance.

1906
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,200
Sure.

1907
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:36,200
That is like, okay, so if my house floods, this money that I pay when it doesn't flood,

1908
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:41,920
so whenever it does flood, if it does flood, then you can have money to fix my flooded

1909
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,920
house.

1910
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,920
Sure.

1911
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,920
Sure.

1912
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,920
So woke insurance, it's got to be something where you pay.

1913
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,920
Totally.

1914
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:47,920
That's what's happening.

1915
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,920
I agree with you.

1916
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:49,920
I don't know.

1917
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,920
Scream the N word at people.

1918
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,920
Now.

1919
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,920
Now.

1920
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,920
Now.

1921
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,200
That doesn't protect you from that.

1922
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,320
It only protects you from the racial reckoning, dad.

1923
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:02,360
So if a racial reckoning occurs, you're going to want woke insurance.

1924
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,360
Okay.

1925
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:08,640
So you're immune from this quote unquote racial reckoning if you've paid your dues to your

1926
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,640
woke insurance.

1927
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,820
Of course.

1928
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,860
Why would we have woke insurance?

1929
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,860
What do you think this is?

1930
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,360
Some sort of scam?

1931
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,480
I don't understand what it's for.

1932
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,960
You're a white man and you need it.

1933
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,240
That's all I need to tell you.

1934
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,760
The world is changing, Dan, without this woke insurance, you could be left in the dust.

1935
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,800
I think a better way to tell this bit if the way that Norm wants to do it would be something

1936
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,600
like a protection racket.

1937
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,860
You know, it's not insurance.

1938
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,560
It's insurance, like the mob kind of insurance, right?

1939
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,560
Sure.

1940
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,000
I mean, isn't that like more the vibe he's trying to give?

1941
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,240
Hey, you don't buy this insurance.

1942
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,680
We're going to say that you said the N-word in public.

1943
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,120
If you don't pay your woke dues, they'll come and get you or something like that.

1944
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,040
Isn't that more the bit he's trying to do?

1945
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,080
It would make sense because it does seem like it's-

1946
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,640
I don't understand what woke insurance is and his conception of it.

1947
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:00,000
I mean, I think it protects you from being dog piled on for being a racist is essentially

1948
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
what he's saying.

1949
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
How?

1950
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,680
Well, if you get dog piled on for being racist, there's a potential loss of income or of course

1951
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,120
a potential gain of income.

1952
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,720
I mean, how does the insurance work?

1953
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:17,040
You pay money a month and then whenever you get dog piled on for being the racist piece

1954
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,040
of shit you are-

1955
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,640
The insurance company comes around and is like, oh, he's cool.

1956
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,760
We'll be like, hey, no, hey, no.

1957
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,840
This guy gets a free rental car.

1958
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,840
We cover those.

1959
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,960
And then, but no, they have to, the insurance company would have to be like, it's cool.

1960
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,960
It's cool.

1961
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:30,960
Stop the dog pile or whatever.

1962
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,960
Sure.

1963
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,960
Well, we can't do that.

1964
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,280
But then that implies, or it has to imply that the people who are doing the dog piling-

1965
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,280
Right.

1966
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,720
That's the work for the insurance company.

1967
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:47,040
If you haven't discovered this yet, the Woke Insurance Company runs the world.

1968
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,040
Yeah.

1969
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,040
Yeah.

1970
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,400
This bit could use some work.

1971
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,400
Probably.

1972
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,240
His delivery could use some work.

1973
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,240
Yes.

1974
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:58,280
Telling people a standup joke outside of the context of a comedy club is a bad idea.

1975
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,280
It is.

1976
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,280
Yeah.

1977
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,960
So Norm goes on from bad standup bits to biblical analogies.

1978
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,960
Now I heard you say before the break-

1979
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,960
Sounds like my standup.

1980
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:10,120
I asked your listeners to go to the Gospel of John chapter five.

1981
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,200
And that's the story of the sick man at Bethesda.

1982
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,620
Jesus went to the fountain.

1983
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,560
There was a man laying beside the fountain.

1984
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,560
He was ill.

1985
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,560
Should have had fountain insurance.

1986
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,080
When the waters would rise, they had healing power.

1987
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,320
He was begging for somebody to move him so that he could be touched by the water.

1988
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,960
And Jesus said, why are you here?

1989
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,380
I want to be into the waters, he said, but every time the waters move, others beat me

1990
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,380
there.

1991
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:33,420
Jesus looked at the man and he didn't create an affirmative action plan.

1992
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:37,080
He didn't create a program for a racial or disabled reckoning.

1993
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,800
He looked at the man and said words that I don't think we say often enough to one another.

1994
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,760
Pick up your bed and walk.

1995
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,920
And the man did.

1996
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,920
He had the power within himself to take care of his own situation, as I believe we all

1997
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,920
do.

1998
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,720
So my view is the next time somebody asks you for something on account of their skin

1999
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,720
color, tell them.

2000
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,640
I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021.

2001
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,880
I am almost glad that he got cut off by the break and we don't know what he suggested

2002
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,880
you tell people.

2003
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,880
Yeah.

2004
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,880
Yeah.

2005
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,880
That's, that's good.

2006
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:15,720
So when you are a lawyer, you do realize that other people do not have the capacity within

2007
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,600
themselves to defeat the law.

2008
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,920
Does that make sense?

2009
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,400
Take your bed and walk.

2010
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,840
I feel like that's, you are abdicating any and all personal responsibility.

2011
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,600
Go ahead and take your bed and walk.

2012
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:36,480
I also, I just don't see Jesus seeing a man who can't walk and thinking this requires

2013
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,040
a top-down structural change.

2014
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,280
I think the whole point of Jesus was the bottom-up kind of stuff.

2015
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:46,040
Also wasn't the whole thing about Jesus is that he did miracles?

2016
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,040
Isn't it, isn't it?

2017
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,040
No, no, no.

2018
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,040
It was the water.

2019
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,680
But, but like people got healed by touching him and stuff.

2020
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,680
Sure, sure.

2021
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,680
That did happen periodically.

2022
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,240
Well, he coated himself in the water.

2023
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,240
Okay.

2024
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,600
He was always covered in water.

2025
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,320
He was, it's left out of the Bible, but Jesus was a very wet man.

2026
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:10,280
I would say that basically what Norm is doing here is using a biblical story to get the

2027
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:14,040
message across to people to stop complaining.

2028
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,600
Hey, you know what?

2029
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:22,120
I think if you ever see, if I saw a slave, Dan, obviously I would go up to the slave

2030
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:26,400
and they would be like, Hey, we need some structural changes here because I'm a slave

2031
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,600
and that's wrong.

2032
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,080
I would look at him and I would say, get your bed and move.

2033
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,080
See?

2034
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,000
Everybody has it within themselves to solve their own problems, Dan.

2035
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,440
There's no doubt about that.

2036
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,280
Take your stick and get the fuck out, is what Jesus said.

2037
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,120
So we have one more clip here from the time that Norm is on and Alex is talking about

2038
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:51,600
a story about Patrisse Cullors, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter.

2039
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,080
Apparently some attention has come to the fact that she's bought some houses recently

2040
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,680
and Alex has this to say.

2041
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,680
Well, I mean, now the Black Lives Matter lady that their own people are calling for investigation

2042
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:06,000
looks like embezzled tens of millions, 10.6 million given to Black Lives Matter causes

2043
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
last year.

2044
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,440
She's calling it white supremism to investigate her.

2045
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,760
I mean, no, you moved into all white neighborhoods.

2046
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,760
You have a private airfield.

2047
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:18,680
Turns out you've got like six houses, tens of millions of dollars.

2048
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,420
And then she says it's white supremacy.

2049
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:24,520
If she's so afraid of white supremacy, why are all her houses in the most white neighborhoods

2050
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,680
I've ever heard of?

2051
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,000
Because she's trying to recolonize the continent that was stolen from Native Americans and

2052
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
to disconfit her neighbors by showing that we're here and we matter.

2053
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Wow.

2054
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Oh boy.

2055
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:46,680
Kind of feels like Alex's question answered itself.

2056
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,560
Segregation now, segregation forever is what you might as well have just said.

2057
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,040
He's kind of saying like, if this person's so worried about white supremacy, why don't

2058
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,940
they just leave our all white neighborhoods alone?

2059
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,680
That does seem like nuts.

2060
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:03,760
It does seem like the point he's trying to make is if you're worried about white supremacy,

2061
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,080
you should leave our country.

2062
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:12,520
So Patrisse Cullors released a statement on Instagram about this sort of questioning of

2063
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,520
her money.

2064
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,520
Sure.

2065
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,320
And you know, she said that she has a number of different careers and revenue sources,

2066
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,600
but they quote, I do not receive a salary or benefits from Black Lives Matter Global

2067
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,260
Network Foundation.

2068
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:26,840
She didn't say that investigating her or questioning her is white supremacy.

2069
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,960
She did say, quote, this effort to discredit and harass me and my family is not new, nor

2070
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,220
is it acceptable.

2071
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:35,880
It's taken away from where the focus should be, ending white supremacy.

2072
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,000
And that's been twisted by Alex to saying like, it's white supremacy to investigate

2073
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
me.

2074
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Sure.

2075
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:49,480
So Norm takes off and I think that was one of his worst appearances.

2076
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,080
And that was one of the most blatantly racist things I've heard Norm say.

2077
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,080
Yeah.

2078
01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:00,720
I mean the standup bit alone is graceful and that's like maybe third on the list of problems.

2079
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:06,400
So Alex comes back and he decides he's going to take matters into his own hands about this

2080
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,000
whole thing, about the non-releasing of the name of the cop.

2081
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Yeah.

2082
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,620
See, if he wasn't such a, such a bad lawyer, I would say Norm Pata should be there for

2083
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:15,620
that part.

2084
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:16,620
No, no.

2085
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:17,620
Norm had to get out of there.

2086
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,620
Yeah.

2087
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:22,880
And I think it's our moral responsibility to release the name as best we know, the man

2088
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,880
is a capitalist officer.

2089
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,880
Oh, that's not good.

2090
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,880
Don't do that.

2091
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,880
If he's not the officer that did it, that's fine.

2092
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,880
Don't say it as best we know.

2093
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,880
They can contact us and let us know.

2094
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,560
But it came out, you know, that the internet believed they knew who it was and the name

2095
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,560
and the information.

2096
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,560
That's not good.

2097
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,960
And so I believe the public has a right to know not to go after this officer.

2098
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:38,960
Uh, yeah.

2099
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:39,960
Okay.

2100
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,960
I believe that.

2101
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,960
Yeah.

2102
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,960
Yeah.

2103
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,800
I would say that generally speaking, if you just have a hunch that somebody is the person

2104
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:52,520
of interest in this case, don't report that.

2105
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,520
Here's what happens a lot.

2106
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:59,740
Whenever somebody reports the name of somebody accused of murder and says, as best we know,

2107
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:00,740
this is the person.

2108
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:01,740
Right.

2109
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,480
A lot of the times it's not the person and you really fucked up their lives.

2110
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,480
Yeah.

2111
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,120
It's something that you can't really take back.

2112
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,120
Never.

2113
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,880
You can't really predict what the audience's response to your shitty reporting will be.

2114
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:16,880
Totally.

2115
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,840
You don't know what you expect people to do.

2116
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:23,160
Even if you are correct, you're like, I don't want anyone to go after this person.

2117
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,720
What else could people do?

2118
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:25,720
Yeah.

2119
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,240
Why would you give them the name?

2120
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,240
Yeah.

2121
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,240
I don't understand.

2122
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:32,400
I look, the people have a right to know exactly the person.

2123
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,240
I totally don't want you to target.

2124
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,520
I am however, giving you the name.

2125
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,960
I'm strangely enough, I'm going to read off the address as well, but I don't want people

2126
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,560
to bother this person at all.

2127
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:48,860
I am getting a sense that Alex is pissed off that he is not being oppressed like his buddy

2128
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:49,860
Sam is.

2129
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:50,860
Yeah.

2130
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:51,860
Yeah.

2131
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:56,220
And so he's going to throw a wild curve ball and try and dock somebody and see if it gets

2132
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:59,240
him in trouble so he can be the real victim.

2133
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,240
Yup.

2134
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:04,660
And also he wants to be clear, this is just because he believes that the capital officer

2135
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,660
is black.

2136
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:06,660
Okay.

2137
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:07,660
Yeah.

2138
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:08,660
That makes sense.

2139
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:09,660
That makes sense.

2140
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,660
He takes careful aim and kills her.

2141
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,660
Okay.

2142
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:12,660
That's what he did.

2143
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:16,000
And the grand jury didn't indict him, so whatever.

2144
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,680
All I know is we know every white cop that kills a black person's name, but when a black

2145
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:26,680
person kills a white person, we don't hear about it because the media wants to act like

2146
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,120
it's only white people killing black people.

2147
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,600
And that's not true.

2148
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,360
Holy shit.

2149
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:38,420
I would say like the most impure of motives are being expressed here in terms of Alex

2150
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,480
wanting to say this person's name.

2151
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,480
Openly.

2152
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,480
Openly.

2153
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,480
Openly.

2154
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:48,720
That's, that's one of those things where it's like, you can not say things.

2155
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:49,720
Yes.

2156
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,320
And you can, you can, you can not say this person's name because you can't prove that

2157
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,440
it is the right person.

2158
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,040
Which makes it a very bad idea to single them out.

2159
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:02,120
Second, you cannot say on air that you're really just pissed off on a race issue.

2160
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,120
Yes.

2161
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,120
Yeah, yeah.

2162
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,120
Your white aggrievement is, is...

2163
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,360
I don't know why people call me racist.

2164
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,440
Anyways, I expect different treatment for black people.

2165
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,440
Jesus.

2166
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:15,280
Anyway, it gets racist more, I guess.

2167
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,560
So when a white police officer or Hispanic police officer shoots a white person, a black

2168
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:25,400
person, a whatever person, it's instantly on the news every time.

2169
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:31,520
But when a black man shoots a white man or a white woman, it's never on the news because

2170
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,880
only whites do bad things.

2171
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,880
You've heard we're evil.

2172
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:38,000
So our intent exposing this is not to say black people are inherently bad or that what

2173
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,560
one black person does reflects on others.

2174
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,240
It's just, we're going to be fair here.

2175
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:48,200
We're not, listen, we're not saying insert the only reason we would be saying this.

2176
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,120
We're not saying it because of that.

2177
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:55,200
We're definitely not saying it because of insert the only reason anyone could say this.

2178
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,080
That's not why we're saying this.

2179
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,080
It's outrageous.

2180
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,760
No, we're not saying it because of this.

2181
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,520
The only possible reason we could have for saying this.

2182
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,160
We're saying it for a different reason.

2183
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:07,480
Now, all right, look, I think Alex wants attention.

2184
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:13,360
He wants this to blow up, get him in a little bit of trouble, but he doesn't want that much

2185
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,360
trouble.

2186
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:15,360
So he has a fall guy.

2187
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,800
He's never met Sam before in his life.

2188
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,000
He has a fall guy and it happens to be the guy who was in the Capitol with Sam.

2189
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It was not.

2190
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,600
Get the fuck out.

2191
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,600
Tyler Hansen.

2192
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,600
Jesus Christ.

2193
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,280
Tyler Hansen has been a pretty good investigative journalist over the years and he's been on

2194
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:34,000
the show before and he and others say they have the identity of Ashley Babbitt's shooter,

2195
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,800
which in the three plus months, the feds never released and now they cleared the police officer

2196
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,960
without saying his name of it.

2197
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:41,960
You don't normally see that.

2198
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:42,960
Do you?

2199
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:43,960
Like some citizens shoot somebody in their backyard.

2200
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,680
Later, you hear they were indicted or they were cleared, but you heard their name day

2201
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,680
one.

2202
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,720
So is he in the new royalty?

2203
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,480
Sometimes you don't.

2204
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,120
Sometimes names aren't released.

2205
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,240
You know, I don't know.

2206
01:29:55,240 --> 01:30:05,000
I think that the sound of a whooshing, fast moving vehicle that meant to carry a bunch

2207
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:11,400
of people that Tyler should be hearing right now, because it's coming and Alex is throwing

2208
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,400
you the fuck under it.

2209
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,400
Not good.

2210
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,400
Not good.

2211
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,400
Nope.

2212
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:19,060
In case Alex gets in any trouble, don't worry, I'm just repeating what Tyler Hansen told

2213
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,060
me.

2214
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,060
Yeah.

2215
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,060
Okay.

2216
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:25,720
So Hansen also the guy who burned a Black Lives Matter flag with Owen Troyer the night

2217
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,720
before January 6th.

2218
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,200
He's a very good investigative journalism.

2219
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,200
Cool guy.

2220
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,480
Well, no, Alex said he's pretty good.

2221
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,480
Pretty good.

2222
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,480
Pretty good.

2223
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,480
He's a pretty good investor.

2224
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,480
That's faint praise.

2225
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:40,640
I mean, it's kind of so fucked up that it's like, if I have to explain to you the difference

2226
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:49,520
between a cop running down and chasing a child and shooting them or fucking choking a man

2227
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:58,400
to death versus a mob of people storming the fucking Capitol building, trying to tear down

2228
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:04,320
the walls, running with people with fucking guns and goddamn everything.

2229
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:09,200
If you can't see the difference between that type of shooting and not, there's no point

2230
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,200
in talking.

2231
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,840
No, you're being intentionally obtuse if you don't.

2232
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,760
There's just no way for me to communicate with you if you don't see the difference.

2233
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:25,320
And, again, assuming that the person who was the police officer in the Capitol was black,

2234
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:32,040
trying to pretend that the relevant difference between those two issues is a racial one is

2235
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,040
absurd.

2236
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,040
Yes.

2237
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,040
That is...

2238
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,040
Absolutely absurd.

2239
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,480
But it's what employers would want to do, because it helps with the white-agreement

2240
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:43,940
narratives that are the fuel that the machine runs on.

2241
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:49,040
So Alex is going to name this guy, and I want to leave it in just because I looked into

2242
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:54,900
it and you can find it being like, it all goes back to Tyler Hansen, but he tweeted

2243
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:59,240
it out and it's out there, it's public, so it's not like...

2244
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:04,080
If it were something that I couldn't really find easily, I might bleep it just because

2245
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:10,840
I don't want to add to this, but just for the sake of demonstrating that Alex is completely

2246
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:17,800
and unconfidently not knowing at all if he's correct naming someone as a shooter here.

2247
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:18,800
Not good.

2248
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:23,040
Now, maybe he's not the officer, but for months his name has been known, so if he's not the

2249
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,840
officer, let us know, or we're going to do a foyer, I assure you.

2250
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,840
A foyer?

2251
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,280
I've asked my lawyer to do it.

2252
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,280
Foyer.

2253
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,280
You've asked your lawyer to foyer?

2254
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,120
Because we have a right as the press, a right to know.

2255
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,940
The identity of Ashley Babbitt's shooter is Lieutenant Michael Leroy Byrd, says Taylor

2256
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,600
Hansen on Twitter.

2257
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,240
So again, throwing Tyler Hansen under that bus.

2258
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:48,400
Hey, Hansen said this name that I'm not saying for any of those insert reason...

2259
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,400
Yeah, yeah.

2260
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:56,360
I have a way larger platform than Tyler Hansen, and I am going to rely on his reporting, but

2261
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:01,280
I'm also going to say that maybe it's not the guy, and hey, if it's not him, maybe he

2262
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:05,720
could call in and correct me about it, because that's the responsibility of the people that

2263
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,280
you accuse of things.

2264
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,280
Totally.

2265
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,800
Look, we're just asking questions, and if these people would come forward and tell us

2266
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,800
the answers, we wouldn't need to ask any more questions.

2267
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,480
This is definitely not something we're saying in bad faith.

2268
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,480
You've never heard this before.

2269
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,880
Not once in your life have you heard us say something similar to this in bad faith.

2270
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,880
Right.

2271
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,360
This is like Alex claiming that Bill Gates is in the Council of 12 or whatever, because

2272
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,800
he said it on air and Bill Gates hasn't corrected him.

2273
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,800
Totally.

2274
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,800
If he wasn't in the Council of 12, he would have called into my show.

2275
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,040
I would have been incredibly deferential towards him because he's powerful and I am a coward.

2276
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,560
This is not how shit works, man.

2277
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:47,520
I like the idea that he does call a FOIA a FOIA, which is fine, whatever, it's his accent.

2278
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,680
His lawyer's getting a FOIA.

2279
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:50,680
Whatever.

2280
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:56,760
So he understands that that's something that you might be able to do in this case, because

2281
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,920
the investigation has closed, and so there may not be a legitimate law enforcement reason

2282
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,800
to not release the name of the person, and you might be able to get that with a FOIA

2283
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:06,800
request.

2284
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,800
Possible.

2285
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,200
Now, if you do that, you could report the name.

2286
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,200
Exactly.

2287
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:19,160
You can't do this and then be like, hey, if he's not the person, he should tell us, meanwhile

2288
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:24,160
the damage has been done by me saying that it is the person, and also eventually we'll

2289
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:27,400
do a FOIA request that we're never going to do.

2290
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:35,000
We'll absolutely confirm this later on with a FOIA request, something that we do so often,

2291
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,040
I pronounce it correctly.

2292
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:41,800
So Alex, like I said, it's just too clear that his entire premise here is that he's

2293
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,600
just mad that the white cop's name got revealed.

2294
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:51,680
Again, they won't say his name, his reported name, but again, we do know Kim Potter's name,

2295
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,880
and she's had to evacuate her house and the police station's been burned down, but that's

2296
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,600
okay because she's a white devil and she deserves it.

2297
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,280
So there you go.

2298
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:06,240
I mean, it's just too obvious that what is animating this and what's motivating him to

2299
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,560
behave in the ways he is.

2300
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:14,080
Even without that motive, this behavior is unacceptable.

2301
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:22,220
But having this kind of a reckless, irresponsible behavior going on while it's being so obviously

2302
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:33,280
motivated by feelings of white identity, insecurity, and victimhood, it's just multiple layers

2303
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,280
of unacceptable.

2304
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,000
I can't believe he's this transparent.

2305
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,880
Yeah, I mean, but it is kind of a truth that if you cling to whiteness, eventually that's

2306
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,280
the only thing you're going to have left.

2307
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:50,520
Like clinging to the color of your skin as something important is going to push everybody

2308
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,640
out of your life eventually.

2309
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:56,880
Or it's only going to unite you with other people who are clinging to whiteness.

2310
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,160
And until you find a difference between you.

2311
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,160
Yeah, exactly.

2312
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,400
Until it's time to shut them out for not being white enough for...

2313
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,720
Right, wrong color hair, something.

2314
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,520
Wrong religion, whatever you want.

2315
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,520
Yeah.

2316
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,480
I mean, I think in many ways it comes down to just having a mentality that is so entirely

2317
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,860
based on exclusion is going to exclude.

2318
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:21,240
And it's going to just, it's going to go that way.

2319
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,240
That's how it works.

2320
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,240
Yeah.

2321
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:29,820
So now at this point, Alex goes to Owen Troyer, who's down by the border trying to get more

2322
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:32,800
footage of stopping smugglers, I guess.

2323
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,520
That's where I would want to be.

2324
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:40,360
I would want to be near the US Mexico border if I was Owen Troyer, just in case.

2325
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:46,040
Just like, oh, I'll take a little step over here and now I'm not in trouble, no border.

2326
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,040
Come and get me.

2327
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,040
Yeah.

2328
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,040
Come on.

2329
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,040
Suck it Biden.

2330
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,240
You want to get to extradite me for this?

2331
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,240
Come on.

2332
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:55,200
So yeah, I didn't care for any of that.

2333
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,280
I'm not going to play this dance.

2334
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,280
No.

2335
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,440
And I got really mad.

2336
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,320
I got really mad at Alex.

2337
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:07,480
One, because of how disgusting this display has been for most of this episode.

2338
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,480
Absolutely.

2339
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,760
But then second, because here's a clip from the first hour that I got really excited about

2340
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,320
and he just fucking teased me.

2341
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,080
And then separately, I'm mixing it into my stacks and I can't find it because I was about

2342
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,080
to hit it.

2343
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:25,280
Will you guys get me the new John Hopkins cyber collapse document that Jamie White wrote?

2344
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:31,200
I've got the document, but I can't find, always on the bottom I did find it.

2345
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:37,520
Cyber polygon 2021 globalist run simulation of coming cyber pandemic to prepare for economic

2346
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,520
reset.

2347
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,520
This is the blueprint.

2348
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,560
I'll tell you, John Hopkins is like the main horse in the fight now against this.

2349
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:46,320
All the globalists do their tests, their drills, they agree at committee what they're going

2350
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,320
to do.

2351
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,640
And it's given to these academics and business people and top scientists and in the top of

2352
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:55,160
their fields, academia, banking, computer science, weapons, psychology, psychology.

2353
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,960
Then they launched the attack.

2354
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,320
I'm going to be hitting that as well.

2355
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,440
I've got to hit that.

2356
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,680
You got to hit it.

2357
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,680
You have to hit that.

2358
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,680
You got to.

2359
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:04,920
You literally have to hit that.

2360
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,920
And then he didn't.

2361
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,480
That's the most important story I've ever heard.

2362
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,000
Cyber polygon 2021.

2363
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,480
Cyber polygon 2021.

2364
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,480
I got to know.

2365
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,480
It's so great.

2366
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:17,480
The great reset is happening and it's through the cyber polygon 2021.

2367
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,960
So I found the documents and everything, and then Alex never brought it up.

2368
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,320
So I don't get to talk about it.

2369
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,320
Damn it.

2370
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,320
Anyway.

2371
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,320
Look, someday soon.

2372
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,280
Look, it's yeah, we will talk about it once he talks about it.

2373
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,280
We'll get there.

2374
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,280
The thing that I struggled with is like, I got really excited.

2375
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,800
There's primary documents here.

2376
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,000
It is actually something that interesting maybe we could talk about, but I'm not going

2377
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,280
to debunk things Alex doesn't even get to.

2378
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,280
Yeah, that's not fair.

2379
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,280
No.

2380
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,280
That's not fair.

2381
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,280
You can't pre bunk things.

2382
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,160
I don't actually even know what his angle is outside of that vague nonsense.

2383
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,160
Exactly.

2384
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:50,480
Anyway, once he talks about cyber polygon, I'll be very excited.

2385
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:51,480
We'll get to it.

2386
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,480
We'll get to it.

2387
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,480
I have a lot to say about it.

2388
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,680
It's good that you've got it in the can though.

2389
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:59,780
You know, it's always good to be one step ahead of, uh, of the roadrunner.

2390
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:05,200
It's unsatisfying though, cause you know, I'm listening to this bullshit about Sam.

2391
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,200
Sure.

2392
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,200
Sure.

2393
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:11,860
And then Alex and Norm getting racist as hell and I'm like, at least I've got cyber polygon

2394
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:14,200
to look forward to and then it just doesn't happen.

2395
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,200
Oh man.

2396
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,200
Bullshit.

2397
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:22,120
I, I'm telling you, I think second string Sam should have been on the second string

2398
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,080
for this episode.

2399
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,560
Should have been cyber polygon 2021 all day.

2400
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:30,720
If I were Alex, I might've spent more time on that than trying to make Sam's arrest about

2401
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,720
himself.

2402
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,720
Yeah, that would be smart.

2403
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,200
But narcissists got to do what they got to do.

2404
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,400
It does seem like it.

2405
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,280
Um, so yeah, I think that, I think this is, um, you know, one of the first times that

2406
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:44,120
we've had an active Infowars employee get arrested and so that's kind of interesting

2407
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,120
and that was one of the reasons why I was like, we gotta, we gotta get into this.

2408
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:50,680
Well, Millie Weaver got arrested, but she was, I think that was unrelated.

2409
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,920
No, it was totally unrelated.

2410
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:58,160
And she was not, uh, she was an independent contractor, honestly, never met her before

2411
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,160
in my life.

2412
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,160
Yeah.

2413
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,160
And she, she was fired pretty quick.

2414
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,160
Yeah, very quick.

2415
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:05,200
Um, and then like Joe Biggs got arrested, but he's a former employee.

2416
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:06,200
Sure.

2417
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,200
That's true.

2418
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:10,640
Um, Roger Stone, but you know, he's, he's Roger Stone.

2419
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,640
He's Roger Stone.

2420
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,160
I guess a lot of them have been arrested.

2421
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,160
Wow.

2422
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,160
All right.

2423
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:22,080
I like how felons can't vote, but they can work at Infowars.

2424
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,080
Yep.

2425
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:28,000
So, uh, Jordan, we'll be back, uh, with another episode, hopefully covering Cyber Polygon.

2426
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,240
Yeah, no kidding.

2427
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,600
We got something to do.

2428
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,760
We got to do something with that.

2429
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,400
Yeah, that's going to be my big tease from now on eventually we'll get to Cyber Polygon.

2430
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,440
And we're going to hit Cyber Polygon 2021.

2431
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,320
Um, but until then we have a website, Jordan.

2432
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:40,320
We do have a website.

2433
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,320
It's knowledgefight.com.

2434
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,320
Yes.

2435
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,320
We're also on Twitter.

2436
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,320
We are on Twitter.

2437
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,320
It's at knowledgefight.com.

2438
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,320
Go to bed, Jordan.

2439
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,320
We're also on Facebook.

2440
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,320
We are on Facebook.

2441
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,800
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

2442
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,200
doing God's work right now.

2443
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:57,360
Uh, we'll be back, but until then I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

2444
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,960
Jordan, I place you under arrest for loud utterances.

2445
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:01,960
Andy in Kansas.

2446
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:02,960
You're on the air.

2447
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:03,960
Thanks for holding.

2448
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,360
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller.

2449
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,360
I'm a huge fan.

2450
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,360
I love your work.

2451
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:38,320
Thank you for being with us today, and we'll see you next time.
