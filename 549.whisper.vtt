00:00.000 --> 00:12.960
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.440
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.800
Probably but not in the right direction.

00:34.800 --> 00:47.080
I love your work, it's TimeToPray!

00:47.080 --> 00:49.380
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.880
Hello Alex, I'm a victim caller, I'm a huge fan.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
I love your work.

00:52.880 --> 00:53.880
Knowledge Fight.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.880
Nom nom nom nom nom nom.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.880
Knowledgefight.com.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.880
I love you.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.380
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.080
I'm Jordan.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.080
We're couple dudes, like to sit around, drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.080
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:08.080 --> 01:08.580
Jordan.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.080
Dan.

01:09.080 --> 01:09.580
Jordan.

01:09.580 --> 01:10.080
Quick question for you.

01:10.080 --> 01:10.580
What's up?

01:10.580 --> 01:11.580
What's your bright spot today?

01:11.580 --> 01:14.080
My bright spot today is a little slice of life moment.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.580
A little slice of life moment.

01:15.580 --> 01:19.580
Little moment, just laying in bed, hanging out.

01:19.580 --> 01:24.580
Celine, the cat, comes over, stares at me while I'm laying there.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.580
Just like, what are you doing?

01:26.580 --> 01:28.080
What are you doing, cat? You weirdo.

01:28.080 --> 01:28.580
Yeah.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.580
And then she just, she's just standing there.

01:30.580 --> 01:31.080
Uh huh.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.580
And then, just with no warning, plops over on her side.

01:34.580 --> 01:36.580
Just floomp.

01:36.580 --> 01:37.580
Just falls over.

01:37.580 --> 01:39.580
Like a horse that was tranquilized.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.080
Yes!

01:40.080 --> 01:40.580
Just goes...

01:40.580 --> 01:41.580
Ka thunk.

01:41.580 --> 01:42.580
Yeah, okay.

01:42.580 --> 01:45.080
Just immediately dead weight is the cutest thing.

01:45.080 --> 01:49.080
It happens from time to time, but I really enjoyed it last night.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
And then, uh...

01:50.080 --> 01:52.080
It is like how that battery goes out.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.580
Where it's not, it's like a sustained and then boom, it's just off.

01:55.580 --> 01:56.080
Yeah.

01:56.080 --> 01:56.580
Yeah.

01:56.580 --> 02:00.080
And then she'll lay there for like maybe five minutes and then get bored and go lay somewhere else.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.080
Sure, well, yes.

02:01.080 --> 02:01.580
I understand.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.080
That thunk moment is really nice.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.080
It's beautiful.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.080
I enjoy that.

02:05.080 --> 02:05.580
How about you?

02:05.580 --> 02:07.080
It's a lovely slice of life, Dan.

02:07.080 --> 02:07.580
Thank you.

02:07.580 --> 02:10.080
My bright spot is twofold.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.580
One, Brockhampton has a new album out.

02:12.580 --> 02:13.080
It's great.

02:13.080 --> 02:13.580
Great.

02:13.580 --> 02:23.580
And two, I just found out that there's this show that I've never heard of that ran for like six some odd seasons or something like that called Superstore.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.080
And it's actually really good.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.080
What about Walmart?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.080
It's kind of about Walmart.

02:27.080 --> 02:27.580
Yeah, yeah.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.580
It's like a...

02:28.580 --> 02:32.080
I was surprised to see how much labor issues were like...

02:32.080 --> 02:33.080
You'd never heard of that show?

02:33.080 --> 02:34.580
I'd never heard of that show before.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.080
I swear to you, I've never heard of it.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
It was all over the place.

02:37.080 --> 02:37.580
Really?

02:37.580 --> 02:38.080
Yep.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.080
Hahahaha!

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
Yeah, it was...

02:41.080 --> 02:42.080
Where?

02:42.080 --> 02:43.080
Where was it all over?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.080
It was probably on network TV, of course.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.080
The place that you would normally...

02:46.080 --> 02:47.580
The one place that I would never go, yes.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.580
Oh, that's all dumb.

02:49.580 --> 02:50.580
It's all dumb comedy.

02:50.580 --> 02:51.580
I just don't have cable.

02:51.580 --> 02:52.080
I don't have...

02:52.080 --> 02:53.580
I'm not gonna cut the cord.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.080
Sure.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.080
I cut it.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.080
Hahahaha!

02:56.080 --> 02:58.080
But even if someone had come up to you and been like,

02:58.080 --> 03:00.580
Hey, there's this show on basic cable that is so good.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.080
You gotta check it out.

03:02.080 --> 03:02.580
You'd have been like,

03:02.580 --> 03:03.080
Oh, fuck yourself.

03:03.080 --> 03:03.580
I'm gonna watch...

03:03.580 --> 03:04.080
What? No!

03:04.080 --> 03:05.580
Parks and Rec was on basic cable.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.080
I'm gonna watch artistic prestige television.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
No.

03:09.080 --> 03:12.080
The first run of Full House was on basic cable.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.080
These are shows that everyone enjoys.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.080
In 30 years, you have two examples.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.080
Yes, exactly.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.080
Congratulations.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.080
Yep, you got it.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.080
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying Superstore.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.080
It's great.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.080
Great.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.080
So, Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.080
We're in the present day because chaos is afoot.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.080
Yes, naturally.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.080
And we'll get into some of that chaos here in a moment.

03:30.080 --> 03:34.080
But before we do, let's take a little moment to christen some new wonks.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.080
Oh, that's great.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.080
So first, Dr. Destructodome.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.080
Thank you so much.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.080
You are now a policy wonk.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.080
I'm a policy wonk.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
Thank you, Dr. Destructodome.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.080
Thank you.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.080
Next, I'm moving to Canada and changing my name to Joe Kickass.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.080
Thank you so much.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.080
You are now a policy wonk.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
I'm a policy wonk.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.080
Thank you very much, future Joe Kickass.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.080
Thank you.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.080
Next, Gwendolyn.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.080
Thank you so much.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.080
You are now a policy wonk.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.080
I'm a policy wonk.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.080
Thanks, Gwendolyn.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
Thank you.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
Next, The Sheep Mafia.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.080
Thank you so much.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.080
You are now a policy wonk.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.080
I'm a policy wonk.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.080
Oh, thank you very much, Sheep Mafia.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.080
Thank you.

04:02.080 --> 04:06.080
And then I got a couple of technocrat shout-outs to give out today.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.080
First, WTF is an NFT.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.080
I'm also confused.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.080
That's totally right.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.080
You are now a technocrat.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.080
And Backyard Widow Farm.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.080
Thank you so much.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.080
You are also a technocrat.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.080
I'm a policy wonk.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.080
Crikey, mate.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.080
That's fantastic.

04:20.080 --> 04:21.080
Have yourself a brew.

04:21.080 --> 04:22.080
How's your 401k doing, bro?

04:22.080 --> 04:25.080
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
Let's just get down to business.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.080
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.080
Why are you pimps so good?

04:30.080 --> 04:32.080
My neck is freakishly large.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.080
I declare info war on you.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.080
Thank you so much.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.080
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

04:38.080 --> 04:42.080
Also, Jordan, I don't know if you know this, but there's two April birthdays.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.080
Just me and Dr. Gums.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
Yes, correct.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.080
And also who could forget about Kelly Clarkson, Cedric, you know, Taylor Swift.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.080
Well, no, of course, nobody could forget about those two, actually.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.080
Well, we have one more to add to the list.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.080
Okay.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.080
Actually, we missed this email.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.080
This was sent in and I missed it and I apologize.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
But Rex, happy birthday.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.080
Happy birthday, Rex.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.080
Welcome to the pantheon of April birthdays.

05:03.080 --> 05:08.080
Along with myself, Dr. Gums, Kelly Clarkson, Cedric the Entertainer, and Mandy Moore.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.080
And a couple others.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.080
I can't remember other celebrities.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.080
Oh, Tyson Ritter.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.080
Oh, sure.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.080
The lead singer of All American Rejects.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.080
Sure.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.080
Naturally.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
Everybody remembers his birthday.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
Move along.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.080
And commemorated by...

05:18.080 --> 05:19.080
I'm sorry.

05:19.080 --> 05:24.080
I've heard very little of what you said because I can't get past Backyard Widow Farm.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.080
That sounds like murder, right?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.080
I don't know.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.080
I think it's a farm.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.080
I like to believe it's a farm, maybe run by widows.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.080
That sounds nice.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
I don't know.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.080
That sounds nice.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.080
I don't know.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.080
You could put an ominous or benign spin on it.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
Sure, that's true.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
However you want to play it.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.080
I guess I have a bad temperament because I went ominous first.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.080
Yes.

05:43.080 --> 05:47.080
So Jordan, we return today to the present day of Alex Jones' content.

05:47.080 --> 05:52.080
He's deep in rambling about the border and about that Spars document from Johns Hopkins

05:52.080 --> 05:54.080
that apparently is a smoking gun.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.080
Which is nothing of the sort.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.080
I was really worried that we would get into today's content and we'd start looking at

06:01.080 --> 06:03.080
this stuff back in the present.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.080
It'll be so boring and repetitive.

06:05.080 --> 06:10.080
A lot of these issues are things that we've done at least three or four laps with Alex

06:10.080 --> 06:11.080
on before.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.080
Oh yeah.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.080
A lot of recycled narratives just about fairly present issues.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.080
The words ad nauseum come to mind.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.080
Yes.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.080
Or as Alex would say, at nauseum.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
Yes, at nauseum.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
But then, Jordan.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
Yes, sir.

06:24.080 --> 06:29.080
On Tuesday evening at the end of the War Room, Alex called into his own show from home.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.080
Oh no.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.080
I guess the War Room isn't his show, but whatever the case.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.080
He owns all shows.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.080
We've got big breaking news.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.080
Uh oh.

06:35.080 --> 06:39.080
All right, they're bringing us in with the classic-

06:39.080 --> 06:40.080
Song.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.080
Slimball intro music.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
Still great.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.080
Alex Jones here, ladies and gentlemen.

06:44.080 --> 06:50.080
On this 13th day, on this Tuesday transmission, we were going to have a special report shot

06:50.080 --> 06:52.080
by now, but I ended up going too long.

06:52.080 --> 06:57.080
I was going to shoot like a two minute quick video, but I ended up doing like 10 minutes.

06:57.080 --> 07:04.080
So that'll be up in about 45 minutes or so at infowars.com or newswars.com.

07:04.080 --> 07:09.080
So the breaking news is that Alex rambled too long in a special report that he shot

07:09.080 --> 07:12.080
about this breaking news, so the well-produced version of it isn't going to come out for

07:12.080 --> 07:16.080
like 45 minutes or so, and Alex is just going to have to come in and do it on the phone.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.080
All right.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
Breaking news.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.080
I'm struggling here, if I understand correctly.

07:21.080 --> 07:27.080
Alex is going to give us a thing that he already knew in the past.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.080
Yeah, but he talked about it.

07:29.080 --> 07:33.080
He meant to talk about it for two minutes so they could have a special report here on

07:33.080 --> 07:35.080
the show, but he talked too long.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
He rambled too long.

07:36.080 --> 07:41.080
So then an hour later, you're going to see a better version of what he's going to do

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
for you now.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.080
Exactly.

07:43.080 --> 07:47.080
And it's so important that you cannot possibly wait one more hour.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.080
No, we have to get into live programming.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.080
This has got to be done.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.080
We've got to break in.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.080
This is Infowars, God damn it.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.080
We can't wait another 45 minutes for this information.

07:58.080 --> 08:02.080
I feel like if it was as important as he thinks, he could have kept it tight.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.080
He could have.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.080
So he can get this special report together.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.080
Or he could have just spent two minutes on it in the middle of his rambles.

08:07.080 --> 08:12.080
Also great that Rush has been dead for two months and Alex is already stealing his aesthetics.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.080
I think it's a good idea.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.080
Stealing his intro music.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
Steal it up.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
Steal it up.

08:16.080 --> 08:20.080
I do like that that clearly wasn't Alex's choice, though, because he calls it out.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.080
That's true.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.080
He's like, oh, coming in with some Rush Limbaugh music.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.080
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.080
Someone else did that and he kind of ruined the illusion that they weren't stealing.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.080
There is a secret hero on the staff, I swear.

08:30.080 --> 08:35.080
The more music we hear at the right time, the more I'm like, somebody is watching us.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.080
So, you know, he rambled too long in that special report that he tried to shoot, but

08:39.080 --> 08:41.080
we don't really know what this news is that's so important.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.080
Sure.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.080
So let's see if he gets to it.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.080
What's we got?

08:44.080 --> 08:47.580
A lot of this we knew was coming.

08:47.580 --> 08:52.080
But now here it is, Sam Montoya for us, about three years.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.080
He's a he's a great.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.080
My daughter just came in here.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.080
Hello, honey.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.080
I love you.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.080
He just he just came in breaking news.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.080
My daughter just came running in here.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.080
We can't wait an hour.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.080
I have that.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.080
Let me just go outside.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.080
I thought she was gonna be in the other room.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.080
This has to happen right now.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.080
I just got home.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
Sorry.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.080
Long story short, we were going to air in this segment.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
This report, but it's not ready yet.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
It'll be a band on video.

09:16.080 --> 09:21.080
InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com here in 30 minutes, 45 minutes or so.

09:21.080 --> 09:27.080
OK, so I guess the news so far is that Sam Montoya is a really good guy.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.080
He's a great guy.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.080
And that Alex, he's trying to innovate in ways he can make his show impressively unprofessional.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.080
It's kind of incredible.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.080
It really is.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
It really is.

09:35.080 --> 09:39.080
So far, we have spent far more time talking about his daughters than we have the breaking

09:39.080 --> 09:40.080
news that he had to call in.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.080
Yeah, breaking news.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.080
I talked too long about it in the special report in order to fit it into here.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.080
Sure.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.080
So I'm going to talk about it now.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.080
Wow.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.080
Yeah.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.080
Yep.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.080
Yep.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.080
This is good.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.080
This is good stuff.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.080
Oh, man.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.080
Almost a parody.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.080
So, you know, there is a story here.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.080
Sure.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.080
So let's see if we can get to it.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.080
What do we got?

09:59.080 --> 10:03.080
Well, we knew this was coming and I've talked to a lot of smart folks and they concur with

10:03.080 --> 10:04.080
my analysis.

10:04.080 --> 10:10.920
Sam Montoya, he is a great guy and he went to the Capitol that day.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.080
He was separate from our main crew because he ended up we didn't take him on a trip with

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
us.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
Go ahead.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
Go on his own.

10:17.080 --> 10:21.400
So he went up there to the January 6 event and then he ended up going to the Capitol

10:21.400 --> 10:22.400
once it was open.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.080
And once I guess the police wave, you'd be as we told me, and he got the tragic footage

10:26.080 --> 10:30.580
of and was the first person put it out of actually Babbitt being executed, by the way,

10:30.580 --> 10:35.600
we don't know the name of the police officer still had executed her.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.920
But we do know the name of the police officer that just shot this guy at a traffic stop

10:39.920 --> 10:41.240
in Minnesota during all the riots.

10:41.240 --> 10:47.120
So just an example of how the feds and the media are all going along with this to demonize

10:47.120 --> 10:52.440
local police for domestic takeovers is a very, very systematic criminal operation.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.440
So here's the deal.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.960
The story that Alex is trying not to cover is that Sam, his cameraman, got arrested and

10:57.960 --> 11:00.720
charged for his actions on January 6th at the Capitol.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
Sure.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.720
Alex doesn't want to just say that.

11:02.720 --> 11:07.480
So instead here he is just reiterating that Sam's a good guy and he's trying to come up

11:07.480 --> 11:12.520
with every possible Dodge he can think of in order to not deal with the reality here.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.120
That clip was less than a minute and here are a list of the qualifiers that Alex is

11:16.120 --> 11:19.920
trying to bake into this story before even telling the audience what has happened.

11:19.920 --> 11:20.920
Give me a list.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.120
One, Sam is a good guy.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.120
He's a good guy.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.760
Two, Sam was separate from Alex's main crew.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
Never heard of that guy.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.040
Three, Sam went into the Capitol on his own.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.920
I swear to you, this man, I've never seen him before in my life.

11:32.920 --> 11:37.360
Four, Sam only went to the Capitol after police waved him in according to what Alex claims

11:37.360 --> 11:38.640
Sam told him.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.600
Frankly, I'm pretty sure he's a ghost.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.160
Five, Sam was the first to get the footage of Ashley Babbitt being shot.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.160
Incidentally, I don't think this is true.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.760
And if you watch Sam's live stream from that day, you'll see him trying to negotiate with

11:49.760 --> 11:53.720
John Sullivan, AKA Jaden X, who had captured footage of the shooting.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.360
He was trying to get the footage from him.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.360
Let me get the footage.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.360
Yeah.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.920
Six, for some reason it's nefarious that we don't know the name of the officer who shot

12:01.920 --> 12:06.400
Babbitt, but we do know the name of the officer who shot Daunte Wright in Minnesota.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.240
I have no idea what that has to do with anything.

12:08.240 --> 12:12.120
No, it has nothing to do with anything, but it's always a good idea to jangle the keys

12:12.120 --> 12:16.780
of racism away from the very real problems that you are dealing with.

12:16.780 --> 12:20.400
You can see pretty clearly how Alex's primary motivation in telling this story is to make

12:20.400 --> 12:22.520
sure the audience knows that Sam's a good guy.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.520
Sam's a good guy.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.880
Even if he went into the Capitol, he wasn't wrong to do it.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.600
And if people say he was wrong to do it, then he did it without Alex even knowing or telling

12:29.600 --> 12:30.600
him to do it.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.360
Fairly certain I've never heard of this guy.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.880
Alex hasn't even told the audience that Sam got arrested yet, and we already have multiple

12:35.880 --> 12:38.120
claims that Alex had nothing to do with this shit.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.480
This whole thing is a simulation.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.240
I put the world on trial.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.400
This is fucking Shadowgate.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
This is bad.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.400
This is Shadowgate.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.400
Listen, he's a great guy.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.400
Never heard of him.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.400
Didn't tell him to do anything.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.880
No idea what he's talking about.

12:49.880 --> 12:50.880
Good guy!

12:50.880 --> 12:55.920
Speaking of Shadowgate, I've realized that the Matt Gaetz thing could be the Gate of

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
Gates.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.360
It does seem like the Gate of Gates.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.360
It sure does.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.360
I don't like that.

13:00.360 --> 13:05.680
I think we're in a situation similar to that where I imagine it took Joel Greenberg exactly

13:05.680 --> 13:08.200
five seconds to give up Matt Gaetz.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.640
I think it might have been even less than that.

13:10.640 --> 13:14.080
The FBI went to his door and he was like, y'all want Matt Gaetz?

13:14.080 --> 13:15.080
Sure!

13:15.080 --> 13:16.080
I'll give him to you.

13:16.080 --> 13:20.640
Sam Portnoy is not protecting Alex in this circumstance.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.880
Me and a friend had this joke that we would always tell each other, like we would smoke

13:24.880 --> 13:25.880
together.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.120
We'd have blunts and we'd be sitting around passing back and forth and having fun listening

13:30.120 --> 13:31.120
to music.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
Sure.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
Doing the good stuff.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.040
And one of the things we would always do is tell each other about how we were going to

13:35.040 --> 13:37.040
rat each other out.

13:37.040 --> 13:42.600
We'd always just joke about how if we were in public, we'd be like, officer, he got weed!

13:42.600 --> 13:43.600
Yes.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
Yes.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.600
That's how I imagine it.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.000
That is how it's going.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yes.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Absolutely.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.960
We all have our way to fuck over each other.

13:51.960 --> 13:52.960
That's how I feel like Matt Gaetz and his buddies.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.840
I can tell you shit about Matt Gaetz that you ain't never even, you didn't even want

13:56.840 --> 13:57.840
to know this stuff.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.360
He got weed!

13:59.360 --> 14:04.640
So now we finally get to the part here of this episode, or this special breaking news

14:04.640 --> 14:06.760
where we find out that he got arrested.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
Yeah.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.760
That Sam is arrested.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.760
Breaking news.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.760
Long story short, I was sitting there this morning at about nine o'clock trying to get

14:12.760 --> 14:18.440
into shape with some weights and got a call that the FBI with 30 people had raided his

14:18.440 --> 14:22.440
little apartment here in Austin, Texas.

14:22.440 --> 14:27.280
And that was crazy because we knew they'd already been harassing one of our other employees

14:27.280 --> 14:34.660
named Rob, not Rob Dewey, the other Rob, who didn't even go to DC on the 6th.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.640
And so we were just like, this is a crazy dragnet.

14:36.640 --> 14:42.720
But Sam had gone in and the journalists, you know, there was other journalists in there

14:42.720 --> 14:43.720
as well.

14:43.720 --> 14:48.680
Jaden X had got $70,000 from CNN and others saying, burn down the Capitol.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
But he's okay.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.680
He's been released.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.680
So that's, that's fine.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.720
He, he tell, you know, lead the attack, the evidence I think is pretty overwhelming in

14:54.720 --> 14:55.720
my opinion.

14:55.720 --> 15:00.960
Not only was Sam arrested, but 30 FBI agents came to get him and other reinforced staff

15:00.960 --> 15:03.480
have been harassed and Jaden X is totally free.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.640
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.040
I've been trying, but I can't find any proof that the arrest went down the way that Alex

15:08.040 --> 15:09.200
has claimed.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.360
He's shown a picture of a door that has a hole punched in it, but I don't know if that

15:12.360 --> 15:15.120
was from police ramming it or a random person kicking it.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.120
I have no idea.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.120
Sure, sure.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.760
As for Jaden X or John Sullivan, that's what's going to be Alex's main defense and the longer

15:21.760 --> 15:24.640
special report that he rambled too long during.

15:24.640 --> 15:28.240
Alex has decided that John Sullivan led the attack on the Capitol, which is absolutely

15:28.240 --> 15:29.240
not true.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.240
Sounds true.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.360
And then he was paid by CNN to be there and he got off scot free.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.360
That's definitely true.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.360
All of that is bullshit.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.360
Oh.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.240
Sullivan has been released with conditions, but he's definitely still facing some very

15:38.240 --> 15:41.580
serious charges and they have not been dropped.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.320
He's, I mean, he's just out.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.120
Yeah, no, that's, it's, yeah.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.120
He's still in trouble.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.120
That's part of the legal system.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.840
You can, you can get out while awaiting trial.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.180
CNN did not pay Sullivan to be at the Capitol.

15:53.180 --> 15:56.960
Alex goes on to repeat the figure $70,000 as the amount that Sullivan was paid, but

15:56.960 --> 16:02.240
this is just a misrepresentation of the fact that CNN and NBC both bought his footage from

16:02.240 --> 16:04.480
inside the Capitol, each for $35,000.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.480
Right, right, right.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.400
There wasn't a preexisting contract or agreement.

16:07.400 --> 16:13.440
It was just CNN and NBC acting exactly the way that Alex's cameraman, Sam, did when he

16:13.440 --> 16:16.680
tried to get the footage from Sullivan inside the Capitol.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.680
Yes, correct.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.400
Uh, so yeah, I don't, I don't know.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.920
According to a CNN spokesperson, quote, on January 6th, CNN was contacted by a reputable

16:23.920 --> 16:27.420
agent regarding an eyewitness video from the Capitol Hill riots.

16:27.420 --> 16:32.000
The company entered into a one week agreement for use of 44 seconds of key content, which

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
was attributed to the witness on air.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.440
When his role in the event was later called into question, the company informed staff

16:37.440 --> 16:39.160
to cease all use of the video.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.160
Oh, that makes sense.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.160
Yeah, totally.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.160
Yeah.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.980
So Alex's main strategy is going to be to point at John Sullivan and pretend that Sullivan

16:44.980 --> 16:49.360
instigated the riots, that he was paid by CNN to do so, and that he isn't facing any

16:49.360 --> 16:50.360
consequences.

16:50.360 --> 16:55.000
And yet here poor Sam the cameraman is getting arrested just for being a good reporter.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.260
It's all nonsense, but it's about the only angle you can take here that heightens the

16:58.260 --> 17:02.240
feelings of agreement correctly and you can profit off of.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.400
Yeah, yeah.

17:04.400 --> 17:09.360
I mean, I can't even really think of it because you don't want to turn Sam into a persecution

17:09.360 --> 17:10.360
too much.

17:10.360 --> 17:13.160
You know, you don't want to turn him into too much of a hero as long as then people

17:13.160 --> 17:14.160
will give him money.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.160
Well, we'll see.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.160
Hold on.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.160
So you don't want to give Sam defense funding.

17:17.160 --> 17:21.720
Well, I mean like you do want to make him a victim if you can make it really all about

17:21.720 --> 17:22.720
yourself.

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
Exactly.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.720
If you can manage to do that.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.720
Yes.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.400
And we are dealing with a world class make it about himself-er.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.480
I wonder if that's what the whole next episode is going to be about.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.480
It could be.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.480
It could be.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.480
It could be.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
It could be.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
It could be.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.480
It could be.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.480
It could be.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.480
Anyway, here's the last clip from Alex's breaking into the war room.

17:39.480 --> 17:44.240
So we're going to have a detailed report on that coming up soon again at man.videoinfowars.com.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.640
But this just shows you where the country is and what's going on and what's unfolding

17:47.640 --> 17:49.200
in the persecution press.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.120
It's not a detailed report and we're not going to listen to it because it's just longer but

17:53.120 --> 17:57.960
about the same stuff and just kind of yelling about John Sullivan over and over again.

17:57.960 --> 18:02.760
So now let us jump to April 14th because I wanted to see how Alex is coping with this

18:02.760 --> 18:03.760
situation.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.760
Sure.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.200
One of his employees just got arrested and charged with a riot.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.440
What's the new story he's going to tell about it?

18:08.440 --> 18:13.720
Now one of the things that I think is really interesting is that we've been aware that

18:13.720 --> 18:17.960
Alex had that cameraman who was inside, like we knew on the 6th.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.960
Yeah.

18:18.960 --> 18:19.960
We knew the whole time.

18:19.960 --> 18:24.440
There wasn't really much of a secret around it and they released the footage of him yelling

18:24.440 --> 18:27.040
infowars.com while he went in the Capitol.

18:27.040 --> 18:31.160
Well that's because the FBI is just full of great investigators.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.880
Well I actually kind of figured they probably were aware of this and it just didn't rise

18:34.880 --> 18:36.800
to the level of someone they would want to charge.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.240
Yeah it does seem like that.

18:38.240 --> 18:42.080
And to me it's actually kind of surprising that there was a charge.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.720
I don't think he's going to get in any trouble.

18:43.720 --> 18:48.240
I think he'll be probably released maybe a slap on the wrist, who knows.

18:48.240 --> 18:53.760
So it is kind of surprising to me that they did end up charging him but I'm not surprised

18:53.760 --> 18:56.960
to hear that there could be a charge.

18:56.960 --> 18:57.960
Oh totally.

18:57.960 --> 18:58.960
Yeah yeah yeah.

18:58.960 --> 19:03.980
So anyway Alex, I just don't, I didn't know how it was going to land.

19:03.980 --> 19:06.080
Outside of I was pretty sure he was going to make it about himself.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.080
Yeah totally.

19:07.080 --> 19:12.040
And we'll get to that but before we do, you know John Bowne has been a long time boring

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
voice man.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.040
Indeed.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.040
For Alex.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.040
He's got special reports.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.040
Yes he does.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.240
And Alex will play those special reports generally in the first six minutes of the show.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.240
Right.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.240
Get him out of the way.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.440
Those often don't go out on the radio.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.160
Get your vegetables out of the way.

19:24.160 --> 19:29.800
A lot of stations air their own sort of station identification and news stuff at the top of

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
the hour.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.360
So Alex has this first segment that just is kind of no man's land.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.540
And he'll usually play some John Bowne reports there with his dumb boring voice.

19:37.540 --> 19:41.120
But there's a guy who's been really making waves.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
Guy named Greg Reese.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.920
He's never heard of him.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.000
He's another guy who's got these special reports that he does.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.440
He's another little video maker down in Austin at the Infowars.

19:51.440 --> 19:57.080
And I think he's making a run at the crown of the weird voice special report guy.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.080
All right.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.080
Here we go.

19:59.080 --> 20:04.660
Immediately following the death of Nikola Tesla, Dr. John Trump, an electrical engineer

20:04.660 --> 20:10.020
with the National Defense Research Committee of the Office of Scientific Research and Development.

20:10.020 --> 20:16.160
And interestingly, President Donald Trump's uncle was called in to analyze the Tesla papers.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.160
Is that interesting?

20:17.160 --> 20:18.160
Or boring?

20:18.160 --> 20:24.680
In a few days, John Trump officially concluded that Tesla's work was primarily speculative

20:24.680 --> 20:28.240
and did not include workable methods.

20:28.240 --> 20:34.040
We are then told that most of Tesla's papers disappeared, but his work most definitely

20:34.040 --> 20:35.320
quietly continued.

20:35.320 --> 20:36.680
All right, man.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.360
I hear that driving music behind you.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.220
What is this special report about?

20:40.220 --> 20:41.220
This is about Tesla, man.

20:41.220 --> 20:47.180
This is about how Tesla's work is the underpinning for all of our futuristic technology that

20:47.180 --> 20:49.680
was stolen from him and hidden from the public.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.440
Yeah, I didn't know what was going on, but I was excited.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.440
Yeah.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.320
I was like, this is how the show is starting?

20:55.320 --> 20:56.320
Yeah.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.320
With this special report?

20:57.320 --> 20:58.320
This is weird.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.840
I'm really more interested in Tesla than I am in whatever other bullshit they're going

21:01.840 --> 21:02.840
to spout.

21:02.840 --> 21:03.840
Sure.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
So let's hear this Tesla shit.

21:04.840 --> 21:10.840
So Greg Reese, he wants to blow some minds talking about some of this physics stuff and

21:10.840 --> 21:14.560
wireless energy, mysterious stuff that Tesla has figured out.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
The whole thing.

21:15.560 --> 21:16.560
Teleportation.

21:16.560 --> 21:23.600
The Palmas spinning ball experiment from 1977 is simple enough for anyone to repeat.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.820
Two steel balls are repeatedly launched with equal force.

21:27.820 --> 21:28.960
One is spinning.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.580
The other is not.

21:30.580 --> 21:36.260
The spinning ball consistently flies higher and falls faster than the other.

21:36.260 --> 21:42.160
This is in direct violation of both Newton's laws and Einstein's relativity.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.160
Really modern science.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.480
You ever see a curve ball for this energy?

21:45.480 --> 21:46.480
Yeah.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.960
You ever see a curve ball?

21:47.960 --> 21:51.600
You ever see a major league baseball pitcher throw a curve ball?

21:51.600 --> 21:56.720
You know, one of those things that's on TV during the summer 162 times.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.720
This is amazing.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
Yeah.

21:58.720 --> 22:03.520
Modern science has plenty of explanations for why this phenomenon could be seen in different

22:03.520 --> 22:06.880
rates of speed between spinning and non-spinning objects.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.440
The issue is that there's no difference for these objects when you try to conduct the

22:10.440 --> 22:12.440
experiment in a vacuum.

22:12.440 --> 22:16.440
You know, like if you didn't have other forces at play, then they would travel at the same

22:16.440 --> 22:21.520
speed whether they were spinning or not, but because in nature, in the world, there's other

22:21.520 --> 22:26.960
forces that come to bear on the object, and they understand that.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.960
Yes.

22:27.960 --> 22:28.960
Scientists are not stupid.

22:28.960 --> 22:29.960
No.

22:29.960 --> 22:33.160
The force that Greg Rees is ignoring here is called the Magnus effect, and it's basically

22:33.160 --> 22:37.600
the reason why pitchers can throw bending pitches or why tennis players add spin.

22:37.600 --> 22:41.080
The spinning object in the air exerts a force on the air that it's traveling through, and

22:41.080 --> 22:44.200
in the process, its path of motion is affected.

22:44.200 --> 22:48.240
This is a well-understood phenomenon, and it's completely compatible with Newtonian

22:48.240 --> 22:49.240
physics.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.240
Yeah.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.400
I guess Greg Rees didn't really look into this before deciding that spinning balls are

22:52.400 --> 22:55.320
somehow proof that physics is a lie.

22:55.320 --> 23:01.080
It would be very hard to research the American baseball pastime.

23:01.080 --> 23:06.280
Yeah, or you can find countless videos of people doing this, like dropping things from

23:06.280 --> 23:08.560
really high heights, because it is really cool.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
Yeah, it's cool.

23:09.560 --> 23:10.560
It's really cool to look at.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.560
It's cool.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.560
Yeah.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.560
Yes.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.480
Is there any spinning force stuff that no one can explain?

23:16.480 --> 23:17.480
No one.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
No one can explain.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.480
Only Tesla.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.480
Maybe.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.480
Oh.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.480
But we don't know.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.480
John Trump didn't look at those papers.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.480
That's true.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.480
That's true.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.480
So, John Trump's uncle is involved in a cover-up.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.880
Did you know that Bruce De Palma is Brian De Palma's uncle?

23:28.880 --> 23:29.880
What?

23:29.880 --> 23:30.880
Isn't that interesting?

23:30.880 --> 23:31.880
No.

23:31.880 --> 23:32.880
Nope.

23:32.880 --> 23:33.880
I also don't think that's true.

23:33.880 --> 23:39.760
So, apparently, the spin creates this magical force.

23:39.760 --> 23:40.760
Magic.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.760
Or whatever.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.760
Yeah.

23:42.760 --> 23:47.520
This magical force somehow to create UFOs.

23:47.520 --> 23:53.040
These patents look very similar to what whistleblowers claim have been in production for years by

23:53.040 --> 23:57.520
weapons manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin Skunk Works.

23:57.520 --> 24:03.480
The same UFO-like craft that whistleblowers claim are being prepared to stage a fake alien

24:03.480 --> 24:04.480
invasion.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.320
So, we've got a fake alien invasion coming.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.320
Yeah.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.320
Yeah.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.160
And these spinning things.

24:13.160 --> 24:17.920
You ever see a knuckleball, Dan?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.680
It was an interesting special report.

24:19.680 --> 24:20.680
Yeah.

24:20.680 --> 24:21.680
Yeah, yeah.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.640
I think that the music really does a lot of work.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.680
I think the music does more work than Greg.

24:27.680 --> 24:32.760
I think our greatest scientists are going to use a split-finger fastball to develop

24:32.760 --> 24:33.760
UFOs.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.760
Yeah.

24:34.760 --> 24:35.760
That's pretty fun.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.680
Also, I would question what this has to do with the globalist's plans.

24:39.680 --> 24:46.600
I don't know how a false flag alien invasion fits in with the larger schemes that we're

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
supposed to be afraid of.

24:47.600 --> 24:53.520
It does seem like the plan B being kill all of the people would kind of negate the need

24:53.520 --> 24:55.000
for the UFO part.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Yep.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.120
That would just be like, hey, look, we're going to do the super bioweapon thing, but

25:00.120 --> 25:01.360
let's have a little fun.

25:01.360 --> 25:05.320
I mean, you know what, I will give it up to the devil in this sense.

25:05.320 --> 25:09.360
It does seem like he's got a lot of plans up in the air at the same time, and if he's

25:09.360 --> 25:12.680
juggling that many plans, that's a talent in and of itself.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.880
That's a management issue, and he's killing it.

25:14.880 --> 25:19.040
But you know, I think back when we did stand up, sometimes you'd have somebody who's like,

25:19.040 --> 25:24.920
I'm going to start my own show, animate a clothing line going, and then start a video

25:24.920 --> 25:25.920
blog.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.920
Right.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.920
Well, you've got to brand yourself.

25:27.920 --> 25:28.920
Well, there's a lot of plans.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
There are a lot of plans.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.740
Sometimes if you have too many plans, you're not going to do any of those things, and maybe

25:33.740 --> 25:35.760
that's the issue that the devil's running into.

25:35.760 --> 25:36.760
That's the ultimate weakness of the devil.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.760
He's got the false flag aliens.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.320
He's got the super bioweapons.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.640
He doesn't follow through on anything.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.040
He didn't even kill Eve, you know?

25:43.040 --> 25:44.040
What was the point?

25:44.040 --> 25:45.040
No.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.040
Stupid.

25:46.040 --> 25:51.920
Also, what do you think you should be more afraid of?

25:51.920 --> 25:53.440
Extermination or world government?

25:53.440 --> 25:56.260
Ooh, depends.

25:56.260 --> 25:57.260
What kind of extermination?

25:57.260 --> 26:02.140
Well, because I feel like in Alex's scheme now with the devil's plan, world government

26:02.140 --> 26:05.220
is not a necessary step towards extermination.

26:05.220 --> 26:06.780
That's true.

26:06.780 --> 26:07.780
That is true.

26:07.780 --> 26:11.240
So I don't know why the devil would need to push for that anymore.

26:11.240 --> 26:16.920
Well, if you had... Okay, so if the devil obtains world government, he's gotten through

26:16.920 --> 26:24.080
the loophole that God set that keeps him from limiting human free will, maybe?

26:24.080 --> 26:25.080
I don't know.

26:25.080 --> 26:29.960
Because the government can do the free will limiting, and he just gets to exterminate

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
people?

26:30.960 --> 26:32.440
I don't know, man.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.040
Yeah, this is what happens when Greg Reese starts the show.

26:35.040 --> 26:40.400
This is a problem with both, I guess, UFOs and the Bible.

26:40.400 --> 26:47.040
So Alex comes in, and he breaks things off with some real serious headlines.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.040
Sure.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.820
Let me tell you what we got for you.

26:51.820 --> 26:57.560
Everyone is starting to call out Fauci as a fraud, and mainstream news is now reporting

26:57.560 --> 27:05.360
that he ran the Wuhan lab, which they're now confirming is where COVID-19 came from.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.880
Absolutely huge.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.800
And then people say, well, I thought you said COVID's not that deadly, but they want to

27:10.800 --> 27:14.640
own it, and they want to have version one, and version two, and version three.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.560
They've got super deadly versions.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.920
This was just the drill.

27:17.920 --> 27:22.560
So Alex is just talking about a Washington Times headline that doesn't prove the claims

27:22.560 --> 27:26.240
that are in the headline, or are speculated about in the headline.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.240
Yeah.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.240
I don't know who that is.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.240
I was pretty disappointed.

27:29.240 --> 27:32.200
He doesn't talk about it until fairly a ways later.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
Right.

27:33.200 --> 27:39.760
Well, I did see that the CIA would refuse to confirm that it wasn't created in a lab,

27:39.760 --> 27:47.280
so people have taken that as speculation that they're probably looking into it, I guess.

27:47.280 --> 27:53.400
But I think that all along, it's not been excluded as a possibility, but it's not the

27:53.400 --> 27:58.200
most likely possibility, and there is not evidence that it was.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.200
Right.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.200
That's the issue.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.200
There are a lot of issues, yeah.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.200
Yeah.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.200
Yeah.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.200
Anyway, Alex-

28:04.200 --> 28:05.200
And I don't trust the CIA.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.200
Fine.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.200
Yeah.

28:07.200 --> 28:11.960
I didn't know whether or not we were going to get into the Sam issue early or late.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
I didn't know.

28:12.960 --> 28:16.640
It turns out that Alex dives right in.

28:16.640 --> 28:21.400
The FBI yesterday morning raided one of our crew members, I'll tell you about that coming

28:21.400 --> 28:29.560
up next segment, and the media is just in ecstasy, oh my God, we're so close to arresting

28:29.560 --> 28:30.560
Jones.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.560
We want to shut down Infowars.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.560
Think about that.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.720
It's not just take us off the internet, not try to block our bank accounts.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.120
Now it's, we want Jones in jail.

28:38.120 --> 28:42.140
He masterminded the capital attacks, you've been hearing that since it happened a few

28:42.140 --> 28:50.840
months ago, three months ago, and now they're just fixing the intelligence to go in line

28:50.840 --> 28:51.840
with all of that.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.880
So I guess this is the first instance of him making it all about himself.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.880
Yep.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.880
Yep.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.880
And it happens immediately.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.880
Yep.

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
Yep.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.000
They got Sam, which is actually about me as always.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.880
I wouldn't be happy about this if I were Sam.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.880
No, no, no, no.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.880
I would flip on him.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.400
I would take this as an insult.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.400
Yep.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
Yep.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.640
So Alex gets to talking about his charges, what Sam's been charged with, and he might

29:15.640 --> 29:17.360
be a little bit off.

29:17.360 --> 29:23.760
As far as reporters, Sam arrested for covering January 6th Capitol riot Montoya.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.600
So I talked to Sam's dad yesterday.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
He was here.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.200
Guess what he's charged with?

29:29.200 --> 29:31.760
They said making loud utterances.

29:31.760 --> 29:35.040
So Sam wasn't charged with making loud utterances.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.240
The charging documents are public and he's facing five charges.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.400
One, entering and remaining in a restricted building.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.400
Sounds like he did that.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.480
Two, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
Almost certainly.

29:46.480 --> 29:49.360
Three, violent entry and disorderly conduct in a Capitol building.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
Yeah, that's true.

29:50.360 --> 29:53.460
Four, impeding passage through the Capitol grounds or Capitol buildings.

29:53.460 --> 29:56.680
No other way to be a mob in front of the door.

29:56.680 --> 30:00.280
And five, parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.

30:00.280 --> 30:04.080
I could be wrong, but I don't think that Sam's going to get in any real trouble about this,

30:04.080 --> 30:07.840
unless there's some kind of information that the state has that I'm not privy to, like

30:07.840 --> 30:11.440
where he was in greater coordination with people than we know.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.700
I don't know.

30:12.700 --> 30:15.320
Unless that's the case, I would guess he's going to get a slap on the wrist and maybe

30:15.320 --> 30:17.280
not even that.

30:17.280 --> 30:21.160
One of the charges about disorderly conduct and violent entry is described like this in

30:21.160 --> 30:22.160
the filing.

30:22.160 --> 30:26.600
Quote, to willfully and knowingly utter loud threatening and abusive language or engage

30:26.600 --> 30:31.020
in disorderly or disruptive conduct at any place on the grounds or in the Capitol buildings

30:31.020 --> 30:35.040
with the intent to impede, disrupt, or disturb the orderly conduct of a session of Congress

30:35.040 --> 30:40.440
or either House of Congress or the orderly conduct in that building of a hearing before

30:40.440 --> 30:45.240
or any deliberations of a committee of Congress or either House of Congress.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.240
Right.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.840
You can't go in there and scream, go fuck yourself.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.840
Yeah.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.320
But framing that as him getting charged for loud utterances is fun because it makes it

30:52.320 --> 30:55.360
seem like the government's trying to punish Sam for yelling, but that's not what happened.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.700
Yeah, it makes it seem like the government's trying to punish him for yelling, go fuck

30:57.700 --> 30:59.080
yourself to Nancy Pelosi.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.080
Right.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.080
Yeah.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.080
That's not quite the same thing.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.080
You kind of lose the context of it.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.080
A little bit.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.880
And, you know, Alex is just saying that he's getting charged with making loud utterances.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.240
It's like, there's five charges.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.840
The documents are right there.

31:10.840 --> 31:11.840
Yeah.

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
Stop playing games.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
They're public too.

31:13.840 --> 31:17.640
Man, everybody's trying to jam Alex up and this is just a part of it.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.640
Sure.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.640
They've had all the major mainstream media, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all of

31:21.640 --> 31:27.080
them, uh, approach people and offer them money to lie about us.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.660
They've had the big tabloids do it.

31:28.660 --> 31:34.960
They have done Facebook scan searches on any body that even ever took a photo with me and

31:34.960 --> 31:36.040
people that take selfies.

31:36.040 --> 31:41.480
Uh, if I'm randomly at a restaurant, uh, these women will get a call from the Wall Street

31:41.480 --> 31:44.080
Journal, the New York Times saying you have a relationship with Alex Jones.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.600
They go, no, I don't know Alex Jones.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.360
I mean, I met him once took a photo with him, with my husband that go, okay, well we heard

31:49.360 --> 31:50.360
he raped you.

31:50.360 --> 31:51.360
What?

31:51.360 --> 31:55.040
No, this is a preposterous and we then get calls from these people and have confirmed

31:55.040 --> 31:56.040
it.

31:56.040 --> 32:03.040
So thousands of people are called by the Savage criminal operators of just the actual leftist

32:03.040 --> 32:06.240
intelligence agency crime Lords.

32:06.240 --> 32:11.640
And then they control the FBI and order the FBI to then go and reverse engineer it.

32:11.640 --> 32:17.160
So these media entities, the mainstream media are essentially leftist crime Lords and they

32:17.160 --> 32:19.840
run the FBI.

32:19.840 --> 32:24.340
And so the media comes up with this stuff and then they reverse engineer an investigation

32:24.340 --> 32:27.240
through the FBI to jam someone up.

32:27.240 --> 32:35.320
I think, I think that Alex is used to people he knows like Jacob Wall and James O'Keefe

32:35.320 --> 32:39.720
operating like this where they're trying to set traps and that's the news that they're

32:39.720 --> 32:43.640
doing what we're doing, even though we're the ones doing it and they aren't.

32:43.640 --> 32:49.200
I think that because those people that are in his sphere do this stuff that he thinks

32:49.200 --> 32:51.080
that everybody does.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.080
Yeah.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.600
And I think that he thinks that's how media and news operate and that's scary.

32:56.600 --> 33:02.940
Which is one of the big things that we can see as a problem with Jacob Wall and the ilk

33:02.940 --> 33:10.440
there because that undermines confidence in any and all media outlets if you are so brazenly

33:10.440 --> 33:11.920
corrupt about it.

33:11.920 --> 33:12.920
Yeah.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.200
And if people have it in their mind to equate the two.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.200
Yeah, of course.

33:16.200 --> 33:23.280
As if the people of that ilk are in any way analogous to the media.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.280
Yeah, no.

33:24.280 --> 33:30.040
Real journalism is lying your way into buildings to surreptitiously record people and then

33:30.040 --> 33:32.660
edit together misleadingly.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.000
That's what people believe.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Mm-hmm.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Mm-hmm.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
That's great.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
That's good.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
That's good for the fourth estate, damn.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Sure.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
So there's a CNN article about Matt Gaetz, The Gate of Gaetz.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Sure.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Yes.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
And...

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Never heard of the guy.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.380
Well, Alex maybe didn't actually read this article.

33:48.380 --> 33:49.380
That could be a problem.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.960
I saw a CNN article.

33:51.960 --> 33:58.180
Gaetz attended parties with drugs and it'd be some huge party in Miami or a big hotel

33:58.180 --> 34:02.780
suite party and the women went to the media to say he was really nice and he didn't give

34:02.780 --> 34:05.360
us money and we didn't even see him using drugs.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.960
One woman said, I saw him take a pill once, but he was really nice and the women were

34:08.960 --> 34:10.960
all 25, 30.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.960
But that's at the end of the article.

34:13.960 --> 34:17.560
And then other women go, yeah, I'm getting offered money to say Gaetz did something to

34:17.560 --> 34:18.560
me.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.560
And it's not that Gaetz is perfect.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.560
He's a rich kid.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.560
He's a smart guy.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.560
He's admitted he's a party animal.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.960
Hell, he's for drug legalization and I'm not endorsing any of that, but I'm not a hypocrite.

34:25.960 --> 34:30.340
I've never been a drug problem person, but I've been, let's just say it, I'm pretty much

34:30.340 --> 34:31.940
an alcoholic off and on.

34:31.940 --> 34:34.720
That it doesn't need to go down like this.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.080
It doesn't.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.080
It's unnecessary.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.000
Why are you involving yourself in the story?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.380
We would all be like, that's fine.

34:41.380 --> 34:45.480
There's no way Alex is involved with this Matt Gaetz story if you wouldn't keep involving

34:45.480 --> 34:46.480
yourself.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.480
Hey look, I love the booze.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.480
Hey, I'm an alcoholic.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.740
Why did you tell me that?

34:51.740 --> 34:57.440
So the actual headline of this CNN story is quote, women detailed drug use, sex, and payments

34:57.440 --> 34:59.680
after late night parties with Gaetz and others.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.480
That does seem like a different headline than the one that I was presented with.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.480
Slightly, slightly different.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.480
Yeah, that is a little bit different.

35:04.480 --> 35:08.120
The article relies on the stories told by multiple women who claim to have been at these

35:08.120 --> 35:09.120
parties.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.520
There is a mention of Gaetz behaving quote, like a frat type of party boy, sometimes taking

35:13.520 --> 35:15.920
pills she believed were recreational drugs.

35:15.920 --> 35:20.600
This person saw him taking pills that were believed to be recreational drugs.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
Yeah.

35:21.600 --> 35:25.440
So the article mentions these women being paid by Joel Greenberg, but not directly ever

35:25.440 --> 35:29.800
by Gaetz, and they quote, said they never saw anyone at the parties who appeared to

35:29.800 --> 35:30.800
be underage.

35:30.800 --> 35:35.440
Additionally, the women disputed the characterizations of what they were aware of happening as being

35:35.440 --> 35:36.440
sex trafficking.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.440
Sure, sure, sure.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.440
Which is fine.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.440
Could just be sex work.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.440
Yeah.

35:40.440 --> 35:45.560
I don't know why, like I said, Alex can't even just touch this story, get into it at

35:45.560 --> 35:49.040
all without some personal thing about himself.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.040
It's very weird.

35:50.040 --> 35:58.560
Yeah, it is feeling a little like, oh no, my son is in trouble, I gotta protect this

35:58.560 --> 35:59.560
poor idiot.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.560
It's very weird.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.560
I wouldn't do that.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.560
No!

36:03.560 --> 36:07.920
I would do anything else but get involved and then tell everyone I'm an alcoholic

36:07.920 --> 36:08.920
on air.

36:08.920 --> 36:12.280
Now, speaking of things you would or would not do.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.280
Sure.

36:13.280 --> 36:17.560
If you were Alex's lawyer, what would you tell him to say publicly about the whole Sam

36:17.560 --> 36:18.560
issue?

36:18.560 --> 36:24.680
Ooh, I would tell him probably to say something along the lines of, we don't believe these

36:24.680 --> 36:28.920
charges are accurate and we are fighting against these, my lawyer has advised me to say nothing

36:28.920 --> 36:29.920
beyond that.

36:29.920 --> 36:34.880
Now, if you were Alex's lawyer and you advised him not to say anything, you probably wouldn't

36:34.880 --> 36:35.880
want to hear this.

36:35.880 --> 36:36.880
This could be an issue.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.200
But my lawyers and people are like, I would not talk about this at all.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.720
Oh, just so it's all over the news and they can lie and say I sent him in there and he

36:42.720 --> 36:45.560
had flame throwers and hand grenades and cut Pelosi's head off.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.560
I'm not going to sit there and wait for that crap.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.160
I'm going to put out a million dollar bounty.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.640
So yeah, Alex is going to set the record straight before people can say he had grenades and

36:55.640 --> 36:56.640
stuff.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.640
Yeah, okay.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.280
Now my lawyer told me not to say anything, so here we go, I'm going to say I'm a bunch

37:00.280 --> 37:01.280
of shit.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.920
All right, here we go.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.580
Shoot that shotgun of bullshit at us.

37:05.580 --> 37:10.560
So here comes, here's what Alex is, here's his story and he's going to be sticking to

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
it.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.520
I'm sure this is going to be very consistent, fully.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.600
So here's what happened.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.680
Um, everybody wanted to go to DC and had a carnival atmosphere.

37:19.680 --> 37:24.000
And I told Harrison Smith, you can go on the next trip out of here.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.840
You here to do the shows while we're all there and to cut to us life.

37:28.840 --> 37:32.360
Well Sam, who almost fired for it, but he's a likable guy, so I didn't do it, but he came

37:32.360 --> 37:33.360
as close.

37:33.360 --> 37:37.320
He's a good guy and said, well, if Alex isn't going to send me, I'm going to go with the,

37:37.320 --> 37:38.320
my pillow people.

37:38.320 --> 37:42.560
And he got press passes, White House press passes from them for the main event.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.520
And then I find out later he's in the Capitol that day and got the footage of like Sam got

37:46.520 --> 37:47.520
footage of the woman being killed.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.480
And I had a huge meltdown on the rooftop, sort of cussing at people.

37:50.480 --> 37:53.200
I said, I didn't, I ain't supposed to be in Austin running things.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.200
He's got footage of these.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.200
And I go, yeah, here it is already on Twitter.

37:55.200 --> 37:59.400
Then I go, why is it on Twitter and not on us?

37:59.400 --> 38:00.640
What the hell?

38:00.640 --> 38:10.580
So Alex said Sam couldn't go, Alex as your counsel, Sam said Alex can't go, or Alex said

38:10.580 --> 38:11.580
Sam can't go.

38:11.580 --> 38:15.760
You and Harrison Smith need to stay here and throw to us while we're there.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.760
Gotta do whatever it is you were doing.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.280
I know it's going to be a carnival, but you got to work.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.280
Yeah.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.280
Sam says, fuck that.

38:21.280 --> 38:26.040
I'm going to go talk to Mike Lindell and apparently goes to the Capitol with Mike Lindell.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.040
Right.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.040
The my pillow people.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.040
Right.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.040
Yeah.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.040
Okay.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.040
Sure.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
So then Alex.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.000
Well, I mean, everybody that works for Infowars, I assume is now an independent contractor

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
completely.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.160
So Alex is unaware that Sam has gone with the my pillow people.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.400
Honestly, he's never met Sam before in his life.

38:41.400 --> 38:48.880
So he finds out that Sam is in Washington DC when he finds out that he has footage of

38:48.880 --> 38:50.000
the woman being shot.

38:50.000 --> 38:57.140
But at the same time, Sam was along with Tyler Hansen at the time who was burning a Black

38:57.140 --> 39:02.280
Lives Matter flag with Owen Schroyer the night before and had shared a hotel room with Owen.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.280
You would think.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.400
Seems like they might've.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.100
They might've had text messages.

39:06.100 --> 39:09.760
Or maybe Sam was there when they burned the Black Lives Matter flag.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.760
Sure seems like it.

39:10.760 --> 39:11.760
Who might've been hanging out.

39:11.760 --> 39:12.760
It seems weird.

39:12.760 --> 39:13.760
Yeah.

39:13.760 --> 39:18.840
That whole burning the Black Lives Matter flag kind of puts it out of carnival atmosphere

39:18.840 --> 39:21.520
and more into bloodthirsty mob atmosphere.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.320
I don't believe for a fucking second that there wasn't an awareness that he was there

39:25.320 --> 39:26.320
in DC.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.320
Absolutely.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.320
That's ridiculous.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.320
No.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.320
I don't know what it means that he went with the my pillow people.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.960
He went with the my pillow people.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.300
You know who you should investigate?

39:33.300 --> 39:34.560
Mike Lindell.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.560
That's who you should investigate.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.560
Boy doesn't feel like that.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.840
You should go see the my pillow people.

39:38.840 --> 39:39.840
They're the ones.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.080
In other words I'm mad that he didn't give me the footage.

39:43.080 --> 39:47.960
I wish he had given me the footage until this moment when I definitely don't wish he gave

39:47.960 --> 39:48.960
me that footage.

39:48.960 --> 39:55.440
So the next day after the 6th on the 7th Alex is talking with Sam and he's like hey dude

39:55.440 --> 39:56.440
shit's fucked up.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.440
Bruh.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.440
Bruh.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.440
This was a terrible idea.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.440
Right bruh?

40:00.440 --> 40:01.440
Bruh.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.440
Bruh.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.440
You fucked.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
You gonzo.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.440
And Sam was like hey buddy.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.440
I get it.

40:06.440 --> 40:07.440
It's all good.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.440
Look I'm with the my pillow people now.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.440
No it's all good man.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.640
You shit.

40:10.640 --> 40:14.520
And then Sam talks to me I guess the next day and I go Sam.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.360
You're probably gonna get in a lot of trouble even though you didn't do anything.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.800
You know as a journalist did you do anything wrong in there and he goes no no it's fine

40:20.800 --> 40:21.800
everything's fine.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.040
I said that's not the case Sam but we'll see.

40:24.040 --> 40:28.520
And here we are a couple months three months later and you see what's unfolding since January

40:28.520 --> 40:29.520
6th.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.520
Okay.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.520
So.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.520
Yep.

40:32.520 --> 40:37.400
I really don't think the people on the right really understand what unfolded on January

40:37.400 --> 40:38.640
6th.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.480
And if they do they are lying about it.

40:41.480 --> 40:47.680
Well I think one of the problems is the you know the ripples of the fake shit that they

40:47.680 --> 40:50.040
came up with to make excuses about it.

40:50.040 --> 40:51.040
Sure.

40:51.040 --> 40:55.720
It's taken a while to catch up with the reality of you know reality keeping on existing.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.680
Yeah it keeps going whether you like it or not.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.400
So Alex heard that Sam got arrested.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
Sure.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.400
Right?

41:03.400 --> 41:04.400
Yeah.

41:04.400 --> 41:07.000
And even though he told him he was gonna be in trouble on the 7th.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Right.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.640
And then last night in 2021.

41:11.640 --> 41:12.640
Sure.

41:12.640 --> 41:17.360
Last night he interrogated people at Infowars Studios.

41:17.360 --> 41:18.360
What was Sam up to?

41:18.360 --> 41:19.360
Get the fuck out.

41:19.360 --> 41:23.880
So then I got to interrogate some people here last night and check their messages and make

41:23.880 --> 41:27.380
damn sure when I tell you the story it's what the truth is and I said I thought I said they

41:27.380 --> 41:29.040
had to stay here and run the shows.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.760
Well he told me he was going with my pillow people and if he got footage he'd give it

41:31.760 --> 41:35.800
to us and maybe we'd reimburse him if he asked for receipts or something and I said so again

41:35.800 --> 41:37.860
as usual no one does what I tell them.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.040
That's why I blow up.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.040
Okay.

41:40.040 --> 41:44.940
As usual when facing legal troubles I really want to check the messages and make sure I

41:44.940 --> 41:49.280
am telling the truth and there are a few other times when I do this.

41:49.280 --> 41:53.280
And I have literally no control over anything.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.280
Nope.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.280
Nobody knows what I'm doing.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.760
I don't know what anybody's doing.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.000
This is an anarchist outfit.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.720
Legally no one listens to me.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.720
Legally.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.520
I have never met any of these people.

42:04.520 --> 42:09.320
So it seems strange to me that Alex would have talked to Sam on January 7th and then

42:09.320 --> 42:15.020
in April he's interrogating people and checking messages about something that he clearly knows

42:15.020 --> 42:16.020
what happened.

42:16.020 --> 42:18.240
Has no idea it was a cold case, Stan.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.240
I don't understand.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.320
He's starting a podcast to investigate Sam's involvement.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.320
Get the piano out.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.680
Yes, it's a new serialized podcast.

42:26.680 --> 42:29.640
Uh, yeah, but look dude.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.640
Sure.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.880
I mean this story doesn't make sense.

42:32.880 --> 42:33.880
No it doesn't.

42:33.880 --> 42:34.880
What?

42:34.880 --> 42:35.880
Who cares?

42:35.880 --> 42:36.880
Good point.

42:36.880 --> 42:37.880
Sam sucks.

42:37.880 --> 42:38.880
Plus, Sam is not that extended.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.880
He's not a good guy anymore?

42:39.880 --> 42:44.840
He's a video editor, low level, camera guy, been here three years and I'd say he's, you

42:44.840 --> 42:45.840
know, second string.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.480
He's a great guy, but he's not gotten trained up to that point.

42:48.480 --> 42:49.480
It takes time.

42:49.480 --> 42:55.160
And sure enough, he went on his own volition, went in there and I don't, I don't say that.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.080
To like me, oh, you know, I didn't tell him to go in there even.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.660
No, I mean, I didn't, but it doesn't matter.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.660
He didn't do anything wrong.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.720
It really sounds like Alex is trying to be like, I didn't have anything to do with this

43:04.720 --> 43:05.720
shit.

43:05.720 --> 43:09.040
This is like a story that Avon Barksdale's lawyer is telling.

43:09.040 --> 43:12.920
Like listen, my client has never been anywhere near drugs.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.760
He's never seen any of these people before.

43:14.760 --> 43:20.160
I don't know why you are trying to malign a businessman and large character in the community.

43:20.160 --> 43:23.440
Quite frankly, Bodhi is a second string.

43:23.440 --> 43:28.280
Listen, if he was part of my crew, I would tell you he was only a mid-level manager.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.680
He didn't have much going on.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.560
He was selling drugs on his own and even if he wasn't, then I wasn't wrong.

43:33.560 --> 43:34.560
I don't know.

43:34.560 --> 43:38.320
He had just got his own coroner, he was, he was moving up in the world, but he wasn't

43:38.320 --> 43:39.320
any good yet.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.920
I would say that if I were Sam, I wouldn't like to hear that.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.720
I would be real unhappy.

43:42.720 --> 43:48.080
Yeah, here I am in prison for info wars and Alex is on air saying I'm second string.

43:48.080 --> 43:53.920
Yeah, I think we're going to see a little bit of a Shadowgate fall out of this one.

43:53.920 --> 43:57.640
Unfortunately Sam has been let go.

43:57.640 --> 44:03.040
If I were Alex, I would be going out of my way to say everything positive about this

44:03.040 --> 44:04.040
guy.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.040
Totally.

44:05.040 --> 44:06.040
He's worked there for three fucking years.

44:06.040 --> 44:11.360
You know, you know what Roger Stone said about Trump when he got arrested?

44:11.360 --> 44:14.120
The nicest things anyone has ever said.

44:14.120 --> 44:15.720
Oh my God.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.160
He prayed for pardons?

44:17.160 --> 44:19.520
No, and look at it the other way.

44:19.520 --> 44:21.080
Trump said nice things about Roger.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.080
Exactly.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.080
When Roger got arrested.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.080
Yes, because you don't want nobody telling nothing.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.080
No.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.080
Exactly.

44:27.080 --> 44:32.040
That's what the lawyer from The Wire would suggest.

44:32.040 --> 44:40.520
So Sam got jammed up because one of his family members tipped off the enforcement that...

44:40.520 --> 44:42.720
They needed a family member to tip people off?

44:42.720 --> 44:44.840
I guess they weren't watching info wars.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.360
Oh, that's fair.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.880
It's not something I would recommend most serious people do.

44:49.880 --> 44:50.880
That is fair.

44:50.880 --> 44:55.680
But Alex is all over the place talking about Sam's family.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.280
And I was this close and I said, you know, Sam's a nice guy.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.900
I'm not going to, I'm not going to fire him.

45:00.900 --> 45:06.200
And then I got to learn that his family member, we know who it is because he told us how she

45:06.200 --> 45:09.600
won't even come to family dinners because he's a conservative and his dad is, they're

45:09.600 --> 45:10.600
big Trump supporters.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.600
Is that it?

45:11.600 --> 45:14.600
His family member, one of his siblings won't even come to dinner with him for years because

45:14.600 --> 45:15.600
of Trump.

45:15.600 --> 45:16.960
Sam's a big Trump supporter.

45:16.960 --> 45:23.800
I mean, you see Sam at the RNC five years ago talking to me, shaking my hand in videos

45:23.800 --> 45:24.800
that Eric Andre shot.

45:24.800 --> 45:30.760
I mean, he's like, he's, he's, he's, he's been around, he's a big fan and so we're praying

45:30.760 --> 45:31.760
for him.

45:31.760 --> 45:32.760
We support him.

45:32.760 --> 45:33.760
He's in jail.

45:33.760 --> 45:34.760
Okay.

45:34.760 --> 45:35.760
This is all over the place, man.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.760
This is weird.

45:36.760 --> 45:37.760
Yeah.

45:37.760 --> 45:38.760
A more important person.

45:38.760 --> 45:42.640
Perhaps somebody not on the second string would be getting a nice little defense fund

45:42.640 --> 45:43.640
boost.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.680
We're setting something up to help him instead.

45:45.680 --> 45:48.040
Sam just gets a nice little, we're praying for him.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.560
Obviously we hope he's doing well.

45:50.560 --> 45:54.560
He will definitely be working here when he gets out of jail 100%.

45:54.560 --> 45:55.960
I will not be firing him immediately.

45:55.960 --> 46:00.600
We've sort of talked to his dad.

46:00.600 --> 46:05.360
But again, it's important to remember that what's at stake here and what's real about

46:05.360 --> 46:10.280
this story is not, it doesn't even involve Sam at all.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.280
No.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.280
It involves Alex.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.280
Of course.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.280
So we're praying for him.

46:14.280 --> 46:15.280
We support him.

46:15.280 --> 46:19.080
He's in jail, uh, for raising his voice in the Capitol and they've got the quotes about

46:19.080 --> 46:22.900
woo woo, America standing up, all this stuff, but he was wearing two hats.

46:22.900 --> 46:23.900
He's a journalist.

46:23.900 --> 46:28.080
He had a presidential, uh, uh, uh, media pass.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.520
He thought the president was going there.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.400
The police opened the doors and waved him in.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.520
That's why he went in and covered it.

46:32.520 --> 46:33.760
He got the footage of the woman dying.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.520
He had other mainstream media there.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.480
So they have to all be indicted if he's indicted.

46:37.480 --> 46:42.320
It's all a fraud in a hope, obviously, to keep him in jail for a nonviolent offense

46:42.320 --> 46:45.400
to try to have him turn state's evidence and make stuff up about me so they can put me

46:45.400 --> 46:46.880
in prison and shut down info wars.

46:46.880 --> 46:48.120
And that's their admitted goal.

46:48.120 --> 46:49.120
Wow.

46:49.120 --> 46:52.600
So that was a lot for them to have as a goal of sure.

46:52.600 --> 46:53.600
Yeah.

46:53.600 --> 46:58.000
They didn't process this story except as it being part of an elaborate plan to get him.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.860
If I were Sam, I would be a bit worried about how my arrest was being used as a prop to

47:01.860 --> 47:04.400
justify Alex's completely out of control narcissism.

47:04.400 --> 47:05.400
You'd think.

47:05.400 --> 47:07.360
I want to take this clip piece by piece.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.360
Okay.

47:08.360 --> 47:12.280
The first little piece here is that Alex is claiming that Sam just said, woo woo, America

47:12.280 --> 47:13.280
is standing up.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.280
That is not true.

47:14.280 --> 47:15.280
That doesn't sound right.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.160
Here's some of the quotes from the charging documents.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.160
Okay.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.160
Quote, we've had enough.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.080
We're not going to take your fucking vaccines.

47:21.080 --> 47:22.480
We're not going to take all your bullshit.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.400
The people are standing up.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.200
That sounds like something he might say.

47:26.200 --> 47:30.280
Quote, here we are in the US Capitol in Washington DC in the Capitol building.

47:30.280 --> 47:33.680
It has officially been stormed by Trump supporters.

47:33.680 --> 47:38.760
Again, the US Capitol building in Washington DC has officially been stormed by Trump supporters.

47:38.760 --> 47:41.760
And here we are taking our the people's house back.

47:41.760 --> 47:46.120
I wouldn't want that anywhere where people would have that on recording.

47:46.120 --> 47:52.000
I especially wouldn't want to say be recording myself while I was saying those things.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.760
It's not in the list of quotes in the charging document, but my favorite quote from Sam's

47:55.760 --> 47:59.940
live stream was when he was walking in, entering the Capitol building and he does a plug for

47:59.940 --> 48:01.840
Info Wars store.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.840
It seems weird.

48:02.840 --> 48:08.000
Like maybe if he was there with my pillow, he should have plugged them, but I didn't

48:08.000 --> 48:09.120
send him down there.

48:09.120 --> 48:14.240
I guess, I guess loyalty runs deep, but it's also a one way street because Alex doesn't

48:14.240 --> 48:15.240
give a shit.

48:15.240 --> 48:20.620
This dude's second string.

48:20.620 --> 48:21.620
That's brutal.

48:21.620 --> 48:24.720
The next piece is that Alex is claiming that Sam had a press pass.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.340
That is also not true.

48:26.340 --> 48:29.920
From the charging document quote, the director of the congressional press galleries within

48:29.920 --> 48:34.000
the Senate press office did a name check on Samuel Christopher Montoya and confirmed that

48:34.000 --> 48:38.600
no one by that name has congressional press credentials as an individual or via any other

48:38.600 --> 48:39.600
organizations.

48:39.600 --> 48:43.560
I have no idea what Alex is trying to claim, but there's no way that Sam had a press pass

48:43.560 --> 48:45.420
to be where he was.

48:45.420 --> 48:46.680
That's complete bullshit.

48:46.680 --> 48:50.440
And there also wasn't any other like mainstream media where Sam was.

48:50.440 --> 48:54.640
The videos that have come out have been played on other outlets or things that people purchased

48:54.640 --> 48:56.640
from the folks who were there.

48:56.640 --> 49:01.920
The media isn't going to be like, Hey, let's go wander inside the middle of this blood

49:01.920 --> 49:04.680
thirsty mob that hates the media.

49:04.680 --> 49:05.680
Uh huh.

49:05.680 --> 49:06.680
Yeah.

49:06.680 --> 49:07.680
Uh, yeah.

49:07.680 --> 49:12.760
Wear one of those hats with a little card from the coverage I can find in any real outlets.

49:12.760 --> 49:16.320
It really feels like Alex is heightening this to a point of absurdity.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.480
This is my area of interest and what I cover.

49:18.480 --> 49:22.840
And honestly, I don't think I care nearly as much about the arrest as I do about Alex's

49:22.840 --> 49:24.080
response.

49:24.080 --> 49:28.200
It's complete sensation, a sensationalization where Alex is trying to walk this interesting

49:28.200 --> 49:32.640
line where he has nothing to do with Sam's actions, but the consequences that are coming

49:32.640 --> 49:35.280
to Sam are secretly an attack on him.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.280
Yes.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.480
This is how a narcissistic mind would interpret something like this.

49:38.480 --> 49:43.240
Like Alex is blameless and all negative consequences are secretly a plot against him.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.240
Yes.

49:44.240 --> 49:48.240
And if I were Sam, I would realize this is a plot and I am being used.

49:48.240 --> 49:52.200
I would immediately go, Oh, he's a vicious narcissist.

49:52.200 --> 49:57.480
Oh, why would I think that he was anything but that who would help me out in my hour

49:57.480 --> 49:58.480
of need?

49:58.480 --> 50:00.960
No, but I mean, look, it's all about getting Alex.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.560
Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.

50:03.560 --> 50:08.600
So there are now hundreds of news articles proliferating like mushrooms going, Oh, Alex

50:08.600 --> 50:10.080
Jones is going to get arrested.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.520
Alex Jones is finally going to get it.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.520
We're going to shut him up.

50:14.520 --> 50:20.280
He sent in one of his reporters to attack the capital of the most vicious attack on

50:20.280 --> 50:21.960
the U S since Pearl Harbor.

50:21.960 --> 50:26.000
You know, they're actually saying that this was as bad as Pearl Harbor asinine.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.240
Again, Alex is making this all about himself.

50:29.240 --> 50:32.840
I failed to find any mainstream media articles that fit the description of what he's talking

50:32.840 --> 50:33.840
about.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.640
But again, if he actually means random tweets when he says media articles, then there's

50:37.640 --> 50:39.260
nothing I can really do about that.

50:39.260 --> 50:41.000
It's just the delusions of a liar.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.560
Also about that Pearl Harbor thing.

50:43.560 --> 50:48.140
This is just Alex misrepresenting comments made by Chuck Schumer after the storming quote.

50:48.140 --> 50:51.620
It's very, very difficult to put into words what has transpired today.

50:51.620 --> 50:55.400
I've never lived through or even imagined an experience like the one we've just witnessed

50:55.400 --> 50:56.960
in this Capitol.

50:56.960 --> 51:01.840
President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy.

51:01.840 --> 51:06.780
Unfortunately we can now add January 6th, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American

51:06.780 --> 51:09.700
history that will live forever in infamy.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.720
Alex has taken this and twisted it into Schumer saying that the storming of the Capitol was

51:12.720 --> 51:15.600
worse than Pearl Harbor when he said no such thing.

51:15.600 --> 51:16.600
Yeah.

51:16.600 --> 51:20.520
Interestingly, there was a recent comment about Pearl Harbor that you might find interesting.

51:20.520 --> 51:21.520
Hmm.

51:21.520 --> 51:24.520
Quote, we went through the worst attack we've ever had in our country.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.720
This is the worst attack we've ever had.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.040
This is worse than Pearl Harbor.

51:28.040 --> 51:29.760
It's worse than the World Trade Center.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.680
There's never been an attack like this.

51:31.680 --> 51:38.440
Ooh, I'm going to go with Paul Ryan about something 10 years ago.

51:38.440 --> 51:41.840
No, it was Trump talking about COVID-19 in May of last year.

51:41.840 --> 51:42.840
There it was.

51:42.840 --> 51:43.960
I'd like Alex's comments on that.

51:43.960 --> 51:47.600
I'd like to see what he thinks about Trump saying that COVID-19 is worse than Pearl Harbor

51:47.600 --> 51:48.600
in 9-11.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.080
Well, you know, you don't need to worry about the things that Trump says.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.800
It's more about the vibe he gives to it.

51:52.800 --> 51:53.800
Right, right, right.

51:53.800 --> 51:58.280
Speaking of vibes, Alex has this vibe, right?

51:58.280 --> 51:59.320
Sure.

51:59.320 --> 52:02.720
Sam got popped.

52:02.720 --> 52:05.920
So Alex has nothing to do with this.

52:05.920 --> 52:09.840
However, Sam was there the night before with Owen.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.320
Well, I don't know.

52:11.320 --> 52:14.880
Actually, I'm not 100% sure Sam was there the night before.

52:14.880 --> 52:20.440
When Sam was in the Capitol, Tyler Hansen was there as well at the same place, and Tyler

52:20.440 --> 52:25.040
was sharing a hotel room, hanging out with Owen, and burning a Black Lives Matter flag.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.320
They all knew they were there.

52:26.320 --> 52:32.200
It seems like there's a very clear associate chain of people.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.200
Right, right, right.

52:34.200 --> 52:36.080
Sorry about distracting you.

52:36.080 --> 52:41.280
So Sam got popped, and Alex has this vibe that's like, it's unfair.

52:41.280 --> 52:44.320
Other people protest at the Capitol, and they don't get arrested.

52:44.320 --> 52:47.920
I don't need to say that I didn't send Sam in there because I need to protect myself.

52:47.920 --> 52:50.040
I'm saying it because it's the truth.

52:50.040 --> 52:53.480
But it doesn't matter because you saw Kavanaugh hearings where they took over, blocked the

52:53.480 --> 52:58.480
halls through things, chased Congress people onto elevators, blocked the elevators, did

52:58.480 --> 53:03.480
all that stuff, and nothing happened to those people.

53:03.480 --> 53:08.400
But when a couple hundred people go in behind a few dozen morons that were violent and who

53:08.400 --> 53:13.920
did do wrong, they don't all deserve to then be indicted when the police officers wave

53:13.920 --> 53:15.520
Sam Motea in.

53:15.520 --> 53:18.360
That's the second time Alex has gotten his name wrong.

53:18.360 --> 53:19.360
Sam Motea.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.360
Yeah.

53:20.360 --> 53:23.240
The guy who definitely is a good guy.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.880
Second string, Sam Motea.

53:24.880 --> 53:25.880
Yeah.

53:25.880 --> 53:31.760
Boy, if I were Sam, I would be like, I'm racking my brain for shit that's unrelated to the

53:31.760 --> 53:32.760
six.

53:32.760 --> 53:34.320
I'm going through any crime I can think.

53:34.320 --> 53:37.280
I think he embezzled 50 bucks one time.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.680
He took it from petty cash.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.960
It was Alex.

53:40.960 --> 53:44.840
As for the Kavanaugh protesters, it feels like no one got arrested there to Alex because

53:44.840 --> 53:45.840
he doesn't care.

53:45.840 --> 53:46.840
Right.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.460
And acknowledging that there were arrests would hurt his narratives.

53:49.460 --> 53:53.160
In reality, you can find articles about mass arrests that took place around the Kavanaugh

53:53.160 --> 53:54.160
hearings.

53:54.160 --> 53:59.800
CNN had an article on October 5th, 2018 about 293 people being arrested by the Capitol Police

53:59.800 --> 54:01.760
for unlawful demonstrations.

54:01.760 --> 54:05.240
A Mother Jones article lists the arrests at Kavanaugh protests.

54:05.240 --> 54:09.040
And if you add them all up, not including the group one from that CNN article, you end

54:09.040 --> 54:12.440
up with 662 arrests at Kavanaugh protests.

54:12.440 --> 54:13.900
That's a ton.

54:13.900 --> 54:18.080
And the main difference between then and now is that these anti-Kavanaugh protesters didn't

54:18.080 --> 54:20.340
try to take over the fucking Capitol.

54:20.340 --> 54:23.060
How many people did they kill?

54:23.060 --> 54:27.000
Alex pretends that no one got arrested protesting Kavanaugh because if he acknowledged that

54:27.000 --> 54:30.920
they did, he'd either have to argue that they shouldn't have and then be defending evil

54:30.920 --> 54:35.520
leftists, or he'd have to accept that there are consequences for people's actions.

54:35.520 --> 54:39.600
And currently, Sam is experiencing what a lot of others before him have.

54:39.600 --> 54:43.560
It was a risk that he either knowingly or unknowingly accepted when he decided to film

54:43.560 --> 54:47.560
himself going into the Capitol with a bunch of lunatics, and recognizing that dynamic

54:47.560 --> 54:50.720
is a big threat to Alex's entire pitch about how they're all victims.

54:50.720 --> 54:51.720
Yeah.

54:51.720 --> 54:55.120
The right has no idea what it means to actually protest.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.120
No.

54:56.120 --> 54:58.440
Like, they just don't get that.

54:58.440 --> 55:04.480
They don't understand the idea about accepting consequences when you put yourself in these

55:04.480 --> 55:05.480
situations.

55:05.480 --> 55:06.480
That's the point.

55:06.480 --> 55:12.560
You are accepting that something will happen to you in order to stand beside a ton of people.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.720
You can't take all of us.

55:13.720 --> 55:19.880
The cause is important enough to you that you risk whatever consequence may come.

55:19.880 --> 55:26.880
It's illegal to occupy this space and sit in the Capitol, let's say, for example.

55:26.880 --> 55:31.400
And you do that knowing that the consequence could be that you get arrested because it

55:31.400 --> 55:35.440
will bring attention to whatever cause you are there protesting.

55:35.440 --> 55:39.360
Yeah, I think they're just so used to getting whatever they fucking want.

55:39.360 --> 55:40.360
Yeah.

55:40.360 --> 55:46.000
It's so bizarre for people who are just so interested in personal responsibility to not

55:46.000 --> 55:48.600
understand this dynamic.

55:48.600 --> 55:49.600
Yeah.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.600
Oh well.

55:50.600 --> 55:51.600
It's not bizarre.

55:51.600 --> 55:55.260
People who are really interested in personal responsibility are usually really interested

55:55.260 --> 55:56.880
in it for other people.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.280
Yeah, maybe.

55:58.280 --> 56:04.300
So mike down for this clip because it was so weird, but another defense of Sam is that

56:04.300 --> 56:05.560
he's got a lot of hats.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.600
He's wearing hats.

56:06.600 --> 56:10.880
He was wearing a MAGA hat when he was there, literally, but he was also wearing a journalist

56:10.880 --> 56:13.400
hat and also just like a, hey, I'm cool guy hat.

56:13.400 --> 56:19.720
And he got really, really dramatic footage.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.600
And so we left it up because he was operating as a journalist.

56:22.600 --> 56:27.000
So they're going to try to say, well, he's not a journalist when he's making political

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
comments.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.360
Well, everybody can wear two or three hats.

56:30.360 --> 56:34.040
You can be out playing golf and then say something to the news cameras about your view on apartheid.

56:34.040 --> 56:38.940
You know, 30 years ago, you can be at a star Wars premiere and say something about animal

56:38.940 --> 56:39.940
rights if you want.

56:39.940 --> 56:41.440
It's two different hats.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
Okay.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.040
I'm guessing that Alex is referencing Gary player.

56:45.040 --> 56:49.160
Yeah, something, but man, that's a weird poll for him to make as an example of someone wearing

56:49.160 --> 56:50.160
two hats.

56:50.160 --> 57:04.880
I think that was on Alex's mind because Trump gave a Gary player a medal of freedom or whatever.

57:04.880 --> 57:05.880
That's too predictable.

57:05.880 --> 57:07.960
I hate people like this.

57:07.960 --> 57:08.960
Yeah.

57:08.960 --> 57:09.960
So that's weird.

57:09.960 --> 57:15.040
I think that there's a slight difference between a golfer giving a unpopular opinion or you

57:15.040 --> 57:18.880
making some kind of a political comment when you're on a red carpet.

57:18.880 --> 57:23.760
I think those are a little bit different than you being, uh, in the middle of an inactive

57:23.760 --> 57:27.800
participant in the storming of the Capitol, but you're a journalist because you have a

57:27.800 --> 57:28.800
camera.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
Yeah.

57:29.800 --> 57:33.200
They like to pretend that it wasn't a massive bloodthirsty attempt to take over the entire

57:33.200 --> 57:36.760
country, hopefully triggering Trump to Institute martial law.

57:36.760 --> 57:41.200
So you have a, everything under your control, they don't like to deal with that part.

57:41.200 --> 57:45.340
Well, the circumstances are a little bit weird to me because it's not analogous to someone

57:45.340 --> 57:47.680
at like a movie premiere saying something political.

57:47.680 --> 57:53.600
No, the, the version that I think would be really funny is if someone was, let's say

57:53.600 --> 57:54.600
storming the Capitol.

57:54.600 --> 57:55.600
Sure.

57:55.600 --> 58:00.600
But they were wearing like Godzilla versus Kong merch, so they argued they were just

58:00.600 --> 58:01.600
doing promotion.

58:01.600 --> 58:02.600
Yeah.

58:02.600 --> 58:03.600
There's two hats.

58:03.600 --> 58:04.600
Yeah.

58:04.600 --> 58:07.480
I'm a marketing major and also I am attempting to overthrow a country.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.480
Right, right, right.

58:08.480 --> 58:09.480
Yeah.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.480
Yeah.

58:10.480 --> 58:13.440
I think I remember that and Marquis de Sade, whenever they stormed the Bastille came out

58:13.440 --> 58:17.600
with copies of his book and he's like, just while I'm here, look, where is there

58:17.600 --> 58:21.080
going to be more free press attention than at the storming of the Capitol?

58:21.080 --> 58:23.360
You want to get the word out about your movie?

58:23.360 --> 58:24.720
That's the place.

58:24.720 --> 58:28.960
Has anybody ever said no press is bad press, my friends, because that's the truth.

58:28.960 --> 58:34.120
I don't, I don't, I don't think that this argument holds up in my mind that he's wearing

58:34.120 --> 58:35.120
two hats.

58:35.120 --> 58:41.080
How long before that's a legitimate advertising strategy, fucking Disney is like, okay, here's

58:41.080 --> 58:42.080
what we do.

58:42.080 --> 58:46.400
We're going to storm the United States Capitol and then after we've done all this damage,

58:46.400 --> 58:51.120
we're going to remove our shirts all at once and it's going to be the next Pocahontas movie.

58:51.120 --> 58:53.280
And everyone's going to blame soy bomb.

58:53.280 --> 58:54.280
Yeah.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.060
Yeah, that sounds right.

58:56.060 --> 59:00.820
So I got this real sense and I think it's kind of a normal sense to get in situations

59:00.820 --> 59:03.640
like this that Alex is obviously making this all about himself.

59:03.640 --> 59:04.640
Sure.

59:04.640 --> 59:05.640
Duh.

59:05.640 --> 59:11.900
But as Alex talked more, I really got a feeling that it kind of felt like he is mad that it's

59:11.900 --> 59:13.840
not him.

59:13.840 --> 59:16.160
It seems like he wishes it was him who got arrested.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.160
Good enough.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.160
Martyr.

59:18.160 --> 59:19.160
Mm hmm.

59:19.160 --> 59:20.160
Yeah.

59:20.160 --> 59:23.920
Disrupting would be blocking him, blocking the door, shutting down the hearing quickly.

59:23.920 --> 59:27.280
He's talking about when he went to Congress and yelled at Sundar Pichai.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.280
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

59:28.280 --> 59:33.320
I don't believe you should do that, but particularly I got angry also because the, in the hearings

59:33.320 --> 59:36.680
they'd been talking about me, they did talk about me in that hearing.

59:36.680 --> 59:41.920
I was in there for five angry hours and they said my name at least six, seven times and

59:41.920 --> 59:46.180
they had Congress people pointing me out in the back row with Roger Stone going, there's

59:46.180 --> 59:48.560
the Russians, there's the spies right there.

59:48.560 --> 59:53.740
I'm not a Russian spy, you trash.

59:53.740 --> 59:56.440
And you know it, you're the globalist butcher in this country.

59:56.440 --> 59:57.440
Sure.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:06.180
So again, what I did was 10 times more aggressive than Sam and if he is indicted, I deserve

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.120
to be indicted for what happened.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.000
I see, that's how I operate.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I am Spartacus.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.240
The law is a fraud, the whole application of it's a fraud, it's garbage.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.800
So please arrest me, please.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.600
I want to be a martyr, it would give me so much attention.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.720
Secondary attention is not good enough.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.520
Uh-uh, what is this, what is this?

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.720
Just a second string cameraman that's getting arrested, I can't turn him into a martyr that

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.720
leads the movement?

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720
I did 10 times worse.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.760
I am the worst person here, he says confidently knowing he won't be arrested or inconvenienced

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760
in any way.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760
So silly.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.760
Yeah.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:47.040
So we get now to that Washington Post, I'm sorry, Washington Times, quite different.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.040
Yeah, hold on.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.520
Headline that Alex was talking about earlier in the episode.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.920
Is Dr. Fauci the father of the pandemic?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:01.040
An incredible Washington Times article out just yesterday, admitting he basically ran

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.120
the Wuhan lab, it had hundreds of groups funding it, but his program with Obama continuing

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.880
under Trump till he pulled out of it two years before COVID launched, about a year into Trump,

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880
Trump pulled out of it.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.480
We showed you those documents last week, to his credit, that he got back into it by then

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.940
supporting their damn vaccine, it's a terrible idea, but that's the facts.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:22.940
That's the facts?

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.120
Those are the facts?

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.240
What facts are those?

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.320
I think that that makes Trump look worse.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.800
That makes him look incredibly stupid.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:34.960
Yeah, if any of that were true, which it's not, that would make Trump like a willing

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.880
participant in bio warfare against the American people.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.680
Because it's not him just letting the program continue, it's him being like, I got to stop

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.720
this program, and then a couple of years later, them being like, come on, let's kill everybody.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.360
And he's like, I'm tired, sure, go for it.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.720
That makes him real, real bad.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:59.360
So we know from looking at past episodes of Alex's show that when Alex first learned about

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.440
Anthony Fauci towards the beginning of the pandemic, huge fan, loved him, he's a great

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440
guy.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.440
Didn't do him, he's a legend.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.600
He's a man among men.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600
One of the best.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.960
Trump's got him out there, he's going to- Best person to lead the fight.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.840
Right, because he was, Alex thought that Fauci was saying stuff that worked for his conspiracies.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840
Right.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.880
Turned out it didn't, so he threw Fauci under the bus pretty quick.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.920
Also we know from listening to past episodes, Steve Pachanik used to think that Anthony

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.040
Fauci was one of the best in the business.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.040
True.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.600
Because they went to Columbia together.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.600
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.600
Or Cornell.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.600
Or Cornell together.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.640
And that has changed that tone.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640
Right.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.640
Turns out we have a new villain backstory.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.240
How do I know Fauci's in charge?

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.180
He's been involved running these attacks and bioweapon attacks against Africa and others

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.240
since before Gates was even out of college.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.960
Gates has worked directly under him.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.960
Fauci is the guy that actually runs the operational programs.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.760
He's been doing it for 40 years at least.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.760
And his, because I read transcripts, his word for word stuff a week before, a month before,

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.120
a day before, will word for word come out of Gigi Pink's dirty mouth and out of the

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.000
UN's dirty mouth, the WHO's murderous mouth.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.260
He's in charge.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.340
He's the one.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.340
He's the one.

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340
He's the one.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.340
Look at him.

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.340
Look at him.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.340
Look at him.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.340
Look at him.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:23.900
He looks like an academic and we hate those.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:29.840
So Fauci's been running bioweapon attacks for like 40 years and yet Steve Pachanik,

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.920
the great insider who knows everything in his overthrown countries, secretly the Forrest

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:41.320
Gump of world history, thought he was a great guy until like just now.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:45.600
No, I would say that Steve Pachanik thought he was a great guy until he was the first

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.240
person to be infected with COVID-19.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.600
He cured himself.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.320
So once he got infected, he realized that Fauci had been lying to him the whole time,

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.040
even since he was young, because Fauci was actually recruited into this program when

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.440
he was zero years old.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.880
He was grown in a lab, Dan.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:08.480
Since he was zero and a half years old, he was also exactly five foot eight at the time,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480
et cetera.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480
Yep.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.480
I think I proved it.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.480
That sounds right.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480
Yeah.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480
Yeah.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.080
I feel like the more and more you try to parody what Alex is talking about.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.560
It's going to say it next week.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.560
Yeah.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.040
It's not far off enough to actually be funny.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.000
I just don't know how far I can go.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.080
We're just basically in comic book territory at this point.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.080
That is true.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:33.600
So Alex is complaining about this article, not really dealing with it at all, but the

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600
headline's fun for him.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
Sure.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600
Sure.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600
So that's great.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600
Yeah.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600
And then Alex reads another headline.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600
I'm a clinical lab scientist.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600
COVID-19 is fake.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600
Wake up.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600
And it continues on from there.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600
It continues on from there.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.600
It continues on from there.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.400
Dan, does it continue on from there?

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400
It does.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.600
Would that continuation perhaps provide context for this headline?

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.600
Yeah.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.280
That headline is just the first line of a meme post that's been going around on message

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.240
boards and Facebook since at least early December.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.560
It was initially attributed to an anonymous doctor, but since it's been claimed to have

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.800
been written by Dr. Rob Oswald, a virologist and immunologist at Cornell University's Department

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800
of Molecular Medicine.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.840
Man, Cornell is out of its mind-growing lunatics at us.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.080
Oswald didn't write that.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Oh, okay.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080
And he doesn't agree with the sentiment.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080
Sure.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.840
But people get tricked more easily when you pretend that someone with expertise in a particular

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:22.000
field is saying something, as opposed to some random idiot on the internet.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm pretty sure Thomas Jefferson said that.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.080
This is what Alex is covering in his stack of news.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.400
This is something that passed the test of what should be printed off and covered on

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.320
this program, which is just pathetic.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320
It's a meme.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.040
You got to share memes, otherwise they won't become powerful.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040
It's not even new.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:42.200
New memes are just old memes waiting to be reused.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200
Great.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.760
Something else that's getting reused is Norm fucking Pattis.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.120
Oh, no.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.120
No.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120
Really?

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.120
Norm Pattis.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.120
Oh, man.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.280
He's a lawyer extraordinaire, guy who had to sit silently and awkwardly while Alex put

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.560
a bounty out on his ass, and he hooked enemies.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.560
There's got to be...

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.160
I think at this point, Pattis has to be in it for the stories.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:08.400
You know, like 20 years from now, he's sitting at a bar just being like, I can tell you tales,

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.400
man.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.880
I suspect that maybe he's flown too close to the sun with Alex.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.440
And he can't go anywhere else.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440
Might realize...

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.320
It might be starting to realize like, ah, shit.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.320
I don't know.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.800
Maybe it's part of a book thing that he's trying to write.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:27.400
Like, you know how some strippers or sex workers or the like, they're like, oh, I do this.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.520
And then they write a book and they go on Oprah.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.840
That's what Norm Pattis is going to do.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840
I don't know.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:37.060
Because the more that I hear Norm, the more I feel like he's being more willing to say

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.060
Infowars-y stuff.

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.060
That's true.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.520
Whereas before, it seemed like he had a little bit of restraint.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.940
It seemed a little more professional.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:47.820
He seems like a real fucking shithead in this interview.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.820
That's not good.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:49.820
Yeah.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:54.520
So anyway, Alex introduces him and he also gets Sam's name wrong again.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.520
Great.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:59.720
I wanted to get Norm Pattis as a famous criminal lawyer and constitutional lawyer and also

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:04.940
does work for us on the first amendment issue quite a bit on, you know, he doesn't know

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.640
all the facts and this all just happened yesterday.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:15.280
So he's going to be limited on what he talks about with our Infowars reporter, Sam Motea.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.560
Wow.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.080
Sam, you got to listen to this broadcast.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.580
This is one that's going to change things for you.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.200
This broadcast is going to put you on a path to a better life.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.200
Alex is trying to do you dirty.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200
Yeah.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.640
And one of the funny things about Norm's appearance here on the show is that you get a real sense

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.000
that he's kind of trying to reassure Alex that like you're clean.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Okay.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You're good, man.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.360
What I know in Mr. Montoya's case is that he was arrested for his conduct on the Capitol

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.360
that day.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.080
I understand he had a press pass.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.400
Federal authorities may or may not be aware of that.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.920
The press pass may or may not have protected him from all the consequences of what he was

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.320
doing that day.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.200
That's a question that will have to be sorted out in a court of law.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.400
You know, I represent you, obviously, my primary concern is you.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:05.960
I do not believe there are facts sufficient to warrant a further investigation of you

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.960
or much less an arrest.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.680
I'm prepared to wage that fight when the time comes, if it comes.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.680
Yeah.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.040
I don't know, from everything I can see publicly available, Norm's probably right.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040
Yeah.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.200
Like, he was promoting Infowars while he was live streaming going into the Capitol.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.200
Sure.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.920
But who's to say if Alex asked him to do that or is even aware that he was doing that?

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.520
Yeah, that is something that will have to be seen.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.840
But it is interesting that there's like, yeah, yeah, he's gonna have to go to court.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840
You're cool.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840
Yeah.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.840
Hey, buddy, buddy.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.840
My primary concern is you.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.840
He's not my client.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.440
He doesn't pay me.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440
You do.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.840
And let me tell you something right now, you keep saying what you're saying, you never

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840
met the guy.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.840
You're cool.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.840
We're gonna have a good night.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:58.960
So they get to talking about the shooting of Daunte Wright in Minneapolis, or in Minnesota.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960
Yeah, sure.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.840
I want to get my lawyer buddy on to do that, yeah.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.120
This takes a turn for the uncomfortable.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120
Let's talk about this.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.360
This is just now breaking.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.680
We know the name of the female police officer who said, get ready Taser.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.080
And then she shot and killed Daunte Wright.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.520
He's in the middle of rioting.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.560
He's got a warrant out for armed robbery.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.200
The city's burning, the police station shot up.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.520
He's kicking police flailing.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.860
She absolutely shoots him in the fog of war.

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:28.860
That's what happens.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.860
I'm not glad it happened.

01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.200
But he's a thug waving guns around on the internet.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.200
You know, all this, he's dead.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.200
Now, what does he expect?

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.680
You go to a riot, you're probably gonna get killed by somebody.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.880
Surprisingly, one person got killed.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.640
Fox is making up almost all of the details of this shooting.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.240
Daunte wasn't at a riot.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.880
He was pulled over for having expired tags on his license plates and having hanging air

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.640
fresheners that blocked his mirrors.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.900
Very minor things.

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.500
He wasn't fighting with the police, though it does appear that he was trying to get back

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.880
into his car before he was shot.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.440
There was a misdemeanor warrant for Wright's arrest, but it was unrelated to an aggravated

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.400
robbery charge he'd gotten in December 2019.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.120
It had to do with missing a court date for a misdemeanor of carrying a pistol without

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.400
a permit, something Alex should not think is a crime.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.040
There's a conversation to have about this shooting, but it's literally impossible to

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.820
deal with any of the real underlying issues if you're like Alex and you insist on creating

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:22.720
a completely fictional version of events to tell your audience.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.920
It's important to understand that Alex does this all the time.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.480
Real events become fiction, with his addition of tons of details and subplots that aren't

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.480
real.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.400
And it's critical to understand how he uses fictional augmentation of real stories, because

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.920
it's one of the easiest ways to see his biases.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.640
When it's a black man who's killed, the story is supplemented with all sorts of extenuating

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:48.960
circumstances and details that make it so sad that the guy kinda had it coming.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.620
We've seen this play out over and over again recently with George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:57.760
The opposite is done when it's a white person who's killed, as we saw so grotesquely in

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.640
the case of Kate Steinle.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.640
In reality, an immigrant found a gun wrapped in a rag that he didn't even realize was a

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:08.120
gun, he picked it up, the gun discharged, and a ricocheting bullet accidentally and

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.220
tragically hit Steinle.

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:14.140
Alex's retelling of the story became a tale where this immigrant saw Steinle with her

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.400
dad who the immigrant thought was her older boyfriend and the immigrant was jealous that

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.920
she was with, he was with someone so beautiful and he couldn't have her so he killed her.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.840
These strategies are intentional because reality isn't what's real to Alex.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.080
What's real is this white supremacist ideology and archetypes that he can try to justify

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.140
by using real life events and tragedies as props.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.160
And you see that and it's very, very obvious.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:42.080
So I mean, one of the things that I think is really important whenever we're talking

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:48.260
about Alex Jones and the things that he does is often times it's less important to look

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:54.040
at what is being done as like the structure of why these things are being done.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:00.600
Alex is creating side stories and details about the story of this shooting in order

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.840
to make it more palatable for his audience to not care.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.280
And he does the reverse when it's a white person who has been shot.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.620
It's just very obvious whenever Alex says something like, where, how am I racist?

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.280
This is a key example.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.760
This strategy and this tactic is a fingerprint.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:25.240
Yeah, I mean it's immediately obvious simply because his argument, even if he says it's

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.940
not okay for the cops to kill people, his argument always boils down to it's more okay

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.440
for the cops to kill black people than white people.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440
Yeah.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440
Yeah.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.800
His behavior dictates that that is his position.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.400
That has to be true in his situation.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.680
So there you go.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.040
You're a racist piece of shit.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.320
Alex is taking issue too with the fact that the name of the police officer in Minnesota

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:54.360
was released and that the officer who shot Ashley Babbitt in the Capitol has not been

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360
released.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360
Sure.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360
And then Norm chimes in.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.800
The department of justice closes investigation, the death of Ashley Babbitt.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.480
And they say, since when do you have an investigation?

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.560
Like it's national security, like it's the CIA and we don't even, they've closed the

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.480
investigation and we don't even know the person's name.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.400
This is a very dangerous precedent here, Norm.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.760
What do you think is going on here?

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.760
I have no idea.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.040
I mean, and that's the problem.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.400
It's not transparent.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.060
I know that had she been black and there were no charges, no transparency, there might be

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:31.080
more riots in the streets and then we'd be talking about the need for a so-called racial

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.080
reckoning.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.080
Are you a lawyer?

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:41.960
Man, you know, the past few years have really made me think that passing the bar is not

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.840
as hard as it has been advertised.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.840
Cool, Norm.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840
Jesus Christ.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.840
Wow.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.920
A racial reckoning.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.920
Yeah.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:56.560
He's saying that the reason that no one is concerned with who the Capitol police officer,

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.360
and I don't even know if I'm going to allow that stipulation to stand, but he's saying

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.200
that we would ever want to be up in arms if it was a black person who had gotten shot.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.240
That's wow.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.240
This guy's a lawyer.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.240
That's not good.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.240
Nope.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240
That's not good.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240
Nope.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.640
So if there's ghosts in the neighborhood, there's something strange in the neighborhood.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640
Sure, sure, sure.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640
Who are you going to call?

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.300
I would call the Ghostbusters.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.300
That is correct.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.840
Who would other people call?

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.960
Now, if there's a rustling in your house at night, maybe if it was a burglar, who would

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:27.960
you call?

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.520
I would still call the Ghostbusters.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.080
Those proton packs are fucking powerful, man.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.080
Do they affect people?

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080
I don't know.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.080
I've never...

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.640
I mean, if you cross them, they'll make something come to life, I guess.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
You'd call the police.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.200
I would totally call the police.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.200
Yes.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.200
And in that, you and Norm...

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.200
Wait, what?

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.200
No, I would never call the police.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.240
I would die before calling the police instantly.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.880
Norm would call the police.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.200
Calling the police is essentially attempted murder at this point.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.200
But I'll tell you something.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.880
If I hear a rustle at the door tonight and somebody's trying to enter my home, I'm calling

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.880
911.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.920
I'm not calling Black Lives Matter.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.840
That's the kind of statement that I hear and my only response is, okay, all right, all

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.840
right, man.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.840
Yeah.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.840
Cool.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.160
Why would you call Black Lives Matter if someone's breaking in your house?

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.960
They're not a police organization.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.320
They're not law enforcement.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.560
I don't know.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560
I just don't...

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.900
I just don't know.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.880
Are you really going to use that as a thing that's acceptable to say?

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:28.920
Well, it's really bizarre because I think we might be dealing with a Norm who's trying

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.960
to get into a second line of work.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.120
Oh, he's looking for that Milly Weaver slot that opened up.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.440
No, I think he's trying to get into standup.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.440
Oh, no.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.640
I tried my debut at standup comedy the other night at a small club in Connecticut and I

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.720
ended my riff with the following, hey, you know, I tried to buy woke insurance the other

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720
day.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.720
The crowd looked at me.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.720
What's woke insurance?

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.840
Well, woke insurance is what you need if you're a white man because I'm reading the paper

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.600
and everything that's wrong with this country is my fault.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.240
How am I going to pay for all of this?

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.100
I need woke insurance.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:06.160
And we're at a point where that sort of humor isn't necessarily farcical any longer.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.400
He's going to fit right in and stand up.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400
Wow.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400
Wow.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400
Listen.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.400
Listen.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.940
He's not funny and he is a bitter white dude.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.040
He's going to go straight to the top.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.040
Or at least straight to every single open mic I've ever been to in my entire life.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.040
Yeah.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.680
Then the bitterness is going to keep on growing.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.480
Oh, it's never going to stop.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.480
Wow.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.480
It's never going to stop.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.480
I don't know.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.400
I feel like if I were interviewing my lawyer and they decided to get into racist, hacky

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.760
standup, I might be considering a change in representation.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.760
Yeah.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.760
Yeah.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.760
Yeah.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.760
Yeah.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.760
Yeah.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.020
I guess I'm going to call Saul Goodman from here on out.

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.020
Better.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.020
This is not good.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.020
This is not good.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.020
No.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.020
Don't tell me.

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:52.020
Don't tell me that you started doing it.

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.400
I don't want anyone to tell me they started doing standup.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400
No.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.960
Especially not Norm fucking Pattis.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.160
Definitely not Norm Pattis.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.160
Not a good bit.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160
Oh yeah.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
Are there problems?

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160
Yeah.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160
Yeah.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160
I would go with the structure.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.080
So if you're buying woke insurance, let's explore this.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.080
Okay.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080
Let's do this.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080
So let's say you're a woke insurance agent.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.080
Right.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.080
Right.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080
Right.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080
I'm a door to door woke insurance salesman.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080
Right.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080
So you come to my door.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.080
You're white.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080
Right.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.080
Okay.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080
So I need woke insurance.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080
Right.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.080
What does this protect me from?

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.720
It protects you from if people are rioting.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.200
So flood insurance.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.200
Sure.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:36.200
That is like, okay, so if my house floods, this money that I pay when it doesn't flood,

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:41.920
so whenever it does flood, if it does flood, then you can have money to fix my flooded

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.920
house.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920
Sure.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920
Sure.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920
So woke insurance, it's got to be something where you pay.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920
Totally.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.920
That's what's happening.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920
I agree with you.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920
I don't know.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.920
Scream the N word at people.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.920
Now.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.920
Now.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.920
Now.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.200
That doesn't protect you from that.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.320
It only protects you from the racial reckoning, dad.

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.360
So if a racial reckoning occurs, you're going to want woke insurance.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360
Okay.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.640
So you're immune from this quote unquote racial reckoning if you've paid your dues to your

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640
woke insurance.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.820
Of course.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.860
Why would we have woke insurance?

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.860
What do you think this is?

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.360
Some sort of scam?

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.480
I don't understand what it's for.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.960
You're a white man and you need it.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.240
That's all I need to tell you.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:26.760
The world is changing, Dan, without this woke insurance, you could be left in the dust.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.800
I think a better way to tell this bit if the way that Norm wants to do it would be something

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.600
like a protection racket.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.860
You know, it's not insurance.

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.560
It's insurance, like the mob kind of insurance, right?

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.560
Sure.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.000
I mean, isn't that like more the vibe he's trying to give?

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.240
Hey, you don't buy this insurance.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.680
We're going to say that you said the N-word in public.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.120
If you don't pay your woke dues, they'll come and get you or something like that.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.040
Isn't that more the bit he's trying to do?

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.080
It would make sense because it does seem like it's-

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.640
I don't understand what woke insurance is and his conception of it.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.000
I mean, I think it protects you from being dog piled on for being a racist is essentially

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
what he's saying.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
How?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.680
Well, if you get dog piled on for being racist, there's a potential loss of income or of course

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.120
a potential gain of income.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.720
I mean, how does the insurance work?

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.040
You pay money a month and then whenever you get dog piled on for being the racist piece

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040
of shit you are-

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.640
The insurance company comes around and is like, oh, he's cool.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.760
We'll be like, hey, no, hey, no.

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.840
This guy gets a free rental car.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.840
We cover those.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.960
And then, but no, they have to, the insurance company would have to be like, it's cool.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:29.960
It's cool.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.960
Stop the dog pile or whatever.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.960
Sure.

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:32.960
Well, we can't do that.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.280
But then that implies, or it has to imply that the people who are doing the dog piling-

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280
Right.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.720
That's the work for the insurance company.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:47.040
If you haven't discovered this yet, the Woke Insurance Company runs the world.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.040
Yeah.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040
Yeah.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.400
This bit could use some work.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400
Probably.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.240
His delivery could use some work.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.240
Yes.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.280
Telling people a standup joke outside of the context of a comedy club is a bad idea.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.280
It is.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.280
Yeah.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.960
So Norm goes on from bad standup bits to biblical analogies.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960
Now I heard you say before the break-

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.960
Sounds like my standup.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.120
I asked your listeners to go to the Gospel of John chapter five.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.200
And that's the story of the sick man at Bethesda.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.620
Jesus went to the fountain.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.560
There was a man laying beside the fountain.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.560
He was ill.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.560
Should have had fountain insurance.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.080
When the waters would rise, they had healing power.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.320
He was begging for somebody to move him so that he could be touched by the water.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.960
And Jesus said, why are you here?

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.380
I want to be into the waters, he said, but every time the waters move, others beat me

01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.380
there.

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.420
Jesus looked at the man and he didn't create an affirmative action plan.

01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:37.080
He didn't create a program for a racial or disabled reckoning.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:41.800
He looked at the man and said words that I don't think we say often enough to one another.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.760
Pick up your bed and walk.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.920
And the man did.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.920
He had the power within himself to take care of his own situation, as I believe we all

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.920
do.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.720
So my view is the next time somebody asks you for something on account of their skin

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.720
color, tell them.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.640
I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:03.880
I am almost glad that he got cut off by the break and we don't know what he suggested

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.880
you tell people.

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:05.880
Yeah.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880
Yeah.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:07.880
That's, that's good.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:15.720
So when you are a lawyer, you do realize that other people do not have the capacity within

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.600
themselves to defeat the law.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.920
Does that make sense?

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.400
Take your bed and walk.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:27.840
I feel like that's, you are abdicating any and all personal responsibility.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.600
Go ahead and take your bed and walk.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:36.480
I also, I just don't see Jesus seeing a man who can't walk and thinking this requires

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.040
a top-down structural change.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.280
I think the whole point of Jesus was the bottom-up kind of stuff.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.040
Also wasn't the whole thing about Jesus is that he did miracles?

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.040
Isn't it, isn't it?

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.040
No, no, no.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.040
It was the water.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.680
But, but like people got healed by touching him and stuff.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.680
Sure, sure.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.680
That did happen periodically.

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.240
Well, he coated himself in the water.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240
Okay.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.600
He was always covered in water.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.320
He was, it's left out of the Bible, but Jesus was a very wet man.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:10.280
I would say that basically what Norm is doing here is using a biblical story to get the

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.040
message across to people to stop complaining.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.600
Hey, you know what?

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:22.120
I think if you ever see, if I saw a slave, Dan, obviously I would go up to the slave

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:26.400
and they would be like, Hey, we need some structural changes here because I'm a slave

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.600
and that's wrong.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.080
I would look at him and I would say, get your bed and move.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080
See?

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.000
Everybody has it within themselves to solve their own problems, Dan.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.440
There's no doubt about that.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:41.280
Take your stick and get the fuck out, is what Jesus said.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:46.120
So we have one more clip here from the time that Norm is on and Alex is talking about

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.600
a story about Patrisse Cullors, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.080
Apparently some attention has come to the fact that she's bought some houses recently

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.680
and Alex has this to say.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:01.680
Well, I mean, now the Black Lives Matter lady that their own people are calling for investigation

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.000
looks like embezzled tens of millions, 10.6 million given to Black Lives Matter causes

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
last year.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.440
She's calling it white supremism to investigate her.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.760
I mean, no, you moved into all white neighborhoods.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.760
You have a private airfield.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:18.680
Turns out you've got like six houses, tens of millions of dollars.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.420
And then she says it's white supremacy.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:24.520
If she's so afraid of white supremacy, why are all her houses in the most white neighborhoods

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.680
I've ever heard of?

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.000
Because she's trying to recolonize the continent that was stolen from Native Americans and

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
to disconfit her neighbors by showing that we're here and we matter.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Wow.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Oh boy.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:46.680
Kind of feels like Alex's question answered itself.

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:51.560
Segregation now, segregation forever is what you might as well have just said.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.040
He's kind of saying like, if this person's so worried about white supremacy, why don't

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.940
they just leave our all white neighborhoods alone?

01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.680
That does seem like nuts.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:03.760
It does seem like the point he's trying to make is if you're worried about white supremacy,

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.080
you should leave our country.

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:12.520
So Patrisse Cullors released a statement on Instagram about this sort of questioning of

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.520
her money.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.520
Sure.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.320
And you know, she said that she has a number of different careers and revenue sources,

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.600
but they quote, I do not receive a salary or benefits from Black Lives Matter Global

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.260
Network Foundation.

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:26.840
She didn't say that investigating her or questioning her is white supremacy.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.960
She did say, quote, this effort to discredit and harass me and my family is not new, nor

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.220
is it acceptable.

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:35.880
It's taken away from where the focus should be, ending white supremacy.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.000
And that's been twisted by Alex to saying like, it's white supremacy to investigate

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
me.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Sure.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.480
So Norm takes off and I think that was one of his worst appearances.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.080
And that was one of the most blatantly racist things I've heard Norm say.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.080
Yeah.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:00.720
I mean the standup bit alone is graceful and that's like maybe third on the list of problems.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.400
So Alex comes back and he decides he's going to take matters into his own hands about this

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.000
whole thing, about the non-releasing of the name of the cop.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Yeah.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.620
See, if he wasn't such a, such a bad lawyer, I would say Norm Pata should be there for

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.620
that part.

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.620
No, no.

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:17.620
Norm had to get out of there.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:18.620
Yeah.

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:22.880
And I think it's our moral responsibility to release the name as best we know, the man

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.880
is a capitalist officer.

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880
Oh, that's not good.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.880
Don't do that.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.880
If he's not the officer that did it, that's fine.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880
Don't say it as best we know.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880
They can contact us and let us know.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.560
But it came out, you know, that the internet believed they knew who it was and the name

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.560
and the information.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:34.560
That's not good.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:37.960
And so I believe the public has a right to know not to go after this officer.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:38.960
Uh, yeah.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.960
Okay.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:40.960
I believe that.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.960
Yeah.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:42.960
Yeah.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.800
I would say that generally speaking, if you just have a hunch that somebody is the person

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.520
of interest in this case, don't report that.

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.520
Here's what happens a lot.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.740
Whenever somebody reports the name of somebody accused of murder and says, as best we know,

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:00.740
this is the person.

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:01.740
Right.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:05.480
A lot of the times it's not the person and you really fucked up their lives.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480
Yeah.

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.120
It's something that you can't really take back.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.120
Never.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:15.880
You can't really predict what the audience's response to your shitty reporting will be.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880
Totally.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.840
You don't know what you expect people to do.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.160
Even if you are correct, you're like, I don't want anyone to go after this person.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.720
What else could people do?

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.720
Yeah.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.240
Why would you give them the name?

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.240
Yeah.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.240
I don't understand.

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.400
I look, the people have a right to know exactly the person.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.240
I totally don't want you to target.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.520
I am however, giving you the name.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.960
I'm strangely enough, I'm going to read off the address as well, but I don't want people

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.560
to bother this person at all.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.860
I am getting a sense that Alex is pissed off that he is not being oppressed like his buddy

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.860
Sam is.

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:50.860
Yeah.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:51.860
Yeah.

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:56.220
And so he's going to throw a wild curve ball and try and dock somebody and see if it gets

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:59.240
him in trouble so he can be the real victim.

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.240
Yup.

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:04.660
And also he wants to be clear, this is just because he believes that the capital officer

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.660
is black.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.660
Okay.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:07.660
Yeah.

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:08.660
That makes sense.

01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:09.660
That makes sense.

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:10.660
He takes careful aim and kills her.

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:11.660
Okay.

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:12.660
That's what he did.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:16.000
And the grand jury didn't indict him, so whatever.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.680
All I know is we know every white cop that kills a black person's name, but when a black

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.680
person kills a white person, we don't hear about it because the media wants to act like

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:29.120
it's only white people killing black people.

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.600
And that's not true.

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.360
Holy shit.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:38.420
I would say like the most impure of motives are being expressed here in terms of Alex

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.480
wanting to say this person's name.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.480
Openly.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480
Openly.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.480
Openly.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.720
That's, that's one of those things where it's like, you can not say things.

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.720
Yes.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:53.320
And you can, you can, you can not say this person's name because you can't prove that

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.440
it is the right person.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.040
Which makes it a very bad idea to single them out.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:02.120
Second, you cannot say on air that you're really just pissed off on a race issue.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.120
Yes.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.120
Your white aggrievement is, is...

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.360
I don't know why people call me racist.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.440
Anyways, I expect different treatment for black people.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.440
Jesus.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.280
Anyway, it gets racist more, I guess.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:19.560
So when a white police officer or Hispanic police officer shoots a white person, a black

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:25.400
person, a whatever person, it's instantly on the news every time.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:31.520
But when a black man shoots a white man or a white woman, it's never on the news because

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.880
only whites do bad things.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.880
You've heard we're evil.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.000
So our intent exposing this is not to say black people are inherently bad or that what

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.560
one black person does reflects on others.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.240
It's just, we're going to be fair here.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:48.200
We're not, listen, we're not saying insert the only reason we would be saying this.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:50.120
We're not saying it because of that.

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:55.200
We're definitely not saying it because of insert the only reason anyone could say this.

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.080
That's not why we're saying this.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.080
It's outrageous.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.760
No, we're not saying it because of this.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.520
The only possible reason we could have for saying this.

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.160
We're saying it for a different reason.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:07.480
Now, all right, look, I think Alex wants attention.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:13.360
He wants this to blow up, get him in a little bit of trouble, but he doesn't want that much

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.360
trouble.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360
So he has a fall guy.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.800
He's never met Sam before in his life.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.000
He has a fall guy and it happens to be the guy who was in the Capitol with Sam.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
It was not.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.600
Get the fuck out.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:24.600
Tyler Hansen.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.600
Jesus Christ.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.280
Tyler Hansen has been a pretty good investigative journalist over the years and he's been on

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:34.000
the show before and he and others say they have the identity of Ashley Babbitt's shooter,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.800
which in the three plus months, the feds never released and now they cleared the police officer

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.960
without saying his name of it.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:41.960
You don't normally see that.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:42.960
Do you?

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.960
Like some citizens shoot somebody in their backyard.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.680
Later, you hear they were indicted or they were cleared, but you heard their name day

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680
one.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.720
So is he in the new royalty?

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.480
Sometimes you don't.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.120
Sometimes names aren't released.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.240
You know, I don't know.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:05.000
I think that the sound of a whooshing, fast moving vehicle that meant to carry a bunch

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.400
of people that Tyler should be hearing right now, because it's coming and Alex is throwing

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.400
you the fuck under it.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.400
Not good.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.400
Not good.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.400
Nope.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.060
In case Alex gets in any trouble, don't worry, I'm just repeating what Tyler Hansen told

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.060
me.

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.060
Yeah.

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:22.060
Okay.

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:25.720
So Hansen also the guy who burned a Black Lives Matter flag with Owen Troyer the night

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.720
before January 6th.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.200
He's a very good investigative journalism.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.200
Cool guy.

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.480
Well, no, Alex said he's pretty good.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.480
Pretty good.

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.480
Pretty good.

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.480
He's a pretty good investor.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.480
That's faint praise.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:40.640
I mean, it's kind of so fucked up that it's like, if I have to explain to you the difference

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:49.520
between a cop running down and chasing a child and shooting them or fucking choking a man

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:58.400
to death versus a mob of people storming the fucking Capitol building, trying to tear down

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:04.320
the walls, running with people with fucking guns and goddamn everything.

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:09.200
If you can't see the difference between that type of shooting and not, there's no point

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.200
in talking.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.840
No, you're being intentionally obtuse if you don't.

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:17.760
There's just no way for me to communicate with you if you don't see the difference.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:25.320
And, again, assuming that the person who was the police officer in the Capitol was black,

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:32.040
trying to pretend that the relevant difference between those two issues is a racial one is

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.040
absurd.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.040
Yes.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.040
That is...

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.040
Absolutely absurd.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:39.480
But it's what employers would want to do, because it helps with the white-agreement

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.940
narratives that are the fuel that the machine runs on.

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:49.040
So Alex is going to name this guy, and I want to leave it in just because I looked into

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:54.900
it and you can find it being like, it all goes back to Tyler Hansen, but he tweeted

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:59.240
it out and it's out there, it's public, so it's not like...

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:04.080
If it were something that I couldn't really find easily, I might bleep it just because

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.840
I don't want to add to this, but just for the sake of demonstrating that Alex is completely

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:17.800
and unconfidently not knowing at all if he's correct naming someone as a shooter here.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:18.800
Not good.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.040
Now, maybe he's not the officer, but for months his name has been known, so if he's not the

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.840
officer, let us know, or we're going to do a foyer, I assure you.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.840
A foyer?

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.280
I've asked my lawyer to do it.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280
Foyer.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280
You've asked your lawyer to foyer?

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.120
Because we have a right as the press, a right to know.

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:38.940
The identity of Ashley Babbitt's shooter is Lieutenant Michael Leroy Byrd, says Taylor

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.600
Hansen on Twitter.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.240
So again, throwing Tyler Hansen under that bus.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:48.400
Hey, Hansen said this name that I'm not saying for any of those insert reason...

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:56.360
I have a way larger platform than Tyler Hansen, and I am going to rely on his reporting, but

01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:01.280
I'm also going to say that maybe it's not the guy, and hey, if it's not him, maybe he

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:05.720
could call in and correct me about it, because that's the responsibility of the people that

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.280
you accuse of things.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280
Totally.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:11.800
Look, we're just asking questions, and if these people would come forward and tell us

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.800
the answers, we wouldn't need to ask any more questions.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.480
This is definitely not something we're saying in bad faith.

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.480
You've never heard this before.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:23.880
Not once in your life have you heard us say something similar to this in bad faith.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.880
Right.

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:28.360
This is like Alex claiming that Bill Gates is in the Council of 12 or whatever, because

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.800
he said it on air and Bill Gates hasn't corrected him.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800
Totally.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.800
If he wasn't in the Council of 12, he would have called into my show.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.040
I would have been incredibly deferential towards him because he's powerful and I am a coward.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.560
This is not how shit works, man.

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:47.520
I like the idea that he does call a FOIA a FOIA, which is fine, whatever, it's his accent.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.680
His lawyer's getting a FOIA.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:50.680
Whatever.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:56.760
So he understands that that's something that you might be able to do in this case, because

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:01.920
the investigation has closed, and so there may not be a legitimate law enforcement reason

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.800
to not release the name of the person, and you might be able to get that with a FOIA

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.800
request.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800
Possible.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.200
Now, if you do that, you could report the name.

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.200
Exactly.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:19.160
You can't do this and then be like, hey, if he's not the person, he should tell us, meanwhile

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.160
the damage has been done by me saying that it is the person, and also eventually we'll

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.400
do a FOIA request that we're never going to do.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:35.000
We'll absolutely confirm this later on with a FOIA request, something that we do so often,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.040
I pronounce it correctly.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:41.800
So Alex, like I said, it's just too clear that his entire premise here is that he's

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.600
just mad that the white cop's name got revealed.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:51.680
Again, they won't say his name, his reported name, but again, we do know Kim Potter's name,

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.880
and she's had to evacuate her house and the police station's been burned down, but that's

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.600
okay because she's a white devil and she deserves it.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.280
So there you go.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:06.240
I mean, it's just too obvious that what is animating this and what's motivating him to

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.560
behave in the ways he is.

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:14.080
Even without that motive, this behavior is unacceptable.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:22.220
But having this kind of a reckless, irresponsible behavior going on while it's being so obviously

01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:33.280
motivated by feelings of white identity, insecurity, and victimhood, it's just multiple layers

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280
of unacceptable.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:37.000
I can't believe he's this transparent.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.880
Yeah, I mean, but it is kind of a truth that if you cling to whiteness, eventually that's

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.280
the only thing you're going to have left.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:50.520
Like clinging to the color of your skin as something important is going to push everybody

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.640
out of your life eventually.

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.880
Or it's only going to unite you with other people who are clinging to whiteness.

01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.160
And until you find a difference between you.

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.160
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:04.400
Until it's time to shut them out for not being white enough for...

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.720
Right, wrong color hair, something.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.520
Wrong religion, whatever you want.

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:09.520
Yeah.

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.480
I mean, I think in many ways it comes down to just having a mentality that is so entirely

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.860
based on exclusion is going to exclude.

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:21.240
And it's going to just, it's going to go that way.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.240
That's how it works.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.240
Yeah.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:29.820
So now at this point, Alex goes to Owen Troyer, who's down by the border trying to get more

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:32.800
footage of stopping smugglers, I guess.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.520
That's where I would want to be.

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:40.360
I would want to be near the US Mexico border if I was Owen Troyer, just in case.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:46.040
Just like, oh, I'll take a little step over here and now I'm not in trouble, no border.

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.040
Come and get me.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.040
Yeah.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.040
Come on.

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.040
Suck it Biden.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.240
You want to get to extradite me for this?

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.240
Come on.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.200
So yeah, I didn't care for any of that.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.280
I'm not going to play this dance.

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.280
No.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.440
And I got really mad.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.320
I got really mad at Alex.

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.480
One, because of how disgusting this display has been for most of this episode.

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.480
Absolutely.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.760
But then second, because here's a clip from the first hour that I got really excited about

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.320
and he just fucking teased me.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.080
And then separately, I'm mixing it into my stacks and I can't find it because I was about

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.080
to hit it.

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:25.280
Will you guys get me the new John Hopkins cyber collapse document that Jamie White wrote?

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:31.200
I've got the document, but I can't find, always on the bottom I did find it.

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:37.520
Cyber polygon 2021 globalist run simulation of coming cyber pandemic to prepare for economic

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.520
reset.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.520
This is the blueprint.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.560
I'll tell you, John Hopkins is like the main horse in the fight now against this.

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.320
All the globalists do their tests, their drills, they agree at committee what they're going

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.320
to do.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.640
And it's given to these academics and business people and top scientists and in the top of

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:55.160
their fields, academia, banking, computer science, weapons, psychology, psychology.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.960
Then they launched the attack.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.320
I'm going to be hitting that as well.

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.440
I've got to hit that.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.680
You got to hit it.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680
You have to hit that.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.680
You got to.

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.920
You literally have to hit that.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:05.920
And then he didn't.

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.480
That's the most important story I've ever heard.

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.000
Cyber polygon 2021.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.480
Cyber polygon 2021.

01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.480
I got to know.

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.480
It's so great.

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.480
The great reset is happening and it's through the cyber polygon 2021.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.960
So I found the documents and everything, and then Alex never brought it up.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.320
So I don't get to talk about it.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320
Damn it.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320
Anyway.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.320
Look, someday soon.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:28.280
Look, it's yeah, we will talk about it once he talks about it.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.280
We'll get there.

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:31.280
The thing that I struggled with is like, I got really excited.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.800
There's primary documents here.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:37.000
It is actually something that interesting maybe we could talk about, but I'm not going

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.280
to debunk things Alex doesn't even get to.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.280
Yeah, that's not fair.

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.280
No.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.280
That's not fair.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.280
You can't pre bunk things.

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:46.160
I don't actually even know what his angle is outside of that vague nonsense.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:47.160
Exactly.

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.480
Anyway, once he talks about cyber polygon, I'll be very excited.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.480
We'll get to it.

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.480
We'll get to it.

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.480
I have a lot to say about it.

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.680
It's good that you've got it in the can though.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:59.780
You know, it's always good to be one step ahead of, uh, of the roadrunner.

01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:05.200
It's unsatisfying though, cause you know, I'm listening to this bullshit about Sam.

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.200
Sure.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.200
Sure.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.860
And then Alex and Norm getting racist as hell and I'm like, at least I've got cyber polygon

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:14.200
to look forward to and then it just doesn't happen.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.200
Oh man.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.200
Bullshit.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:22.120
I, I'm telling you, I think second string Sam should have been on the second string

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.080
for this episode.

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.560
Should have been cyber polygon 2021 all day.

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:30.720
If I were Alex, I might've spent more time on that than trying to make Sam's arrest about

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.720
himself.

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:32.720
Yeah, that would be smart.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.200
But narcissists got to do what they got to do.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.400
It does seem like it.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.280
Um, so yeah, I think that, I think this is, um, you know, one of the first times that

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:44.120
we've had an active Infowars employee get arrested and so that's kind of interesting

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:47.120
and that was one of the reasons why I was like, we gotta, we gotta get into this.

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.680
Well, Millie Weaver got arrested, but she was, I think that was unrelated.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.920
No, it was totally unrelated.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:58.160
And she was not, uh, she was an independent contractor, honestly, never met her before

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.160
in my life.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.160
Yeah.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160
And she, she was fired pretty quick.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160
Yeah, very quick.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.200
Um, and then like Joe Biggs got arrested, but he's a former employee.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.200
Sure.

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200
That's true.

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:10.640
Um, Roger Stone, but you know, he's, he's Roger Stone.

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.640
He's Roger Stone.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.160
I guess a lot of them have been arrested.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:15.160
Wow.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.160
All right.

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:22.080
I like how felons can't vote, but they can work at Infowars.

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.080
Yep.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:28.000
So, uh, Jordan, we'll be back, uh, with another episode, hopefully covering Cyber Polygon.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.240
Yeah, no kidding.

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.600
We got something to do.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.760
We got to do something with that.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:35.400
Yeah, that's going to be my big tease from now on eventually we'll get to Cyber Polygon.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.440
And we're going to hit Cyber Polygon 2021.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.320
Um, but until then we have a website, Jordan.

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320
We do have a website.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.320
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.320
Yes.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.320
We're also on Twitter.

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.320
We are on Twitter.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.320
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.320
Go to bed, Jordan.

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.320
We're also on Facebook.

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.320
We are on Facebook.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:51.800
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.200
doing God's work right now.

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.360
Uh, we'll be back, but until then I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:00.960
Jordan, I place you under arrest for loud utterances.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960
Andy in Kansas.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.960
You're on the air.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:03.960
Thanks for holding.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.360
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:07.360
I'm a huge fan.

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:08.360
I love your work.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:38.320
Thank you for being with us today, and we'll see you next time.
