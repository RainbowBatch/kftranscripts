1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying, we are the bad guys.

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:50,860
Thank you.

3
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:58,480
It's time to pray.

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,320
I love you.

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,120
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm Dan.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,780
I'm Jordan.

8
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,620
We're a couple dudes.

9
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,460
Like to sit around, drink novelty beverages,

10
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,560
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
Oh, indeed we are.

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,160
Mr. Freezin'.

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Holmes.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
Mr. Freezin'.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
Mr. Holmes.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,520
What's your bright spot today?

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,080
My bright spot today is granola, baby.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,840
Ooh, what's that say?

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,920
Lure Crunch?

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,080
This is Love Crunch.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Love Crunch.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,760
Founded at the store.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,680
This is espresso vanilla cream.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,500
Granola.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,340
Oh my God.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,520
What do you have to have to name your business Love Crunch?

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,600
Jordan, this is so good.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,780
It's inspired by the Italian affogato,

29
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,620
which is made with espresso and ice cream.

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,460
Oh, okay.

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,700
It's very good.

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,540
It's nice.

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,880
I'm trying to, I had like this period,

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,240
I think I talked about it in some previous bright spots,

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,000
where I was going for these bizarre ass cereals,

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,600
you know, like the fruity pebbles with marshmallows.

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,440
Oh yes.

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,160
We, the Dunkin' Donuts.

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,000
The coffee Dunkin' Donuts ones.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
That's gonna happen, yeah.

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,420
And I'm trying to get back onto a more like,

42
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,920
all right, I've indulged my inner child a little bit here.

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Sure, sure.

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,420
And even this, I'll admit, this is, I mean,

45
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,560
it's an espresso vanilla cream situation.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,720
So it's not like it's the hardest core granola,

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,960
but I'm working in that direction.

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,480
I feel like my breakfast could be better served.

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm glad it's based on an Italian something

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,080
as opposed to affogato.

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,640
Cause it sounds a little bit like a song

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,960
a hair metal band would have released in the eighties.

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,840
You know, like, love crunch, love, love crunch.

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
Isn't that Nazareth, love hurts?

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,960
Could be, could be, something along those lines.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,800
So what's your bright spot?

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
Oh, my bright spot, Dan.

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm assuming some people have found out by now.

59
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
We were in the New York Times.

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,600
How fun is that?

61
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,440
That's nice.

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Super bizarre.

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,100
That's fun.

64
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,800
If I hadn't like been aware that this was coming,

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,600
I would be like, this is, I can't, I.

66
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,440
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,260
It's very bizarre.

68
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,100
No, this is.

69
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,940
Very bizarre, thank you to.

70
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,260
It's fun, it's fun, it's silly, all right.

71
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,040
So Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over.

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
We're going to be talking about April 16th, 2021.

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,960
Blackjack.

74
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,120
Ah, shit.

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,680
This is Friday's episode of Alex's show.

76
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,520
Okay.

77
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,500
And you know, it's not, it's not great.

78
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,280
It's not, it may not be the most groundbreaking of episodes.

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Sure, sure.

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,680
But there are a couple of things that happened

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,040
that are breathtaking.

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,880
Okay.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
That are amazing.

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
All right.

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
And a good teachable moment.

86
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
So. Okay, good.

87
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
We'll get down to business on that here in a second.

88
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,720
But before we do, let's take a little moment

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
to say thank you to some folks who have signed up

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
and are supporting the show.

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Oh, that's great.

92
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,260
So first, the Reverend Dr. Sorrow.

93
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,100
Thank you so much.

94
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,560
You are now a policy wonk.

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm a policy wonk.

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,120
Thank you very much, RDS.

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,960
Thank you.

98
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Next, 1776 was a false flag.

99
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
The British are the globalists.

100
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
Thank you so much.

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
You are now a policy wonk.

102
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,040
I'm a policy wonk.

103
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,240
Thank you very much.

104
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,600
Thought-provoking.

105
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,400
I think Alex might agree with half of that.

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,960
I think he might have said that.

107
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah.

108
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
Borderline, yeah.

109
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,480
Then a couple of technocrat shout-outs

110
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,080
to throw out William V.

111
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,900
Thank you so much.

112
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,200
You are now a technocrat and Thomas C. Thank you so much.

113
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,760
You are now a technocrat.

114
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,920
I'm a policy wonk.

115
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,720
Crikey, mate.

116
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,680
That's fantastic.

117
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,040
Have yourself a brew.

118
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,640
How's your 401k doing, bro?

119
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,200
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

120
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,520
Let's just get down to business.

121
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,600
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

122
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,540
Why are you pimps so good?

123
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,320
My neck is freakishly large.

124
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,800
I declare info war on you.

125
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,520
Thank you, Willie, and thank you, Tomas.

126
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

127
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,400
So Jordan, I had to cut the wonk shout-outs a little bit short

128
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,440
on this episode because we have another little bit of business

129
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
that we have to get to.

130
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,200
It's very important.

131
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,880
Of course.

132
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,680
And that is that tomorrow, Tuesday, is 4-20.

133
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,180
Right.

134
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,200
And that means that it is the official end

135
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,360
of the year of the Seltzer.

136
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,960
That's true.

137
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
It is the official end of the year of the Seltzer.

138
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,600
Where did we wind up?

139
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,120
You got 3-50, right?

140
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
Yeah, right around 3-50.

141
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,480
That's great.

142
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,440
For people who maybe have found the podcast more recently,

143
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
last year, around 4-20.

144
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,600
You've got lore to catch up on.

145
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,920
I decided that I was going to drink 500 Seltzers in that year.

146
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,360
It was kind of something just to put a smile on our face

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,040
because it seemed like there was going to be this period where

148
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,280
there was the COVID.

149
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,440
I didn't think it was going to go as long as it did.

150
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,400
I did not either.

151
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,520
I just kind of thought like, yeah,

152
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,800
this will be a way to kill some time.

153
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,360
I'll drink a bunch of La Croix and all

154
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,640
these weird flavors of things.

155
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,280
And look, a year's too long for a novelty goof.

156
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,400
It was very much an emotional rollercoaster ride

157
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,280
because it started off as a goof.

158
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,840
Then a few weeks later...

159
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,160
It started off as a goof with a lot of energy behind it.

160
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,960
That's true.

161
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,840
No, well, a few weeks later, what I'm saying

162
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,920
is you got into it.

163
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,600
And all of a sudden, it started being a lot of Seltzers

164
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,480
just popping up all over the place.

165
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
And then, what was it?

166
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,360
Probably about six months ago.

167
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
I got a hot tip on a Seltzer.

168
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,640
We got to go to the south side to find it.

169
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,240
It was about six months ago that your enthusiasm

170
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,960
dropped down, and then there was a little bounce back.

171
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,320
It was like the stock market.

172
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,960
It dropped farther, there's a little bounce back,

173
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,880
and then it's gone.

174
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,040
Well, I can say that a big part of it

175
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,200
is the difficulties involved with COVID.

176
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,920
And then some personal life stuff kind of

177
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,800
disenchanted me a lot over a period of months.

178
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,320
And look, a lot of Seltzers are not very different.

179
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Yeah, I think you could make it to a year and 500

180
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,240
if you were on a Japanese game show where

181
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,320
you had to live in a place where there's nothing

182
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
but Seltzers for a year.

183
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,240
If someone brought me all of the Seltzers,

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
and I was like, sip it, and they're like, oh, 50.

185
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Who gives a shit?

186
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,480
Like, in those circumstances, I definitely

187
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,360
could have tried 50.

188
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,960
But after you try so many, it's like, I don't know.

189
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,560
This is fine.

190
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
It sucks, but it's not that bad.

191
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
It's not great.

192
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
You really lose the enthusiasm to hunt

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,760
down new Seltzers.

194
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,520
And once you've already had everything

195
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,480
that's at every store within a couple miles of your house,

196
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,280
and you can't find anything else on Amazon,

197
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,520
it just becomes a real stu-

198
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,200
I mean, it was a stupid idea from the beginning.

199
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
No, but I mean, you know, all of our ideas

200
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,040
are somewhat stupid.

201
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,880
Yeah, and I'm glad I tried.

202
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,520
I learned a few things.

203
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,560
One is the wide, wide world of these Seltzers.

204
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,720
There's so many.

205
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
And the ones that are more tea-like are better, I think.

206
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,080
I enjoy them more.

207
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,120
They have more depth of flavor.

208
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,320
And so, hooray.

209
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,040
And in honor of ending the Year of the Seltzer,

210
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,360
I'm ending it with my novelty beverage for today,

211
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,680
which is a listener, Amani, sent some Sunwink

212
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,240
Sparkle Herbal Tonics.

213
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,320
And I've tried the one that is, I believe, turmeric-related.

214
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,440
And that one was all right.

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,200
It's got a little spice to it.

216
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,760
Is it turmeric or turmeric?

217
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,120
I think it's pronounced turmeric,

218
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,200
but there is an R in there.

219
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
That infuriates me.

220
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,360
Yeah, it might be a silent R.

221
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,440
We can continue.

222
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,080
So this is Sunwink Lemon Rose Uplift.

223
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,560
I feel like now is a good time for some uplifting.

224
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,920
No, Lemon Rose, taking a sip.

225
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I noticed you playing around with that bottle

226
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,600
before the show.

227
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,720
And normally, you have a bit of an energy drink going on there.

228
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,120
And how did you do?

229
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
It was really good.

230
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,600
It was really good?

231
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:57,920
Yeah.

232
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,440
Nice.

233
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,400
Yeah, that's very tea-like.

234
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,840
It's reminiscent of those ones that had flour.

235
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,960
I mean, I guess rose is the flour.

237
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,080
Well, that would make sense.

238
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, good.

239
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
Those were real good.

240
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,240
Yeah.

241
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,360
So thank you, Imani.

242
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,000
And thank you, everybody who has enjoyed

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,520
the year of the seltzer.

244
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,720
I don't know if I'm going to do a year of anything else

245
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,280
ever again.

246
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,760
I doubt it.

247
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,520
I learned a valuable lesson.

248
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,640
There's definitely that.

249
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,720
It's humiliating.

250
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,280
Think of it.

251
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,080
You got to round 350 seltzers.

252
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,080
If you had set your goal for 300 seltzers,

253
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
you wouldn't have made 350.

254
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,160
500 was such an attractive number, though.

255
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,640
It's a nice round number.

256
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Yeah, I mean, look, I achieved something.

257
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,160
Indeed.

258
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,280
Maybe?

259
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,680
Probably.

260
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,920
Let the viewer decide.

261
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,760
Sure.

262
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,200
Anyway, Jordan, today, April 16th.

263
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,280
Indeed.

264
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,600
Ides of March.

265
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,800
I'm still writing June on my checks.

266
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,440
So here we go.

267
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
We're going to start off with Alex

268
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,960
talking about some headlines.

269
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,880
And then getting into something that is very bad news for us,

270
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,040
as you know, we are the chat guys.

271
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,640
Now, they denied all of this in mainline publications

272
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,720
until a few years ago.

273
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,280
And now they run the same headline every week.

274
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:15,080
For the first time, animal human clones have been made.

275
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,200
That's always, it's in the test tube, it's embryonic.

276
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,680
And that's just a condition, condition, condition,

277
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,600
condition.

278
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,680
The CIA was quoted in the Washington Post back in 1999

279
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
that, oh, we're funding the body modification and tattoo

280
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
and earring movement.

281
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,520
Doesn't mean it's bad or good or anything.

282
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,440
All the things you said, all the things you said.

283
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
To get you ready for implantable chips.

284
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,920
I mean, this is all actually in different publications.

285
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,040
They admit all of this.

286
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,480
Yep, the CIA encouraged everyone to get earrings and tattoos.

287
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
It's really weird for the CIA to finally start admitting stuff

288
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,400
and choose the stuff that I guess

289
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
would take them down the most.

290
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,520
Yeah.

291
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,160
But, you know, what are you going to do?

292
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,960
Yeah, I don't know about this.

293
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,320
Also, so the latest news in the animal human hybrid front

294
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,040
is that there was an article published in the journal Cell,

295
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,000
where researchers injected human stem cells into monkey embryos,

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,040
which then they observed growing.

297
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,640
Three of the embryos survived up to 19 days,

298
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,720
but they didn't create clones or anything like Alex is saying.

299
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,480
This is a field of study, but it's not

300
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,640
what Alex is describing.

301
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,200
And the scientific community is far

302
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,760
from reaching a consensus on it.

303
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,960
There are tons of debates that go on about the ethics

304
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,600
or even the need for such research.

305
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,840
And you can find people who have informed opinions on both sides.

306
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,880
Alex is not one of them.

307
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,400
Yeah, but, you know, once I saw that you could transfer

308
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,320
the bioluminescence trait to another creature,

309
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,840
I was like, well, get rid of all other research.

310
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,760
Until I can glow in the dark, all science should stop.

311
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,400
Until everything.

312
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,480
Until everything can glow in the dark.

313
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
My buddy Dr. Gums used to get furious with me,

314
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,920
because I would constantly demand

315
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,560
for him to explain to me why we can't photosynthesize.

316
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,400
Like, why can't we get a human that has photosynthesis?

317
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,800
I would like to know that.

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
I feel like we should.

319
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,680
I really think he had a compelling, full answer,

320
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,200
and I was too high to remember what it was.

321
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,240
Well, of course.

322
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,440
I don't remember.

323
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,400
Considering you've heard it many times, too.

324
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,160
Yeah.

325
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,480
So this story, you know, the whole thing

326
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,640
about the human-animal hybrids and stuff,

327
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,960
this is something that people like to take as an example

328
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,440
of actually, Alex, he's right all along, man.

329
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,800
But the important thing to remember is that his version

330
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,160
of this research, it doesn't match what actually exists.

331
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,080
The stories that he tells are different than reality.

332
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,800
Just remember, we were talking about fish-human hybrids

333
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,760
in tanks with sad human eyes.

334
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,320
Exactly.

335
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,440
That's the kind of stuff that Alex talks about.

336
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,600
And he claims that he's seen them.

337
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,560
He's pinned to the tanks.

339
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
We're not talking about injecting embryos.

340
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,280
We're talking about full-grown fish men wandering

341
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,640
around our seas.

342
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,280
Yeah.

343
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,920
It's very attractive for people to take headlines and then

344
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,280
sort of out-of-context snippets of things Alex said,

345
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,400
and he's like, yeah, he's been right all along.

346
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,160
Showed you.

347
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
It's not really accurate.

348
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
It's a fun game, though, and I applaud people for playing it.

349
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,400
So if you want to be someone who plays this game that Alex

350
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
is right about everything, I have bad news.

351
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,040
We will all be dead soon.

352
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,880
Oh, no.

353
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,840
There is a scientific global dictatorship

354
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,880
that is breaking away from humanity,

355
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,320
and that as it breaks away, it extracts

356
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,160
all the resources of the old civilization,

357
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,680
poisons us, dumbs us down, divides us, and conquers us,

358
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,440
puts us back into the jungle, the urban jungle,

359
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,040
and then wipes us out.

360
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,400
We've got fun and games.

361
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,520
And by the time that they finally wiped everybody out,

362
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,080
which is coming very soon, in a cascade of crises

363
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,160
they orchestrate but pose as the saviors, those of us

364
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,720
that haven't joined them, it'll be very hard pressed for us

365
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,640
to survive without joining them.

366
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,320
And those of us that haven't joined them

367
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,320
will still only survive because the global has killed everybody.

368
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,880
So we're not on their side, but if you're

369
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,840
able to make the right moves and be prepared,

370
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,440
you might be able to survive and not join them.

371
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,440
But I think God isn't going to like that.

372
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,040
God doesn't like cowards, so I think it's just surviving.

373
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,320
We have to stop this thing from happening.

374
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
This is very weird.

375
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,600
Well, I mean, it seems strange for him

376
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,120
to say that God wouldn't like that,

377
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,480
considering the most popular Christian book

378
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
series ever written was about the small number of survivors

379
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
who made it through the evil apocalypse.

380
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,280
Yeah, that was globalist shit, though, man.

381
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,160
OK, well, that's fair.

382
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,600
Kirk Cameron's a globalist.

383
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,320
My bad.

384
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,920
My bad.

385
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,440
Nope, I fucked it up.

386
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, it's an interesting version

387
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
of Alex's fear narratives.

388
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,200
It's like, OK, so a kill-off event is about to happen very

389
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,560
soon.

390
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,080
Naturally.

391
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,280
Because the globalists are taking over

392
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,040
and the blah, blah, blah.

393
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,720
Any moment now.

394
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,960
So it's coming up almost immediately,

395
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,400
and you are probably going to die.

396
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,440
But if you make the right moves, there's

397
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,000
a way that you can survive.

398
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Now, some of the right moves that are the wrong moves

399
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,720
are joining with the globalists.

400
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,160
Of course.

401
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,680
That's bad.

402
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,360
But you could survive if you did that.

403
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,840
Even though, why would you, since everybody you've ever

404
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,360
known and cared for is dead?

405
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,920
I don't know.

406
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,480
Fair enough.

407
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,800
But you cannot join the globalists and still

408
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,360
survive if you get really lucky and do all the right moves,

409
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,520
but God will be mad.

410
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,800
But then you're going to hell.

411
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
God's going to be mad.

412
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,640
So you can die in the apocalypse,

413
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,080
or you can survive it for a little while with no one

414
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,760
you've ever met.

415
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,640
But either way, you're going to hell.

416
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,400
But I guess that this implies that there

417
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,040
is a fourth, fifth option, and that

418
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,360
is fighting to stop this.

419
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
Somehow stopping it, yeah.

420
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,440
But it doesn't matter.

421
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
The globalists have a plan B. Alex

422
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
has already explained that.

423
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,880
Yeah, it doesn't seem to be a good fight at this point.

424
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
No, this is really dumb.

425
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,160
So I think that there are jobs in the world that have

426
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,560
more staying power for people.

427
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,320
Careers.

428
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,600
Sure, if you're in a career that takes a long time to master,

429
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,680
let's say, maybe there's a lower turnover

430
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,440
than some unskilled professions maybe

431
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,040
have higher turnover rates.

432
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
Comedian, high turnover rate.

433
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,400
Quite.

434
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Very high turnover rate.

435
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,680
Although it should be higher.

436
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,520
Much, much higher.

437
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,840
What do you think about the high ranking globalists?

438
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,040
What's their turnover rate?

439
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,600
Yeah, what do you think about that?

440
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,320
Oh my god.

441
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,120
It has to be, here's what I think.

442
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,040
I think it's got to be like the Politburo level of like.

443
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,880
It's got to be zero.

444
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,920
Backstabbing, no, no, no.

445
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,760
Backstabbing murder all the time.

446
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,000
You're wrong.

447
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
And I can tell you the globalists have major turnover

448
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,560
with their higher level people.

449
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,280
Because they really understand, even once they have all

450
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,880
the money and the power, that it's empty.

451
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,360
And if they haven't totally turned their souls over.

452
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,560
They get to keep all the money and power?

453
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,080
They then turn against it.

454
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,120
But then those people don't have a voice.

455
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,840
They get shut down or they get killed.

456
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh, OK.

457
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,320
That's convenient.

458
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,880
So the globalists and the high ranking levels,

459
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,080
they constantly have crises.

460
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
Right, they have crises of conscience

461
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,080
and realize, nah, fuck this noise.

462
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,040
Alex is right.

463
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,760
So they quit, but then they get killed.

464
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
So what are you going to do?

465
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,200
Hey, it's as everybody knows from watching our government

466
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,920
function, obviously the people who run the world

467
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,400
have consciences that they've been to at all times.

468
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,160
I don't know if I can think of any examples of anybody

469
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,360
that Alex has ever discussed who was a high ranking globalist,

470
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,640
who turned on the globalists, and then got killed.

471
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,480
Although, again, it's a fun story.

472
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,960
It is a fun story.

473
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,520
And it does explain why there aren't

474
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,680
defectors of the globalists.

475
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Sure, sure, they're dead.

476
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Except for, I guess, Leo Zagami, which maybe he should be dead.

477
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,440
Right.

478
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,280
If this makes sense.

479
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,360
I don't know, Mike Lindell got rich and powerful.

480
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,720
So he's probably turned against the globalists.

481
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
I bet he was a high ranking globalist for a while.

482
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,360
He had to have been, right?

483
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,920
I don't know.

484
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,600
Otherwise you can't get money and power.

485
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,720
His point is you can only get money and power

486
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,960
if you join with the globalists.

487
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,160
Or I guess if you sell supplements.

488
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,800
Or pillows.

489
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,640
Yeah.

490
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't think Mike Lindell's with the globalists.

491
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,600
I doubt it.

492
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,120
No.

493
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,840
No.

494
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,560
Also, the topic of Alex's employee

495
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,320
who got arrested at the Capitol does come back up a little bit.

496
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,000
OK.

497
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,480
My pillow storyline is not brought back up.

498
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,160
No longer brought up.

499
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,960
It might still be there, but it's not front and center.

500
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,600
So here's the thing.

501
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
These globalists who have high turnover rates

502
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,560
and then end up having to kill the former employees,

503
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,320
they're only going to kill you if certain conditions are met.

504
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,680
That's nice.

505
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,360
If you've ever worked for the New World Order

506
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,120
and never signed the contracts with them

507
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,320
and ever actually run their operations,

508
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,400
then they will kill you if you sidestep them

509
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,160
or don't follow their orders or ever try to leave them.

510
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,600
But if you've never sold out to them, it's metaphysical rules.

511
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,680
They'll just try to get other people to kill you,

512
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,520
but they won't give the order themselves.

513
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,360
Or they will try to kill your name or discredit you

514
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,560
or put you in prison.

515
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,520
But they don't often kill you unless you've

516
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,760
been involved with them and made some deal with them

517
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,960
at some level.

518
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,360
And that's why I've never made any deals with these guys.

519
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,480
That's a protective instinct on his part.

520
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
I.

521
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,880
Yep.

522
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
So yeah, you've got to make deals

523
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
or else there's going to be some kind

524
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,560
of an infringing of metaphysical rules that sound really dumb.

525
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,200
I have a lot of problems with this.

526
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,720
Yeah.

527
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,320
If the metaphysical rules that govern the universe

528
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,040
are so dumb that you can ethically sidestep

529
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,880
murder by convincing somebody else to kill somebody,

530
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,320
and then you have a totally clean slate,

531
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,720
I don't think that these rules are good.

532
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,440
I think that they're ungrounded.

533
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Give me a second.

534
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,960
Are you telling me that Mark Richards

535
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,760
is innocent of all crimes according

536
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,200
to the metaphysical rules of the universe?

537
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,040
I think there might be a flaw in this metaphysical rule.

538
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,760
You bet.

539
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,080
Yeah, I think there could be.

540
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,000
Yep.

541
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,080
I don't know what I feel about this other than any time

542
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,720
he brings up these metaphysical rule ideas, I just,

543
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,560
I want to know more.

544
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,840
I want him to actually get into the ethical underpinnings

545
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,640
of this and really break down what must be

546
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
true within this ethical system.

547
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,480
Oh no, if he were capable, the one thing

548
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,000
that I want from him is a full accounting

549
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,680
of his metaphysics beliefs.

550
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,240
It's just brought out whenever things are convenient.

551
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Yeah, I want a book of him like codify,

552
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,840
I want Alex Jones' version of the Bible.

553
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
That's what I want.

554
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,360
I don't.

555
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Oh wow, that's fair.

556
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,080
I definitely don't.

557
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,680
That's fair.

558
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,840
That's fair.

559
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,640
All caps.

560
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,520
So Alex has all these ideas about how

561
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,760
the news about human-animal hybrids and stuff,

562
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,560
it's not what they're saying.

563
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,240
Of course not.

564
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,680
It's not that there were human stem cells and embryos.

565
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,360
No, fish people.

566
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,320
No, no, no, no.

567
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,880
Fish people in the oceans.

568
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,680
Technology is 50 years ahead of where it actually

569
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,720
is, all this stuff.

570
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,480
And you know what?

571
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,560
You know who thinks they know what's up but don't?

572
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,240
The globalists?

573
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,880
Fucking military intelligence.

574
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, those idiots.

575
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,520
People talk about army intelligence

576
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,960
or the military intelligence.

577
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,800
They don't know any of this.

578
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,520
That's an oxymoron, am I right?

579
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
This cute stuff at the highest level

580
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
is military intelligence.

581
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,160
That's totally compartmentalized to archaic weapons.

582
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,320
Atomic weapons are 120 years old.

583
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,360
They had all the equations 120 plus years ago.

584
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,440
That's all tinker toy stuff.

585
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,880
That's all that's being phased out.

586
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,320
They're getting rid of the human military.

587
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,200
By 2030, there really won't be very many humans

588
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,680
left in the military.

589
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,840
And they have all these Hollywood movies

590
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,880
about super soldiers, these really cool bad ass guys.

591
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
And you know, like the new movie, Nobody.

592
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,760
You know, he's so tough.

593
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,640
None of that exists.

594
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,320
It's all gone.

595
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,040
It's all over.

596
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,760
It's all robots.

597
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
It's all clones.

598
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,480
It's all robots and clones in the future.

599
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,240
It's all robots and clones in the future.

600
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,680
Fun.

601
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,600
All right.

602
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,040
So I guess you saw Bob Oden, Kirk, and nobody.

603
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,560
Yeah.

604
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,360
So that's nice.

605
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,960
It's a good movie.

606
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,560
I bet it is.

607
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,120
It's a good movie.

608
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,640
I think Bob Oden, Kirk has a lot of range that's been unexplored.

609
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,760
And I'm excited for him.

610
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,440
He's incredibly great.

611
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,280
I think, you know, it's kind of an interesting dilemma.

612
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,320
Because you do see the possibility of a future

613
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,400
where a lot of warfare is done by way of robots.

614
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,080
Sure, of course.

615
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,400
You know, drones certainly are a big problem.

616
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Yeah, we're already there to a smaller extent.

617
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
But if things escalate towards the point

618
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,160
where actual troops are robots, then eventually you're

619
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,840
going to get to a point where a negotiation between countries

620
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,160
that is robots fighting robots is really

621
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,680
just a financial thing.

622
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,040
It's like, I'm destroying more of your property,

623
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,920
which is robots.

624
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

625
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,720
No, it's.

626
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,640
And then it almost has a potential to be like, well,

627
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,120
we could negotiate through this easier than fighting.

628
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,880
So I don't know.

629
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
I haven't fully thought it through.

630
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,520
But it's an interesting thing.

631
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,120
It almost seems like it would lead to a vast reduction

632
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,720
in war.

633
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,080
Well, I mean, I think there have been

634
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,240
a lot of really interesting, because that's something

635
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
that I've read about.

636
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,400
That's one of those things that futurists

637
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
have been describing since Kurt Vonnegut,

638
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,960
like that kind of stuff.

639
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
And there's a lot of people who are like,

640
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,880
war doesn't mean anything if there aren't people dying.

641
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,200
So you can't really do it.

642
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,600
You know, it would be like a video game at that point.

643
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,560
It's just like, are you better at video games?

644
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,120
I have 100 more robots than you, so mathematically I

645
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,040
win before we even fight.

646
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,360
Yeah.

647
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,280
Yeah, I guess it doesn't relate to robot drones and stuff

648
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,160
like bombing apartment buildings or something.

649
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,640
Exactly.

650
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,480
It doesn't relate to that, my thought.

651
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,200
There's still a devastating human toll

652
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,040
associated with that.

653
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,680
Yeah, I don't know.

654
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't know about the clones part.

655
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What would clones be doing in this scenario?

656
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,400
I don't know.

657
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,640
Have you seen the prequels, the Star Wars prequels?

658
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,840
I mean, yeah, but ultimately clones are not as good in war.

659
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,280
You know, if you're going to build.

660
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
Seems like a massive investment if you're

661
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
going to use them for warfare.

662
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,120
No, it's like, look, but here's the thing.

663
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,880
If you're building robots, you know,

664
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,320
we're not thinking about AT-ATs, because those are stupid.

665
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,440
They're giant lumbering moron machines.

666
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,200
I have bad news.

667
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,360
I am thinking about AT-ATs.

668
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,240
Small, small, quick mobility, all of these things.

669
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,280
Human beings don't stand a chance against those.

670
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,960
Those terrifying things you see videos of every now and again.

671
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,200
Yep.

673
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,840
Yep.

674
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,520
So Alex has some complaints about the pope.

675
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,040
Sure.

676
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,560
Pope Francis, those full communists

677
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,360
are sharing prosperity is not communism,

678
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,680
but pure Christianity.

679
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,560
But they're going to direct how you share.

680
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,920
And of course, all the big bankers pay no tax,

681
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,320
but they'll lecture you all day.

682
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,080
No idea what the bankers have to do with the pope's opinions.

683
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,960
I mean, I guess they don't pay taxes at the Vatican either.

684
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,480
Also, I have great news for Alex.

685
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,000
What's that?

686
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
The pope was arrested a year ago.

687
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,000
He was.

688
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,120
According to Steve Pajetnik.

689
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,240
He's been gone for a while.

690
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,320
This is the fake pope that Alex is complaining about now.

691
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,000
Don't worry about what this pope is saying.

692
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,160
This is a puppet.

693
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,040
Francis is behind jail bars.

694
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,600
Naturally.

695
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080
So Alex gets to talk in here a little bit

696
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
about the old COVID vaccines.

697
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,680
Sure.

698
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,320
And I think he says something that I

699
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,160
find flagrantly irresponsible.

700
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,600
You've got all these countries that

701
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,560
have stopped the Pfizer shot, all these companies that

702
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,640
have stopped the AstraZeneca, all these ones that

703
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,440
have stopped J&J. You've got all these deaths, not one death.

704
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,760
They'll go, one woman died.

705
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,560
You actually go look at the reporting system.

706
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,280
It's like 3,000 here, 2,000 there, 5,000 there.

707
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,640
They estimate between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100.

708
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,480
They're not sure.

709
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,200
It varies.

710
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,960
Country to country are actually reporting the deaths as COVID.

711
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,160
But it is COVID vaccine killing them.

712
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,200
This is a gigantic unsupported claim that Alex is making.

713
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
If he has some kind of evidence that the COVID vaccines are

714
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,360
responsible for a high number of deaths

715
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,000
that are being called COVID-19 deaths,

716
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,240
then he can't just assert it and wave

717
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,080
his hand to some vague unspecified statistics that

718
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,040
varies from country to country.

719
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,960
He knows that he can't back this claim up,

720
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
which is why even what he's saying

721
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,640
is a meaningless nonsense assertion.

722
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,600
The difference between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 is huge.

723
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,040
That's an irresponsible spectrum to be pointing to.

724
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,480
It might be a little bit.

725
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,800
Anyway, I'm going to need to see the sources on this.

726
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,760
And until I do, I'm going to go out on a limb

727
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,720
and assume it's his dumb imagination, as usual.

728
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,760
It's either 10% or 1,000% more.

729
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,640
No idea which.

730
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,880
Could be anything, honestly.

731
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,240
So on our last episode, we got a meeting

732
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,080
of the minds between Alex and fresh, hot on the scene

733
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,560
comedian Norm Paddis, lawyer.

734
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,840
He's finally breaking out of this law game

735
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,760
to pursue his real passion of stand-up comedy.

736
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,200
He's not even going to be able to be the funniest lawyer,

737
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,360
because every comedy scene already has that.

738
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,080
We've already got a funniest lawyer in Chicago, at least.

739
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,560
So not to be outdone by the shit-headery of Norm

740
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,520
coming on, Alex's other lawyer buddy, Barnes,

741
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,760
is going to be on this episode.

742
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,240
Oh, yeah.

743
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,840
You can't have Paddis on without Barnes being like,

744
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,360
you got to book me soon.

745
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Yeah, so he's got to come on.

746
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,680
And this is where Alex teases that they're

747
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,080
going to talk about how the Chauvin trial is nonsense.

748
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,440
No.

749
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,040
Coming up today, Robert Barnes is

750
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,000
going to be looking at the insane Chauvin trial

751
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
up in Minnesota.

752
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
And when he thinks that's going to end, and no doubt,

753
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,760
every major city is going to be lit up like a Christmas tree.

754
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,320
And they're not the type you put cookies and milk out

755
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,520
for Santa for.

756
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
It's going to be lit up with fire.

757
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,360
And why are the communists doing this?

758
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,400
It's part of the takeover of the police.

759
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,360
They're not getting rid of the police.

760
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,960
They are bullying them using any bad event that happens.

761
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Oh, my god, we've had three days of riots.

762
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,920
And a guy, an armed robbery suspect for robbing a woman,

763
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,080
waving guns around everywhere, is then attacking the police.

764
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,200
And in the melee, the cop pulls the wrong weapon

765
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,920
and shoots him.

766
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,480
What do you think happens when you go into riots

767
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
and high-speed car chases?

768
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,240
But now, you see, we've got to have more riots for that trial.

769
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,280
We've got to have more.

770
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,600
It just goes on and on.

771
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,680
But if you're a good globalist police department,

772
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,440
if you do everything the New World Order says

773
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,960
and arrest their political enemies,

774
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
become commissars under strong cities initiative

775
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,360
that Obama launched, directly directed by the UN,

776
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,280
well, then you're in like Flynn.

777
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
So that's coming up.

778
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,680
Separately, ladies and gentlemen, where is it?

779
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,360
Here it is.

780
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,040
This is your last three-day chance

781
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,720
to get the really highest quality liquid multivitamin

782
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,680
mineral system with amino acids as well.

783
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,680
There's going to be riots and fires all over the city.

784
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,200
Got it.

785
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,800
Add pivot.

786
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,840
Yep.

787
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,360
Fun.

788
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
You know, you work people up about, hey,

789
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,760
this ain't the fun Christmas tree with cookies and milk.

790
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,400
And separately, let me get these vitamins.

791
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,960
Hey, listen, don't turn around, Dan.

792
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
Der Kommisar is in town.

793
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:44,840
Uh-oh.

794
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,920
Yeah, we're in trouble.

795
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,440
So Alex has a story that he hits on a number of times

796
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,240
throughout the show, and that is that Maxine Waters apparently

797
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,800
told Jim Jordan to shut his mouth

798
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,840
seated in the chambers.

799
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,640
It's a very un-congressional language.

800
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,880
I would have preferred she beat the shit out of him

801
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,760
with a cane, because we've got one.

802
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,480
There is a precedent to that happening, I guess.

803
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,600
OK, I think there's an even, look, we've got one.

804
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,400
You get to beat an anti-abolitionist

805
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,360
to borderline to death in Congress.

806
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,200
That's the rule.

807
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,920
I think Alex might have the wrong angle on this.

808
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,880
Uh-oh.

809
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,480
Let me do this.

810
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,160
I want to get into this Jim Jordan thing,

811
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,160
and Maxine Waters telling him shut up.

812
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,480
In fact, let's go to the end first.

813
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,080
Let's go to her telling him to shut up.

814
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,320
And imagine if a white guy was telling a black lady shut up.

815
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,240
That's like half of Alex's show.

816
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,320
Yeah, I was going to say, you are always

817
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,600
telling black women to shut up.

818
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
It's the most important thing to you.

819
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,680
Yeah, any time there's some kind of social justice-related

820
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,800
activism, it tells people to shut up.

821
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,080
Just shut up, yeah, yeah, just shut up.

822
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,760
Can you imagine if there was some sort of football

823
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,000
player who was blackballed from the league for speaking out

824
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,160
very obvious truths that seem so obvious that no one should

825
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,840
be even borderline punished for them?

826
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,600
Imagine if a white guy told that guy to shut up.

827
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,800
People would be furious.

828
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,840
We're going to get some flagrantly racist stuff

829
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,200
about Kaepernick a little bit later.

830
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,080
Of course we are.

831
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,960
Why wouldn't we?

832
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,680
Why wouldn't we?

833
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,320
It's funny you should bring him up as an example.

834
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
While we're here.

835
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,400
So back to COVID matters.

836
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,440
Here's Alex saying some dumb shit.

837
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,400
And even a year ago, they admitted 94% of COVID deaths

838
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,320
were something else.

839
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,620
It's the same thing in England.

840
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,280
It's the same scam everywhere, because it was never

841
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,880
really COVID, folks.

842
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,640
It was pneumonia or the flu.

843
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,080
So in 6%, it was an actual virus.

844
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,600
In 94%, it was heart attack or cancer.

845
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:47,440
But the hospitals coded as COVID to get the $53,000.

846
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,400
So this is just Alex misrepresenting

847
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,960
how there was a figure that came out where it was like 6%

848
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,200
of COVID-19 deaths didn't involve a person who

849
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,760
had an underlying condition that might

850
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,880
have contributed to the death.

851
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,400
Sure, sure, sure.

852
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,440
Considering that things like obesity or smoking

853
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,000
could be underlying conditions, this isn't surprising.

854
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,360
Alex and his ilk have just used that stat incorrectly

855
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,880
for a year to argue that the death numbers are artificial.

856
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,520
Right.

857
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,040
Now, I was thinking about this.

858
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,640
And that idea that the hospitals are in on a get-rich-quick

859
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,120
scheme because there's a certain amount that they get paid out

860
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,720
by Medicare, Medicaid, based on COVID-19 patients.

861
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,680
Yeah, that tremendously stupid idea about that, yeah.

862
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,480
I was just thinking about it, and does Alex

863
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,440
think that those hospitals don't get payments

864
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,320
for other conditions?

865
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,600
Does he think that someone getting,

866
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,960
like if they have an aggressive cancer that they need

867
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,200
treatment, does he think that these programs don't also

868
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,840
pay out?

869
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,040
What you're not understanding, and I

870
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,560
don't know if you've been to a hospital in a while,

871
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,840
they pay everything on a flat $100 fee.

872
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,200
So if you've got cancer, you're taking all kinds of stuff

873
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,840
and they pay $100 for it.

874
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,400
It's been a while since I've been to a hospital,

875
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,560
and admittedly, I don't have cancer.

876
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,360
They switched it.

877
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,400
It's super weird, but it's $100 for everything but COVID.

878
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,040
Yeah, it's one of these days I'm actually

879
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,400
going to sit down and try and figure out

880
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,360
like what other payouts are.

881
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,280
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,960
So you're like, all right, here we go.

883
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Let's do this.

884
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,320
But that may be needed for another day,

885
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,360
because today we're going to get in to Operation Cyber Polygon.

886
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,200
Ooh, now you're excited.

887
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,320
I'm also lying.

888
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,560
He doesn't bring it up at all.

889
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,920
God damn it, Dan!

890
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,120
You son of a bitch.

891
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,240
No, no, Alex doesn't bring up.

892
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,360
You always have to then, like when you're excited

893
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,280
and you get a letdown, you have to just pass it on to me.

894
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,240
Yeah, it is a little bit mean of me,

895
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,320
and maybe I just want you to feel that disappointment.

896
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,760
Yeah, no, no, no.

897
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,800
We got to share in it.

898
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,480
We're a team.

899
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,200
We're partners.

900
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,840
We got to share in that disappointment.

901
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,680
So instead of getting into that, Alex just

902
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,440
complains about things he imagined

903
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,720
that Anthony Fauci said.

904
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,400
Sure.

905
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,480
You can play the clips.

906
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,240
Once you're vaccinated, you can go out and not wear a mask

907
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,080
and go to restaurants.

908
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,200
That's Fauci.

909
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,640
That's what they all said worldwide.

910
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,720
Oh, sorry, doesn't work, because they've

911
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,440
had you under their control for a year.

912
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,680
They've doubled their wealth.

913
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,960
They're taking over.

914
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,600
They're not going to stop.

915
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,880
They're bad people.

916
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
So this is mostly about defending

917
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,520
Tucker Carlson about attacks that

918
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,560
have been made against him for his segment

919
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,400
that he had where he was talking about like, hey,

920
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
I was told that we could go back to normal

921
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,080
once people were vaccinated.

922
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,840
Oh, OK.

923
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,160
I thought he was talking about the white replacement one.

924
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,840
No, no, no, no.

925
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,000
We've moved on from that?

926
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,240
You can just get white replacement for like a week.

927
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,040
He lets Harrison Smith defend that.

928
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,720
That's fair.

929
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,360
That's fair.

930
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,760
So I think people might have gotten the sense that things

931
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,120
would immediately return to normal

932
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,080
after a vaccine was released, but that's not

933
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,240
what was being said by experts, including Dr. Fauci.

934
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,440
This is a straw man position that the right wing media

935
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,760
types like Alex and Tucker have been using recently

936
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,960
to argue against vaccination while pretending

937
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
that they have some kind of a principled point.

938
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,520
It's basically a child whining that their parent promised

939
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,440
to buy them a pony if they got good grades when

940
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
the parents said no such thing.

941
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,320
Yeah.

942
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,680
In December 2020, Fauci said, quote,

943
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,720
let's say we get 75%, 80% of the population vaccinated.

944
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
If we do that, if we do it efficiently

945
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
through the second quarter of 2021,

946
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,920
by the time we get to the end of the summer, i.e.

947
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,640
the third quarter, we may actually

948
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,800
have enough herd immunity protecting our society

949
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,200
that when we get to the end of 2021,

950
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,400
we can approach very much some degree of normality

951
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,360
that is close to where we were before.

952
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
So that's what he was saying at the end of 2020.

953
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,820
No, at every point in time, they've

954
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,760
said even after you've been vaccinated,

955
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,640
continue to wear a mask, not least of which

956
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,440
to stop the spread, but also just to make it fine for people

957
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,360
to wear masks outside.

958
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,040
In September, Fauci told Healthline, quote,

959
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,960
we can be greatly helped by vaccines,

960
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,840
but it's not vaccine alone.

961
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,480
Let's assume that we get a reasonably effective vaccine,

962
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,720
not measles vaccine where you have a 98% effective.

963
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,480
I think that would be too much to ask for.

964
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,120
But let's talk about 75%, 80% effective vaccine, which

965
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,720
would be really good if we did that.

966
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
If we did that and we ultimately got

967
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,200
everyone who should be and could be vaccinated,

968
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,880
I would think that together with not necessarily abruptly ending

969
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,360
measures like masks and physical distancing,

970
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,320
if we could get the majority of the community

971
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,120
to adopt those health measures together

972
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,000
with a reasonably effective vaccine,

973
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,640
then we could get the level of infection

974
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,560
down so low in the community that by the third quarter

975
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,400
end of 2021, we could start thinking in terms of normal.

976
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,960
Alex and his idiot friends don't live in reality.

977
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,680
They've fabricated a fake one that adheres to the storylines

978
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,040
that they want to tell and that they profit off of.

979
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,600
Alex's story about the vaccine is

980
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,760
that the globalists are trying to force it on everyone.

981
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,800
So it's essential for that story to involve an explicit promise

982
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,320
from the villains of the story that if everything will go back

983
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,400
to normal just as soon as you take my evil vaccine.

984
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,800
That's not the actual messaging that people like Fauci

985
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,960
have been engaging in, but it's how it feels to Alex

986
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,960
because that's the story that he tells for a living.

987
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,280
You can see by the false portrayals.

988
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,320
Yeah.

989
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,080
Silly.

990
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,880
What a dick.

991
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,040
Yeah.

992
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,720
So I think it's important to recognize a few things.

993
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,440
One of them is that I'm willing to address and talk

994
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,920
about like factual issues like, you know,

995
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,680
cyber polygon if you were to bring it up.

996
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,720
Or these other big operational lockstep nonsense.

997
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,640
SPARS.

998
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,320
SPARS, sure.

999
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,160
That was recent.

1000
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,720
Yeah.

1001
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,240
I'm very happy to engage in those things.

1002
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,680
But I will also say that anybody who

1003
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,400
wants to take Alex Jones as someone who

1004
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,560
is a good purveyor of information

1005
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,840
will also have to explain this kind of thing.

1006
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
And I know God's real.

1007
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm going to leave it at that.

1008
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,600
I have always had a connection to God.

1009
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,080
I was born again when I was probably about eight,

1010
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,520
nine years old.

1011
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,200
But I have been having experiences now

1012
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,120
that I'm going to keep private.

1013
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,560
But I'm going to tell you are biblical.

1014
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,080
You hear about the Holy Ghost, the Comforter,

1015
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,240
and all the rest of that.

1016
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,080
I am now routinely having experiences

1017
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,000
that now I would be pleased to be crucified upside down

1018
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,400
or tortured for five years for this.

1019
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,920
OK, I mean, I can just flip a switch in my brain

1020
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,800
now and go right to Valhalla.

1021
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,400
And so I am transcending these Satanists.

1022
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,360
And I am so thankful to God because I've

1023
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,680
been in a lot of pain and really upset over them

1024
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,080
and really taking on and getting very depressed.

1025
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,960
And I just prayed to God the last few months

1026
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,640
to take the worry away.

1027
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,320
And I'll fight harder than ever.

1028
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,280
And I've done that.

1029
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,720
And now I am really now experiencing the Holy Ghost.

1030
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,360
And it is un, oh my, oh, it's so good.

1031
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,200
Wow.

1032
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,760
I mean, we're talking 50 times what I ever experienced.

1033
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,760
Because I mean, you start crying getting near God

1034
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,280
and close to the door.

1035
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,320
But man, I've gone in the door now.

1036
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,520
And I mean, I've, I'll tell you part of it.

1037
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,880
I mean, man, I have these dreams now

1038
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,120
that are just intense ecstasy.

1039
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,680
And I'm in heaven.

1040
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,040
And I, trying to describe the beauty of it

1041
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,520
and the purity of it and the level of this

1042
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,960
is just like you're in God's mind.

1043
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,640
It's all good and well to have like religious beliefs

1044
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,480
and stuff.

1045
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,560
It's not normal to believe that you're

1046
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,160
having visions of being in heaven when you dream.

1047
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,080
Everyone, everyone, I am waking up having just been

1048
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,320
sucked off by an angel.

1049
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
Are you shitting me?

1050
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,640
This is ecstasy.

1051
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,160
I thought women were great.

1052
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
This is lunatic level behavior.

1053
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,520
The Archangel Michael visits me at night and gives me handies.

1054
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,560
I've been in the God's mind.

1055
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,800
It turns out all angels are gay, by the way.

1056
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,480
I think that this is silly.

1057
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,560
And I think this is stupid.

1058
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,400
And anybody who wants to take Alex

1059
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,160
as any kind of sincere good faith actor

1060
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,360
in the sense of like the conversation about ideas,

1061
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,360
let's talk about this being the way he sees himself.

1062
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,640
But even that's kind of, you know, maybe a personal attack

1063
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,440
and what have you.

1064
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,400
Well, all I heard him say was, I am having good dreams lately.

1065
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,880
Sure.

1066
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,600
So that's also, that's nice.

1067
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,680
But he puts so much more import on it than just someone saying,

1068
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,480
I've had good dreams.

1069
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,720
A little bit, a little bit.

1070
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,240
And then the other thing about it

1071
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,160
that I think is much more functional and grounded

1072
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,440
is Alex says at the beginning that he was born again

1073
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,840
at eight or nine when we know that he was a Satanist.

1074
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,360
Yup.

1075
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
To his teens.

1076
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
When you were born again.

1077
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,480
This timeline doesn't work.

1078
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,160
When you were born again, at eight or nine,

1079
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,280
had you already paid for the abortions

1080
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,000
or would that come later?

1081
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,640
Yeah.

1082
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Is this before or after the Satanists tried to lure you

1083
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,040
and you were a functional Satanist until you were 18?

1084
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,560
Listen, I was a Satanist for a while.

1085
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,160
I was born again at eight or nine.

1086
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,520
I was a Satanist.

1087
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,800
Look, if you're not a Satanist when you're young,

1088
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,600
you have no heart.

1089
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,040
The problem with stories like this that are obviously

1090
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,280
fucking artificial and not true and played up

1091
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,320
for the presentation of this, the person

1092
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,520
that Alex wants the people to see him as,

1093
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,000
is you can't keep it straight.

1094
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,320
It just doesn't make sense.

1095
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,800
No.

1096
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,480
This timeline is ridiculous.

1097
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,240
So yeah, he was born again at eight

1098
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
and then went to the devil for a little while

1099
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,720
and then came back.

1100
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,400
I don't know.

1101
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,000
That's why all mythologies wound up in books,

1102
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,160
because they were like, eh, I'm telling you,

1103
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,600
I think Zeus did it this way.

1104
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,520
And somebody else is like, nah, nah, nah, Zeus is crazy, man.

1105
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,040
Yeah.

1106
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,440
Eventually, you've got to put it in a book.

1107
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,880
Otherwise, nobody's going to agree.

1108
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,760
Oral tradition has a way of changing stories

1109
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,640
a little bit over time, because of the different ways

1110
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,440
the different tellers would tell stories.

1111
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,000
You got it.

1112
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,080
So this goes on.

1113
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,600
Alex keeps talking like a deranged lunatic.

1114
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,840
Well, we have different words.

1115
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,640
Well, that's fair.

1116
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,200
And it is just, I mean, last night, man,

1117
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,960
I woke up really upset about 2 AM and everything.

1118
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,640
I'm like really upset about the world and really upset.

1119
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,280
And I said, I said, God, I'm going to pray.

1120
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,440
I'm going to go back to sleep.

1121
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,400
Please, please help me.

1122
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,880
And man, it was just, it was just unbelievable.

1123
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,120
There's no way to describe this.

1124
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,640
And I've never seen any of this in art and literature,

1125
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,920
because a lot of stuff I've seen,

1126
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,720
I've seen in movies and culture.

1127
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,480
Other humans have seen that archetype.

1128
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,440
I'm seeing stuff that has never been seen on this planet.

1129
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,280
And you can say, oh, your mind created that.

1130
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,000
Well, then, wow, that's quite a mind.

1131
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,280
But I'm telling the Satanists, you are missing out.

1132
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,520
You have no idea what you're missing out on.

1133
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,280
I just, it's unbelievable.

1134
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,400
All right, I'm getting metaphysical.

1135
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,280
I'm going to stop right there.

1136
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,080
All I'm saying is I want to stay on air.

1137
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,800
I need the temporal funds to do this.

1138
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,600
And we spend a lot of money running this operation.

1139
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,720
I pay the crew pretty good.

1140
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,880
And I don't want to have to do a lot of things here.

1141
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,600
I don't want to cut back.

1142
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,240
I want to expand.

1143
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,480
So go to mvollwarstor.com.

1144
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,400
That's the end of his long rant about the God giving him

1145
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,760
visions and stuff.

1146
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,560
Satanists have no concept of what it's like.

1147
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,200
So what I'm going to do is immediately

1148
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,480
take the Lord's name in vain and ask for your temporal money.

1149
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,000
I am going to tell you all about how great the Lord is.

1150
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,680
And how I'm special and have visions inside God's eye.

1151
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,320
And when I go to bed, when you go to bed,

1152
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,200
you just maybe have a memory that you replay in your head.

1153
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,640
No, I go to heaven.

1154
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,560
Absolutely.

1155
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,360
And in heaven.

1156
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,240
And I need money.

1157
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,440
And then I come back down and I break commandments left

1158
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,280
and right because I'm so good.

1159
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,160
It's great.

1160
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,600
It's really great.

1161
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,800
Also, I love the idea that he's seen things that

1162
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,720
have never been seen on earth.

1163
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,480
I want to know what those things are.

1164
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,360
That's like a Lovecraftian description of something.

1165
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,360
I enjoy that.

1166
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,880
Art in literature does not contain these archetypes.

1167
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,200
I get what you're saying, but also describe

1168
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,000
what it looked like.

1169
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,880
It does not belong in Euclidean geometry.

1170
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
I imagine if he described what it looked like,

1171
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,320
I could probably find some literature or art.

1172
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,960
Yeah.

1173
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,880
I think he saw an angle that looked acute,

1174
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,280
but acted as if it was obtuse.

1175
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,520
I looked at the standard model, and it turns out

1176
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,440
there are more particles.

1177
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,440
So Alex gets into talking about COVID

1178
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
and how it's a globalist attack, right, of course.

1179
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,280
Sure.

1180
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,800
But one of the things I really appreciate about Alex

1181
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,960
is that he's a man with good priorities.

1182
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,800
And he knows what, like, if you're going down a track

1183
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,960
and something more important comes up,

1184
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,680
kind of got to go for it.

1185
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,800
Italian lawmaker calls for the arrest of creepy Bill Gates

1186
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,360
in charges of crimes against humanity.

1187
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,520
And more and more scientists, more and more lawyers

1188
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,880
are coming out and saying, that's

1189
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,480
what this is, is a medical weaponized globalist takeover.

1190
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,680
And the sooner we rake up the horror

1191
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,160
and that our acquiescence to tyranny

1192
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,440
encourage these monsters to launch this,

1193
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,760
the sooner we're able to stop it.

1194
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,960
That's coming up.

1195
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,080
But Brian Stelter is one of the nastiest people on Earth.

1196
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,320
And he's a liar.

1197
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,800
What?

1198
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,720
He's an anti-American.

1199
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,920
He's a defamer.

1200
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,200
He's somebody that goes around against people deplatformed,

1201
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,600
like myself.

1202
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
He literally stalked 20-plus advertisers

1203
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,520
and ran them off by threatening to do pieces on them

1204
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,760
and call them white supremacists.

1205
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,960
He's a terrorist.

1206
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,640
Sure.

1207
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,280
Sure.

1208
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,800
Sure.

1209
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,200
Economic terrorist.

1210
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,360
And what he is is a sack of garbage

1211
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,800
who acts all powerful and manly.

1212
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,400
He is America's enemy.

1213
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,800
OK, all right.

1214
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,520
Thought we were going to talk about COVID.

1215
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,960
Turns out you're mad at Stelter.

1216
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,360
I do appreciate that, of all people, Brian Stelter

1217
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
is our big bad today.

1218
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,840
You know, it's super weird to me that you

1219
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,120
have such a hatred towards Conor Friedersdorf.

1220
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,720
You complain about him so much less than Alex

1221
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,120
does about Brian Stelter.

1222
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,840
I haven't talked about Friedersdorf in a year.

1223
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,040
That's what I'm saying.

1224
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm Frieders free, OK?

1225
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,520
That's what I do.

1226
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,880
Alex needs to take some cues from you and let it go.

1227
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
Just let it go.

1228
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,680
You don't need to read it.

1229
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,880
You don't need to be so mad at Stelter.

1230
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,960
Although, if you believe Alex, then his anger and hatred

1231
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,000
at Stelter is actually paid some dividends.

1232
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
If anything was ever an enemy of the country,

1233
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,280
it's Brian Stelter.

1234
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,480
And I can tell you, my rant from four years ago,

1235
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,400
calling him enemy of the people, I didn't know this,

1236
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,120
but a certain national talk show hosted others,

1237
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,080
sent it around everybody, and Trump got it,

1238
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,320
I recently learned, and that's where

1239
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,680
enemy of the people came from.

1240
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,600
So I am kind of the unofficial speech writer,

1241
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,200
I guess, at some level for a lot of folks,

1242
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,440
which I'm very honored to do.

1243
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,560
OK.

1244
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,480
So Trump took enemy of the people

1245
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,560
from Alex when he was talking about the press.

1246
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,560
Look, a phrase like that has never

1247
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,840
before been uttered in literature

1248
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,120
or in any kind of art.

1249
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,000
No archetypes.

1250
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,800
Nothing.

1251
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,360
That is brand new, straight from Alex's mouth to Trump's ears.

1252
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,520
I don't believe this, first of all.

1253
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,120
But second of all, if true, not something necessarily

1254
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,040
brag-worthy.

1255
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,440
That's kind of a pretty bad thing.

1256
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,120
No, I gave him a phrase.

1257
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,680
So Alex is complaining here about some stuff.

1258
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,160
Sure.

1259
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,400
And mic down for this, because I actually

1260
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,720
think that this is really hilarious.

1261
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,080
This is one of the funnier things I've heard in a while.

1262
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,640
I know the average man's watching baseball,

1263
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,840
his buddy's eating pizza and drinking beer at a bar tonight.

1264
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
And that sounds great to me, too, OK?

1265
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,040
In fact, if we weren't in so much trouble,

1266
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,680
I'd be buying season tickets to baseball and football

1267
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,520
and the NBA.

1268
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,600
I love it all.

1269
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,560
I like basketball.

1270
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,320
I like boxing.

1271
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,440
I like the Olympics.

1272
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,160
Man, I'd be happier than a pig in you know what if this wasn't.

1273
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,320
But I can't do it, because the whole thing's

1274
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,600
coming down on us.

1275
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,760
So what I'm doing at night is reading the UN documents.

1276
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,080
So here are the reasons I find this hilarious.

1277
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,080
The first is that Alex constantly

1278
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,000
pretends that he hates sports, because it's just

1279
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,480
the media's way of pacifying men's instinct

1280
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,760
towards conflict in battle.

1281
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,320
I was going to say, that blew me away.

1282
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,680
I was like, you hate sports.

1283
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,800
He gives a speech about it every single Super Bowl Sunday.

1284
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,520
Every one.

1285
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,200
It's ridiculous.

1286
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:32,800
Every one.

1287
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,360
The second thing that's really funny

1288
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,320
is how long it took Alex to come up with UN documents.

1289
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,840
What is it that I stay up late reading?

1290
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,160
I am reading.

1291
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,640
Fuck.

1292
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,240
Finally, this is hilarious, because this entire show

1293
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,320
is based on the idea that nothing is ever

1294
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,720
going back to normal.

1295
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,920
And yet here, Alex is decrying how the average man is watching

1296
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,680
sports at a bar with their friends,

1297
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,800
which Alex can't do because he's too busy with UN documents.

1298
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,240
Should the average people he's mad

1299
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,280
at not be able to go to a bar and watch sports

1300
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,800
because of Fauci's dictatorship?

1301
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,320
See, what it is is the government has you.

1302
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,160
They've been keeping you inside for a year,

1303
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,720
and they want to keep you inside for a year.

1304
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,760
Now obviously, everybody's out and about tonight.

1305
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
They have a great time.

1306
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,320
Everybody's having a great old time.

1307
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,080
This might sound kind of like nitpicking,

1308
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,280
but it's really more something that I

1309
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,320
want to use as a demonstration about how deeply

1310
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,480
seated Alex's narcissism is.

1311
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,800
His presentation of himself as a superior person

1312
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,600
because he fights imaginary globalists

1313
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,480
is more important to him than staying consistent

1314
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,960
with his ideas that people can't do normal things like go

1315
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,800
to bars with their friends anymore.

1316
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,040
You see the priorities there.

1317
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,040
Yeah, when anything gets in the way of Alex saying

1318
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,120
he's exceptional, it is out of the way as soon as possible.

1319
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,880
Alex will give up on any narrative

1320
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,520
for telling you how great he is.

1321
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,040
So Tucker Carlson is coming under fire

1322
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,760
from Chelsea Clinton about these vaccine comments.

1323
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,120
And Alex does the whole like, if you're vaccinated,

1324
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,640
why should you care if I get vaccinated routine, which

1325
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,480
is very dumb, but it works on folks.

1326
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,040
So he's doing that.

1327
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,360
He's going through this.

1328
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,440
And then he remembers the George Carlin bit.

1329
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,560
Oh, no.

1330
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,480
And this is one of his suggestions.

1331
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,640
Bring Pattison to deliver it.

1332
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,560
Actually studies it's swimming in swamps

1333
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,640
in the area you live in, and that means in sewage.

1334
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,960
Is that what we think swamp is?

1335
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,440
It's where the bears and the bees

1336
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,640
and the buffalo and the deer and the bobcats and the fish.

1337
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
That's the flora.

1338
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,320
You basically, that's the inoculation is Mother Earth.

1339
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,720
Don't swim in sewage.

1340
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,960
This is not good advice.

1341
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,560
All right.

1342
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,120
This is not revolutionary.

1343
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,680
You should not, instead of getting vaccinated,

1344
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,920
it's not a good idea just to jump in.

1345
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,120
So what you want to do, all right,

1346
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,720
you get this little cocktail.

1347
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,400
You put some Ebola in it.

1348
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,080
You're immune to Ebola.

1349
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,720
Makes sense.

1350
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,360
I shouldn't expect much more from somebody who thinks

1351
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,040
Mike Adams is a good doctor.

1352
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,840
Yeah.

1353
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,040
But yeah, don't jump into sewage tanks.

1354
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,520
No.

1355
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,400
It's not good for you.

1356
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,600
And swamps are an ecosystem, not just a toilet.

1357
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,120
Right.

1358
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,040
There is that as well.

1359
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,800
There's more than just the toilet of swamps.

1360
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,480
Yeah, yeah.

1361
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,320
Swamp thing wasn't poop thing.

1362
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,280
Shit thing.

1363
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,400
So this next clip is a little bit rough.

1364
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,720
It's a little offensive.

1365
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,760
Alex has found a clip from a protest.

1366
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,840
And I don't really know what all the circumstances are in it.

1367
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,920
But from what I can tell from the limited amount of context

1368
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,680
that's in the clip, it appears that some organizer

1369
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,240
at a protest took issue with some

1370
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,000
of the behavior of one of the white participants

1371
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,280
of the protest that was probably not

1372
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,880
in line with what the people who were doing the protest wanted

1373
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,520
to be how things were presented.

1374
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,480
Look, there's a reason people teach you

1375
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,800
how to protest at these things.

1376
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,400
There's a way.

1377
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,800
Yeah, and it can be disrespectful to the larger

1378
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,320
point of the protest if people are working across purposes.

1379
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,520
And that's what it seems like is going on in this video.

1380
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,880
Alex takes this and gets wildly racist.

1381
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,440
I don't hate white people because there's

1382
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,960
some racist white people.

1383
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,640
I don't hate black people because there's

1384
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,320
some racist black people.

1385
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,040
I judge people according to what they do, who they are.

1386
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,200
That's common sense, like Martin Luther King said.

1387
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,920
That's why America believed in what he said,

1388
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,120
because it was true and brotherly love

1389
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,080
that Christ talked about.

1390
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,600
But I have dozens of videos just today

1391
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,440
of whites being shot, stabbed, beat up because they're white,

1392
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,120
told you're not welcome here because you're white.

1393
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:42,560
And the hatred of these young black people's faces

1394
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,920
is palpable.

1395
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,120
But I notice most of the time, and I've

1396
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,800
looked at some studies on this, they're not even Africans,

1397
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,880
but where they're like 100% African.

1398
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,400
Oh my god.

1399
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,680
They're usually mulatto.

1400
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,960
They're usually part white.

1401
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,720
And now we learn, like Kaepernick and others,

1402
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,600
their parents are white liberals and have basically

1403
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,560
done this to them.

1404
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,320
Like, why is it always white skinned black folks that

1405
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,680
are being really anti-white?

1406
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,720
There's some really black folks that are doing this.

1407
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,840
That's because they have white parents.

1408
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,040
They're either adopted or one of the parents

1409
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,000
is white.

1410
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,760
And the left has done this.

1411
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,480
This is their communist revolution

1412
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,840
hidden behind black people so they

1413
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,960
can do this in claimants for black people's empowerment.

1414
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,480
So that's pretty offensive just on the surface level.

1415
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,320
And I don't feel like we need to break down exactly why that's

1416
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,320
incredibly fucked up.

1417
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,640
I mean, if you want me to just scream for about 15 straight

1418
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,360
minutes, yeah.

1419
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,680
I also think that if people who've been listening

1420
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,840
to our show for a while, they'd recognize

1421
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,600
this isn't necessarily an uncommon sentiment for Alex

1422
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,240
to express, despite it being horrible.

1423
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,720
I mean, it's, yeah.

1424
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,960
You know, if this were the first time that we heard him say that,

1425
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,160
well, go back and listen to the first times

1426
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,880
that we've heard him say stuff like that.

1427
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,200
Jordan started barking and dove out my window.

1428
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1429
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,840
So the reason I pulled this clip is because the mentality

1430
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,200
that Alex is espousing, that these people who he's

1431
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,800
determined are not really black enough

1432
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,640
are being used to push a communist agenda

1433
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,720
to attack white people, is exactly,

1434
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,600
and I mean exactly, the argument that his spiritual predecessors

1435
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,520
like Gary Allen made when they opposed

1436
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,640
the civil rights movement.

1437
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,240
Yep.

1438
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,720
Allen's book, Communist Revolution in the Streets,

1439
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,960
lays out this mentality, and it's clear

1440
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,840
that Alex subscribes to this explanation

1441
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,000
of any kind of social justice-related activism.

1442
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,320
That's not interesting on its own.

1443
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,560
Alex is a dumb bigot, but what's fascinating

1444
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,280
is how Alex isn't stupid enough to argue against the civil

1445
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,640
rights movement, because he knows that he couldn't back up

1446
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,320
that kind of claim, and it looks a little bit too transparently

1447
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,840
bigoted through present-day eyes.

1448
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,640
Yeah, that's what I was saying a week ago or whatever,

1449
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:45,400
is like you can measure the same ideology being forced ever

1450
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,480
so slowly to be like, fine, you won on civil rights.

1451
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,680
Fine, we don't get slaves anymore.

1452
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,520
Fine, I'm still going to say the same shit, though.

1453
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm going to do it.

1454
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,600
The book, Communist Revolution in the Streets,

1455
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,120
is mostly an attack on Martin Luther King Jr.

1456
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,080
So forgive me if I think it's a little bit funny for Alex

1457
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,080
to signal some imaginary support for King's ideas

1458
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,680
while using the exact same playbook his heroes used

1459
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,240
to attempt to discredit and demonize King himself

1460
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
while he was alive.

1461
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,000
This is bullshit, but it's important to recognize this.

1462
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,320
When Alex has glimmers like that, there is severe racism,

1463
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,520
but it's also these same ideas that

1464
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,400
have been bubbling under these hard-right forces that

1465
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
were in favor of segregation.

1466
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,200
They were against the entirety of the civil rights movement.

1467
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,240
Yeah, no, absolutely.

1468
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,480
And it's that same mentality that still underpins Alex,

1469
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,640
but he's smart enough to know that he

1470
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,800
would be called some horrible, accurate names

1471
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,680
if he argued like that.

1472
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,000
But even then, it goes all the way back to fucking slavery.

1473
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,760
It goes all the way back to being like, oh, well,

1474
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,760
see, whenever you allow miscegenation,

1475
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,800
the ones who are more white are more likely to cause it.

1476
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,520
And it's just fucking, it's slavery.

1477
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,480
It's the same shit.

1478
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,200
Yeah, there's that sort of influence

1479
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,480
and then this other influence that comes in.

1480
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,360
Yeah, it's all just very, very shocking and horrible.

1481
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,800
Anyway, that's, you know, who Alex is.

1482
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,520
Yeah, yeah, he's shocking and horrible and a bigot.

1483
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,880
It's not necessarily news, but it's

1484
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,600
important to recognize these things when they're here.

1485
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,440
Shocking, horrible bigot.

1486
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,920
Yeah.

1487
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,400
Also, he's been in God's mind.

1488
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:17,880
Yeah.

1489
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1490
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,040
Hey, I wonder if it's all white in God's mind.

1491
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,760
I bet it is.

1492
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,080
I think it might be, Dan.

1493
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,000
So you might notice from watching Alex's show

1494
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,040
that all of his guests are complete lunatics who

1495
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,920
believe mostly the same things he does

1496
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,040
and say, not only that, but Alex, hey, aren't you great?

1497
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,520
And they like to flatter him, yeah.

1498
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,040
Love to.

1499
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,920
Love to flatter him.

1500
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,120
That's how you win.

1501
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,920
And you might think, like, why doesn't he

1502
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,520
have other guests on the show?

1503
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,160
For many reasons.

1504
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,240
Well, I have a lot of great guests on the show.

1505
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,040
We invite communists and globalists on.

1506
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,440
They won't come on, but everybody we have on regularly

1507
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,240
are smart.

1508
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,160
But right up there at the top is Robert Barnes,

1509
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,880
great lawyer.

1510
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,840
Barnes, so smart.

1511
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,720
Yeah, so commies and globalists have

1512
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,320
been invited, but the RSVP comes back not attending.

1513
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,640
Yeah, yeah.

1514
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,200
You know, I believe that.

1515
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,040
I don't know.

1516
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,240
I've been saying good work Barnes very dismissively.

1517
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,000
But now that I know Pat has tried stand up,

1518
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,080
he might be the dumber lawyer at this point.

1519
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,600
Yeah, it's neck and neck.

1520
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,160
Yeah, that's tough.

1521
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,160
Trying stand up comedy really lowers your.

1522
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,840
You know what's interesting is I do

1523
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,480
think that Alex does invite some people on.

1524
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,600
I don't know when lately there's been

1525
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,680
anybody who would be an interesting booking.

1526
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,200
But you know, you have the people like David Rothschild

1527
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,400
or like the weatherman.

1528
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1529
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,800
The moment you ask me for a poll, it's gone.

1530
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,920
I could have pulled it two seconds ago.

1531
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,480
Yeah.

1532
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,160
Bill.

1533
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,960
Bill Ayers.

1534
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,680
Yes.

1535
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,480
Yeah, so there are those interviews that have happened

1536
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,160
and like Alex comes out looking terrible.

1537
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,960
Oh, yeah.

1538
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,160
And so like, yeah, I guess maybe in the past

1539
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,640
he would have put out more feelers for globalists

1540
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,880
and commies in his definitions.

1541
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,080
But they don't go well.

1542
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,080
Those interviews are embarrassing.

1543
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,440
No, and you can't do them now because if somebody comes in

1544
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,880
and he starts getting religious, boy, it's going to get bad.

1545
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,920
Yeah, imagine if you had David Rothschild on now

1546
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,560
and Alex is just screaming about the fucking devil.

1547
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,080
The real fucking devil.

1548
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,600
I mean, Bill Ayers would be like, whoa,

1549
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,600
and then just leave.

1550
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,520
You're a Satanist.

1551
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,480
You're the devil.

1552
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,400
I am with God.

1553
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,880
I've seen his mind.

1554
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,320
Oh, click.

1555
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Wow.

1556
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,200
Yeah, right.

1557
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:37,720
OK.

1558
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,200
So Barnes thinks that the Chauvin trial is a show trial.

1559
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,720
Nice.

1560
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,480
And he has a reason.

1561
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,240
Oh, he's starting to stay.

1562
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,840
Why are you saying this is such a fraud

1563
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,000
and where do you see it going?

1564
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,600
Two parts.

1565
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,560
One is that Chauvin had agreed to plead

1566
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,760
guilty to third degree murder before the trial.

1567
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,280
And so that put him in jail potentially for 20 years.

1568
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,320
And it was Bill Barr who blew it up.

1569
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,560
And so if they were serious about getting an outcome that

1570
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,160
could meet the facts, they already had that in the bag

1571
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,640
and they chose not to.

1572
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,840
So this is very much a Soviet style show trial

1573
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,440
simply because they refused to do a reasonable plea deal.

1574
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,840
And the trial is for public consumption almost entirely.

1575
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,800
So Derek Chauvin had offered to plead guilty

1576
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,960
to third degree murder and William Barr did reject that.

1577
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,720
But the details of the situation aren't

1578
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,480
being captured by super lawyer Robert Barnes.

1579
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,800
One of the primary issues is that according to an ABC News

1580
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,400
article Chauvin, quote, asked to serve his time

1581
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,280
in a federal prison and wanted assurances

1582
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,200
that he wouldn't face federal civil rights charges.

1583
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,280
Because he was asking for federal guarantees,

1584
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,880
the deal needed to be approved by the Department of Justice.

1585
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,680
But Barr, quote, wanted to allow state prosecutors

1586
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,000
to make their own decisions about how to proceed.

1587
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,560
Seems like that state autonomy thing Alex and his buddies

1588
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,960
yell about all the time being put into action.

1589
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,560
Yeah.

1590
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,680
And also Barr being like, I don't want to touch this.

1591
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,840
You guys deal with it.

1592
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,920
Also the fact that Chauvin was willing to plead

1593
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,160
to third degree murder is probably not a great sign.

1594
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,440
No, if you say he's willing to plead to third degree murder,

1595
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,000
wouldn't you want to then defend the murder

1596
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,640
charge instead of being like, the whole trial's

1597
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,400
illegitimate.

1598
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,120
Also the way that he's presenting

1599
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,920
is it's a show trial because they didn't accept

1600
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,000
what is a reasonable plea.

1601
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,980
And that's your determination Barr.

1602
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,480
You have determined that this is what

1603
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,600
would be a reasonable plea.

1604
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,360
That's not necessarily what the prosecution believes

1605
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,480
or the state.

1606
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,680
Yeah, justice doesn't exist unless it's equally applied.

1607
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,000
So that's it.

1608
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,160
So the real issue, though, is that this trial

1609
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,600
is just happening because it's a demonstration

1610
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,200
that the left wants to put on, that they

1611
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,520
can do whatever they want.

1612
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,400
Sure.

1613
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,120
So let me ask this.

1614
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,840
We've got a minute to break.

1615
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,160
What is the left looking for?

1616
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,520
Just rubber stamp what they want?

1617
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,800
I think the left wants him hung.

1618
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,760
The left wants him legally lynched.

1619
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,400
And the left wants to show they can use and weaponize

1620
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,600
the prosecutorial process to validate and vindicate

1621
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,680
their media narratives to help push

1622
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,600
a particular politicized agenda.

1623
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,120
Sure, so like anybody they want burned, they can burn.

1624
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,800
Exactly.

1625
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,720
That's the point, to show this is what we can do.

1626
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Y'all need woke insurance.

1627
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,480
We can do it any time we want, any place we want,

1628
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
even to a police officer.

1629
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,160
I think that there's other issues.

1630
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,160
Like a guy died.

1631
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,960
Well, there's that.

1632
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,860
I don't think it's anyone, any time.

1633
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,480
I think there's specific circumstances that are.

1634
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,440
I would imagine that in this case,

1635
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,880
committing a murder is probably more important for the left.

1636
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,120
Well, I mean, look.

1637
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,680
That he committed a murder, not we want to commit a murder.

1638
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,520
They can burn anybody they want at any point, no big deal.

1639
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,320
As long as you murder somebody, we can burn the shit out of you.

1640
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,900
Anybody who murders, even cops.

1641
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,720
As long as there's a body, they can just jam you up.

1642
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,000
Just lie about how you murdered somebody, you know?

1643
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,160
So, you know, we got on the right, we have a lot of groups,

1644
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,880
people like the Oath Keepers, people like the Proud Boys,

1645
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,840
certainly.

1646
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,520
But Brian Stelter is a terrorist.

1647
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,000
Definitely.

1648
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,760
Yes.

1649
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,340
But you have these groups, and there's

1650
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,400
been pretty well-documented interaction between them

1651
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,520
and law enforcement, some overlap even.

1652
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,880
But Robert Barnes wants you to know that people like Antifa,

1653
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,120
they are actually the Nazi brown shirts.

1654
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,560
That sounds right.

1655
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,800
They want to triangulate BLM Antifa and the FBI

1656
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,380
and use the military on the people.

1657
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,840
Don't they get that will cause an internal civil war

1658
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,600
guaranteed?

1659
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,920
Well, I mean, the real model they're looking at

1660
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,080
is not so much the communist Soviet model,

1661
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,520
but is the fascist model of the 1930s.

1662
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,280
Sure.

1663
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,600
They want to know the long knives.

1664
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,240
They want to, yeah.

1665
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,120
Yep, you have your paramilitary supporters

1666
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,160
that are outside of the governmental structure that

1667
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,160
can do things that you can't do that you can use

1668
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,880
as a pretext and a predicate to do what you want to do.

1669
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,580
You create false flags events, you stage events,

1670
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,480
or you exaggerate events.

1671
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,320
I mean, I mean, the amazing, the January 6 event

1672
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,940
is basically being treated like the Reichstag fire.

1673
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,040
So it's the same, except there was less violence and less

1674
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,720
damage.

1675
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,160
You know who the only person I've

1676
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,440
heard call that the Reichstag fire?

1677
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,600
Fucking Alex Jones.

1678
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,560
Yeah, you would think.

1679
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,600
Alex spent like a week talking about inaccurate information

1680
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,920
about Hitler's rise to power and the Reichstag fire

1681
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,120
and how it was the January 6th storming of the capital.

1682
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,160
They were the same thing.

1683
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,160
Now Barnes is trying to say that the left is doing that.

1684
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,160
That's what the left does.

1685
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:28,880
Fucking nonsense.

1686
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,920
That's what we do, Dan.

1687
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,440
So stupid.

1688
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,920
That's what the left does.

1689
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,040
I just, I have very little patience

1690
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,880
for this direct pretending that that's not his entire strategy.

1691
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,680
Yeah, you know, it is so fucked up

1692
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:48,720
that they apply to us the characteristics that most

1693
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,680
define their thought process and then describe that thought

1694
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,160
process as disgusting.

1695
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,080
So it's like, hey, if they did do what we were doing,

1696
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,840
we would really hate them.

1697
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,840
Because it's evil.

1698
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:08,320
What they're doing that sounds like what we're doing

1699
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,800
and how we think, we'd be pissed.

1700
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,360
Totally.

1701
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,000
If they did the things that we think.

1702
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,640
Now let's interview Stuart Rhodes.

1703
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,280
Let's go ahead and get the people who

1704
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,960
decided to overthrow the capital.

1705
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,560
So you know, there have been some unfortunate things

1706
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,280
that I've seen popping up about the idea of like an America

1707
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,480
First caucus.

1708
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,280
Sure.

1709
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,000
Certainly there's no historical precedent of this being shit.

1710
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,120
Just call yourselves the Know Nothing Party

1711
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,760
and never read history.

1712
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,760
Just do it, fine.

1713
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,120
It's a little much.

1714
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,840
You want a bunch of white men running around rioting

1715
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,880
and oppressing people.

1716
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,840
You're the Know Nothings.

1717
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,320
Let's go.

1718
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,440
It's a little bit frustrating and scary.

1719
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,280
And I hope that it fizzles.

1720
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,520
That would be nice.

1721
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,440
But Alex is on that tip.

1722
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,160
He's on the vanguard of America First.

1723
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,680
Sure.

1724
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,720
He also knows nothing.

1725
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,120
So is Robert Barnes.

1726
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,080
Man, these are America First kind of guys.

1727
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,240
That's what caused Russians in the early 60s to defect to us.

1728
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,920
Because they saw Khrushchev acting like a maniac.

1729
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,880
Our leaders are acting worse than Khrushchev right now.

1730
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,600
By far.

1731
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,960
By a long mile.

1732
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,760
Putin looks completely reasonable compared to the way

1733
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,960
Biden is behaving.

1734
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,000
Putin's not changing his mind every other day.

1735
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,240
He's cutting defense budgets.

1736
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:22,920
As Navalny dies.

1737
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,640
He's asking for Jay time.

1738
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,120
Great.

1739
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:26,760
Exactly.

1740
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,920
Yeah, so they're getting into some pretty serious,

1741
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,520
like, oh, Putin's the best.

1742
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,640
As Navalny is literally starved to death

1743
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:40,560
and his body is falling apart and shutting down in prison,

1744
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,280
the main political rival of President Putin

1745
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,320
is being murdered by President Putin as we speak.

1746
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,400
To be fair, he's been consistent on that front.

1747
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,600
He's really been consistent.

1748
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,720
It's kind of a thing.

1749
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,880
Yeah, America First.

1750
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,360
But also Putin's much better than our leaders.

1751
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,800
Putin's much better than our leaders in America First.

1752
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,320
Yeah, America First.

1753
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,120
And Alex, I would take this more seriously

1754
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,200
and actually discuss some of the issues

1755
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,560
around maybe international relations.

1756
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,520
Sure, sure, sure.

1757
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,720
But I don't feel like Alex's positions deserve the respect

1758
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,480
of being taken seriously.

1759
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,280
I mean, listen to this nonsense.

1760
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,520
And by the way, I don't even respect a lot of generals

1761
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,520
and a lot of top people.

1762
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,480
Some I do, but at least they've been like in 20 tours

1763
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,880
and combat and kill people.

1764
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,000
It's all a bunch of weird Harvard women

1765
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,760
want to have war with Putin because they're

1766
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,080
going to show a man.

1767
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,320
It doesn't even make sense.

1768
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,720
It's insane.

1769
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,560
It's like putting a woman in the ring with Mike Tyson in 1989.

1770
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,560
It's kind of a silly way he's trying to format,

1771
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,680
formulate this thing.

1772
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,360
Or it's like, ah, yes, these women who have feminism

1773
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:49,960
run amuck.

1774
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,520
And that's why they're mad at Putin,

1775
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,080
because he's too much of a man.

1776
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:59,120
Yeah, I despise educated women leading a military.

1777
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,840
What I want is bloodthirsty murderers

1778
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,040
who went over to a different country on a lie

1779
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,560
and killed people for no reason.

1780
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,160
That's who should be running things, Dan.

1781
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,120
Sure, sure.

1782
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,880
And if Alex is going to insist on disseminating

1783
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,160
this kind of an idea, and I found myself

1784
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,360
having a very similar response to a lot of stuff.

1785
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,560
And this episode's a little bit shorter,

1786
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,120
because there's a lot of stuff that I was like, nope.

1787
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,480
Yeah, yeah, that's a big nope.

1788
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,280
And that's one of them.

1789
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,080
That's a big nope.

1790
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:27,640
It's like, nope.

1791
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,160
And I was kind of expecting that we

1792
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,160
were going to get into fucking cyber polygon.

1793
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:31,920
I know.

1794
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,440
I know.

1795
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,280
It was never going to happen.

1796
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah, it infuriates me.

1797
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,160
It was never going to happen.

1798
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:35,680
I'm sorry.

1799
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,280
Yeah.

1800
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,680
Niall, why am I apologizing to you?

1801
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,640
That's a good question.

1802
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,560
Anyway, Alex has some more things to say.

1803
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,040
Sure.

1804
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,000
This is the last clip.

1805
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,880
Him and Barnes are having a little discussion

1806
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,600
about how great Russia is.

1807
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,120
Sure.

1808
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:47,600
And Putin.

1809
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,080
Yeah.

1810
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,520
Deeply nationalistic country, deeply proud of their country.

1811
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,720
That's who Putin really is.

1812
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,640
He's Russia's version of Trump.

1813
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,840
That's why the deep state hates him.

1814
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,520
And it's just insane.

1815
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,720
We should be aligning with Russia on key foreign policy.

1816
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,200
I agree.

1817
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,920
And I feel the danger for my family.

1818
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,720
And it pisses me off, Barnes, that we're literally having.

1819
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,840
We're having some type of pissing contest

1820
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,640
with these weird liberals.

1821
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,480
Just Putin's Christian, and Russia's Christian now.

1822
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,840
So they see it like the Midwest.

1823
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,960
They want to blow it up.

1824
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,880
This is all just essentially projecting identity politics

1825
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,520
onto anybody who has a critique of Putin.

1826
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,000
They hate him because he's Christian,

1827
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,080
or it's just weird women who think he's too much of a man.

1828
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:27,600
Yeah.

1829
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:32,360
And yeah, it happens to be all of the identifying identity

1830
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,400
signifiers that Alex has.

1831
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,600
So he feels himself under attack when people criticize Putin.

1832
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,360
And again, it's just like a rank level of narcissism.

1833
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,440
It's not geopolitical analysis.

1834
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,600
It's not meaningful in any way.

1835
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,240
It's just he identifies, feels himself.

1836
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,440
Yeah, I can't think of any reason

1837
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,800
why people would be mad at what is functionally

1838
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,440
the richest man in the world.

1839
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah.

1840
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,920
Even if you're just Alex and you're like,

1841
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,360
hey, I don't believe in dynastic rulers.

1842
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,120
Sure, yeah.

1843
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,440
I'm into democracy.

1844
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,160
I hate dictators.

1845
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,520
And I definitely don't want anybody

1846
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,440
to rule over a country for, let's say, more than two terms.

1847
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,120
Yeah, it seems like he should have just

1848
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,800
an elementary problem there.

1849
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,680
But he doesn't.

1850
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,200
Nope.

1851
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,360
And I don't know.

1852
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,480
I think that if you look at it realistically,

1853
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,880
I think that what it mostly is is

1854
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:29,160
Alex sees a lot of his identity mirrored in Putin.

1855
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:29,640
Yeah.

1856
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,720
A lot of those things that are the surface level,

1857
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,760
I am a white male Christian.

1858
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1859
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,360
And I think that he sees a strong person there

1860
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,080
that he lacks that as someone to follow.

1861
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah, performative masculinity is

1862
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,720
what he's really stoked about.

1863
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,360
Yeah.

1864
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,840
That's not to say that he's going

1865
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,240
to become Putin's number one guy.

1866
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,200
No, I doubt that.

1867
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,400
It's just a continuation of these longstanding trends

1868
01:06:59,400 --> 01:06:59,960
that he's had.

1869
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,240
It was pretty overt, though, just the love fest

1870
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,640
of these America Firsters.

1871
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,160
Yeah, it's hard to go back and see

1872
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,920
the vehemence with which he despises Putin

1873
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,480
and then get to the present day where

1874
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,080
it's like, Putin's probably the best thing we've got,

1875
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,080
second, of course, to our God King Trump.

1876
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,600
Well, but he's Russia's Trump.

1877
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,440
Well, yeah.

1878
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,400
So I guess he's the God King there.

1879
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,200
And I wish we had him God Kinging us America first.

1880
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,800
Yep, it feels that way a little bit.

1881
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,400
Stupid.

1882
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:28,920
Yep.

1883
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,720
Anyway, Jordan, this episode's a little bit shorter,

1884
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,520
and I apologize.

1885
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,240
But you know, it is what it is.

1886
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,240
Yeah.

1887
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,280
We'll be back.

1888
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:35,800
Indeed.

1889
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,360
For another episode in the near future.

1890
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,000
That's the plan.

1891
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,440
And we'll see where the wind blows us.

1892
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,600
We may be back in the past.

1893
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,000
Let's hope for Cyber Polygon.

1894
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,840
Fingers crossed.

1895
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,600
I've got it open on my screen right here.

1896
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,280
I was going to say, you've got that locked and loaded for sure.

1897
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,240
Anyway, we'll be back.

1898
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,200
But until then, we have a website.

1899
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:54,920
We do have a website.

1900
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,800
It's knowledgefight.com.

1901
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,560
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

1902
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,120
We are on Twitter.

1903
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,160
It's at knowledgefight.com.

1904
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,120
I go to betjordan.

1905
01:07:59,120 --> 01:07:59,960
We're also on Facebook.

1906
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,120
We are on Facebook, and if you could,

1907
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,440
please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

1908
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,640
to help out people still protesting, still fighting.

1909
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,440
Sure.

1910
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,080
We'll be back.

1911
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,200
But until then, I'm Neo.

1912
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,800
I'm Leo.

1913
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,880
I'm DZXClark.

1914
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,000
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1915
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,560
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

1916
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,000
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

1917
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,640
Thanks for holding.

1918
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,280
Hello, Alex.

1919
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,240
I'm a first time caller.

1920
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,000
I'm a huge fan.

1921
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,880
I love your work.

1922
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:28,440
I love you.
