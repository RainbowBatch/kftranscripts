WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:28.920
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying, we are the bad guys.

00:28.920 --> 00:50.860
Thank you.

00:50.860 --> 00:58.480
It's time to pray.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.320
I love you.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.120
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:01.120 --> 01:01.960
I'm Dan.

01:01.960 --> 01:02.780
I'm Jordan.

01:02.780 --> 01:03.620
We're a couple dudes.

01:03.620 --> 01:04.460
Like to sit around, drink novelty beverages,

01:04.460 --> 01:06.560
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.240
Oh, indeed we are.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.160
Mr. Freezin'.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.000
Mr. Holmes.

01:10.000 --> 01:10.840
Mr. Freezin'.

01:10.840 --> 01:11.680
Mr. Holmes.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.520
What's your bright spot today?

01:12.520 --> 01:16.080
My bright spot today is granola, baby.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.840
Ooh, what's that say?

01:17.840 --> 01:18.920
Lure Crunch?

01:18.920 --> 01:20.080
This is Love Crunch.

01:20.080 --> 01:20.920
Love Crunch.

01:20.920 --> 01:21.760
Founded at the store.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.680
This is espresso vanilla cream.

01:24.680 --> 01:25.500
Granola.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.340
Oh my God.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.520
What do you have to have to name your business Love Crunch?

01:28.520 --> 01:29.600
Jordan, this is so good.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.780
It's inspired by the Italian affogato,

01:32.780 --> 01:34.620
which is made with espresso and ice cream.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.460
Oh, okay.

01:35.460 --> 01:36.700
It's very good.

01:36.700 --> 01:37.540
It's nice.

01:37.540 --> 01:38.880
I'm trying to, I had like this period,

01:38.880 --> 01:41.240
I think I talked about it in some previous bright spots,

01:41.240 --> 01:45.000
where I was going for these bizarre ass cereals,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.600
you know, like the fruity pebbles with marshmallows.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.440
Oh yes.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.160
We, the Dunkin' Donuts.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.000
The coffee Dunkin' Donuts ones.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.200
That's gonna happen, yeah.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.420
And I'm trying to get back onto a more like,

01:56.420 --> 01:58.920
all right, I've indulged my inner child a little bit here.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.760
Sure, sure.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.420
And even this, I'll admit, this is, I mean,

02:01.420 --> 02:04.560
it's an espresso vanilla cream situation.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.720
So it's not like it's the hardest core granola,

02:08.720 --> 02:09.960
but I'm working in that direction.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.480
I feel like my breakfast could be better served.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.400
I'm glad it's based on an Italian something

02:15.400 --> 02:17.080
as opposed to affogato.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.640
Cause it sounds a little bit like a song

02:19.640 --> 02:21.960
a hair metal band would have released in the eighties.

02:21.960 --> 02:25.840
You know, like, love crunch, love, love crunch.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.440
Isn't that Nazareth, love hurts?

02:27.440 --> 02:29.960
Could be, could be, something along those lines.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.800
So what's your bright spot?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.720
Oh, my bright spot, Dan.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.960
I'm assuming some people have found out by now.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.320
We were in the New York Times.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.600
How fun is that?

02:37.600 --> 02:38.440
That's nice.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.280
Super bizarre.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.100
That's fun.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.800
If I hadn't like been aware that this was coming,

02:42.800 --> 02:45.600
I would be like, this is, I can't, I.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.440
Yeah, yeah.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.260
It's very bizarre.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.100
No, this is.

02:48.100 --> 02:48.940
Very bizarre, thank you to.

02:48.940 --> 02:51.260
It's fun, it's fun, it's silly, all right.

02:51.260 --> 02:55.040
So Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.120
We're going to be talking about April 16th, 2021.

02:57.120 --> 02:57.960
Blackjack.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.120
Ah, shit.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.680
This is Friday's episode of Alex's show.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.520
Okay.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.500
And you know, it's not, it's not great.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.280
It's not, it may not be the most groundbreaking of episodes.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.120
Sure, sure.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.680
But there are a couple of things that happened

03:12.680 --> 03:14.040
that are breathtaking.

03:14.040 --> 03:14.880
Okay.

03:14.880 --> 03:16.200
That are amazing.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.040
All right.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.040
And a good teachable moment.

03:18.040 --> 03:18.880
So. Okay, good.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.440
We'll get down to business on that here in a second.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.720
But before we do, let's take a little moment

03:21.720 --> 03:23.000
to say thank you to some folks who have signed up

03:23.000 --> 03:23.840
and are supporting the show.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.680
Oh, that's great.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.260
So first, the Reverend Dr. Sorrow.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.100
Thank you so much.

03:27.100 --> 03:28.560
You are now a policy wonk.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.400
I'm a policy wonk.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.120
Thank you very much, RDS.

03:31.120 --> 03:31.960
Thank you.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.960
Next, 1776 was a false flag.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.080
The British are the globalists.

03:35.080 --> 03:35.920
Thank you so much.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.080
You are now a policy wonk.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.040
I'm a policy wonk.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.240
Thank you very much.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.600
Thought-provoking.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.400
I think Alex might agree with half of that.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.960
I think he might have said that.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.800
Yeah.

03:44.800 --> 03:45.640
Borderline, yeah.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.480
Then a couple of technocrat shout-outs

03:47.480 --> 03:49.080
to throw out William V.

03:49.080 --> 03:49.900
Thank you so much.

03:49.900 --> 03:52.200
You are now a technocrat and Thomas C. Thank you so much.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.760
You are now a technocrat.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.920
I'm a policy wonk.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.720
Crikey, mate.

03:55.720 --> 03:56.680
That's fantastic.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.040
Have yourself a brew.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.640
How's your 401k doing, bro?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.200
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.520
Let's just get down to business.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.600
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.540
Why are you pimps so good?

04:07.540 --> 04:09.320
My neck is freakishly large.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.800
I declare info war on you.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.520
Thank you, Willie, and thank you, Tomas.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.360
Yes, thank you very much to the both of you.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.400
So Jordan, I had to cut the wonk shout-outs a little bit short

04:18.400 --> 04:20.440
on this episode because we have another little bit of business

04:20.440 --> 04:21.360
that we have to get to.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.200
It's very important.

04:22.200 --> 04:22.880
Of course.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.680
And that is that tomorrow, Tuesday, is 4-20.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.180
Right.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.200
And that means that it is the official end

04:29.200 --> 04:30.360
of the year of the Seltzer.

04:30.360 --> 04:30.960
That's true.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.120
It is the official end of the year of the Seltzer.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.600
Where did we wind up?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.120
You got 3-50, right?

04:36.120 --> 04:37.440
Yeah, right around 3-50.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.480
That's great.

04:38.480 --> 04:43.440
For people who maybe have found the podcast more recently,

04:43.440 --> 04:44.960
last year, around 4-20.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.600
You've got lore to catch up on.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.920
I decided that I was going to drink 500 Seltzers in that year.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.360
It was kind of something just to put a smile on our face

04:53.360 --> 04:56.040
because it seemed like there was going to be this period where

04:56.040 --> 04:58.280
there was the COVID.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.440
I didn't think it was going to go as long as it did.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.400
I did not either.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.520
I just kind of thought like, yeah,

05:02.520 --> 05:03.800
this will be a way to kill some time.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.360
I'll drink a bunch of La Croix and all

05:05.360 --> 05:07.640
these weird flavors of things.

05:07.640 --> 05:14.280
And look, a year's too long for a novelty goof.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.400
It was very much an emotional rollercoaster ride

05:17.400 --> 05:19.280
because it started off as a goof.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.840
Then a few weeks later...

05:20.840 --> 05:23.160
It started off as a goof with a lot of energy behind it.

05:23.160 --> 05:23.960
That's true.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.840
No, well, a few weeks later, what I'm saying

05:25.840 --> 05:27.920
is you got into it.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.600
And all of a sudden, it started being a lot of Seltzers

05:30.600 --> 05:32.480
just popping up all over the place.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.240
And then, what was it?

05:34.240 --> 05:36.360
Probably about six months ago.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.080
I got a hot tip on a Seltzer.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.640
We got to go to the south side to find it.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.240
It was about six months ago that your enthusiasm

05:43.240 --> 05:45.960
dropped down, and then there was a little bounce back.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.320
It was like the stock market.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.960
It dropped farther, there's a little bounce back,

05:48.960 --> 05:49.880
and then it's gone.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.040
Well, I can say that a big part of it

05:52.040 --> 05:56.200
is the difficulties involved with COVID.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.920
And then some personal life stuff kind of

05:57.920 --> 06:01.800
disenchanted me a lot over a period of months.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.320
And look, a lot of Seltzers are not very different.

06:07.320 --> 06:13.320
Yeah, I think you could make it to a year and 500

06:13.320 --> 06:15.240
if you were on a Japanese game show where

06:15.240 --> 06:17.320
you had to live in a place where there's nothing

06:17.320 --> 06:18.320
but Seltzers for a year.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.240
If someone brought me all of the Seltzers,

06:20.240 --> 06:22.080
and I was like, sip it, and they're like, oh, 50.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
Who gives a shit?

06:23.080 --> 06:26.480
Like, in those circumstances, I definitely

06:26.480 --> 06:27.360
could have tried 50.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.960
But after you try so many, it's like, I don't know.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.560
This is fine.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.560
It sucks, but it's not that bad.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.960
It's not great.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.960
You really lose the enthusiasm to hunt

06:36.960 --> 06:38.760
down new Seltzers.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.520
And once you've already had everything

06:40.520 --> 06:44.480
that's at every store within a couple miles of your house,

06:44.480 --> 06:47.280
and you can't find anything else on Amazon,

06:47.280 --> 06:49.520
it just becomes a real stu-

06:49.520 --> 06:51.200
I mean, it was a stupid idea from the beginning.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.600
No, but I mean, you know, all of our ideas

06:53.600 --> 06:55.040
are somewhat stupid.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.880
Yeah, and I'm glad I tried.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.520
I learned a few things.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.560
One is the wide, wide world of these Seltzers.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.720
There's so many.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.120
And the ones that are more tea-like are better, I think.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.080
I enjoy them more.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.120
They have more depth of flavor.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.320
And so, hooray.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.040
And in honor of ending the Year of the Seltzer,

07:16.040 --> 07:18.360
I'm ending it with my novelty beverage for today,

07:18.360 --> 07:22.680
which is a listener, Amani, sent some Sunwink

07:22.680 --> 07:25.240
Sparkle Herbal Tonics.

07:25.240 --> 07:30.320
And I've tried the one that is, I believe, turmeric-related.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.440
And that one was all right.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.200
It's got a little spice to it.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.760
Is it turmeric or turmeric?

07:33.760 --> 07:35.120
I think it's pronounced turmeric,

07:35.120 --> 07:36.200
but there is an R in there.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.280
That infuriates me.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.360
Yeah, it might be a silent R.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.440
We can continue.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.080
So this is Sunwink Lemon Rose Uplift.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.560
I feel like now is a good time for some uplifting.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.920
No, Lemon Rose, taking a sip.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.920
I noticed you playing around with that bottle

07:49.920 --> 07:50.600
before the show.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.720
And normally, you have a bit of an energy drink going on there.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.120
And how did you do?

07:56.120 --> 07:56.960
It was really good.

07:56.960 --> 07:57.600
It was really good?

07:57.600 --> 07:57.920
Yeah.

07:57.920 --> 07:58.440
Nice.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.400
Yeah, that's very tea-like.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.840
It's reminiscent of those ones that had flour.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.960
I mean, I guess rose is the flour.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.080
Well, that would make sense.

08:09.080 --> 08:09.600
Yeah, good.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.480
Those were real good.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.240
Yeah.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.360
So thank you, Imani.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.000
And thank you, everybody who has enjoyed

08:15.000 --> 08:16.520
the year of the seltzer.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.720
I don't know if I'm going to do a year of anything else

08:18.720 --> 08:19.280
ever again.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.760
I doubt it.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.520
I learned a valuable lesson.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.640
There's definitely that.

08:23.640 --> 08:24.720
It's humiliating.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.280
Think of it.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.080
You got to round 350 seltzers.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.080
If you had set your goal for 300 seltzers,

08:30.080 --> 08:31.280
you wouldn't have made 350.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.160
500 was such an attractive number, though.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.640
It's a nice round number.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.640
Yeah, I mean, look, I achieved something.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.160
Indeed.

08:37.160 --> 08:38.280
Maybe?

08:38.280 --> 08:39.680
Probably.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.920
Let the viewer decide.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.760
Sure.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.200
Anyway, Jordan, today, April 16th.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.280
Indeed.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.600
Ides of March.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.800
I'm still writing June on my checks.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.440
So here we go.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.000
We're going to start off with Alex

08:54.000 --> 08:55.960
talking about some headlines.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.880
And then getting into something that is very bad news for us,

08:59.880 --> 09:02.040
as you know, we are the chat guys.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.640
Now, they denied all of this in mainline publications

09:04.640 --> 09:05.720
until a few years ago.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.280
And now they run the same headline every week.

09:08.280 --> 09:15.080
For the first time, animal human clones have been made.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.200
That's always, it's in the test tube, it's embryonic.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.680
And that's just a condition, condition, condition,

09:20.680 --> 09:22.600
condition.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.680
The CIA was quoted in the Washington Post back in 1999

09:25.680 --> 09:28.560
that, oh, we're funding the body modification and tattoo

09:28.560 --> 09:30.560
and earring movement.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.520
Doesn't mean it's bad or good or anything.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.440
All the things you said, all the things you said.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.120
To get you ready for implantable chips.

09:36.120 --> 09:39.920
I mean, this is all actually in different publications.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.040
They admit all of this.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.480
Yep, the CIA encouraged everyone to get earrings and tattoos.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.920
It's really weird for the CIA to finally start admitting stuff

09:47.920 --> 09:49.400
and choose the stuff that I guess

09:49.400 --> 09:51.000
would take them down the most.

09:51.000 --> 09:51.520
Yeah.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.160
But, you know, what are you going to do?

09:54.160 --> 09:55.960
Yeah, I don't know about this.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.320
Also, so the latest news in the animal human hybrid front

09:59.320 --> 10:02.040
is that there was an article published in the journal Cell,

10:02.040 --> 10:06.000
where researchers injected human stem cells into monkey embryos,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.040
which then they observed growing.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.640
Three of the embryos survived up to 19 days,

10:10.640 --> 10:13.720
but they didn't create clones or anything like Alex is saying.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.480
This is a field of study, but it's not

10:15.480 --> 10:16.640
what Alex is describing.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.200
And the scientific community is far

10:18.200 --> 10:19.760
from reaching a consensus on it.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.960
There are tons of debates that go on about the ethics

10:21.960 --> 10:23.600
or even the need for such research.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.840
And you can find people who have informed opinions on both sides.

10:26.840 --> 10:27.880
Alex is not one of them.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.400
Yeah, but, you know, once I saw that you could transfer

10:30.400 --> 10:33.320
the bioluminescence trait to another creature,

10:33.320 --> 10:35.840
I was like, well, get rid of all other research.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.760
Until I can glow in the dark, all science should stop.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.400
Until everything.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.480
Until everything can glow in the dark.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.480
My buddy Dr. Gums used to get furious with me,

10:44.480 --> 10:46.920
because I would constantly demand

10:46.920 --> 10:50.560
for him to explain to me why we can't photosynthesize.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.400
Like, why can't we get a human that has photosynthesis?

10:53.400 --> 10:54.800
I would like to know that.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
I feel like we should.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.680
I really think he had a compelling, full answer,

10:58.680 --> 11:00.200
and I was too high to remember what it was.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.240
Well, of course.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.440
I don't remember.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.400
Considering you've heard it many times, too.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.160
Yeah.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.480
So this story, you know, the whole thing

11:07.480 --> 11:09.640
about the human-animal hybrids and stuff,

11:09.640 --> 11:11.960
this is something that people like to take as an example

11:11.960 --> 11:15.440
of actually, Alex, he's right all along, man.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.800
But the important thing to remember is that his version

11:17.800 --> 11:22.160
of this research, it doesn't match what actually exists.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.080
The stories that he tells are different than reality.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.800
Just remember, we were talking about fish-human hybrids

11:27.800 --> 11:29.760
in tanks with sad human eyes.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.320
Exactly.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.440
That's the kind of stuff that Alex talks about.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.600
And he claims that he's seen them.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.560
He's pinned to the tanks.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.560
We're not talking about injecting embryos.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.280
We're talking about full-grown fish men wandering

11:42.280 --> 11:43.640
around our seas.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.280
Yeah.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.920
It's very attractive for people to take headlines and then

11:48.920 --> 11:51.280
sort of out-of-context snippets of things Alex said,

11:51.280 --> 11:53.400
and he's like, yeah, he's been right all along.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.160
Showed you.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.760
It's not really accurate.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.320
It's a fun game, though, and I applaud people for playing it.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.400
So if you want to be someone who plays this game that Alex

12:02.400 --> 12:04.560
is right about everything, I have bad news.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.040
We will all be dead soon.

12:06.040 --> 12:06.880
Oh, no.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.840
There is a scientific global dictatorship

12:10.840 --> 12:13.880
that is breaking away from humanity,

12:13.880 --> 12:16.320
and that as it breaks away, it extracts

12:16.320 --> 12:19.160
all the resources of the old civilization,

12:19.160 --> 12:22.680
poisons us, dumbs us down, divides us, and conquers us,

12:22.680 --> 12:26.440
puts us back into the jungle, the urban jungle,

12:26.440 --> 12:28.040
and then wipes us out.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.400
We've got fun and games.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.520
And by the time that they finally wiped everybody out,

12:32.520 --> 12:36.080
which is coming very soon, in a cascade of crises

12:36.080 --> 12:39.160
they orchestrate but pose as the saviors, those of us

12:39.160 --> 12:43.720
that haven't joined them, it'll be very hard pressed for us

12:43.720 --> 12:46.640
to survive without joining them.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.320
And those of us that haven't joined them

12:49.320 --> 12:53.320
will still only survive because the global has killed everybody.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.880
So we're not on their side, but if you're

12:56.880 --> 13:00.840
able to make the right moves and be prepared,

13:00.840 --> 13:03.440
you might be able to survive and not join them.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.440
But I think God isn't going to like that.

13:10.440 --> 13:15.040
God doesn't like cowards, so I think it's just surviving.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.320
We have to stop this thing from happening.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.320
This is very weird.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.600
Well, I mean, it seems strange for him

13:22.600 --> 13:24.120
to say that God wouldn't like that,

13:24.120 --> 13:26.480
considering the most popular Christian book

13:26.480 --> 13:30.000
series ever written was about the small number of survivors

13:30.000 --> 13:31.920
who made it through the evil apocalypse.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.280
Yeah, that was globalist shit, though, man.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.160
OK, well, that's fair.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.600
Kirk Cameron's a globalist.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.320
My bad.

13:36.320 --> 13:36.920
My bad.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.440
Nope, I fucked it up.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.000
Yeah, it's an interesting version

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
of Alex's fear narratives.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.200
It's like, OK, so a kill-off event is about to happen very

13:46.200 --> 13:46.560
soon.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.080
Naturally.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.280
Because the globalists are taking over

13:48.280 --> 13:49.040
and the blah, blah, blah.

13:49.040 --> 13:49.720
Any moment now.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.960
So it's coming up almost immediately,

13:51.960 --> 13:54.400
and you are probably going to die.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.440
But if you make the right moves, there's

13:56.440 --> 13:58.000
a way that you can survive.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.400
Now, some of the right moves that are the wrong moves

14:00.400 --> 14:01.720
are joining with the globalists.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.160
Of course.

14:02.160 --> 14:02.680
That's bad.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.360
But you could survive if you did that.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.840
Even though, why would you, since everybody you've ever

14:06.840 --> 14:08.360
known and cared for is dead?

14:08.360 --> 14:08.920
I don't know.

14:08.920 --> 14:09.480
Fair enough.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.800
But you cannot join the globalists and still

14:11.800 --> 14:14.360
survive if you get really lucky and do all the right moves,

14:14.360 --> 14:15.520
but God will be mad.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.800
But then you're going to hell.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.240
God's going to be mad.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.640
So you can die in the apocalypse,

14:20.640 --> 14:23.080
or you can survive it for a little while with no one

14:23.080 --> 14:23.760
you've ever met.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.640
But either way, you're going to hell.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.400
But I guess that this implies that there

14:27.400 --> 14:30.040
is a fourth, fifth option, and that

14:30.040 --> 14:31.360
is fighting to stop this.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.560
Somehow stopping it, yeah.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.440
But it doesn't matter.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.880
The globalists have a plan B. Alex

14:34.880 --> 14:36.000
has already explained that.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.880
Yeah, it doesn't seem to be a good fight at this point.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.880
No, this is really dumb.

14:41.880 --> 14:48.160
So I think that there are jobs in the world that have

14:48.160 --> 14:51.560
more staying power for people.

14:51.560 --> 14:52.320
Careers.

14:52.320 --> 14:56.600
Sure, if you're in a career that takes a long time to master,

14:56.600 --> 14:59.680
let's say, maybe there's a lower turnover

14:59.680 --> 15:02.440
than some unskilled professions maybe

15:02.440 --> 15:04.040
have higher turnover rates.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.880
Comedian, high turnover rate.

15:05.880 --> 15:06.400
Quite.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
Very high turnover rate.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.680
Although it should be higher.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.520
Much, much higher.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.840
What do you think about the high ranking globalists?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.040
What's their turnover rate?

15:16.040 --> 15:16.600
Yeah, what do you think about that?

15:16.600 --> 15:17.320
Oh my god.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.120
It has to be, here's what I think.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.040
I think it's got to be like the Politburo level of like.

15:22.040 --> 15:22.880
It's got to be zero.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.920
Backstabbing, no, no, no.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.760
Backstabbing murder all the time.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.000
You're wrong.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.320
And I can tell you the globalists have major turnover

15:30.320 --> 15:31.560
with their higher level people.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.280
Because they really understand, even once they have all

15:36.280 --> 15:38.880
the money and the power, that it's empty.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.360
And if they haven't totally turned their souls over.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.560
They get to keep all the money and power?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.080
They then turn against it.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.120
But then those people don't have a voice.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.840
They get shut down or they get killed.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.760
Oh, OK.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.320
That's convenient.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.880
So the globalists and the high ranking levels,

15:58.880 --> 16:02.080
they constantly have crises.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.680
Right, they have crises of conscience

16:03.680 --> 16:05.080
and realize, nah, fuck this noise.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.040
Alex is right.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.760
So they quit, but then they get killed.

16:07.760 --> 16:08.960
So what are you going to do?

16:08.960 --> 16:12.200
Hey, it's as everybody knows from watching our government

16:12.200 --> 16:14.920
function, obviously the people who run the world

16:14.920 --> 16:18.400
have consciences that they've been to at all times.

16:18.400 --> 16:23.160
I don't know if I can think of any examples of anybody

16:23.160 --> 16:26.360
that Alex has ever discussed who was a high ranking globalist,

16:26.360 --> 16:28.640
who turned on the globalists, and then got killed.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.480
Although, again, it's a fun story.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.960
It is a fun story.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.520
And it does explain why there aren't

16:33.520 --> 16:35.680
defectors of the globalists.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.680
Sure, sure, they're dead.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.880
Except for, I guess, Leo Zagami, which maybe he should be dead.

16:40.880 --> 16:41.440
Right.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.280
If this makes sense.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.360
I don't know, Mike Lindell got rich and powerful.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.720
So he's probably turned against the globalists.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.800
I bet he was a high ranking globalist for a while.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.360
He had to have been, right?

16:50.360 --> 16:50.920
I don't know.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.600
Otherwise you can't get money and power.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.720
His point is you can only get money and power

16:55.720 --> 16:57.960
if you join with the globalists.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.160
Or I guess if you sell supplements.

17:00.160 --> 17:00.800
Or pillows.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.640
Yeah.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.000
I don't think Mike Lindell's with the globalists.

17:03.000 --> 17:03.600
I doubt it.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.120
No.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.840
No.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.560
Also, the topic of Alex's employee

17:08.560 --> 17:12.320
who got arrested at the Capitol does come back up a little bit.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.000
OK.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.480
My pillow storyline is not brought back up.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.160
No longer brought up.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.960
It might still be there, but it's not front and center.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.600
So here's the thing.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.600
These globalists who have high turnover rates

17:25.600 --> 17:28.560
and then end up having to kill the former employees,

17:28.560 --> 17:32.320
they're only going to kill you if certain conditions are met.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.680
That's nice.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.360
If you've ever worked for the New World Order

17:36.360 --> 17:38.120
and never signed the contracts with them

17:38.120 --> 17:40.320
and ever actually run their operations,

17:40.320 --> 17:44.400
then they will kill you if you sidestep them

17:44.400 --> 17:50.160
or don't follow their orders or ever try to leave them.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.600
But if you've never sold out to them, it's metaphysical rules.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.680
They'll just try to get other people to kill you,

17:55.680 --> 17:57.520
but they won't give the order themselves.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.360
Or they will try to kill your name or discredit you

18:00.360 --> 18:02.560
or put you in prison.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.520
But they don't often kill you unless you've

18:06.520 --> 18:08.760
been involved with them and made some deal with them

18:08.760 --> 18:09.960
at some level.

18:09.960 --> 18:14.360
And that's why I've never made any deals with these guys.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.480
That's a protective instinct on his part.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.840
I.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.880
Yep.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.400
So yeah, you've got to make deals

18:20.400 --> 18:21.960
or else there's going to be some kind

18:21.960 --> 18:25.560
of an infringing of metaphysical rules that sound really dumb.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.200
I have a lot of problems with this.

18:27.200 --> 18:27.720
Yeah.

18:27.720 --> 18:31.320
If the metaphysical rules that govern the universe

18:31.320 --> 18:34.040
are so dumb that you can ethically sidestep

18:34.040 --> 18:36.880
murder by convincing somebody else to kill somebody,

18:36.880 --> 18:39.320
and then you have a totally clean slate,

18:39.320 --> 18:41.720
I don't think that these rules are good.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.440
I think that they're ungrounded.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.800
Give me a second.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.960
Are you telling me that Mark Richards

18:46.960 --> 18:49.760
is innocent of all crimes according

18:49.760 --> 18:53.200
to the metaphysical rules of the universe?

18:53.200 --> 18:56.040
I think there might be a flaw in this metaphysical rule.

18:56.040 --> 18:56.760
You bet.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.080
Yeah, I think there could be.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.000
Yep.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.080
I don't know what I feel about this other than any time

19:05.080 --> 19:09.720
he brings up these metaphysical rule ideas, I just,

19:09.720 --> 19:10.560
I want to know more.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.840
I want him to actually get into the ethical underpinnings

19:12.840 --> 19:16.640
of this and really break down what must be

19:16.640 --> 19:18.720
true within this ethical system.

19:18.720 --> 19:22.480
Oh no, if he were capable, the one thing

19:22.480 --> 19:25.000
that I want from him is a full accounting

19:25.000 --> 19:27.680
of his metaphysics beliefs.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.240
It's just brought out whenever things are convenient.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.240
Yeah, I want a book of him like codify,

19:34.240 --> 19:36.840
I want Alex Jones' version of the Bible.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.800
That's what I want.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.360
I don't.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.200
Oh wow, that's fair.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.080
I definitely don't.

19:40.080 --> 19:40.680
That's fair.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.840
That's fair.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.640
All caps.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.520
So Alex has all these ideas about how

19:48.520 --> 19:50.760
the news about human-animal hybrids and stuff,

19:50.760 --> 19:52.560
it's not what they're saying.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.240
Of course not.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.680
It's not that there were human stem cells and embryos.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.360
No, fish people.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.320
No, no, no, no.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.880
Fish people in the oceans.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.680
Technology is 50 years ahead of where it actually

20:01.680 --> 20:02.720
is, all this stuff.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.480
And you know what?

20:03.480 --> 20:05.560
You know who thinks they know what's up but don't?

20:05.560 --> 20:06.240
The globalists?

20:06.240 --> 20:07.880
Fucking military intelligence.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.000
Oh, those idiots.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.520
People talk about army intelligence

20:10.520 --> 20:11.960
or the military intelligence.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.800
They don't know any of this.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.520
That's an oxymoron, am I right?

20:15.520 --> 20:17.520
This cute stuff at the highest level

20:17.520 --> 20:18.880
is military intelligence.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.160
That's totally compartmentalized to archaic weapons.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.320
Atomic weapons are 120 years old.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.360
They had all the equations 120 plus years ago.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.440
That's all tinker toy stuff.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.880
That's all that's being phased out.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.320
They're getting rid of the human military.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.200
By 2030, there really won't be very many humans

20:35.200 --> 20:36.680
left in the military.

20:36.680 --> 20:37.840
And they have all these Hollywood movies

20:37.840 --> 20:40.880
about super soldiers, these really cool bad ass guys.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.480
And you know, like the new movie, Nobody.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.760
You know, he's so tough.

20:43.760 --> 20:44.640
None of that exists.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.320
It's all gone.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.040
It's all over.

20:46.040 --> 20:46.760
It's all robots.

20:46.760 --> 20:47.760
It's all clones.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.480
It's all robots and clones in the future.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.240
It's all robots and clones in the future.

20:51.240 --> 20:51.680
Fun.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.600
All right.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.040
So I guess you saw Bob Oden, Kirk, and nobody.

20:56.040 --> 20:56.560
Yeah.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.360
So that's nice.

20:57.360 --> 20:57.960
It's a good movie.

20:57.960 --> 20:58.560
I bet it is.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.120
It's a good movie.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.640
I think Bob Oden, Kirk has a lot of range that's been unexplored.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.760
And I'm excited for him.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.440
He's incredibly great.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.280
I think, you know, it's kind of an interesting dilemma.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.320
Because you do see the possibility of a future

21:11.320 --> 21:15.400
where a lot of warfare is done by way of robots.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.080
Sure, of course.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.400
You know, drones certainly are a big problem.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.800
Yeah, we're already there to a smaller extent.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.800
But if things escalate towards the point

21:22.800 --> 21:27.160
where actual troops are robots, then eventually you're

21:27.160 --> 21:30.840
going to get to a point where a negotiation between countries

21:30.840 --> 21:33.160
that is robots fighting robots is really

21:33.160 --> 21:34.680
just a financial thing.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.040
It's like, I'm destroying more of your property,

21:37.040 --> 21:37.920
which is robots.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.720
No, it's.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.640
And then it almost has a potential to be like, well,

21:42.640 --> 21:47.120
we could negotiate through this easier than fighting.

21:47.120 --> 21:47.880
So I don't know.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.040
I haven't fully thought it through.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.520
But it's an interesting thing.

21:50.520 --> 21:54.120
It almost seems like it would lead to a vast reduction

21:54.120 --> 21:54.720
in war.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.080
Well, I mean, I think there have been

21:57.080 --> 22:00.240
a lot of really interesting, because that's something

22:00.240 --> 22:01.760
that I've read about.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.400
That's one of those things that futurists

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
have been describing since Kurt Vonnegut,

22:06.400 --> 22:07.960
like that kind of stuff.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.960
And there's a lot of people who are like,

22:10.960 --> 22:14.880
war doesn't mean anything if there aren't people dying.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.200
So you can't really do it.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.600
You know, it would be like a video game at that point.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.560
It's just like, are you better at video games?

22:20.560 --> 22:24.120
I have 100 more robots than you, so mathematically I

22:24.120 --> 22:26.040
win before we even fight.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.360
Yeah.

22:27.360 --> 22:33.280
Yeah, I guess it doesn't relate to robot drones and stuff

22:33.280 --> 22:35.160
like bombing apartment buildings or something.

22:35.160 --> 22:35.640
Exactly.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.480
It doesn't relate to that, my thought.

22:38.480 --> 22:41.200
There's still a devastating human toll

22:41.200 --> 22:43.040
associated with that.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.680
Yeah, I don't know.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.000
I don't know about the clones part.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
What would clones be doing in this scenario?

22:49.000 --> 22:49.400
I don't know.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.640
Have you seen the prequels, the Star Wars prequels?

22:51.640 --> 22:55.840
I mean, yeah, but ultimately clones are not as good in war.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.280
You know, if you're going to build.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.880
Seems like a massive investment if you're

22:58.880 --> 23:00.080
going to use them for warfare.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.120
No, it's like, look, but here's the thing.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.880
If you're building robots, you know,

23:03.880 --> 23:07.320
we're not thinking about AT-ATs, because those are stupid.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.440
They're giant lumbering moron machines.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.200
I have bad news.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.360
I am thinking about AT-ATs.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.240
Small, small, quick mobility, all of these things.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.280
Human beings don't stand a chance against those.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.960
Those terrifying things you see videos of every now and again.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.200
Yep.

23:22.200 --> 23:22.840
Yep.

23:22.840 --> 23:27.520
So Alex has some complaints about the pope.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.040
Sure.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.560
Pope Francis, those full communists

23:30.560 --> 23:33.360
are sharing prosperity is not communism,

23:33.360 --> 23:34.680
but pure Christianity.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.560
But they're going to direct how you share.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.920
And of course, all the big bankers pay no tax,

23:39.920 --> 23:41.320
but they'll lecture you all day.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.080
No idea what the bankers have to do with the pope's opinions.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.960
I mean, I guess they don't pay taxes at the Vatican either.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.480
Also, I have great news for Alex.

23:49.480 --> 23:50.000
What's that?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.360
The pope was arrested a year ago.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.000
He was.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.120
According to Steve Pajetnik.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.240
He's been gone for a while.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.320
This is the fake pope that Alex is complaining about now.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.000
Don't worry about what this pope is saying.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.160
This is a puppet.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.040
Francis is behind jail bars.

24:03.040 --> 24:03.600
Naturally.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.080
So Alex gets to talk in here a little bit

24:06.080 --> 24:08.080
about the old COVID vaccines.

24:08.080 --> 24:08.680
Sure.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.320
And I think he says something that I

24:11.320 --> 24:14.160
find flagrantly irresponsible.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.600
You've got all these countries that

24:15.600 --> 24:17.560
have stopped the Pfizer shot, all these companies that

24:17.560 --> 24:19.640
have stopped the AstraZeneca, all these ones that

24:19.640 --> 24:22.440
have stopped J&J. You've got all these deaths, not one death.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.760
They'll go, one woman died.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.560
You actually go look at the reporting system.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.280
It's like 3,000 here, 2,000 there, 5,000 there.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.640
They estimate between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.480
They're not sure.

24:32.480 --> 24:33.200
It varies.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.960
Country to country are actually reporting the deaths as COVID.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.160
But it is COVID vaccine killing them.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.200
This is a gigantic unsupported claim that Alex is making.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.800
If he has some kind of evidence that the COVID vaccines are

24:43.800 --> 24:45.360
responsible for a high number of deaths

24:45.360 --> 24:47.000
that are being called COVID-19 deaths,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.240
then he can't just assert it and wave

24:49.240 --> 24:52.080
his hand to some vague unspecified statistics that

24:52.080 --> 24:54.040
varies from country to country.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.960
He knows that he can't back this claim up,

24:55.960 --> 24:57.360
which is why even what he's saying

24:57.360 --> 24:59.640
is a meaningless nonsense assertion.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.600
The difference between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 is huge.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.040
That's an irresponsible spectrum to be pointing to.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.480
It might be a little bit.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.800
Anyway, I'm going to need to see the sources on this.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.760
And until I do, I'm going to go out on a limb

25:11.760 --> 25:15.720
and assume it's his dumb imagination, as usual.

25:15.720 --> 25:19.760
It's either 10% or 1,000% more.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.640
No idea which.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.880
Could be anything, honestly.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.240
So on our last episode, we got a meeting

25:24.240 --> 25:29.080
of the minds between Alex and fresh, hot on the scene

25:29.080 --> 25:31.560
comedian Norm Paddis, lawyer.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.840
He's finally breaking out of this law game

25:34.840 --> 25:38.760
to pursue his real passion of stand-up comedy.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.200
He's not even going to be able to be the funniest lawyer,

25:41.200 --> 25:44.360
because every comedy scene already has that.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.080
We've already got a funniest lawyer in Chicago, at least.

25:47.080 --> 25:52.560
So not to be outdone by the shit-headery of Norm

25:52.560 --> 25:55.520
coming on, Alex's other lawyer buddy, Barnes,

25:55.520 --> 25:56.760
is going to be on this episode.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.240
Oh, yeah.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.840
You can't have Paddis on without Barnes being like,

25:59.840 --> 26:01.360
you got to book me soon.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.760
Yeah, so he's got to come on.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.680
And this is where Alex teases that they're

26:04.680 --> 26:08.080
going to talk about how the Chauvin trial is nonsense.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.440
No.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.040
Coming up today, Robert Barnes is

26:11.040 --> 26:14.000
going to be looking at the insane Chauvin trial

26:14.000 --> 26:15.440
up in Minnesota.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.600
And when he thinks that's going to end, and no doubt,

26:17.600 --> 26:20.760
every major city is going to be lit up like a Christmas tree.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.320
And they're not the type you put cookies and milk out

26:23.320 --> 26:24.520
for Santa for.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.520
It's going to be lit up with fire.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.360
And why are the communists doing this?

26:28.360 --> 26:30.400
It's part of the takeover of the police.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.360
They're not getting rid of the police.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.960
They are bullying them using any bad event that happens.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.960
Oh, my god, we've had three days of riots.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.920
And a guy, an armed robbery suspect for robbing a woman,

26:40.920 --> 26:44.080
waving guns around everywhere, is then attacking the police.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.200
And in the melee, the cop pulls the wrong weapon

26:47.200 --> 26:47.920
and shoots him.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.480
What do you think happens when you go into riots

26:50.480 --> 26:51.720
and high-speed car chases?

26:54.480 --> 26:57.240
But now, you see, we've got to have more riots for that trial.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.280
We've got to have more.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.600
It just goes on and on.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.680
But if you're a good globalist police department,

27:01.680 --> 27:03.440
if you do everything the New World Order says

27:03.440 --> 27:04.960
and arrest their political enemies,

27:04.960 --> 27:07.840
become commissars under strong cities initiative

27:07.840 --> 27:11.360
that Obama launched, directly directed by the UN,

27:11.360 --> 27:14.280
well, then you're in like Flynn.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.280
So that's coming up.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.680
Separately, ladies and gentlemen, where is it?

27:17.680 --> 27:18.360
Here it is.

27:18.360 --> 27:21.040
This is your last three-day chance

27:21.040 --> 27:23.720
to get the really highest quality liquid multivitamin

27:23.720 --> 27:25.680
mineral system with amino acids as well.

27:25.680 --> 27:29.680
There's going to be riots and fires all over the city.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.200
Got it.

27:30.200 --> 27:30.800
Add pivot.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.840
Yep.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.360
Fun.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.360
You know, you work people up about, hey,

27:34.360 --> 27:37.760
this ain't the fun Christmas tree with cookies and milk.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.400
And separately, let me get these vitamins.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.960
Hey, listen, don't turn around, Dan.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.360
Der Kommisar is in town.

27:44.360 --> 27:44.840
Uh-oh.

27:44.840 --> 27:45.920
Yeah, we're in trouble.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.440
So Alex has a story that he hits on a number of times

27:49.440 --> 27:53.240
throughout the show, and that is that Maxine Waters apparently

27:53.240 --> 27:57.800
told Jim Jordan to shut his mouth

27:57.800 --> 27:58.840
seated in the chambers.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.640
It's a very un-congressional language.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.880
I would have preferred she beat the shit out of him

28:03.880 --> 28:05.760
with a cane, because we've got one.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.480
There is a precedent to that happening, I guess.

28:07.480 --> 28:10.600
OK, I think there's an even, look, we've got one.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.400
You get to beat an anti-abolitionist

28:13.400 --> 28:15.360
to borderline to death in Congress.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.200
That's the rule.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.920
I think Alex might have the wrong angle on this.

28:18.920 --> 28:19.880
Uh-oh.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.480
Let me do this.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.160
I want to get into this Jim Jordan thing,

28:24.160 --> 28:28.160
and Maxine Waters telling him shut up.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.480
In fact, let's go to the end first.

28:29.480 --> 28:33.080
Let's go to her telling him to shut up.

28:33.080 --> 28:36.320
And imagine if a white guy was telling a black lady shut up.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.240
That's like half of Alex's show.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.320
Yeah, I was going to say, you are always

28:40.320 --> 28:42.600
telling black women to shut up.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.600
It's the most important thing to you.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.680
Yeah, any time there's some kind of social justice-related

28:47.680 --> 28:49.800
activism, it tells people to shut up.

28:49.800 --> 28:53.080
Just shut up, yeah, yeah, just shut up.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.760
Can you imagine if there was some sort of football

28:55.760 --> 29:00.000
player who was blackballed from the league for speaking out

29:00.000 --> 29:04.160
very obvious truths that seem so obvious that no one should

29:04.160 --> 29:05.840
be even borderline punished for them?

29:05.840 --> 29:08.600
Imagine if a white guy told that guy to shut up.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.800
People would be furious.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.840
We're going to get some flagrantly racist stuff

29:11.840 --> 29:13.200
about Kaepernick a little bit later.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.080
Of course we are.

29:14.080 --> 29:14.960
Why wouldn't we?

29:14.960 --> 29:15.680
Why wouldn't we?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.320
It's funny you should bring him up as an example.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.320
While we're here.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.400
So back to COVID matters.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.440
Here's Alex saying some dumb shit.

29:22.440 --> 29:26.400
And even a year ago, they admitted 94% of COVID deaths

29:26.400 --> 29:27.320
were something else.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.620
It's the same thing in England.

29:28.620 --> 29:32.280
It's the same scam everywhere, because it was never

29:32.280 --> 29:33.880
really COVID, folks.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.640
It was pneumonia or the flu.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.080
So in 6%, it was an actual virus.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.600
In 94%, it was heart attack or cancer.

29:40.600 --> 29:47.440
But the hospitals coded as COVID to get the $53,000.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.400
So this is just Alex misrepresenting

29:49.400 --> 29:51.960
how there was a figure that came out where it was like 6%

29:51.960 --> 29:54.200
of COVID-19 deaths didn't involve a person who

29:54.200 --> 29:55.760
had an underlying condition that might

29:55.760 --> 29:56.880
have contributed to the death.

29:56.880 --> 29:57.400
Sure, sure, sure.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.440
Considering that things like obesity or smoking

29:59.440 --> 30:02.000
could be underlying conditions, this isn't surprising.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.360
Alex and his ilk have just used that stat incorrectly

30:04.360 --> 30:06.880
for a year to argue that the death numbers are artificial.

30:06.880 --> 30:07.520
Right.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.040
Now, I was thinking about this.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.640
And that idea that the hospitals are in on a get-rich-quick

30:13.640 --> 30:16.120
scheme because there's a certain amount that they get paid out

30:16.120 --> 30:19.720
by Medicare, Medicaid, based on COVID-19 patients.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.680
Yeah, that tremendously stupid idea about that, yeah.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.480
I was just thinking about it, and does Alex

30:25.480 --> 30:28.440
think that those hospitals don't get payments

30:28.440 --> 30:30.320
for other conditions?

30:30.320 --> 30:32.600
Does he think that someone getting,

30:32.600 --> 30:35.960
like if they have an aggressive cancer that they need

30:35.960 --> 30:39.200
treatment, does he think that these programs don't also

30:39.200 --> 30:39.840
pay out?

30:39.840 --> 30:42.040
What you're not understanding, and I

30:42.040 --> 30:44.560
don't know if you've been to a hospital in a while,

30:44.560 --> 30:47.840
they pay everything on a flat $100 fee.

30:47.840 --> 30:51.200
So if you've got cancer, you're taking all kinds of stuff

30:51.200 --> 30:52.840
and they pay $100 for it.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.400
It's been a while since I've been to a hospital,

30:54.400 --> 30:55.560
and admittedly, I don't have cancer.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.360
They switched it.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.400
It's super weird, but it's $100 for everything but COVID.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.040
Yeah, it's one of these days I'm actually

31:02.040 --> 31:04.400
going to sit down and try and figure out

31:04.400 --> 31:07.360
like what other payouts are.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.280
Yeah, yeah.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.960
So you're like, all right, here we go.

31:09.960 --> 31:10.960
Let's do this.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.320
But that may be needed for another day,

31:13.320 --> 31:18.360
because today we're going to get in to Operation Cyber Polygon.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.200
Ooh, now you're excited.

31:20.200 --> 31:21.320
I'm also lying.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.560
He doesn't bring it up at all.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.920
God damn it, Dan!

31:24.920 --> 31:26.120
You son of a bitch.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.240
No, no, Alex doesn't bring up.

31:28.240 --> 31:31.360
You always have to then, like when you're excited

31:31.360 --> 31:34.280
and you get a letdown, you have to just pass it on to me.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.240
Yeah, it is a little bit mean of me,

31:36.240 --> 31:38.320
and maybe I just want you to feel that disappointment.

31:38.320 --> 31:38.760
Yeah, no, no, no.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.800
We got to share in it.

31:39.800 --> 31:40.480
We're a team.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.200
We're partners.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.840
We got to share in that disappointment.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.680
So instead of getting into that, Alex just

31:44.680 --> 31:46.440
complains about things he imagined

31:46.440 --> 31:47.720
that Anthony Fauci said.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.400
Sure.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.480
You can play the clips.

31:49.480 --> 31:53.240
Once you're vaccinated, you can go out and not wear a mask

31:53.240 --> 31:54.080
and go to restaurants.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.200
That's Fauci.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.640
That's what they all said worldwide.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.720
Oh, sorry, doesn't work, because they've

31:59.720 --> 32:01.440
had you under their control for a year.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.680
They've doubled their wealth.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.960
They're taking over.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.600
They're not going to stop.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.880
They're bad people.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.680
So this is mostly about defending

32:08.680 --> 32:11.520
Tucker Carlson about attacks that

32:11.520 --> 32:14.560
have been made against him for his segment

32:14.560 --> 32:16.400
that he had where he was talking about like, hey,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.000
I was told that we could go back to normal

32:18.000 --> 32:19.080
once people were vaccinated.

32:19.080 --> 32:19.840
Oh, OK.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.160
I thought he was talking about the white replacement one.

32:22.160 --> 32:22.840
No, no, no, no.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.000
We've moved on from that?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.240
You can just get white replacement for like a week.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.040
He lets Harrison Smith defend that.

32:28.040 --> 32:28.720
That's fair.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.360
That's fair.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.760
So I think people might have gotten the sense that things

32:31.760 --> 32:33.120
would immediately return to normal

32:33.120 --> 32:35.080
after a vaccine was released, but that's not

32:35.080 --> 32:38.240
what was being said by experts, including Dr. Fauci.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.440
This is a straw man position that the right wing media

32:40.440 --> 32:42.760
types like Alex and Tucker have been using recently

32:42.760 --> 32:44.960
to argue against vaccination while pretending

32:44.960 --> 32:47.200
that they have some kind of a principled point.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.520
It's basically a child whining that their parent promised

32:49.520 --> 32:51.440
to buy them a pony if they got good grades when

32:51.440 --> 32:52.720
the parents said no such thing.

32:52.720 --> 32:53.320
Yeah.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.680
In December 2020, Fauci said, quote,

32:55.680 --> 32:59.720
let's say we get 75%, 80% of the population vaccinated.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.720
If we do that, if we do it efficiently

33:01.720 --> 33:03.720
through the second quarter of 2021,

33:03.720 --> 33:05.920
by the time we get to the end of the summer, i.e.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.640
the third quarter, we may actually

33:07.640 --> 33:09.800
have enough herd immunity protecting our society

33:09.800 --> 33:12.200
that when we get to the end of 2021,

33:12.200 --> 33:15.400
we can approach very much some degree of normality

33:15.400 --> 33:18.360
that is close to where we were before.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.360
So that's what he was saying at the end of 2020.

33:20.360 --> 33:21.820
No, at every point in time, they've

33:21.820 --> 33:23.760
said even after you've been vaccinated,

33:23.760 --> 33:25.640
continue to wear a mask, not least of which

33:25.640 --> 33:29.440
to stop the spread, but also just to make it fine for people

33:29.440 --> 33:31.360
to wear masks outside.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.040
In September, Fauci told Healthline, quote,

33:34.040 --> 33:35.960
we can be greatly helped by vaccines,

33:35.960 --> 33:37.840
but it's not vaccine alone.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.480
Let's assume that we get a reasonably effective vaccine,

33:40.480 --> 33:43.720
not measles vaccine where you have a 98% effective.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.480
I think that would be too much to ask for.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.120
But let's talk about 75%, 80% effective vaccine, which

33:49.120 --> 33:50.720
would be really good if we did that.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.880
If we did that and we ultimately got

33:52.880 --> 33:55.200
everyone who should be and could be vaccinated,

33:55.200 --> 33:58.880
I would think that together with not necessarily abruptly ending

33:58.880 --> 34:01.360
measures like masks and physical distancing,

34:01.360 --> 34:03.320
if we could get the majority of the community

34:03.320 --> 34:05.120
to adopt those health measures together

34:05.120 --> 34:07.000
with a reasonably effective vaccine,

34:07.000 --> 34:08.640
then we could get the level of infection

34:08.640 --> 34:11.560
down so low in the community that by the third quarter

34:11.560 --> 34:15.400
end of 2021, we could start thinking in terms of normal.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.960
Alex and his idiot friends don't live in reality.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.680
They've fabricated a fake one that adheres to the storylines

34:20.680 --> 34:23.040
that they want to tell and that they profit off of.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.600
Alex's story about the vaccine is

34:24.600 --> 34:26.760
that the globalists are trying to force it on everyone.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.800
So it's essential for that story to involve an explicit promise

34:29.800 --> 34:32.320
from the villains of the story that if everything will go back

34:32.320 --> 34:35.400
to normal just as soon as you take my evil vaccine.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.800
That's not the actual messaging that people like Fauci

34:37.800 --> 34:39.960
have been engaging in, but it's how it feels to Alex

34:39.960 --> 34:42.960
because that's the story that he tells for a living.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.280
You can see by the false portrayals.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.320
Yeah.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.080
Silly.

34:47.080 --> 34:47.880
What a dick.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.040
Yeah.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.720
So I think it's important to recognize a few things.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.440
One of them is that I'm willing to address and talk

34:55.440 --> 34:58.920
about like factual issues like, you know,

34:58.920 --> 35:01.680
cyber polygon if you were to bring it up.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.720
Or these other big operational lockstep nonsense.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.640
SPARS.

35:06.640 --> 35:07.320
SPARS, sure.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.160
That was recent.

35:08.160 --> 35:08.720
Yeah.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.240
I'm very happy to engage in those things.

35:11.240 --> 35:15.680
But I will also say that anybody who

35:15.680 --> 35:19.400
wants to take Alex Jones as someone who

35:19.400 --> 35:21.560
is a good purveyor of information

35:21.560 --> 35:26.840
will also have to explain this kind of thing.

35:26.840 --> 35:27.840
And I know God's real.

35:27.840 --> 35:29.040
I'm going to leave it at that.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.600
I have always had a connection to God.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.080
I was born again when I was probably about eight,

35:33.080 --> 35:34.520
nine years old.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.200
But I have been having experiences now

35:36.200 --> 35:38.120
that I'm going to keep private.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.560
But I'm going to tell you are biblical.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.080
You hear about the Holy Ghost, the Comforter,

35:42.080 --> 35:43.240
and all the rest of that.

35:43.240 --> 35:46.080
I am now routinely having experiences

35:46.080 --> 35:50.000
that now I would be pleased to be crucified upside down

35:50.000 --> 35:51.400
or tortured for five years for this.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.920
OK, I mean, I can just flip a switch in my brain

35:53.920 --> 35:55.800
now and go right to Valhalla.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.400
And so I am transcending these Satanists.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.360
And I am so thankful to God because I've

36:00.360 --> 36:02.680
been in a lot of pain and really upset over them

36:02.680 --> 36:06.080
and really taking on and getting very depressed.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.960
And I just prayed to God the last few months

36:07.960 --> 36:09.640
to take the worry away.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.320
And I'll fight harder than ever.

36:11.320 --> 36:12.280
And I've done that.

36:12.280 --> 36:15.720
And now I am really now experiencing the Holy Ghost.

36:15.720 --> 36:19.360
And it is un, oh my, oh, it's so good.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.200
Wow.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.760
I mean, we're talking 50 times what I ever experienced.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.760
Because I mean, you start crying getting near God

36:26.760 --> 36:28.280
and close to the door.

36:28.280 --> 36:31.320
But man, I've gone in the door now.

36:31.320 --> 36:35.520
And I mean, I've, I'll tell you part of it.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.880
I mean, man, I have these dreams now

36:38.880 --> 36:42.120
that are just intense ecstasy.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.680
And I'm in heaven.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.040
And I, trying to describe the beauty of it

36:46.040 --> 36:48.520
and the purity of it and the level of this

36:48.520 --> 36:50.960
is just like you're in God's mind.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.640
It's all good and well to have like religious beliefs

36:53.640 --> 36:54.480
and stuff.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.560
It's not normal to believe that you're

36:57.560 --> 37:00.160
having visions of being in heaven when you dream.

37:00.160 --> 37:04.080
Everyone, everyone, I am waking up having just been

37:04.080 --> 37:05.320
sucked off by an angel.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.360
Are you shitting me?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.640
This is ecstasy.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.160
I thought women were great.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.160
This is lunatic level behavior.

37:11.160 --> 37:15.520
The Archangel Michael visits me at night and gives me handies.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.560
I've been in the God's mind.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.800
It turns out all angels are gay, by the way.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.480
I think that this is silly.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.560
And I think this is stupid.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.400
And anybody who wants to take Alex

37:24.400 --> 37:29.160
as any kind of sincere good faith actor

37:29.160 --> 37:32.360
in the sense of like the conversation about ideas,

37:32.360 --> 37:36.360
let's talk about this being the way he sees himself.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.640
But even that's kind of, you know, maybe a personal attack

37:39.640 --> 37:40.440
and what have you.

37:40.440 --> 37:43.400
Well, all I heard him say was, I am having good dreams lately.

37:43.400 --> 37:43.880
Sure.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.600
So that's also, that's nice.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.680
But he puts so much more import on it than just someone saying,

37:48.680 --> 37:49.480
I've had good dreams.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.720
A little bit, a little bit.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.240
And then the other thing about it

37:52.240 --> 37:55.160
that I think is much more functional and grounded

37:55.160 --> 37:58.440
is Alex says at the beginning that he was born again

37:58.440 --> 38:00.840
at eight or nine when we know that he was a Satanist.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.360
Yup.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
To his teens.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
When you were born again.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.480
This timeline doesn't work.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.160
When you were born again, at eight or nine,

38:10.160 --> 38:12.280
had you already paid for the abortions

38:12.280 --> 38:14.000
or would that come later?

38:14.000 --> 38:14.640
Yeah.

38:14.640 --> 38:18.640
Is this before or after the Satanists tried to lure you

38:18.640 --> 38:21.040
and you were a functional Satanist until you were 18?

38:21.040 --> 38:22.560
Listen, I was a Satanist for a while.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.160
I was born again at eight or nine.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.520
I was a Satanist.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.800
Look, if you're not a Satanist when you're young,

38:28.800 --> 38:30.600
you have no heart.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.040
The problem with stories like this that are obviously

38:34.040 --> 38:37.280
fucking artificial and not true and played up

38:37.280 --> 38:40.320
for the presentation of this, the person

38:40.320 --> 38:42.520
that Alex wants the people to see him as,

38:42.520 --> 38:44.000
is you can't keep it straight.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.320
It just doesn't make sense.

38:45.320 --> 38:45.800
No.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.480
This timeline is ridiculous.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.240
So yeah, he was born again at eight

38:50.240 --> 38:52.640
and then went to the devil for a little while

38:52.640 --> 38:54.720
and then came back.

38:54.720 --> 38:55.400
I don't know.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.000
That's why all mythologies wound up in books,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.160
because they were like, eh, I'm telling you,

39:00.160 --> 39:01.600
I think Zeus did it this way.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.520
And somebody else is like, nah, nah, nah, Zeus is crazy, man.

39:04.520 --> 39:05.040
Yeah.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.440
Eventually, you've got to put it in a book.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.880
Otherwise, nobody's going to agree.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.760
Oral tradition has a way of changing stories

39:09.760 --> 39:12.640
a little bit over time, because of the different ways

39:12.640 --> 39:14.440
the different tellers would tell stories.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.000
You got it.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.080
So this goes on.

39:17.080 --> 39:20.600
Alex keeps talking like a deranged lunatic.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.840
Well, we have different words.

39:21.840 --> 39:22.640
Well, that's fair.

39:22.640 --> 39:26.200
And it is just, I mean, last night, man,

39:26.200 --> 39:29.960
I woke up really upset about 2 AM and everything.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.640
I'm like really upset about the world and really upset.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.280
And I said, I said, God, I'm going to pray.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.440
I'm going to go back to sleep.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.400
Please, please help me.

39:36.400 --> 39:42.880
And man, it was just, it was just unbelievable.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.120
There's no way to describe this.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.640
And I've never seen any of this in art and literature,

39:47.640 --> 39:48.920
because a lot of stuff I've seen,

39:48.920 --> 39:50.720
I've seen in movies and culture.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.480
Other humans have seen that archetype.

39:52.480 --> 39:56.440
I'm seeing stuff that has never been seen on this planet.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.280
And you can say, oh, your mind created that.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.000
Well, then, wow, that's quite a mind.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.280
But I'm telling the Satanists, you are missing out.

40:04.280 --> 40:07.520
You have no idea what you're missing out on.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.280
I just, it's unbelievable.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.400
All right, I'm getting metaphysical.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.280
I'm going to stop right there.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.080
All I'm saying is I want to stay on air.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.800
I need the temporal funds to do this.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.600
And we spend a lot of money running this operation.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.720
I pay the crew pretty good.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.880
And I don't want to have to do a lot of things here.

40:21.880 --> 40:22.600
I don't want to cut back.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.240
I want to expand.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.480
So go to mvollwarstor.com.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.400
That's the end of his long rant about the God giving him

40:31.400 --> 40:32.760
visions and stuff.

40:32.760 --> 40:37.560
Satanists have no concept of what it's like.

40:37.560 --> 40:41.200
So what I'm going to do is immediately

40:41.200 --> 40:45.480
take the Lord's name in vain and ask for your temporal money.

40:45.480 --> 40:49.000
I am going to tell you all about how great the Lord is.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.680
And how I'm special and have visions inside God's eye.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.320
And when I go to bed, when you go to bed,

40:55.320 --> 40:58.200
you just maybe have a memory that you replay in your head.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.640
No, I go to heaven.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.560
Absolutely.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.360
And in heaven.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.240
And I need money.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.440
And then I come back down and I break commandments left

41:05.440 --> 41:07.280
and right because I'm so good.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.160
It's great.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.600
It's really great.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.800
Also, I love the idea that he's seen things that

41:11.800 --> 41:13.720
have never been seen on earth.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.480
I want to know what those things are.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.360
That's like a Lovecraftian description of something.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.360
I enjoy that.

41:20.360 --> 41:23.880
Art in literature does not contain these archetypes.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.200
I get what you're saying, but also describe

41:27.200 --> 41:30.000
what it looked like.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.880
It does not belong in Euclidean geometry.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.880
I imagine if he described what it looked like,

41:34.880 --> 41:37.320
I could probably find some literature or art.

41:37.320 --> 41:37.960
Yeah.

41:37.960 --> 41:40.880
I think he saw an angle that looked acute,

41:40.880 --> 41:42.280
but acted as if it was obtuse.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.520
I looked at the standard model, and it turns out

41:48.520 --> 41:50.440
there are more particles.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.440
So Alex gets into talking about COVID

41:53.440 --> 41:55.440
and how it's a globalist attack, right, of course.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.280
Sure.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.800
But one of the things I really appreciate about Alex

41:59.800 --> 42:01.960
is that he's a man with good priorities.

42:01.960 --> 42:04.800
And he knows what, like, if you're going down a track

42:04.800 --> 42:06.960
and something more important comes up,

42:06.960 --> 42:08.680
kind of got to go for it.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.800
Italian lawmaker calls for the arrest of creepy Bill Gates

42:11.800 --> 42:14.360
in charges of crimes against humanity.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.520
And more and more scientists, more and more lawyers

42:16.520 --> 42:17.880
are coming out and saying, that's

42:17.880 --> 42:21.480
what this is, is a medical weaponized globalist takeover.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.680
And the sooner we rake up the horror

42:23.680 --> 42:25.160
and that our acquiescence to tyranny

42:25.160 --> 42:27.440
encourage these monsters to launch this,

42:27.440 --> 42:28.760
the sooner we're able to stop it.

42:28.760 --> 42:29.960
That's coming up.

42:29.960 --> 42:33.080
But Brian Stelter is one of the nastiest people on Earth.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.320
And he's a liar.

42:35.320 --> 42:35.800
What?

42:35.800 --> 42:36.720
He's an anti-American.

42:36.720 --> 42:37.920
He's a defamer.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.200
He's somebody that goes around against people deplatformed,

42:40.200 --> 42:41.600
like myself.

42:41.600 --> 42:45.400
He literally stalked 20-plus advertisers

42:45.400 --> 42:47.520
and ran them off by threatening to do pieces on them

42:47.520 --> 42:48.760
and call them white supremacists.

42:48.760 --> 42:49.960
He's a terrorist.

42:49.960 --> 42:50.640
Sure.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.280
Sure.

42:51.280 --> 42:51.800
Sure.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.200
Economic terrorist.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.360
And what he is is a sack of garbage

42:55.360 --> 42:56.800
who acts all powerful and manly.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.400
He is America's enemy.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.800
OK, all right.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.520
Thought we were going to talk about COVID.

43:02.520 --> 43:03.960
Turns out you're mad at Stelter.

43:03.960 --> 43:10.360
I do appreciate that, of all people, Brian Stelter

43:10.360 --> 43:12.360
is our big bad today.

43:12.360 --> 43:15.840
You know, it's super weird to me that you

43:15.840 --> 43:20.120
have such a hatred towards Conor Friedersdorf.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.720
You complain about him so much less than Alex

43:22.720 --> 43:24.120
does about Brian Stelter.

43:24.120 --> 43:26.840
I haven't talked about Friedersdorf in a year.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.040
That's what I'm saying.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.800
I'm Frieders free, OK?

43:29.800 --> 43:30.520
That's what I do.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.880
Alex needs to take some cues from you and let it go.

43:32.880 --> 43:33.880
Just let it go.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.680
You don't need to read it.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.880
You don't need to be so mad at Stelter.

43:37.880 --> 43:41.960
Although, if you believe Alex, then his anger and hatred

43:41.960 --> 43:45.000
at Stelter is actually paid some dividends.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
If anything was ever an enemy of the country,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.280
it's Brian Stelter.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.480
And I can tell you, my rant from four years ago,

43:51.480 --> 43:54.400
calling him enemy of the people, I didn't know this,

43:54.400 --> 43:56.120
but a certain national talk show hosted others,

43:56.120 --> 43:58.080
sent it around everybody, and Trump got it,

43:58.080 --> 43:59.320
I recently learned, and that's where

43:59.320 --> 44:00.680
enemy of the people came from.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.600
So I am kind of the unofficial speech writer,

44:02.600 --> 44:04.200
I guess, at some level for a lot of folks,

44:04.200 --> 44:05.440
which I'm very honored to do.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.560
OK.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.480
So Trump took enemy of the people

44:08.480 --> 44:11.560
from Alex when he was talking about the press.

44:11.560 --> 44:15.560
Look, a phrase like that has never

44:15.560 --> 44:17.840
before been uttered in literature

44:17.840 --> 44:19.120
or in any kind of art.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.000
No archetypes.

44:20.000 --> 44:20.800
Nothing.

44:20.800 --> 44:25.360
That is brand new, straight from Alex's mouth to Trump's ears.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.520
I don't believe this, first of all.

44:27.520 --> 44:31.120
But second of all, if true, not something necessarily

44:31.120 --> 44:32.040
brag-worthy.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.440
That's kind of a pretty bad thing.

44:33.440 --> 44:36.120
No, I gave him a phrase.

44:36.120 --> 44:40.680
So Alex is complaining here about some stuff.

44:40.680 --> 44:41.160
Sure.

44:41.160 --> 44:42.400
And mic down for this, because I actually

44:42.400 --> 44:43.720
think that this is really hilarious.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.080
This is one of the funnier things I've heard in a while.

44:46.080 --> 44:48.640
I know the average man's watching baseball,

44:48.640 --> 44:51.840
his buddy's eating pizza and drinking beer at a bar tonight.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.840
And that sounds great to me, too, OK?

44:53.840 --> 44:55.040
In fact, if we weren't in so much trouble,

44:55.040 --> 44:57.680
I'd be buying season tickets to baseball and football

44:57.680 --> 44:58.520
and the NBA.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.600
I love it all.

44:59.600 --> 45:00.560
I like basketball.

45:00.560 --> 45:01.320
I like boxing.

45:01.320 --> 45:02.440
I like the Olympics.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.160
Man, I'd be happier than a pig in you know what if this wasn't.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.320
But I can't do it, because the whole thing's

45:07.320 --> 45:08.600
coming down on us.

45:08.600 --> 45:13.760
So what I'm doing at night is reading the UN documents.

45:13.760 --> 45:17.080
So here are the reasons I find this hilarious.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.080
The first is that Alex constantly

45:19.080 --> 45:21.000
pretends that he hates sports, because it's just

45:21.000 --> 45:23.480
the media's way of pacifying men's instinct

45:23.480 --> 45:24.760
towards conflict in battle.

45:24.760 --> 45:26.320
I was going to say, that blew me away.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.680
I was like, you hate sports.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.800
He gives a speech about it every single Super Bowl Sunday.

45:30.800 --> 45:31.520
Every one.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.200
It's ridiculous.

45:32.200 --> 45:32.800
Every one.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.360
The second thing that's really funny

45:34.360 --> 45:37.320
is how long it took Alex to come up with UN documents.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.840
What is it that I stay up late reading?

45:39.840 --> 45:42.160
I am reading.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.640
Fuck.

45:43.640 --> 45:46.240
Finally, this is hilarious, because this entire show

45:46.240 --> 45:48.320
is based on the idea that nothing is ever

45:48.320 --> 45:49.720
going back to normal.

45:49.720 --> 45:52.920
And yet here, Alex is decrying how the average man is watching

45:52.920 --> 45:54.680
sports at a bar with their friends,

45:54.680 --> 45:57.800
which Alex can't do because he's too busy with UN documents.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.240
Should the average people he's mad

45:59.240 --> 46:01.280
at not be able to go to a bar and watch sports

46:01.280 --> 46:02.800
because of Fauci's dictatorship?

46:02.800 --> 46:05.320
See, what it is is the government has you.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.160
They've been keeping you inside for a year,

46:07.160 --> 46:08.720
and they want to keep you inside for a year.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.760
Now obviously, everybody's out and about tonight.

46:10.760 --> 46:11.760
They have a great time.

46:11.760 --> 46:14.320
Everybody's having a great old time.

46:14.320 --> 46:16.080
This might sound kind of like nitpicking,

46:16.080 --> 46:17.280
but it's really more something that I

46:17.280 --> 46:19.320
want to use as a demonstration about how deeply

46:19.320 --> 46:21.480
seated Alex's narcissism is.

46:21.480 --> 46:23.800
His presentation of himself as a superior person

46:23.800 --> 46:25.600
because he fights imaginary globalists

46:25.600 --> 46:27.480
is more important to him than staying consistent

46:27.480 --> 46:29.960
with his ideas that people can't do normal things like go

46:29.960 --> 46:32.800
to bars with their friends anymore.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.040
You see the priorities there.

46:34.040 --> 46:37.040
Yeah, when anything gets in the way of Alex saying

46:37.040 --> 46:41.120
he's exceptional, it is out of the way as soon as possible.

46:41.120 --> 46:44.880
Alex will give up on any narrative

46:44.880 --> 46:47.520
for telling you how great he is.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.040
So Tucker Carlson is coming under fire

46:50.040 --> 46:52.760
from Chelsea Clinton about these vaccine comments.

46:52.760 --> 46:56.120
And Alex does the whole like, if you're vaccinated,

46:56.120 --> 46:58.640
why should you care if I get vaccinated routine, which

46:58.640 --> 47:03.480
is very dumb, but it works on folks.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.040
So he's doing that.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.360
He's going through this.

47:06.360 --> 47:09.440
And then he remembers the George Carlin bit.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.560
Oh, no.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.480
And this is one of his suggestions.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.640
Bring Pattison to deliver it.

47:14.640 --> 47:18.560
Actually studies it's swimming in swamps

47:18.560 --> 47:23.640
in the area you live in, and that means in sewage.

47:23.640 --> 47:24.960
Is that what we think swamp is?

47:24.960 --> 47:26.440
It's where the bears and the bees

47:26.440 --> 47:30.640
and the buffalo and the deer and the bobcats and the fish.

47:30.640 --> 47:31.640
That's the flora.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.320
You basically, that's the inoculation is Mother Earth.

47:34.320 --> 47:37.720
Don't swim in sewage.

47:37.720 --> 47:38.960
This is not good advice.

47:38.960 --> 47:39.560
All right.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.120
This is not revolutionary.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.680
You should not, instead of getting vaccinated,

47:43.680 --> 47:45.920
it's not a good idea just to jump in.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.120
So what you want to do, all right,

47:48.120 --> 47:49.720
you get this little cocktail.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.400
You put some Ebola in it.

47:51.400 --> 47:53.080
You're immune to Ebola.

47:53.080 --> 47:53.720
Makes sense.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.360
I shouldn't expect much more from somebody who thinks

47:56.360 --> 47:58.040
Mike Adams is a good doctor.

47:58.040 --> 47:58.840
Yeah.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.040
But yeah, don't jump into sewage tanks.

48:01.040 --> 48:01.520
No.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.400
It's not good for you.

48:02.400 --> 48:05.600
And swamps are an ecosystem, not just a toilet.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.120
Right.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.040
There is that as well.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.800
There's more than just the toilet of swamps.

48:09.800 --> 48:10.480
Yeah, yeah.

48:10.480 --> 48:15.320
Swamp thing wasn't poop thing.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.280
Shit thing.

48:16.280 --> 48:19.400
So this next clip is a little bit rough.

48:19.400 --> 48:20.720
It's a little offensive.

48:20.720 --> 48:23.760
Alex has found a clip from a protest.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.840
And I don't really know what all the circumstances are in it.

48:26.840 --> 48:30.920
But from what I can tell from the limited amount of context

48:30.920 --> 48:33.680
that's in the clip, it appears that some organizer

48:33.680 --> 48:35.240
at a protest took issue with some

48:35.240 --> 48:38.000
of the behavior of one of the white participants

48:38.000 --> 48:41.280
of the protest that was probably not

48:41.280 --> 48:45.880
in line with what the people who were doing the protest wanted

48:45.880 --> 48:47.520
to be how things were presented.

48:47.520 --> 48:49.480
Look, there's a reason people teach you

48:49.480 --> 48:51.800
how to protest at these things.

48:51.800 --> 48:52.400
There's a way.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.800
Yeah, and it can be disrespectful to the larger

48:55.800 --> 48:59.320
point of the protest if people are working across purposes.

48:59.320 --> 49:04.520
And that's what it seems like is going on in this video.

49:04.520 --> 49:09.880
Alex takes this and gets wildly racist.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.440
I don't hate white people because there's

49:11.440 --> 49:12.960
some racist white people.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.640
I don't hate black people because there's

49:14.640 --> 49:16.320
some racist black people.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.040
I judge people according to what they do, who they are.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.200
That's common sense, like Martin Luther King said.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.920
That's why America believed in what he said,

49:22.920 --> 49:26.120
because it was true and brotherly love

49:26.120 --> 49:28.080
that Christ talked about.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.600
But I have dozens of videos just today

49:30.600 --> 49:34.440
of whites being shot, stabbed, beat up because they're white,

49:34.440 --> 49:37.120
told you're not welcome here because you're white.

49:37.120 --> 49:42.560
And the hatred of these young black people's faces

49:42.560 --> 49:44.920
is palpable.

49:44.920 --> 49:48.120
But I notice most of the time, and I've

49:48.120 --> 49:50.800
looked at some studies on this, they're not even Africans,

49:50.800 --> 49:52.880
but where they're like 100% African.

49:52.880 --> 49:53.400
Oh my god.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.680
They're usually mulatto.

49:54.680 --> 49:55.960
They're usually part white.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.720
And now we learn, like Kaepernick and others,

49:58.720 --> 50:01.600
their parents are white liberals and have basically

50:01.600 --> 50:02.560
done this to them.

50:02.560 --> 50:05.320
Like, why is it always white skinned black folks that

50:05.320 --> 50:06.680
are being really anti-white?

50:06.680 --> 50:08.720
There's some really black folks that are doing this.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.840
That's because they have white parents.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.040
They're either adopted or one of the parents

50:12.040 --> 50:13.000
is white.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.760
And the left has done this.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.480
This is their communist revolution

50:16.480 --> 50:18.840
hidden behind black people so they

50:18.840 --> 50:21.960
can do this in claimants for black people's empowerment.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.480
So that's pretty offensive just on the surface level.

50:24.480 --> 50:28.320
And I don't feel like we need to break down exactly why that's

50:28.320 --> 50:29.320
incredibly fucked up.

50:29.320 --> 50:32.640
I mean, if you want me to just scream for about 15 straight

50:32.640 --> 50:33.360
minutes, yeah.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.680
I also think that if people who've been listening

50:35.680 --> 50:37.840
to our show for a while, they'd recognize

50:37.840 --> 50:40.600
this isn't necessarily an uncommon sentiment for Alex

50:40.600 --> 50:43.240
to express, despite it being horrible.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.720
I mean, it's, yeah.

50:44.720 --> 50:47.960
You know, if this were the first time that we heard him say that,

50:47.960 --> 50:50.160
well, go back and listen to the first times

50:50.160 --> 50:51.880
that we've heard him say stuff like that.

50:51.880 --> 50:54.200
Jordan started barking and dove out my window.

50:54.200 --> 50:55.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.840
So the reason I pulled this clip is because the mentality

50:57.840 --> 51:00.200
that Alex is espousing, that these people who he's

51:00.200 --> 51:01.800
determined are not really black enough

51:01.800 --> 51:03.640
are being used to push a communist agenda

51:03.640 --> 51:05.720
to attack white people, is exactly,

51:05.720 --> 51:09.600
and I mean exactly, the argument that his spiritual predecessors

51:09.600 --> 51:11.520
like Gary Allen made when they opposed

51:11.520 --> 51:12.640
the civil rights movement.

51:12.640 --> 51:13.240
Yep.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.720
Allen's book, Communist Revolution in the Streets,

51:15.720 --> 51:17.960
lays out this mentality, and it's clear

51:17.960 --> 51:19.840
that Alex subscribes to this explanation

51:19.840 --> 51:23.000
of any kind of social justice-related activism.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.320
That's not interesting on its own.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.560
Alex is a dumb bigot, but what's fascinating

51:27.560 --> 51:30.280
is how Alex isn't stupid enough to argue against the civil

51:30.280 --> 51:32.640
rights movement, because he knows that he couldn't back up

51:32.640 --> 51:35.320
that kind of claim, and it looks a little bit too transparently

51:35.320 --> 51:36.840
bigoted through present-day eyes.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.640
Yeah, that's what I was saying a week ago or whatever,

51:39.640 --> 51:45.400
is like you can measure the same ideology being forced ever

51:45.400 --> 51:48.480
so slowly to be like, fine, you won on civil rights.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.680
Fine, we don't get slaves anymore.

51:50.680 --> 51:53.520
Fine, I'm still going to say the same shit, though.

51:53.520 --> 51:54.600
I'm going to do it.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.600
The book, Communist Revolution in the Streets,

51:56.600 --> 51:59.120
is mostly an attack on Martin Luther King Jr.

51:59.120 --> 52:02.080
So forgive me if I think it's a little bit funny for Alex

52:02.080 --> 52:05.080
to signal some imaginary support for King's ideas

52:05.080 --> 52:07.680
while using the exact same playbook his heroes used

52:07.680 --> 52:10.240
to attempt to discredit and demonize King himself

52:10.240 --> 52:12.240
while he was alive.

52:12.240 --> 52:15.000
This is bullshit, but it's important to recognize this.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.320
When Alex has glimmers like that, there is severe racism,

52:18.320 --> 52:20.520
but it's also these same ideas that

52:20.520 --> 52:25.400
have been bubbling under these hard-right forces that

52:25.400 --> 52:27.400
were in favor of segregation.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.200
They were against the entirety of the civil rights movement.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.240
Yeah, no, absolutely.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.480
And it's that same mentality that still underpins Alex,

52:34.480 --> 52:36.640
but he's smart enough to know that he

52:36.640 --> 52:39.800
would be called some horrible, accurate names

52:39.800 --> 52:41.680
if he argued like that.

52:41.680 --> 52:46.000
But even then, it goes all the way back to fucking slavery.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.760
It goes all the way back to being like, oh, well,

52:48.760 --> 52:51.760
see, whenever you allow miscegenation,

52:51.760 --> 52:55.800
the ones who are more white are more likely to cause it.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.520
And it's just fucking, it's slavery.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.480
It's the same shit.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.200
Yeah, there's that sort of influence

53:01.200 --> 53:03.480
and then this other influence that comes in.

53:03.480 --> 53:07.360
Yeah, it's all just very, very shocking and horrible.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.800
Anyway, that's, you know, who Alex is.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.520
Yeah, yeah, he's shocking and horrible and a bigot.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.880
It's not necessarily news, but it's

53:12.880 --> 53:14.600
important to recognize these things when they're here.

53:14.600 --> 53:15.440
Shocking, horrible bigot.

53:15.440 --> 53:15.920
Yeah.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.400
Also, he's been in God's mind.

53:17.400 --> 53:17.880
Yeah.

53:17.880 --> 53:20.760
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

53:20.760 --> 53:24.040
Hey, I wonder if it's all white in God's mind.

53:24.040 --> 53:24.760
I bet it is.

53:24.760 --> 53:26.080
I think it might be, Dan.

53:26.080 --> 53:29.000
So you might notice from watching Alex's show

53:29.000 --> 53:31.040
that all of his guests are complete lunatics who

53:31.040 --> 53:32.920
believe mostly the same things he does

53:32.920 --> 53:36.040
and say, not only that, but Alex, hey, aren't you great?

53:36.040 --> 53:37.520
And they like to flatter him, yeah.

53:37.520 --> 53:38.040
Love to.

53:38.040 --> 53:38.920
Love to flatter him.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.120
That's how you win.

53:40.120 --> 53:41.920
And you might think, like, why doesn't he

53:41.920 --> 53:43.520
have other guests on the show?

53:43.520 --> 53:45.160
For many reasons.

53:45.160 --> 53:48.240
Well, I have a lot of great guests on the show.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.040
We invite communists and globalists on.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.440
They won't come on, but everybody we have on regularly

53:52.440 --> 53:54.240
are smart.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.160
But right up there at the top is Robert Barnes,

53:56.160 --> 53:57.880
great lawyer.

53:57.880 --> 54:00.840
Barnes, so smart.

54:00.840 --> 54:02.720
Yeah, so commies and globalists have

54:02.720 --> 54:07.320
been invited, but the RSVP comes back not attending.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.640
Yeah, yeah.

54:08.640 --> 54:10.200
You know, I believe that.

54:10.200 --> 54:11.040
I don't know.

54:11.040 --> 54:15.240
I've been saying good work Barnes very dismissively.

54:15.240 --> 54:17.000
But now that I know Pat has tried stand up,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.080
he might be the dumber lawyer at this point.

54:19.080 --> 54:22.600
Yeah, it's neck and neck.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.160
Yeah, that's tough.

54:25.160 --> 54:28.160
Trying stand up comedy really lowers your.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.840
You know what's interesting is I do

54:29.840 --> 54:32.480
think that Alex does invite some people on.

54:32.480 --> 54:34.600
I don't know when lately there's been

54:34.600 --> 54:36.680
anybody who would be an interesting booking.

54:36.680 --> 54:40.200
But you know, you have the people like David Rothschild

54:40.200 --> 54:43.400
or like the weatherman.

54:43.400 --> 54:47.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.800
The moment you ask me for a poll, it's gone.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.920
I could have pulled it two seconds ago.

54:51.920 --> 54:52.480
Yeah.

54:52.480 --> 54:53.160
Bill.

54:53.160 --> 54:53.960
Bill Ayers.

54:53.960 --> 54:54.680
Yes.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.480
Yeah, so there are those interviews that have happened

54:57.480 --> 55:00.160
and like Alex comes out looking terrible.

55:00.160 --> 55:00.960
Oh, yeah.

55:00.960 --> 55:03.160
And so like, yeah, I guess maybe in the past

55:03.160 --> 55:05.640
he would have put out more feelers for globalists

55:05.640 --> 55:07.880
and commies in his definitions.

55:07.880 --> 55:09.080
But they don't go well.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.080
Those interviews are embarrassing.

55:11.080 --> 55:14.440
No, and you can't do them now because if somebody comes in

55:14.440 --> 55:17.880
and he starts getting religious, boy, it's going to get bad.

55:17.880 --> 55:19.920
Yeah, imagine if you had David Rothschild on now

55:19.920 --> 55:21.560
and Alex is just screaming about the fucking devil.

55:21.560 --> 55:23.080
The real fucking devil.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.600
I mean, Bill Ayers would be like, whoa,

55:25.600 --> 55:27.600
and then just leave.

55:27.600 --> 55:28.520
You're a Satanist.

55:28.520 --> 55:29.480
You're the devil.

55:29.480 --> 55:30.400
I am with God.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.880
I've seen his mind.

55:31.880 --> 55:35.320
Oh, click.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
Wow.

55:36.320 --> 55:37.200
Yeah, right.

55:37.200 --> 55:37.720
OK.

55:37.720 --> 55:42.200
So Barnes thinks that the Chauvin trial is a show trial.

55:42.200 --> 55:42.720
Nice.

55:42.720 --> 55:43.480
And he has a reason.

55:43.480 --> 55:44.240
Oh, he's starting to stay.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.840
Why are you saying this is such a fraud

55:45.840 --> 55:48.000
and where do you see it going?

55:48.000 --> 55:48.600
Two parts.

55:48.600 --> 55:50.560
One is that Chauvin had agreed to plead

55:50.560 --> 55:53.760
guilty to third degree murder before the trial.

55:53.760 --> 55:57.280
And so that put him in jail potentially for 20 years.

55:57.280 --> 56:00.320
And it was Bill Barr who blew it up.

56:00.320 --> 56:04.560
And so if they were serious about getting an outcome that

56:04.560 --> 56:07.160
could meet the facts, they already had that in the bag

56:07.160 --> 56:08.640
and they chose not to.

56:08.640 --> 56:11.840
So this is very much a Soviet style show trial

56:11.840 --> 56:15.440
simply because they refused to do a reasonable plea deal.

56:15.440 --> 56:18.840
And the trial is for public consumption almost entirely.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.800
So Derek Chauvin had offered to plead guilty

56:21.800 --> 56:24.960
to third degree murder and William Barr did reject that.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.720
But the details of the situation aren't

56:26.720 --> 56:29.480
being captured by super lawyer Robert Barnes.

56:29.480 --> 56:32.800
One of the primary issues is that according to an ABC News

56:32.800 --> 56:35.400
article Chauvin, quote, asked to serve his time

56:35.400 --> 56:37.280
in a federal prison and wanted assurances

56:37.280 --> 56:40.200
that he wouldn't face federal civil rights charges.

56:40.200 --> 56:42.280
Because he was asking for federal guarantees,

56:42.280 --> 56:44.880
the deal needed to be approved by the Department of Justice.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.680
But Barr, quote, wanted to allow state prosecutors

56:47.680 --> 56:50.000
to make their own decisions about how to proceed.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.560
Seems like that state autonomy thing Alex and his buddies

56:52.560 --> 56:54.960
yell about all the time being put into action.

56:54.960 --> 56:55.560
Yeah.

56:55.560 --> 56:58.680
And also Barr being like, I don't want to touch this.

56:58.680 --> 56:59.840
You guys deal with it.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.920
Also the fact that Chauvin was willing to plead

57:01.920 --> 57:04.160
to third degree murder is probably not a great sign.

57:04.160 --> 57:09.440
No, if you say he's willing to plead to third degree murder,

57:09.440 --> 57:12.000
wouldn't you want to then defend the murder

57:12.000 --> 57:14.640
charge instead of being like, the whole trial's

57:14.640 --> 57:15.400
illegitimate.

57:15.400 --> 57:18.120
Also the way that he's presenting

57:18.120 --> 57:20.920
is it's a show trial because they didn't accept

57:20.920 --> 57:23.000
what is a reasonable plea.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.980
And that's your determination Barr.

57:25.980 --> 57:27.480
You have determined that this is what

57:27.480 --> 57:28.600
would be a reasonable plea.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.360
That's not necessarily what the prosecution believes

57:31.360 --> 57:32.480
or the state.

57:32.480 --> 57:35.680
Yeah, justice doesn't exist unless it's equally applied.

57:35.680 --> 57:37.000
So that's it.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.160
So the real issue, though, is that this trial

57:39.160 --> 57:41.600
is just happening because it's a demonstration

57:41.600 --> 57:44.200
that the left wants to put on, that they

57:44.200 --> 57:45.520
can do whatever they want.

57:45.520 --> 57:46.400
Sure.

57:46.400 --> 57:47.120
So let me ask this.

57:47.120 --> 57:47.840
We've got a minute to break.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.160
What is the left looking for?

57:49.160 --> 57:52.520
Just rubber stamp what they want?

57:52.520 --> 57:54.800
I think the left wants him hung.

57:54.800 --> 57:56.760
The left wants him legally lynched.

57:56.760 --> 57:59.400
And the left wants to show they can use and weaponize

57:59.400 --> 58:02.600
the prosecutorial process to validate and vindicate

58:02.600 --> 58:04.680
their media narratives to help push

58:04.680 --> 58:06.600
a particular politicized agenda.

58:06.600 --> 58:10.120
Sure, so like anybody they want burned, they can burn.

58:10.120 --> 58:10.800
Exactly.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.720
That's the point, to show this is what we can do.

58:12.720 --> 58:13.720
Y'all need woke insurance.

58:13.720 --> 58:16.480
We can do it any time we want, any place we want,

58:16.480 --> 58:18.480
even to a police officer.

58:18.480 --> 58:20.160
I think that there's other issues.

58:20.160 --> 58:23.160
Like a guy died.

58:23.160 --> 58:23.960
Well, there's that.

58:23.960 --> 58:25.860
I don't think it's anyone, any time.

58:25.860 --> 58:28.480
I think there's specific circumstances that are.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.440
I would imagine that in this case,

58:30.440 --> 58:35.880
committing a murder is probably more important for the left.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.120
Well, I mean, look.

58:37.120 --> 58:39.680
That he committed a murder, not we want to commit a murder.

58:39.680 --> 58:42.520
They can burn anybody they want at any point, no big deal.

58:42.520 --> 58:46.320
As long as you murder somebody, we can burn the shit out of you.

58:46.320 --> 58:48.900
Anybody who murders, even cops.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.720
As long as there's a body, they can just jam you up.

58:51.720 --> 58:55.000
Just lie about how you murdered somebody, you know?

58:55.000 --> 58:59.160
So, you know, we got on the right, we have a lot of groups,

58:59.160 --> 59:01.880
people like the Oath Keepers, people like the Proud Boys,

59:01.880 --> 59:03.840
certainly.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.520
But Brian Stelter is a terrorist.

59:05.520 --> 59:06.000
Definitely.

59:06.000 --> 59:06.760
Yes.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.340
But you have these groups, and there's

59:08.340 --> 59:11.400
been pretty well-documented interaction between them

59:11.400 --> 59:15.520
and law enforcement, some overlap even.

59:15.520 --> 59:19.880
But Robert Barnes wants you to know that people like Antifa,

59:19.880 --> 59:23.120
they are actually the Nazi brown shirts.

59:23.120 --> 59:24.560
That sounds right.

59:24.560 --> 59:27.800
They want to triangulate BLM Antifa and the FBI

59:27.800 --> 59:30.380
and use the military on the people.

59:30.380 --> 59:32.840
Don't they get that will cause an internal civil war

59:32.840 --> 59:34.600
guaranteed?

59:34.600 --> 59:36.920
Well, I mean, the real model they're looking at

59:36.920 --> 59:39.080
is not so much the communist Soviet model,

59:39.080 --> 59:41.520
but is the fascist model of the 1930s.

59:41.520 --> 59:42.280
Sure.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.600
They want to know the long knives.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.240
They want to, yeah.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.120
Yep, you have your paramilitary supporters

59:47.120 --> 59:49.160
that are outside of the governmental structure that

59:49.160 --> 59:51.160
can do things that you can't do that you can use

59:51.160 --> 59:53.880
as a pretext and a predicate to do what you want to do.

59:53.880 --> 59:56.580
You create false flags events, you stage events,

59:56.580 --> 59:58.480
or you exaggerate events.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.320
I mean, I mean, the amazing, the January 6 event

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.940
is basically being treated like the Reichstag fire.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:07.040
So it's the same, except there was less violence and less

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:07.720
damage.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.160
You know who the only person I've

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.440
heard call that the Reichstag fire?

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.600
Fucking Alex Jones.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.560
Yeah, you would think.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.600
Alex spent like a week talking about inaccurate information

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.920
about Hitler's rise to power and the Reichstag fire

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.120
and how it was the January 6th storming of the capital.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.160
They were the same thing.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.160
Now Barnes is trying to say that the left is doing that.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.160
That's what the left does.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:28.880
Fucking nonsense.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.920
That's what we do, Dan.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.440
So stupid.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.920
That's what the left does.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.040
I just, I have very little patience

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.880
for this direct pretending that that's not his entire strategy.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.680
Yeah, you know, it is so fucked up

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:48.720
that they apply to us the characteristics that most

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.680
define their thought process and then describe that thought

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.160
process as disgusting.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.080
So it's like, hey, if they did do what we were doing,

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.840
we would really hate them.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.840
Because it's evil.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.320
What they're doing that sounds like what we're doing

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.800
and how we think, we'd be pissed.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.360
Totally.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.000
If they did the things that we think.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.640
Now let's interview Stuart Rhodes.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.280
Let's go ahead and get the people who

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.960
decided to overthrow the capital.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.560
So you know, there have been some unfortunate things

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.280
that I've seen popping up about the idea of like an America

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.480
First caucus.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.280
Sure.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.000
Certainly there's no historical precedent of this being shit.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.120
Just call yourselves the Know Nothing Party

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.760
and never read history.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760
Just do it, fine.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.120
It's a little much.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.840
You want a bunch of white men running around rioting

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.880
and oppressing people.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.840
You're the Know Nothings.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.320
Let's go.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.440
It's a little bit frustrating and scary.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.280
And I hope that it fizzles.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.520
That would be nice.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.440
But Alex is on that tip.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.160
He's on the vanguard of America First.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:58.680
Sure.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.720
He also knows nothing.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.120
So is Robert Barnes.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.080
Man, these are America First kind of guys.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.240
That's what caused Russians in the early 60s to defect to us.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.920
Because they saw Khrushchev acting like a maniac.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.880
Our leaders are acting worse than Khrushchev right now.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.600
By far.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.960
By a long mile.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.760
Putin looks completely reasonable compared to the way

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.960
Biden is behaving.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.000
Putin's not changing his mind every other day.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.240
He's cutting defense budgets.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:22.920
As Navalny dies.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.640
He's asking for Jay time.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.120
Great.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:26.760
Exactly.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.920
Yeah, so they're getting into some pretty serious,

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.520
like, oh, Putin's the best.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.640
As Navalny is literally starved to death

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.560
and his body is falling apart and shutting down in prison,

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:44.280
the main political rival of President Putin

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.320
is being murdered by President Putin as we speak.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.400
To be fair, he's been consistent on that front.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.600
He's really been consistent.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.720
It's kind of a thing.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.880
Yeah, America First.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.360
But also Putin's much better than our leaders.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.800
Putin's much better than our leaders in America First.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.320
Yeah, America First.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.120
And Alex, I would take this more seriously

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.200
and actually discuss some of the issues

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.560
around maybe international relations.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.520
Sure, sure, sure.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.720
But I don't feel like Alex's positions deserve the respect

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.480
of being taken seriously.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.280
I mean, listen to this nonsense.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.520
And by the way, I don't even respect a lot of generals

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.520
and a lot of top people.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.480
Some I do, but at least they've been like in 20 tours

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.880
and combat and kill people.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.000
It's all a bunch of weird Harvard women

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.760
want to have war with Putin because they're

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.080
going to show a man.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.320
It doesn't even make sense.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.720
It's insane.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.560
It's like putting a woman in the ring with Mike Tyson in 1989.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.560
It's kind of a silly way he's trying to format,

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.680
formulate this thing.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.360
Or it's like, ah, yes, these women who have feminism

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:49.960
run amuck.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.520
And that's why they're mad at Putin,

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.080
because he's too much of a man.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:59.120
Yeah, I despise educated women leading a military.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.840
What I want is bloodthirsty murderers

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.040
who went over to a different country on a lie

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.560
and killed people for no reason.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.160
That's who should be running things, Dan.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.120
Sure, sure.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.880
And if Alex is going to insist on disseminating

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.160
this kind of an idea, and I found myself

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.360
having a very similar response to a lot of stuff.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.560
And this episode's a little bit shorter,

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.120
because there's a lot of stuff that I was like, nope.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.480
Yeah, yeah, that's a big nope.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.280
And that's one of them.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.080
That's a big nope.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:27.640
It's like, nope.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.160
And I was kind of expecting that we

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160
were going to get into fucking cyber polygon.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:31.920
I know.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.440
I know.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.280
It was never going to happen.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah, it infuriates me.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.160
It was never going to happen.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:35.680
I'm sorry.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.280
Yeah.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.680
Niall, why am I apologizing to you?

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.640
That's a good question.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.560
Anyway, Alex has some more things to say.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.040
Sure.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.000
This is the last clip.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.880
Him and Barnes are having a little discussion

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.600
about how great Russia is.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.120
Sure.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:47.600
And Putin.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.080
Yeah.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.520
Deeply nationalistic country, deeply proud of their country.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.720
That's who Putin really is.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.640
He's Russia's version of Trump.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.840
That's why the deep state hates him.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.520
And it's just insane.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.720
We should be aligning with Russia on key foreign policy.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.200
I agree.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.920
And I feel the danger for my family.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:05.720
And it pisses me off, Barnes, that we're literally having.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.840
We're having some type of pissing contest

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.640
with these weird liberals.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.480
Just Putin's Christian, and Russia's Christian now.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.840
So they see it like the Midwest.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.960
They want to blow it up.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.880
This is all just essentially projecting identity politics

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.520
onto anybody who has a critique of Putin.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.000
They hate him because he's Christian,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.080
or it's just weird women who think he's too much of a man.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:27.600
Yeah.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:32.360
And yeah, it happens to be all of the identifying identity

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.400
signifiers that Alex has.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.600
So he feels himself under attack when people criticize Putin.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.360
And again, it's just like a rank level of narcissism.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.440
It's not geopolitical analysis.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.600
It's not meaningful in any way.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.240
It's just he identifies, feels himself.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.440
Yeah, I can't think of any reason

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.800
why people would be mad at what is functionally

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.440
the richest man in the world.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.000
Yeah.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.920
Even if you're just Alex and you're like,

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.360
hey, I don't believe in dynastic rulers.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.120
Sure, yeah.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.440
I'm into democracy.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.160
I hate dictators.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.520
And I definitely don't want anybody

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.440
to rule over a country for, let's say, more than two terms.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.120
Yeah, it seems like he should have just

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.800
an elementary problem there.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.680
But he doesn't.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.200
Nope.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.360
And I don't know.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.480
I think that if you look at it realistically,

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.880
I think that what it mostly is is

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.160
Alex sees a lot of his identity mirrored in Putin.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:29.640
Yeah.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.720
A lot of those things that are the surface level,

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.760
I am a white male Christian.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.360
And I think that he sees a strong person there

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.080
that he lacks that as someone to follow.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.000
Yeah, performative masculinity is

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.720
what he's really stoked about.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.360
Yeah.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.840
That's not to say that he's going

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.240
to become Putin's number one guy.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.200
No, I doubt that.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.400
It's just a continuation of these longstanding trends

01:06:59.400 --> 01:06:59.960
that he's had.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.240
It was pretty overt, though, just the love fest

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.640
of these America Firsters.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.160
Yeah, it's hard to go back and see

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.920
the vehemence with which he despises Putin

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.480
and then get to the present day where

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:15.080
it's like, Putin's probably the best thing we've got,

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.080
second, of course, to our God King Trump.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.600
Well, but he's Russia's Trump.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.440
Well, yeah.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.400
So I guess he's the God King there.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.200
And I wish we had him God Kinging us America first.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.800
Yep, it feels that way a little bit.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.400
Stupid.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:28.920
Yep.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.720
Anyway, Jordan, this episode's a little bit shorter,

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.520
and I apologize.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.240
But you know, it is what it is.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.240
Yeah.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.280
We'll be back.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:35.800
Indeed.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.360
For another episode in the near future.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.000
That's the plan.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.440
And we'll see where the wind blows us.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.600
We may be back in the past.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.000
Let's hope for Cyber Polygon.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:45.840
Fingers crossed.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.600
I've got it open on my screen right here.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.280
I was going to say, you've got that locked and loaded for sure.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.240
Anyway, we'll be back.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.200
But until then, we have a website.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:54.920
We do have a website.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.800
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.560
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.120
We are on Twitter.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.160
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.120
I go to betjordan.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:07:59.960
We're also on Facebook.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.120
We are on Facebook, and if you could,

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.440
please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.640
to help out people still protesting, still fighting.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.440
Sure.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.080
We'll be back.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.200
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:11.800
I'm Leo.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.880
I'm DZXClark.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.560
I'm the Juiciest Ice Cube.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.000
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.640
Thanks for holding.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.280
Hello, Alex.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.240
I'm a first time caller.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.000
I'm a huge fan.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.880
I love your work.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:28.440
I love you.
