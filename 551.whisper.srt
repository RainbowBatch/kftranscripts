1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
it's a downward slide. It's a downward slide is it? A couple of

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,920
greasy overgrown man-children. They have a podcast called

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,580
Knowledge Fight. Alex Jones's podcasting hecklers knowledge fight

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,600
calm. They're doing research you ever listen to the show

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,900
Knowledge Fight? Knowledge Fight? Oh, a couple of neck beards

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,920
indeed, they literally just make stuff up. They don't appreciate

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,680
literally just make stuff up.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,620
They don't ever talk about

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,260
what Alex Jones actually talked about.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,180
They don't actually say what he actually says.

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,980
They don't actually delve into his sources of information.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,260
Mr. Friesen, Mr. Friesen.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,420
I was live, you numbskulls.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,380
They're in the league with some sort of cult leader

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,460
called Selene.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,100
Knowledge Fight, mocking Infowars every single day.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,820
It's really just incredible.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
It's almost hard to comprehend.

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,320
Knowledgefight.com.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,160
I love you.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,460
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,200
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm Dan.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,380
I'm Jordan.

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,540
We're a couple dudes like Sir Raptor,

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,340
Donald T. Crouches, and talk a little bit

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,180
about Alex Jones and his sources.

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,900
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,380
Shout out to DJ Dan Arkey.

30
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,540
Oh, of course.

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,540
Thank you so much for whipping up that.

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,740
Fourth or fifth absolute banger of a track.

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,980
We're gonna close the episode

34
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,060
with a little special DJ Dan Arkey track also.

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,700
So stay tuned for that at the end of the episode.

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,100
It's incredible.

37
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,540
But yeah, hey, what's up?

38
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,220
Oh, that's right, Dan.

39
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,040
Jordan.

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
What's your bright spot?

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,460
Why don't you go first?

42
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,060
I have a little thinking to do.

43
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,660
I will tell you, I had some stressful times

44
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,660
past couple of days, and then last night

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,060
my partner was like, I'm just vibrating

46
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,860
with fury and stress and all this stuff.

47
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,420
And she's like, you know what you should do?

48
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,580
You should take a bath.

49
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,580
So I took a downright ecstatic bath.

50
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,300
I absolute.

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,620
This makes me furious.

52
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,460
Incredible.

53
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,860
So what I did, I used a whole thing of bath salts.

54
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,700
That's twice as much as you're supposed to use.

55
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,380
Maybe, I mean, depends on the size of the bag.

56
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,940
Deep relaxation is what it was called.

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,780
I had that, I had the Cubs game on my computer.

58
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
I could watch that.

59
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,700
And I had my vape pen to my left hand.

60
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,900
It was the best.

61
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,740
Nice.

62
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,560
It was the best.

63
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm happy for you.

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,140
Although this really, really sets me off

65
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,860
because I do feel like.

66
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,580
You don't own baths.

67
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,420
No, no, no.

68
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,240
That's not why.

69
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Oh, okay.

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
I'm happy for you to enjoy a bath.

71
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,740
Okay, thank you.

72
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,580
But I do have visceral memories

73
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,100
of me telling you, yeah, baths are great.

74
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,140
And you judging me for it.

75
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,980
Of course I did.

76
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,780
And now your partner comes in and she's like,

77
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,260
hey, come on, why don't you take a bath?

78
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,380
We both haven't matured over the years.

79
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,220
Bullshit.

80
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,100
I've come more towards your direction on baths.

81
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,940
Bullshit.

82
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,760
Yeah.

83
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,380
I guess, what's your bright spot, buddy?

84
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,620
What might my bright spot be?

85
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,560
I don't know, man.

86
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,840
I've, I don't know.

87
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,460
I guess not caring.

88
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,780
Is that kind of a bright spot?

89
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,260
I would say that's kind of a bright spot.

90
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,500
I don't give a shit.

91
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,980
Like, okay, here's what I would say, I guess,

92
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,180
in terms of a bright spot.

93
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,140
Hey, there's nothing left to lose.

94
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,580
There was a, you know, I had a lot of anxiety

95
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,100
about the prospect of Knowledge Fight getting noticed.

96
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,940
Sure, sure, sure.

97
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,660
Usually by Info Wars.

98
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,860
There's something that was kind of,

99
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,940
it was always in the back of my mind

100
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,460
as like being a little bit like,

101
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,300
oh, that's kind of scary.

102
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,140
And it doesn't matter if nothing happened.

103
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,980
Nope, nothing happened.

104
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,820
Nobody cares.

105
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,740
It's fantastic.

106
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,660
It's great.

107
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,500
Best case scenario, we got a new theme song out of it.

108
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,700
That's all we needed.

109
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,060
Yeah, so like some kind of like fear that I had

110
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,380
about the acknowledgement.

111
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,220
Sure, sure.

112
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,380
And granted, maybe I'll be killed

113
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,660
by an Info Warrior tomorrow.

114
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,500
Well.

115
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,940
At this point, you know,

116
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,860
there's been a couple of harassing emails

117
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,860
and they're all from the same email address.

118
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,700
I found the guy's address really easily, so.

119
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,140
So if you're listening, buddy.

120
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,300
Yeah, congrats.

121
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Just do a little bit more security on,

122
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,780
don't send threatening emails

123
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,340
from your personal email account.

124
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,180
Try a proton mail account.

125
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,580
Yeah, yeah, something like that would be good.

126
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,420
Go for it.

127
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,740
Yeah, I mean, I'm not too worried about this nonsense.

128
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,580
It's great.

129
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,060
I think a lot of people are probably tuning in

130
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,180
and hoping to hear like sort of a deconstruction of that.

131
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,020
Naturally.

132
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,940
That's kind of, you know, that's kind of a big deal.

133
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,780
And I think they will be-

134
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,580
Everybody likes feuds, you know?

135
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,420
Sure.

136
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,260
Yeah.

137
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,500
I think they will be sorely disappointed.

138
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,860
Super.

139
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,700
I have no interest in really talking

140
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,020
about Harrison Smith's breakdown of-

141
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,860
Not at all.

142
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,700
And part of the reason is

143
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,220
because he wasn't critiquing our show.

144
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,020
He was critiquing an article that we didn't write.

145
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,860
Yeah.

146
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,700
I don't care.

147
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,540
No, I don't give a shit.

148
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,380
Give a shit.

149
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,500
Yeah.

150
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,660
So anyway, I figured the only thing we can do

151
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,700
is move ahead and do the stuff that we do.

152
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,420
And that is, we're going to be talking

153
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,860
about April 20th and 21st, 2021, Blackjack.

154
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,900
Oh, wow.

155
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,780
Man, now you see, you were doing updated 2021.

156
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,620
I almost did.

157
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,940
You almost did.

158
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,780
I almost did.

159
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,900
You can't surprise me with a bit change mid-bit.

160
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,060
I surprised myself.

161
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,980
Yeah, so we're just going to do business as usual.

162
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,820
We're going to be talking about-

163
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,900
And I was going to, my birthday is this weekend.

164
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,740
It is.

165
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,580
And so one of the things that I was going to do

166
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,260
is I was going to treat myself to going back to 2003.

167
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,100
Mm-hmm.

168
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,860
But I just felt like, you know,

169
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,780
we've got the issue with the Chauvin trial.

170
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,620
Sure.

171
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,380
And I think that it probably is more important

172
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,220
that we go ahead and talk about that.

173
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,060
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,820
And take care of some of this present day business.

175
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,660
Not a bad business.

176
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,620
And what better present I could give myself

177
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,340
than to do some work?

178
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,740
As usual.

179
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,100
So Jordan, we're going to get into business on this,

180
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,860
but before we do, you take a little moment to say,

181
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,980
hey-o, what's up to some new wands?

182
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,100
That's a great idea.

183
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,300
So first, Paul Joseph Watson's laminated map of solitude.

184
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,140
Thank you so much.

185
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,180
You are now a policy wonk.

186
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,220
I'm a policy wonk.

187
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,380
Hey-o, Paul Joseph Watson's, et cetera.

188
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,460
Rude.

189
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,140
Next, Bigsby Smalls should point out that's a dog.

190
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,980
Thank you so much.

191
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,020
You are now a policy wonk.

192
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,140
I'm a policy wonk.

193
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,540
Hey-o, Bigsby Smalls.

194
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,420
Next, Rachel.

195
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,260
Thank you so much.

196
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,100
You are now a policy wonk.

197
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,300
I'm a policy wonk.

198
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,060
Hey-o, Rachel.

199
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,620
Every time you shake your head, it gives me hope.

200
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,260
Like I'm fed by it.

201
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,180
I'm growing stronger when you shake your head.

202
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,460
Next, this one's actually possible.

203
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,860
There's two possible names, so you

204
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,580
could choose which one you prefer at the end of it.

205
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,140
OK, all right.

206
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,660
First is The Most Delicious Hamburger in the Galaxy.

207
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,580
And the second is Simon's Disappointed Dad.

208
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,060
First or second?

209
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,780
I'm going to have to go with second, just

210
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,060
for non-personal reasons.

211
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,780
All right, Simon's Disappointed Dad, you are now a policy wonk.

212
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
I'm a policy wonk.

213
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,380
Hey-o, Simon's Disappointed Dad.

214
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,980
I gave you eyebrow raise that time.

215
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,100
I know, it might be the last time.

216
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,140
Next, it's pronounced A-T-A-T, not At-At.

217
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,860
Thank you so much.

218
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,500
You are now a policy wonk.

219
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm a policy wonk.

220
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,820
Hey-o, Mr. At-At Imperial Walker.

221
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,460
That was straight at you, Jordan.

222
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,700
Yes, it was.

223
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,820
And I'd like to give a little technocrat shout out

224
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,460
to a couple of folks out there.

225
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,100
Tom and Kelsey, thank you so much.

226
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,500
You are now a technocrat, or two technocrats in a pod.

227
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,660
I'm a policy wonk.

228
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,420
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

229
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,740
Have yourself a brew.

230
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,220
How's your 401k doing, bro?

231
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,420
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson,

232
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,020
all right?

233
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,340
Let's just get down to business.

234
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,300
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

235
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,220
Why are you pimps so good?

236
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,980
My neck is freakishly large.

237
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,620
I declare info war on you.

238
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,220
Thank you so much, Tom and Kelsey.

239
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,980
Yes.

240
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,100
Two peas in a pod-lacy wonk.

241
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,420
I would call them a dick-tick in the porse.

242
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,140
Policy wonk force?

243
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,140
No, lost it.

244
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,740
Lost it.

245
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,260
OK.

246
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,220
I was trying.

247
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,980
So hey, this weekend, not only my birthday

248
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,380
coming up, very excited about that.

249
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,340
But also, I should tell you that coming to theaters and VOD,

250
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,540
the Mortal Kombat, we're sponsored by Mortal Kombat.

251
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,340
We are not sponsored by Mortal Kombat.

252
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,340
We are not sponsored by Mortal Kombat.

253
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,980
Please no.

254
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,740
Jordan, Shang Tsung got in touch with me.

255
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,700
He sent you an email from shangtsung at gmail.com.

256
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,660
It's a real threatening email.

257
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,060
All this publicity you've been getting.

258
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,180
You will take your soul.

259
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,860
All this publicity you've been getting,

260
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,340
you guys got to promote the movie.

261
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,860
No, also this weekend, though, very exciting.

262
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,340
Yes.

263
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,220
Now, I want to call myself out on this just right off the top.

264
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,460
Of course, naturally.

265
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,820
I made an incomplete note about what kind of shout-out this is.

266
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,860
So on the 24th, this Saturday, this is Shan and Jay, right?

267
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,260
They either have an anniversary or they're getting married.

268
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,060
Or.

269
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,340
So that could be your 0th anniversary.

270
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,740
Or they're going to a dog marriage.

271
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,140
No, no, no.

272
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,940
It's one of the two.

273
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,140
It's either their wedding is this Saturday

274
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,260
or it's their anniversary.

275
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,380
I think it's their wedding.

276
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,900
All right.

277
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,620
If this is your anniversary, cut this out, play it next year.

278
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,180
If it's your wedding, cut it out and play it

279
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,100
at your goddamn wedding.

280
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Congratulations, either way.

281
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes, yes.

282
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,980
Congratulations, either way.

283
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,460
And thank you for helping me remind myself.

284
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,260
I've got to write more specific notes.

285
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,900
Jeez.

286
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,580
I like the idea that you, like when

287
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,380
you said I wrote an incomplete note,

288
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,420
I had this mental picture of like that Civil War note

289
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,740
where the guy is being murdered.

290
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
It's like, ah, right at the end.

291
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,420
That's what I was looking for.

292
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,260
So Jordan, today, like I said, 20th and 21st of April.

293
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
Sure.

294
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,580
But before we get into today's episode,

295
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,180
we have a out of context drop.

296
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,260
And it comes in the form of the game show

297
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,060
that is taking over the country.

298
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,580
OK.

299
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,940
And that is, who is Alex going to tell to burn in hell?

300
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,300
Is that taking over the country?

301
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,660
We've done it a couple of times.

302
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,380
Can I get three, can I get R, S, T, L, N, and E?

303
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,940
None.

304
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,980
OK.

305
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,700
None of those.

306
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,500
OK, fine.

307
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,260
I was going to try.

308
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,940
Yeah.

309
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,140
You're going for Wheel of Fortune shit?

310
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,380
I was going for Wheel of Fortune shit.

311
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,260
None of those letters.

312
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,140
OK.

313
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,060
Do you have a guess?

314
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,260
None of those letters?

315
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,460
No.

316
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,980
No.

317
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,460
Burn in hell, CIA.

318
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,100
Burn in hell.

319
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,820
Damn it.

320
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,820
How was I supposed to know that it was those letters?

321
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,460
Well, it wasn't any of the ones you said.

322
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,900
It wasn't any of the ones I said.

323
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,420
So he wants the CIA to burn in hell.

324
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,100
Man, I am bad at Wheel of Fortune.

325
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,980
So Alex gets to talk in here.

326
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,380
We're going to start on the 20th.

327
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,220
And this is a day where, of course, in the afternoon,

328
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,300
the Derek Chauvin trial's verdict comes out.

329
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,060
But there's a good bit of anticipation surrounding that.

330
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,500
People were kind of aware that closing arguments had been done

331
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,580
and the jurors had been deliberating.

332
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,500
And Maxine Waters had come out and made some comments

333
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,740
that Alex isn't happy about.

334
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,460
Oh, of course not.

335
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,340
This will take up quite a bit of the show.

336
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,860
Yeah.

337
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,580
And then Alex.

338
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,100
But he doesn't have a problem with black women speaking.

339
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,740
Not at all.

340
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,580
No, no, no, no.

341
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,340
Not a pattern.

342
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,460
It doesn't matter in the scheme of things about George Floyd

343
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,700
or about Chauvin.

344
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
They're both humans.

345
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
They both have red blood.

346
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,620
God made them both.

347
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,300
I mean, they matter to God.

348
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,500
But to the globalist, they don't matter.

349
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,780
They're just pawns in this game.

350
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,380
I guarantee you George Floyd didn't

351
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,020
want to get addicted to methamphetamine

352
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,620
and to fentanyl.

353
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,100
And I guarantee you the cop that turned out was friends with him

354
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,980
and worked at the same club with him didn't want to kill him.

355
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,020
But they're humans.

356
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,820
And so we're flawed and things go wrong and bad things happen.

357
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,780
But now the media can sit there and divide and conquer us

358
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,500
and control us.

359
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,340
Turns out they've gone to the former home.

360
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,380
I'll cover next segment.

361
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,140
Guys got my article out there in the printer.

362
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,180
Thanks.

363
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,660
Of one of the defense witnesses.

364
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,620
Went to his home, hadn't lived there in two years,

365
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,060
threw a dead pig head on his property,

366
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,500
on the former property, and spread blood all over it.

367
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,260
We'll show you all that coming up next segment.

368
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,180
There's some of it right there.

369
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,100
Barry Brode's former residence.

370
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,780
And they went to the other jurors' homes

371
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,740
because CBS doxed them yesterday.

372
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,380
CBS said, here's who they are, so you can go harass them.

373
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,340
The Maxine Waters commentary is going

374
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,500
to be a major part of this, but where Alex begins

375
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,580
is this pig's head and the idea of CBS doxing folks.

376
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,380
So I've seen that story reported in other outlets than Infowars.

377
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm going to go ahead and assume that this act of vandalism

378
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,660
towards the defense witness's former home

379
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,340
did happen more or less at the same time.

380
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,460
Although Alex does still seem to be embellishing it a tiny bit.

381
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
Like, blood all over.

382
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Yeah, well, come on.

383
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,460
It's a better story.

384
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,580
To be clear, I am against this kind of thing,

385
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,980
and I feel like it's counterproductive

386
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
to the ability of trials to proceed.

387
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,540
According to an NBC News article,

388
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,940
the people responsible are being sought and are, quote,

389
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,380
accused of felony vandalism.

390
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,820
So there's a decent chance someone's

391
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,620
going to get in trouble for that.

392
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,940
That being said, I would be remiss

393
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,820
if I just let Alex play this game of fake outrage.

394
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,180
In November 2012, the NBC News article

395
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,740
showed that in 2020, Roger Stone was on trial.

396
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,220
And in case you don't remember, Alex

397
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,460
spent a couple of days on his show

398
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,220
trying to dox potential jurors in that case.

399
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,300
Alex didn't even know for sure that the person

400
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,900
he was naming on his show was actually even a potential juror

401
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,380
in Roger's case, but he was still going to go ahead

402
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,500
and put a target on them.

403
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,940
And so nobody else will release it.

404
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,820
That appears to be who it is with about 99% probability.

405
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,300
Oh, hey, it just appears to be who this person is.

406
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,260
Right, right.

407
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,580
I still really feel like once you have put out a bounty

408
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,660
on somebody, you don't get to be like,

409
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,740
and now they're mistreating the jurors.

410
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,820
You don't get to do that.

411
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,900
After you do this whole big thing where it's like,

412
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,500
this is the name of Roger Stone.

413
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,740
Exactly, yeah.

414
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,780
No, you lose.

415
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,660
You lose forever.

416
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,300
Goodbye.

417
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,900
Naturally, Alex felt a little bit insecure

418
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,300
about his actions because it's a very clear attempt

419
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,340
at jury tampering.

420
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,060
So he even addressed that on his show on November 6.

421
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,420
Keep in mind that Roger wouldn't be found guilty

422
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,580
until November 15.

423
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,700
This trial was still ongoing.

424
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,020
And then Media Matters goes, Jones

425
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,460
should get arrested for jury tampering and harassing jurors.

426
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,180
It's completely legal and lawful when someone's a public figure.

427
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,540
What if Brad Pitt was on the jury?

428
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,900
What if Obama was on the jury?

429
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,140
What if it was Robert Mueller?

430
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,380
What if?

431
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,300
What if it was Hillary Clinton?

432
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,620
What if it was Chelsea Clinton?

433
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,700
Oh, she got called.

434
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,540
Oh, she's on it.

435
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,940
Oh, Chelsea Clinton's going to sit

436
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,860
on the jury for Roger Stone.

437
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,820
You'd say, that's crazy.

438
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,540
Get her off.

439
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,380
It's the same thing.

440
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,620
It's one of their minions.

441
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,300
And we've got her name.

442
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,580
And we're going to release it.

443
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,100
Oh, boy.

444
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,340
Because that's what the press does.

445
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,020
I know there's a war on the press.

446
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,820
It's an interesting strategy to claim this juror that Alex was

447
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,140
talking about as a public figure on the level of Brad Pitt

448
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,900
or Hillary Clinton.

449
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,920
But that was just desperation talking

450
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,660
because he knew that Roger was guilty as shit.

451
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,820
Oh, she had a lot of hits in the late 90s.

452
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,820
She was really killing it.

453
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,820
She got her big break with Thelma and Louisa.

454
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,540
It's so convenient whenever you can just redefine public figure

455
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,980
to be suspected minion of my imaginary enemy.

456
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,660
Anyone that I despise.

457
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,500
If the people who threw a pig's head at that house

458
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,060
had thrown it at the house of a juror,

459
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,260
or if one of the jurors on the Chauvin trial

460
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,860
was being targeted, then I wouldn't

461
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,340
be OK with that at all.

462
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,260
That would fall into the same kind of category

463
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,180
as Alex's behavior.

464
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,780
But what did happen is a little bit of a gray area.

465
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,180
And again, I'm still against it.

466
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,900
But the person whose former house

467
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,620
it was was a witness for the defense who'd

468
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,580
already given their testimony.

469
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,980
You could argue that it was a retaliatory vandalism.

470
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,540
And I suspect that's why it's being considered a felony.

471
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
But I do think that that's different than trying

472
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,160
to intimidate jurors, which is what Alex was very publicly

473
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,420
doing like six months ago.

474
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Yes, very much so.

475
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,780
CBS also didn't dox anyone.

476
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,180
The local Minnesota affiliate published an article

477
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,220
that discusses the jurors, broadly speaking,

478
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,300
just vaguely in details like their age and information

479
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,340
about their perspectives.

480
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,940
CBS, damn them.

481
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,460
This is not the same thing as what Alex did.

482
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,340
If Alex can show actual instances of people showing up

483
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,100
at the jurors' homes, he should do that.

484
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,060
But I can't find instances or any evidence

485
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,500
of that being a real thing.

486
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,180
I suspect he's just taking that defense witness story

487
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,820
and then making up another story on top of it

488
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
because it's more fun.

489
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,740
I'm a huge fan of people who have really taken to heart

490
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,540
all of the historical lessons about intimidating witnesses

491
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,380
being a thing that puts you on the side of good.

492
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,500
I think that's really, you know, history judges people

493
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,940
for intimidating witnesses very positively.

494
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,100
That's kind of history's thing.

495
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,180
So Roger, when he was on trial, Alex did this whole thing,

496
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,180
this whole nonsensical display on his show.

497
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Yeah.

498
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,740
Interestingly, he doesn't bring this up

499
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,660
when talking about the efforts that some people have made

500
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,900
to intimidate jurors.

501
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,980
That is surprising.

502
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,220
Instead, on his show here on April 20th,

503
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,540
he's just talking about how, like,

504
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,500
when he's been in trial situations-

505
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,540
Sure, sure.

506
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,140
The globalists have tried, or the, I'm sorry,

507
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,660
the media has tried to intimidate these journalists.

508
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
The evil CBS media.

509
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,420
I've been involved in jury trials.

510
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,180
I've been involved in situations we later learned

511
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,260
where the media got involved in contact to the jurors

512
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,860
and said, if you don't do the right thing,

513
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,500
we're gonna dox your ass.

514
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,940
That's how corrupt the corporate media is.

515
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,540
They're not media, they're terrorists.

516
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,940
They're the enemies of this country.

517
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,460
So I guess Alex thinks he's a terrorist.

518
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,300
Yep.

519
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,420
I think Alex should think he's a terrorist.

520
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,460
It's interesting.

521
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,740
So, like I said, one of the big things

522
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,020
that goes throughout this episode

523
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,340
is critiques of Maxine Waters-

524
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,620
Sure.

525
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,980
Having some public statements about the Chauvin trial.

526
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,500
And Alex is kind of mad.

527
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,100
He's kind of mad that she grandstands on issues like this,

528
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,220
but won't take on some of the bigger issues

529
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,260
that Alex cares about. No, no, no, no.

530
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,620
And Maxine Waters said,

531
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,780
well, that's what civil rights looks like.

532
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,580
But she doesn't say a word about

533
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,180
three million Muslims in death camps,

534
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,740
a million Christians in death camps,

535
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,620
a million Buddhists in death camps.

536
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,460
Uh.

537
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,100
No, no, no, no, no.

538
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,020
She'll pick one of the 14 black men killed each year

539
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,420
in a wrongful situation out of 350 million people.

540
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,780
And she'll make a huge deal about that all day

541
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,620
and act like that's all the world's problems

542
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,460
to distract from the fact that she's a monster

543
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,060
that sold out to China 30 years ago

544
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,580
and deindustrialized this country.

545
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,020
And that she promotes planned parenthood

546
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,220
that was established to kill black people.

547
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,180
Can you imagine if I set up a group

548
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,700
that's mission was to quote, kill black weeds,

549
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,260
kill black sub-humans.

550
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,060
That's who she works with.

551
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,460
That's who she really funds.

552
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,140
Isn't the Republican party exactly that?

553
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,340
I see what they've done to black people

554
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,380
and everybody else for that matter.

555
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,460
They just started on them.

556
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,540
So they're farther down than us.

557
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,420
You think I feel strong as a human watching them

558
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,260
brainwash me?

559
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,580
Strong as a human watching them brainwash, dumb down,

560
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,380
drugged out, dying, killing each other.

561
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,460
It makes me feel like a sack of garbage.

562
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,340
But to people like her and the Democrats and Joe Biden

563
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,180
that passed the laws to,

564
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,780
if a black guy gets busted with drugs,

565
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,380
he gets three times the sentence of a white person

566
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,220
to those real elitist,

567
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,620
cause they're beyond racist, they're elitist.

568
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,460
Is that beyond racist?

569
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
They see us as animals.

570
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,620
They see us weak and falling apart

571
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,660
and dying and going bankrupt.

572
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,340
They see that and it makes them feel big inside.

573
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,780
Makes them feel strong.

574
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,660
Cause the truth is they're falling and they're ugly

575
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,820
and they're stupid and they're bad.

576
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,700
These globalists, they're black, they're white,

577
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,460
they're Christian, they're Catholic, they're Jewish,

578
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,020
they're Muslim, they're Chicom, they're everything.

579
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,860
I thought they were Satanists.

580
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,100
They're from all our groups,

581
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,060
but they're of their father, the dirty,

582
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,900
lion, stinking, loser ass devil.

583
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,220
There it was, my bad, I spoke too soon.

584
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,820
My bad, my bad.

585
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,940
That's a loser.

586
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,780
He's a loser.

587
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,580
I take it back, my bad, that's on me.

588
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,620
He's a loser, the devil.

589
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,660
Yeah, come on, man.

590
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,580
I know, I should've, I should've known

591
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,780
he was gonna pull it home.

592
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,060
Yeah, I mean like, I do appreciate how,

593
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,100
you know, conversations about issues

594
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,100
like the carceral state or China end up becoming rants

595
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,980
about how they're all from the devil.

596
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,740
They're all children of the devil.

597
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,300
The literal Christian devil.

598
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,700
Who I should point out is a loser.

599
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,540
Yes.

600
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,460
That loser ass devil.

601
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,980
I thought he was doing great so far, to be honest.

602
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,500
Also, incidentally, Maxine Waters has spoken out

603
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,940
consistently about the human rights abuses in China.

604
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,820
On September 30th, 2020, she spoke on the House floor

605
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,060
in support of the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020

606
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,260
saying, quote, the government of the People's Republic

607
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,620
of China falsely refers to these concentration camps

608
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,140
as vocational camps or reeducation camps.

609
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,700
Make no mistake, the truth is that today in 2020,

610
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,260
one million human beings are being held

611
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,700
in concentration camps where they're beaten, starved,

612
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,580
and forced to work long hours in conditions

613
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,260
that can only be described as inhumane.

614
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,300
And we haven't even gotten to America yet.

615
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,580
Their relatives often have no idea where they are

616
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,060
or whether they are alive.

617
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,740
They're dying each day due to the cruelty

618
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,580
of their living conditions and the brutality

619
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,340
of the Chinese government,

620
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,460
which executes them with impunity.

621
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,140
Incidentally, that bill had five co-sponsors,

622
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,900
all of them Democrats.

623
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,340
Some of the notable Alex-friendly folks in the House

624
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,900
who voted nay on that include Louie Gohmert,

625
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,900
Paul Gosar, Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, and Steve Scalise.

626
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,740
That makes sense.

627
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,860
Alex is making up that people like Maxine Waters

628
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,020
don't ever deal with the issues

629
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,220
that he wants them to deal with

630
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,860
because that makes it easier for him to trivialize things

631
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,660
like the George Floyd killing.

632
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,940
The reality is, however,

633
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,500
that Alex is just making up everything he says.

634
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,140
He has no idea if Maxine Waters has spoken out publicly

635
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,060
against the Chinese human rights abuses,

636
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,180
but the idea that she hasn't is the only option

637
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,500
that fits into how his content is supposed to feel.

638
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,340
Totally.

639
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,780
Because that feeling is more important

640
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,220
than accurate reporting.

641
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,060
That feeling is reported as fact,

642
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,020
and this is just bad work.

643
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,060
This is how he operates.

644
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,980
It is the most infuriating part

645
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,940
of the right-wing bullshit sphere

646
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,700
is that it's like, we only pay attention to these people

647
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,780
whenever they do something we don't like,

648
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,420
so we have honestly no idea whatsoever

649
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,940
if she's ever spoken about China.

650
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,300
No clue, no clue, doesn't matter.

651
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,260
Wasn't paying attention when she did that.

652
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,160
I am only mad whenever she speaks out

653
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,380
about something that I care about.

654
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,740
Wait, what is the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020?

655
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,260
Totally no clue, no clue, no clue.

656
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,980
So, you know, sometimes the world opens up a little bit.

657
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,220
You know, like, I think that now that vaccines

658
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,820
are going around a little bit more,

659
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,380
we're getting to a point where there's a possibility

660
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,780
of like meeting a friend for dinner.

661
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,680
And it's kind of exciting,

662
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,060
or being able to go over to a friend's house

663
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,260
for a barbecue or something like that.

664
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,100
There's a ball game in my future, and I'm very excited.

665
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,620
It's kinda nice.

666
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,940
It's very exciting.

667
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,920
Unless.

668
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,760
Very bad.

669
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,580
You're like Alex.

670
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,420
Uh-oh.

671
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,100
And you go out to dinner with James O'Keeffe.

672
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

673
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,900
I had a really great evening last night.

674
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,560
I had like a two and a half hour dinner

675
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,340
with James O'Keeffe and his fantastic crew.

676
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,180
And it's just an honor to be around these types of souls

677
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,300
who love liberty, who are indomitable,

678
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,580
and who have a fighting spirit.

679
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,380
It just makes me feel strong, and it was really great.

680
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,660
And O'Keeffe turned to me after dinner and he said,

681
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,300
hey, we're gonna give you a big exclusive tomorrow.

682
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,140
We're gonna actually let you break it at 11 a.m.

683
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,540
And it's another terrorist.

684
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,900
They caught at the border and a coverup of what happened.

685
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,740
They were given the internal documents.

686
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,540
That is breaking in 10 minutes at infowars.com.

687
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,840
James O'Keeffe operates on one thing and one thing only,

688
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,340
and that is attention.

689
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,700
If you're ever in a position where James O'Keeffe

690
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,100
is offering you an exclusive,

691
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,700
you need to ask yourself some very serious questions

692
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,060
about the legitimacy of the story

693
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,220
that he's trying to give you.

694
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,540
I am 100% sure this man,

695
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,620
whose entire career is based off of lying to the people

696
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,380
that he is speaking to at any given point in time.

697
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,500
For the sake of attention.

698
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,820
For the sake of attention and profit,

699
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,780
I am sure there's no way he would backstab Alex.

700
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,540
I'm not saying backstab necessarily,

701
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,700
but you gotta be asking yourself,

702
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,900
does he just not wanna stand behind this story?

703
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,620
As it turns out, it's not an exclusive.

704
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,060
It's a video that's up on Project Veritas

705
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,220
that Alex just plays.

706
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,060
Sure, of course.

707
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,900
He's calling it an exclusive.

708
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,740
It doesn't fucking mean anything.

709
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,580
No, of course not.

710
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,420
I don't even believe they had dinner.

711
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,340
How is it possible that you can,

712
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,220
like, the Infowars itself is blackballed

713
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,140
on the major right-wing conservative news networks,

714
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,220
but O'Keeffe can hang out with Alex

715
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,260
and then still be like, Fox News is like,

716
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,460
look at the new O'Keeffe masterpiece.

717
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,340
To be fair, we don't have corroboration

718
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,180
they went to dinner with us.

719
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,620
That's true, that's true.

720
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,820
That is true, that's true.

721
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,460
Alex does say a lot of shit.

722
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,540
You can't trust him bullshitting about that.

723
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,980
He also said this is an exclusive,

724
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
and it's fucking not.

725
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,820
It's true, that's true.

726
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,100
So let's get to that real quick.

727
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,260
Here is the scoop that's not.

728
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,780
Project Veritas exclusive,

729
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,060
Department of Homeland Security insider leaks,

730
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,020
quote, significant event report

731
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,900
showing suspected terrorists being tracked

732
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,300
and apprehended on US-Mexico border.

733
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,260
This is the third one in a couple of weeks

734
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,940
and they want this shut down,

735
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,740
so folks get the article out.

736
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,980
I don't care what Project Veritas does,

737
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,020
but also even if everything that's being said here is true,

738
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,580
then I don't care about their scoop.

739
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,580
A suspected terrorist was tracked and arrested

740
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,220
when they tried to enter the country.

741
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,420
That's just a story that tells me that border security

742
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,260
is pretty all right in catching terrorists.

743
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,180
No, no, it's not working.

744
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,260
It's a failure.

745
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,700
Biden's administration is ruining everything

746
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,460
by catching terrorists whenever they cross into this country.

747
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,940
Also, if I were James O'Keeffe,

748
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,060
I'd probably shy away from stories like this

749
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,380
about terrorists and the border.

750
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,740
They run the risk of reminding people

751
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,740
about that time in 2014 when he dressed up

752
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,740
as Osama bin Laden and walked across a stretch

753
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,940
of the Rio Grande River,

754
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,740
supposedly illustrating how easy it would be

755
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,900
for bin Laden to sneak into the country.

756
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,500
It was super embarrassing and he got dunked on pretty hard,

757
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,060
so I'd be careful about reminding people about that video.

758
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,500
I would say go for it, O'Keeffe.

759
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,260
I think this is a great idea.

760
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
You're gonna get all the attention in the world

761
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,020
and absolutely you should dress up like Osama again

762
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,580
and then die in the ocean.

763
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,860
I will say that the sort of like flare for costuming period

764
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,340
seems to be over in James O'Keeffe's career.

765
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,180
That could be.

766
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,980
He seemed to love to dress up earlier on.

767
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,620
You know, when you're young, you like to dress up.

768
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,460
That happens.

769
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,660
You get older, you know, you put away childish things.

770
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,500
That happens.

771
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,660
Now he just likes to wear a suit,

772
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,820
act really dramatic.

773
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,100
Oh, I hate him so much.

774
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Interview weirdos.

775
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,940
I hate him so much.

776
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,420
Who maybe used to work at Facebook.

777
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,260
Yeah, he's the worst.

778
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
Yep.

779
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,300
So we got a new instance

780
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,380
of social media censorship going on here.

781
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,860
This one doesn't quite fit all the usual suspects.

782
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,580
It also probably isn't true.

783
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,020
Meanwhile, Facebook removes posts by Breonna Taylor's mother

784
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,660
criticizing Black Lives Matter

785
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,980
saying they never helped her and they're full of crap.

786
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,940
Wow.

787
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,340
So now the mother of Breonna Taylor who was killed wrongly

788
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,740
and Senator Paul passed a law

789
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,820
to try to stop the no-knock warrants being used too much.

790
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,780
He gets beat up for passing a lot of protector.

791
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,140
It's all upside down.

792
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,060
So you can see here

793
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,060
Alex's position on the killing of Breonna Taylor has changed

794
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,540
now that there's an angle he can use

795
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,380
to attack Black Lives Matter.

796
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,100
Yeah, fuck, I wanted, oh my God, oh my God.

797
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,260
Because he's using the mask

798
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,780
of being sympathetic about her death

799
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,260
to make his attack on Black Lives Matter more palatable.

800
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,460
Oh my God, you fucking opportunist, bullshitting,

801
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,300
oh, fuck off.

802
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,580
This is shady as hell and I have zero respect for it.

803
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,700
A couple of quick fact checks here though.

804
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,380
Taylor's mother did not say

805
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,180
that Black Lives Matter was a fraud.

806
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,060
She was commenting on the Louisville chapter

807
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,900
of Black Lives Matter

808
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,220
which she said she also has never dealt with.

809
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,340
Also, there's no indication that Facebook took down her post.

810
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,580
It's entirely possible that she removed it herself.

811
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,380
There's no verification on that.

812
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Also, Rand Paul was beaten up by his neighbor in 2017

813
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,100
and reports on the neighbor's trial have called it a fight,

814
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,620
quote, over a lawn care dispute.

815
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,140
Breonna Taylor was killed on March 13th, 2020.

816
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,380
So unless this neighbor attacked Rand three years in advance

817
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,520
as retaliation for passing laws limiting no-knock warrants,

818
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,260
then what Alex is saying makes no sense

819
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,740
and he's just grasping at straws.

820
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,360
Also, Rand Paul's bill, S3955, was read twice

821
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,700
and then referred to committee

822
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,140
where it has been since June, 2020.

823
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,580
It is a dead bill.

824
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,820
Rand Paul has not succeeded in doing the thing

825
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,220
that Alex is giving him credit for

826
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,740
which his neighbor apparently beat him up

827
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,860
for three years prior.

828
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,780
I would, I think that's a fun, a lawn care incident.

829
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,420
I think if Rand and I were to get into a fight,

830
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,260
it would be like, they would be described

831
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,060
as an existential incident

832
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,180
insofar as I do not appreciate his existence.

833
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,540
So that would just be my, that would be my excuse.

834
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,380
Sure.

835
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,200
That's what I would have.

836
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,900
I feel like you might be the sort of cat who would like,

837
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,660
you could get in a lawn care dispute with him.

838
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,500
I could find a lawn care dispute.

839
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,820
I could find any kind of dispute.

840
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,180
I just feel like it would be,

841
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,100
you'd like put poison on some of his yard

842
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,140
so it would spell out something really offensive

843
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,980
maybe in the grass.

844
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,860
No, but what if he has a dog that ate it?

845
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,440
I would never, ever, ever hurt a pet

846
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,260
despite it being Rand Paul's pet.

847
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,220
That is still a good pet.

848
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,180
Trim his bonsai into a offensive shape

849
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,460
out in front of his house maybe.

850
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,780
Oh, I think I could probably get a crane

851
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,580
and then, you know like that gag

852
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,140
where you've got the bottle of,

853
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,080
or the bucket of water on the door

854
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,020
and you like open it and then somebody gets,

855
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,140
oh, that's terrible.

856
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,380
I get a crane, but like a really tall one.

857
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,220
Okay.

858
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,340
And then when he's walking out of his house in the morning,

859
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,060
I just pee right on his head.

860
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,900
Hmm.

861
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,580
And then whenever he's not sure what it is

862
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,380
and he looks up, right into his mouth.

863
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,220
No way to kill the dog there.

864
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,060
That's how I do it.

865
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,020
So that I think you're safe. Exactly.

866
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,140
Yep.

867
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,940
I would say that if you were doing that,

868
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,260
you'd be playing with fire.

869
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,100
Possibly.

870
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,420
And now the globalists want to burn down America.

871
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,260
They want to hold the police

872
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,420
and all the governments hostage

873
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,340
so they roll over and a lot of them are.

874
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,900
But don't play with me.

875
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,060
They're playing with fire.

876
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,340
Cause you're playing with fire.

877
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,260
Playing with fire now, aren't they?

878
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,220
Fire has a way of getting away from you.

879
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,860
Way of blowing back.

880
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,740
Burning you real bad.

881
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,660
That's why I don't play with fire.

882
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,500
Is it?

883
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,740
Don't you?

884
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,980
Cause what did old George Washington say?

885
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,580
Old George, our leader.

886
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,380
What'd he say?

887
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,380
What did he say?

888
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,620
He said, fire is a dangerous servant

889
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,860
and a fearful master.

890
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,220
This isn't a real Washington quote.

891
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,780
I was going to say that's not a Washington quote

892
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,940
by any shot.

893
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,700
The structure of discussing fire

894
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,020
and this exact construction

895
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,580
with the servant master dichotomy

896
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,140
was traced back to at least 1637

897
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,260
by the website quote investigator.

898
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,220
And the same idea and quote,

899
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,100
but being applied to water

900
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,700
was traced back to 1562.

901
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,220
The first time this turn of phrase

902
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,580
was credited to Washington was in 1902

903
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,780
in an article in the Christian Science Journal.

904
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,620
And it's not even been consistently credited

905
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,100
to Washington since then.

906
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,620
It's just another example of Alex

907
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,580
thrown around fake quotes.

908
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,660
Man, I think that one probably goes

909
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,620
all the way back to like 150,000 years ago

910
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,900
whenever it was just like ugh

911
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,260
and that meant it's hot.

912
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,180
Run away.

913
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,700
You can use fire for things,

914
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,460
but also it can fuck you.

915
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,580
Exactly.

916
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,420
So I was listening-

917
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,460
Don't touch it, it's hot.

918
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,540
I was listening to that clip though

919
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,380
and I got really excited

920
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,500
cause you know, every now and again,

921
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
I hate the doors,

922
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,340
but every now and again,

923
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,580
I'm in the right mood for that playing with fire.

924
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,980
Sure, sure.

925
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,820
I don't know.

926
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,660
I'm just in the right mood.

927
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,180
And the way that Alex was doing the like,

928
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,540
don't play with fire.

929
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,220
I learned not to play with fire.

930
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,460
Fire has a way of biting you.

931
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,500
I got really excited

932
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,820
and then when he said this,

933
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,460
I got even more excited.

934
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,700
You're the ones playing with fire.

935
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,500
You're the one letting it out of the box

936
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,740
and you don't control it.

937
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,060
And those that release the fire

938
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,820
are almost always the ones burned by the fire.

939
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,020
That doesn't sound true at all.

940
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,860
You must respect the fire

941
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,380
and you must keep the fire at arm's length.

942
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,100
But those of you that embrace the fire

943
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,980
of 666 will be burned by the fire.

944
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,700
You cannot contain the fire.

945
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
You are not in command of the fire.

946
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,660
You wanna play God?

947
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,500
You're not.

948
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,340
You're not.

949
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,740
I wasn't ready for the fire to be the devil.

950
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,780
I really wasn't.

951
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,740
Oh man, oh boy.

952
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,460
I thought it was just about taking chances.

953
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,380
See, now who got tricked by it

954
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,740
winding up being the devil?

955
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,580
Yeah, I know.

956
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,140
I was hoisted on my own petard.

957
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,380
I was playing with fire, if you will,

958
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,540
and I got burned.

959
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,980
Do Christians not know how silly it is

960
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,580
to use 666?

961
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,020
Ooh, it's three numbers.

962
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,100
I also do like the idea that Clank's like,

963
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,380
you have to respect the fire.

964
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,540
You gotta respect the fire.

965
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,380
Wait, the devil?

966
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,220
You gotta respect the devil?

967
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,100
Keep the devil at an arm's length.

968
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,300
All right, you don't embrace it,

969
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,260
you respect the devil.

970
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,860
And when he was saying you gotta keep the fire,

971
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,260
I was thinking of that Kenny Loggins song.

972
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,900
Well, I was thinking of that too.

973
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,900
So yeah, that little diatribe was a little fun for me.

974
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,620
Yeah, I always appreciate it

975
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,580
whenever he really loses the thread

976
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,140
while trying to do lyrics.

977
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,460
And then he's like, what if I combine the two

978
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,060
and then I'll have a thing to say?

979
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,140
What if I turn this into a block of content?

980
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,860
Then I have to do less work.

981
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,500
Then I have a good excuse

982
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,700
to have not covered any news stories.

983
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,500
Dumb asshole.

984
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,900
Spoken word album is coming our way

985
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,980
once he's off the air.

986
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,300
Anyway, Jordan, this clip,

987
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,500
this for me is just like every now and again

988
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,260
you need like that cute moment.

989
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,100
Sure.

990
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,340
And I think that this is really cute.

991
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,380
Because there is a war on for your mind.

992
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,580
No, no.

993
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,220
There are a lot of diseased,

994
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,540
crazy people who always seek to destroy innocence.

995
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,140
And when we bow down to them, well, we get destroyed.

996
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
He can't stop himself, he can't do it.

997
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,980
He can't.

998
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,820
He can't do it.

999
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,380
It's too catchy, Dan, I almost started whistling.

1000
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,580
It's too catchy.

1001
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,900
He has to start whistling in the middle of a sentence.

1002
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,740
He can't stop.

1003
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,580
It's amazing.

1004
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,620
That, my friend, is a human moment.

1005
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,460
That is very cute, that is very cute.

1006
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,460
Yep, so not so cute is Alex's story corner on this episode.

1007
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,300
Oh, no.

1008
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,140
Except a little bit of a story.

1009
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,100
About something that happened when he was getting divorced

1010
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,940
from his wife.

1011
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,780
Okay.

1012
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,620
I think.

1013
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,780
How is it possible to turn this racist?

1014
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,260
Because I feel that's where we're going.

1015
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,580
It's not going racist yet.

1016
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,420
Okay, okay.

1017
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,820
We'll get pretty deep into that later.

1018
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,660
I'm sure.

1019
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,580
This story in particular is more,

1020
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,700
I don't even know what it is.

1021
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,100
I think the story Alex is trying to tell

1022
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,100
is a couple of really high-level stories.

1023
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,420
A couple of really hot ladies

1024
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,580
after he was getting divorced, right?

1025
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,980
A couple of hot ladies.

1026
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,820
All right.

1027
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,300
Invited him to a drag show.

1028
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,700
Okay, yeah, okay.

1029
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,300
And here's what happened.

1030
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,380
And I don't know what it is about women liking this.

1031
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,340
When I was getting divorced,

1032
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,020
a couple of gorgeous women that lived in the condos with me,

1033
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,180
well, one of them did, one of them didn't live there,

1034
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,780
said, hey, we want to take you to this drag show contest.

1035
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,740
And I'm like, I don't really go to topless bars.

1036
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,060
And they go, no, no, no, this is tasteful.

1037
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,220
It was in North Austin.

1038
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,820
I lived in downtown then.

1039
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,900
I was like a year into my divorce.

1040
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,740
I wasn't divorced yet.

1041
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,900
I'm like, okay, I mean, I'll go with you.

1042
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,500
And there were two gorgeous brunettes took me.

1043
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,380
And I get there and I go, what the hell?

1044
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,340
This is like, half of these are men.

1045
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,380
And the smell of the hormones, I was sick.

1046
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,060
And then they all got mad at me that I was there.

1047
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,300
And we were there like, well, you're right.

1048
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,780
We didn't know it was all men.

1049
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,220
We thought there'd be a few here, let's go.

1050
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,060
What?

1051
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,420
But I remember, and we were there like 15 minutes.

1052
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,940
This story makes no sense.

1053
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,260
This is incoherent and insane.

1054
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,660
Yeah, I wonder what the reality of the story is

1055
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,140
if he's just making all this up.

1056
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,300
Yeah, I mean, it rings true in the sense

1057
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,900
that I have no doubt that at a certain point in his life,

1058
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,500
someone invited him to a drag show.

1059
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,340
Sure.

1060
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,540
That I would believe.

1061
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,980
Well, yeah, it feels strange that you accept

1062
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,820
that invitation. I would also believe

1063
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,660
they would be incredibly,

1064
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,900
it doesn't sound like he knows what a drag show is.

1065
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,740
It's possible.

1066
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,100
I think he thinks that it's a burlesque show.

1067
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,980
Maybe.

1068
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,540
And it's not a drag show.

1069
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,780
It's tasteful.

1070
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,020
Wow, man, isn't that sad?

1071
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,480
There's a certain part of me that finds it so sad

1072
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,720
that if you're a conservative Christian white nationalist,

1073
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,820
you can't enjoy a drag show,

1074
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,300
which is one of the most joyous places that I've,

1075
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,380
there's, everybody's happy at a drag show.

1076
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,220
There's a lot of happiness.

1077
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,420
There's, it's so happy.

1078
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,620
I think that this story may or may not actually be true,

1079
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,340
or it might be greatly embellished,

1080
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,560
because I think it's really just an avenue for him

1081
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,660
to get into bashing drag queen story out.

1082
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,780
Yes, of course.

1083
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,580
And so one of the things that I've noticed

1084
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,580
that he does all the time is basically says,

1085
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,180
he says that he, his reporters have captured

1086
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,160
like pornographic footage of kids with like naked men

1087
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,140
and stuff like that.

1088
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,980
Sure, sure.

1089
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,260
And it's like, no, you haven't.

1090
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,940
Not, if you had.

1091
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,780
It would be everywhere.

1092
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,620
These people would be arrested.

1093
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1094
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,900
Absolutely not.

1095
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,700
And so would you for playing it on your show.

1096
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,540
No, no, you can't play it on the show

1097
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,260
because the local affiliates complain.

1098
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,100
That's what I'm saying.

1099
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,420
That's what he, that's what he's saying.

1100
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1101
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,660
He, this is just nonsense.

1102
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,900
Yeah, this is some footage in Austin

1103
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,140
where the station's complaining about this.

1104
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,020
So don't, don't show the part with a guy

1105
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,100
totally naked with glitter with children humping him.

1106
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,620
I mean, but it's like a dude with a major slong

1107
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,260
and there's kids riding him,

1108
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,140
but he's got glitter on his genitals.

1109
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,660
So it's, oh, it's covered.

1110
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,060
I mean, this is all illegal.

1111
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,940
And so I just couldn't imagine being a child

1112
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,780
and being around these.

1113
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,460
Cause it's, it's a pack of lunatics.

1114
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,660
I mean, they're all on drugs.

1115
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,100
They're on all sorts of crazy hormones.

1116
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,220
They're doing all sorts of insane things.

1117
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,220
And I've been around it for 15 minutes

1118
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,500
and it made me physically sick.

1119
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,020
Talking about that drag show that he went to

1120
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,180
with those two very attractive ladies.

1121
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,020
Wow.

1122
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,860
For 15 minutes on that one.

1123
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,980
So, so much of that doesn't need to be part of the story.

1124
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,820
Nope.

1125
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,060
So much of it is like,

1126
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,740
those details don't help with your story.

1127
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,900
It doesn't matter how big his slong was.

1128
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,740
No, that is weird.

1129
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,820
Were that the case?

1130
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,780
It's, any size slong, it's still illegal.

1131
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,460
Let me, let me tell you this.

1132
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,180
I don't know if he was saying it was a big slong.

1133
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,900
He said it was a major slong.

1134
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,740
That's true.

1135
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,720
That's true.

1136
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,100
That means it's one rank away from giving him information.

1137
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,940
Yeah.

1138
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,660
This is not a Lieutenant Colonel slong.

1139
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,100
This, yeah, I don't know.

1140
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,340
I don't, I don't buy any of this nonsense.

1141
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,180
No, no.

1142
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,180
So Alex gets back to talking about the Chauvin trial.

1143
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,020
Sure.

1144
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,900
The anticipation is building.

1145
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,820
Maxine Waters has, you know,

1146
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,140
said some comments that Alex is not into.

1147
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,980
Sure.

1148
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,140
But the judge, you know, he's not,

1149
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,740
he's not interested in making this a mistrial.

1150
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,460
You see that judge up there.

1151
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,820
Well, we don't just listen to a Congresswoman.

1152
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,520
You know, we don't, we don't need a mistrial.

1153
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,180
No, you just have the jurors,

1154
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,340
people going to their houses the last two days,

1155
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,660
CBS news doxing them.

1156
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,620
You got people going to the,

1157
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,220
where one of the witnesses lived two years ago

1158
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,940
and putting pig blood and a severed pig head

1159
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
on his property.

1160
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,180
No, you just got the media saying

1161
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,780
they're going to burn down everything

1162
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,340
if you don't send him to prison.

1163
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,840
This isn't about that cop.

1164
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,900
It's about lawlessness and terrorism and this mob,

1165
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,240
this French revolution, Maoist, Bolshevik revolution,

1166
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,240
October revolution, takeover.

1167
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,960
Alex has yet to demonstrate or show any instances

1168
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,440
of jurors being doxed or harassed.

1169
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,360
So I'm not taking him repeating that claim

1170
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,240
any more seriously than I did the first time.

1171
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,860
There's another interesting thing here though,

1172
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,600
which is that the media didn't say

1173
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,280
that there would be protests and fires

1174
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,320
if Chauvin was found not guilty.

1175
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,360
Alex has played some clips from newscasts,

1176
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,640
but there are interviews with civilians in Minneapolis

1177
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,760
who are expressing that are likely beyond rest

1178
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,240
if Chauvin is acquitted.

1179
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,760
There's a really important difference here

1180
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,840
and it's one that I think Alex refuses to acknowledge.

1181
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,240
If the news goes out and interviews people

1182
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,960
and they say that they'll likely be protests

1183
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,520
if Chauvin is found not guilty,

1184
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,660
does Alex think that the news should pretend

1185
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,900
that they didn't do these interviews?

1186
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,600
If the goal is to represent the opinion

1187
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,640
of persons on the street that they talked to,

1188
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,320
it would seem like an irresponsible level of censorship

1189
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,520
to just edit their responses

1190
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,740
to reflect what you would want them to say,

1191
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,280
but that seems to be what Alex wants to happen.

1192
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,320
Well, the, okay, so the person being interviewed

1193
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,760
said specifically that if justice in this circumstance

1194
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,500
is denied when it's so overwhelmingly obvious

1195
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,320
what the verdict should be,

1196
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,020
then I'm going to help people, quote,

1197
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,120
no longer have a police precinct for a little while.

1198
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,460
And then if that was edited, it would be like a,

1199
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,040
bah, zh, bah.

1200
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, I mean, like, I think that really what's going on

1201
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,680
is essentially that this is how Alex creates content,

1202
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,400
and so he assumes that everybody else does.

1203
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,220
Yeah, of course.

1204
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,040
Alex only puts like blurbs in and stuff that makes him,

1205
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,520
you know, like he has these-

1206
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,280
It tells the narrative he wants it to tell,

1207
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,200
so he assumes.

1208
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,280
Super cuts of Owen Schroyer dunking on libs

1209
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,200
and stuff like that.

1210
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,080
Do you think the right wing has actually convinced itself

1211
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,760
that the other side is doing what they're doing?

1212
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,800
I think Alex has probably thought that all along.

1213
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,480
Yeah, it has to be the only justification

1214
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,360
for their horrible, awful behavior, right?

1215
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,400
Yeah, I think so.

1216
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,600
Also a small point,

1217
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,140
but Maoism and Bolshevism aren't the same thing,

1218
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,400
and they have some pretty salient differences.

1219
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,120
I think Alex just picks and chooses commie words

1220
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,840
that he thinks will scare the audience.

1221
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,080
Communism is a single block.

1222
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,820
I would love for him to try and explain

1223
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,380
what he meant by the end of that sentence.

1224
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,180
That would be amazing.

1225
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,020
Yeah.

1226
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,520
So Alex is not a racist, as we've discussed many times,

1227
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,840
but usually in the reverse.

1228
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,680
He is a racist.

1229
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,500
Yes.

1230
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,020
And one of the ways that you can tell that

1231
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,400
is when he says things like this.

1232
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,880
But in all these BLM events,

1233
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,480
it's like 20, 30 white people

1234
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,760
and three or four black people

1235
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,360
who they have at the front of the line,

1236
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,880
who they admit they use at the front of the line.

1237
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,920
And then the black controllers trained as Marxists

1238
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,960
even say white allies in the back

1239
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,540
because they don't want them seen.

1240
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,600
They want it to look like it's blacks doing it.

1241
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,560
To scapegoat the blacks while they start the race war.

1242
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,520
Wow.

1243
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,000
So I'm smart enough to play chess

1244
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,280
while their folks are playing checkers.

1245
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,120
Really?

1246
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,960
Wow.

1247
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,640
That was your chess game right there.

1248
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,480
4D.

1249
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,300
Ah, yeah.

1250
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,380
I would say three moves is all it takes to defeat him.

1251
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,840
So Alex seems to be hitting this note

1252
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,280
a little bit more regularly in recent days.

1253
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,300
This idea that social justice causes

1254
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,240
are meant to incite racist backlash from white people

1255
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,360
and are orchestrated to do that by white people

1256
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,080
putting a few black scapegoats at the front of their actions.

1257
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,320
This is a pretty outrageously racist idea.

1258
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,520
And as I've mentioned in the past,

1259
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,040
particularly on the last episode,

1260
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,580
this is very much in the same tradition

1261
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,080
as Alex's forefathers who fought

1262
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,080
against the civil rights movement.

1263
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,400
I realized in hindsight that maybe I should explain

1264
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,760
my point a little bit further.

1265
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,720
And now Alex has kind of given me an opening

1266
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,680
to do just that.

1267
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,520
Yeah.

1268
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,560
Alex's favorite book,

1269
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,360
the one that turned him on to the new world order

1270
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,600
was called None Dare Call It Conspiracy by Gary Allen.

1271
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,180
Apparently Alex read it at 12 and his mind was blown.

1272
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,240
Although he was still a Satanist a few years later

1273
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,380
and got a bunch of people pregnant,

1274
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,120
but honestly the timeline doesn't matter.

1275
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,200
Let's not worry about that.

1276
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,200
This book is a primer that has been cited by many people,

1277
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,560
not just Alex, but people like Richard Belzer

1278
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,360
as being like a revelation to them.

1279
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,840
Wow, the bell's tolls.

1280
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,740
Mm-hmm.

1281
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,580
Gary Allen was a longtime member of the John Birch Society

1282
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,880
and None Dare wasn't his first book.

1283
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,160
Previously he'd written a book called

1284
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,760
Communist Revolution in the Streets,

1285
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,160
which was a scathing and very racist attack

1286
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,740
on the civil rights movement.

1287
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,240
There are a lot of arguments made in the book

1288
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,600
that look very bad in hindsight,

1289
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,400
but one of the predominant themes in the text

1290
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,680
is the idea that black rights organizations

1291
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,780
were secretly not actually black rights organizations,

1292
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,740
but actually communist fronts,

1293
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,920
typically run by white people.

1294
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,560
Just in case any white people reading this

1295
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,840
are concerned about unequal treatment,

1296
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,760
let's just 100% get rid of that idea

1297
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,460
that race even exists at all.

1298
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,200
It's just white people versus white people.

1299
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,900
From page 33, quote,

1300
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,920
We arrive at the interesting possibility

1301
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,780
that the black Muslims were started by the communists,

1302
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,700
knowing that the majority of American Negroes

1303
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,120
felt no kinship with Soviet Russia.

1304
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,620
By establishing a pseudo-religion

1305
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,200
based on Negro racial supremacy

1306
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,240
and annihilation of the blue-eyed devils,

1307
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
a revolutionary cadre could be built

1308
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,420
within the United States without the majority of people

1309
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,920
realizing its true significance.

1310
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,400
Probably not surprisingly, Allen never actually justifies

1311
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,620
this quote, interesting possibility,

1312
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,160
because as he goes on to say, quote,

1313
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,320
If the black Muslims were a communist setup

1314
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,320
from the beginning, it's doubtful that any

1315
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,180
but the very top oligarchy were aware.

1316
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,480
That's some classic Infowars-style proof right there.

1317
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,320
That's great.

1318
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,460
This thing is true, and I can't prove it,

1319
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,600
because only the top level of the conspiracy

1320
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,800
that I swear is real has that proof.

1321
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,360
And you can trust my credentials,

1322
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,240
because my previous and former professors,

1323
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,760
all of whom top professors,

1324
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,140
I mean, you could, look, you can interview them,

1325
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,960
all of them are dead, but you can trust that I'm great.

1326
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,920
Right, you understand this construction

1327
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,080
that he's using is basically,

1328
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,440
in order to prove the basis for my conspiracy

1329
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,200
and the suspicion that I have,

1330
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,000
you have to assume the existence of the very conspiracy

1331
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,960
that I've failed to prove exists.

1332
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,800
It's circular.

1333
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,440
It's kind of, yeah, no, it's him saying

1334
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,480
that if I'm right, you would already know,

1335
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,800
or if my information was public by them,

1336
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,600
you would have already, yeah.

1337
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,920
This runs constantly throughout his book.

1338
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,260
Quote, The real cause of the riots is agitation

1339
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,380
by revolutionaries, power-craving civil rights leaders,

1340
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,460
and vote-hungry politicians who are willing to trade

1341
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,920
a citizen's safety for the vote of a minority bloc.

1342
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,120
Every group is a front,

1343
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,400
every event is incited by communists,

1344
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,100
it's all very boring.

1345
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,800
On page 48, Allen lays out

1346
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,200
what is essentially an overarching thesis.

1347
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,180
Quote, The communists have been working for over 30 years

1348
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,520
on mass recruitment of Negroes in America.

1349
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,800
Their efforts have usually failed

1350
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,300
because Negroes have proved to be loyal Americans,

1351
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,280
but this has not caused the communists to slacken,

1352
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,120
because they see civil rights as America's Achilles heel,

1353
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,360
and the Negro is the sacrificial cannon fodder

1354
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,160
for a communist-instigated revolution.

1355
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,000
This is the exact same rhetoric that Alex Jones uses now,

1356
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,520
which is being deployed by Gary Allen

1357
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,120
to attack the civil rights movement

1358
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,840
and Martin Luther King back in the mid-60s.

1359
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,040
I would challenge Alex to reflect on this more or less

1360
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,200
one-to-one overlap between his rhetoric

1361
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,320
that's being used to attack social justice protests

1362
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,100
of the modern era, and the rhetoric that Gary Allen used

1363
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,620
to attack social justice protests

1364
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,160
from our country's recent past.

1365
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,160
I mean, you could, again, this goes back to slavery.

1366
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,600
This goes all the way back to them being like,

1367
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,140
well, there's no way that slaves

1368
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,480
could ever organize on their own,

1369
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,160
so it must be white people agitating the slaves,

1370
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,720
and it's probably poor white people,

1371
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,160
because they don't like us having all the money.

1372
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,800
It goes all the way back.

1373
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,680
It's there.

1374
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,560
There is that.

1375
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,880
I choose to focus this towards this,

1376
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,560
because this is part of Alex's intellectual tradition.

1377
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,560
Right, right, the anti-communism hadn't been attached to.

1378
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,200
And this is the worldview that Alex espouses very deeply,

1379
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,080
this anti-communism stuff, and this rooting of it

1380
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,040
is something that he needs to understand

1381
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,680
and stop obfuscating.

1382
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,040
It's nonsense.

1383
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,880
You can't play the exact same game that your forefathers did

1384
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,360
against the civil rights movement

1385
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,240
and pretend like that's not what you're doing.

1386
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,600
It's not about communism.

1387
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,880
No, of course not.

1388
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,040
So Alex won't do any of this reflection,

1389
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,840
and everyone in his orbit pretends

1390
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,200
like books like Communist Revolution in the Street

1391
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,880
don't exist, because they make it too obvious that,

1392
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,800
like I said, this isn't about communism.

1393
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,600
It never was.

1394
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,560
That's all just a mask that they use to hide behind.

1395
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,360
Yeah, absolutely.

1396
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,760
Whenever the communists was used as an excuse

1397
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,640
to blackball Jews in Hollywood, it's

1398
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,560
not like J. Edgar Hoover was like,

1399
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,320
this will never work against black people.

1400
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,400
Yeah.

1401
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,520
And just to give you some idea of how

1402
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,600
little people want people to read books like this,

1403
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,880
it was very hard to find that book.

1404
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,600
I believe that.

1405
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,520
I had to get it on loan from another university's

1406
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,520
private library that I got it for like a week

1407
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,720
and was able to photocopy it.

1408
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,480
It's out of print.

1409
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,400
It's buried, probably because it's super offensive.

1410
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,520
It is a terrifyingly racist thing.

1411
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,760
I've read, you've given me one page,

1412
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,520
and I was like, Jesus Christ.

1413
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,920
Yeah, it's terrifyingly offensive and very similar

1414
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,360
to the rhetoric that Alex Jones uses now,

1415
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,680
vis-a-vis things like Black Lives Matter.

1416
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,440
Any white replacement theory in there?

1417
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,240
Yeah, probably.

1418
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,080
Yeah, we'll get there sooner or later.

1419
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,720
Yeah.

1420
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,560
So Alex goes to calls, and he wants

1421
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,640
to talk about what do you think is going to happen

1422
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,160
with this verdict, ma'am?

1423
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,720
What do you think?

1424
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,840
OK, so number one on the verdict,

1425
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,720
I think it's going to be a hung jury.

1426
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,920
I think a lot of people got scared about the Maxine Waters

1427
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,560
comment.

1428
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,400
Even the defense lawyer brought it up

1429
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,080
that his phone was blowing up on the trial.

1430
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,200
And that's what I think.

1431
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,760
I think they're going to be hung jury,

1432
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,680
and it's going to be a retry him.

1433
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,080
I think they're going to try to keep this going all year.

1434
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,840
That's my thought.

1435
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,800
Yeah, I think Maxine's totally controlled.

1436
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,680
She's a demon.

1437
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,960
I think they told her to go do that too, hang the jury.

1438
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,720
I agree.

1439
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,080
To cause the blow up.

1440
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,240
OK, so there's going to be a hung jury,

1441
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,960
and it's going to be Maxine Waters has come out

1442
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,560
and said these things in order to precipitate that.

1443
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,160
Here is my educated guess.

1444
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,000
That way there's going to be a riot afterwards

1445
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,480
because people are going to be really upset about that.

1446
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,440
They're going to be pissed.

1447
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,080
Yeah.

1448
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,440
So that's where we're at here, and that

1449
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,760
seems to be fairly consistent.

1450
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,400
Not hard.

1451
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,080
Now, this caller has another thing to bring up.

1452
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,640
Boy, things change real fast.

1453
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,040
OK.

1454
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,360
I just want to know, did you see that Omar segment

1455
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,080
where he pretty much told his audience

1456
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,520
that the liberal media has been lying about COVID

1457
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,240
the whole time?

1458
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,240
I just want to know your thoughts on the Bill Maher

1459
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,040
segment because I haven't heard talk about that yet.

1460
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,560
Well, I think Omar is very talented, very watchable.

1461
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,720
I don't agree with a lot of what he said.

1462
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,320
What the fuck?

1463
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,160
I think he got smart.

1464
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,080
Yeah, he said COVID was basically a giant hoax.

1465
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,680
And a fraud.

1466
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,000
Oh, and I forgot that he had that.

1467
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,640
I hate you.

1468
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,240
I hate you so much.

1469
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:43,800
Bill Maher.

1470
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,520
I hate you so much.

1471
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,480
Bill Maher is now a secret patriot.

1472
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,800
I hate him.

1473
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,680
I can't.

1474
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,280
I can't.

1475
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:52,920
No.

1476
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,320
That's a bricking.

1477
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,120
I just think he's fucked pretty much.

1478
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,000
He's not going to become like a regular Democrat on the left.

1479
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,920
He's going to have to come out as a libertarian

1480
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,680
or they're going to start calling him a fraud.

1481
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,960
Oh, actually, they've been demonizing him before this,

1482
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,760
saying, stop burning down random neighborhoods.

1483
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,200
Stop shooting random police.

1484
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,720
That's what bad guys do.

1485
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,840
Yeah, no, he's, look.

1486
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,200
I can't think of anybody.

1487
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,920
The word is he's more like Tucker Carlson.

1488
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,440
He's just, he won't be on air if he doesn't tell the line.

1489
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,920
So he has to make some false statement

1490
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,360
and make a true statement.

1491
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,360
But I'm rooting for Bill Maher to go all the way.

1492
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,960
Thank you so much.

1493
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,560
I have bad news for that caller, and that

1494
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,240
is that Bill Maher is self-identified

1495
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,640
as a libertarian many times in the past.

1496
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,280
His exact political philosophy is kind of tough to nail down,

1497
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,280
but libertarianism is one of the titles he's used before.

1498
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,720
The only reason anyone would think

1499
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,280
that he's some kind of a super liberal

1500
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,160
is if they only know about his positions

1501
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,600
from listening to Alex yell about him.

1502
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,080
Also, Alex can fuck right off with this stuff about Maher

1503
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,680
being basically like Tucker Carlson,

1504
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,480
but he knows that he needs to say some things to stay on air.

1505
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,400
For years, Alex has used things that Maher has said

1506
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,760
and pretended they were globalist positions.

1507
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,360
The whole thing about how the globalists

1508
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,720
wanted to crash the economy to hurt Trump,

1509
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,640
that was entirely based on a joke

1510
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,120
that Bill Maher said on one of his shows.

1511
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,640
Alex has used Bill Maher's comments

1512
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,960
to such a prominent extent in his conspiracies

1513
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,160
that Alex had to explain Bill Maher's role

1514
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,560
in globalist operations like this.

1515
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,400
Here he is on the same show, Bill Maher.

1516
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,160
When he talks, that's a globalist mouthpiece.

1517
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,840
So it's like Satan's puppet, his little, sitting on his lap,

1518
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,840
a little, one of those things, ventriloquist dolls.

1519
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,080
Yeah, he's basically a globalist ventriloquist doll.

1520
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,560
He lays out the program.

1521
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,400
I was just gonna say,

1522
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,680
whenever he said some people have been,

1523
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,800
I'm like, that has been your job for five years.

1524
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,720
Jesus.

1525
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,400
This is a stunning reversal for Bill Maher.

1526
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,600
If I believed a word that Alex said,

1527
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,080
Bill Maher should be super worried

1528
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,640
about globalist assassin squads

1529
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,440
coming to get him for betraying his contract

1530
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,640
as a ventriloquist dummy or some dumb shit.

1531
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,200
But all of it's made up, so it doesn't matter.

1532
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,440
Isn't that something that he said on his last episode,

1533
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,400
is that the higher ranking guys

1534
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,680
eventually leave the globalists

1535
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,240
with all their money and power,

1536
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,440
and then they get killed.

1537
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,080
Yeah, Bill Maher is gonna get assassinated soon.

1538
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,840
That should be what you're saying.

1539
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,680
Yeah.

1540
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,520
Yeah.

1541
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,360
Anyway, we get a guest at this point,

1542
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,520
and it's Norm Standup Comedy Patches.

1543
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,960
Does he have a new bit for us?

1544
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,800
No, but he has.

1545
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,200
If he did Lumerics, if he just out of nowhere

1546
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,320
started doing Lumerics, that's a full circle for us.

1547
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,000
Isn't Schachter's name Norm too?

1548
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,840
No, Marty Schachter.

1549
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,840
No, it's Marty, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1550
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,920
I will say that Norm doesn't have a new bit,

1551
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,120
but he does have an old one.

1552
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,960
Okay.

1553
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,680
I mean, I'm sure not gonna call Black Lives Matter

1554
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,400
if somebody's breaking my door down tonight.

1555
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,800
I'm dialing 911 and hoping somebody like Derek Chauvin

1556
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,160
responds to the call.

1557
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,920
Again, great bit.

1558
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,080
I mean, you would if you were white.

1559
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,560
And I do love the idea that he's insistent

1560
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,840
on making sure people know that Black Lives Matter

1561
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,600
does not address burglaries.

1562
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,840
Yes, yes.

1563
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
Just to make sure everyone knows.

1564
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,680
Thank you, Norm.

1565
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,080
One, the number for Black Lives Matter,

1566
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,560
significantly longer than 911.

1567
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,280
I also wouldn't call the police to deal

1568
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,400
with like racial injustice issues.

1569
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,240
Nope, nope.

1570
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,320
So I wouldn't call them to deal with like advocacy

1571
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,160
for causes.

1572
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,000
Uh, yeah.

1573
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,840
Woo.

1574
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,360
We've made an amazing point.

1575
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,200
I think it's good.

1576
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,320
It's so good that Norm had to do it again.

1577
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,160
Yeah.

1578
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,520
The same fucking point on my back to back episodes.

1579
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,880
Mic down for this.

1580
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,720
Cause Norm's gonna lie a little bit about the idea

1581
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,160
of reassignment surgery for minors.

1582
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,000
Oh no.

1583
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,560
But that's less important than the exchange

1584
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,760
that happens at the end of this clip.

1585
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,600
Okay, okay.

1586
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,920
Cause it is so heartbreaking.

1587
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,760
Okay.

1588
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,600
It is so sad.

1589
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,040
We cherish difference for the sake of difference.

1590
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,480
We're in a situation where parents could be accused

1591
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,360
of risk of injury to a minor by not heeding

1592
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,640
their minor children's desire for sex change operations.

1593
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,880
I mean, it's just absolutely insane.

1594
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,360
And I don't really know who benefits from this.

1595
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,160
It's hard to imagine that anyone does.

1596
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,000
Satan.

1597
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,320
Well, yeah, you know, that would be one candidate.

1598
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,160
Oh my God.

1599
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,080
You're a fucking lawyer.

1600
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,320
Who benefits from this?

1601
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,360
Satan.

1602
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,840
Oh boy.

1603
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,680
Oh boy.

1604
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,800
Your honor, I ask that this case be thrown out.

1605
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,600
Seeing as how half of the jury is Satanists.

1606
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,760
How embarrassing would it be to be like,

1607
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,240
well, maybe we used to be taken seriously.

1608
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,880
Now I'm sitting here with this dumb fuck Alex.

1609
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,560
He's telling me the answer to Qui Bono is Satan.

1610
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,800
And I have to be like, well, that's one option.

1611
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,760
That's a possibility.

1612
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,640
To take this bullshit seriously.

1613
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,000
At no point in time could I consider that perhaps

1614
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,160
somebody would benefit from not having their emotional life

1615
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,720
destroyed by their real identity being denied them,

1616
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,880
but it's gotta be the devil.

1617
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,840
So I think that Alex has a disease.

1618
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:55,840
I think he has a compulsion, sickness and addiction.

1619
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,360
And that is whenever Norm Pattis is on the show,

1620
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,600
he can't help himself,

1621
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,800
but make declarations that involve a million dollars.

1622
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,120
Probably put her face up.

1623
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,240
She's under lights, like 10 lights

1624
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,600
that are on her at a press conference.

1625
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,160
And she's got almost pure pupils.

1626
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,440
Talking about Maxine Waters.

1627
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,640
Yeah, I put that together.

1628
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,760
From my research, you've got to at least,

1629
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,640
we're talking 10 lines of methamphetamine,

1630
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,240
cocaine or LSD to do that.

1631
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,120
I mean, those eyes are, she is jacked.

1632
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,760
What the hell is she on, man?

1633
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,840
She's, I mean, she's on self-righteous fumes.

1634
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,680
No, seriously.

1635
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,440
Look, I'll bet anybody a million dollars.

1636
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,920
You can't shine bright lights in somebody's eyeballs

1637
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,840
and have them be 95% pupil.

1638
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,880
I mean, look at that, God almighty.

1639
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,840
I don't understand enough of the physiology

1640
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,680
of pupil dilation.

1641
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,960
Let me get into this flash.

1642
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,720
Any police training, let me tell you.

1643
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,760
I, it's remarkable.

1644
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,840
I mean, once is a, I mean, it's still not a pattern,

1645
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,000
I guess, but Norm has been on for two instances

1646
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,320
of Alex offering million dollar bounties on things.

1647
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,080
If it were Norm, I'd be like, is it me?

1648
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,920
I do appreciate it.

1649
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,760
Is it something about me?

1650
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,040
Am I so boring that Alex needs to spice this up

1651
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,920
with millions of dollars on the line?

1652
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,320
I do appreciate that Norm is like,

1653
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,360
well, I think she's on self-righteousness

1654
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,240
because I am not going to insist that she is on drugs.

1655
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,160
That's not what I do.

1656
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,760
You already pimped me out into saying

1657
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,600
that maybe the devil.

1658
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,560
Maybe it was the devil.

1659
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,160
You forced me to say that.

1660
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,040
Yeah. Yeah.

1661
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,640
So, man, interesting.

1662
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,760
Norm, not Norm's appearance, very boring.

1663
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,600
No, of course.

1664
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,480
But what is interesting is that immediately after this,

1665
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,600
Alex has Barnes on.

1666
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,440
Why?

1667
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,280
His other lawyer friend.

1668
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,880
You always have the double lawyer attack.

1669
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,440
I think it's because it's the law day.

1670
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,280
Well, that's right.

1671
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Chauvin trials going on.

1672
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,120
Chauvin trials, yeah.

1673
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,840
You might as well have as many lawyers on as you can

1674
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,160
and there are only two who will.

1675
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,240
Yeah, but I might have accidentally skipped a minute

1676
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,560
or something because Alex was in the middle

1677
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,320
of talking to Norm and then he's talking about

1678
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,200
how Barnes is the smartest lawyer that he knows.

1679
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,040
Oh, boy.

1680
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,080
And I'm like, did he just say that but he meant Norm?

1681
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,920
I don't know.

1682
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,520
I couldn't tell until Barnes started talking to himself

1683
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,640
and I'm like, okay, I guess they just had them back to back.

1684
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,640
So maybe we just stroked out for a minute there.

1685
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,400
Yeah, but as soon as he was on,

1686
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,480
I kind of figured out what was going on.

1687
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,800
The whole point of a jury trial

1688
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,520
is to not have mob justice.

1689
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,400
It's the counter to mob justice.

1690
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,560
It's the opposite point to mob justice.

1691
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,880
It's the remedy to mob justice.

1692
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,360
So by trying to create mob justice inside the courtroom

1693
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,160
and convert the jury into a mob,

1694
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,360
they are completely defeating the entire point

1695
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,320
of jury trial justice and maybe their goal,

1696
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,880
much like with policing,

1697
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,240
will be to ultimately replace juries.

1698
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,080
Exactly.

1699
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,120
Why the bold assault?

1700
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,200
Why are they so arrogant?

1701
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,040
How do we counter this?

1702
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,360
Because this should really threaten all Americans.

1703
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,000
This is just as bad as going after free speech or guns.

1704
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,520
But one of the greatest protection

1705
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,440
against total control by the state is the jury system

1706
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,480
because it's ordinary, everyday people coming together.

1707
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,600
It says the power of the judiciary lies with the people.

1708
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,720
Absolutely.

1709
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,760
The power of the state is in the power of the jury.

1710
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,240
And it's a check on politicians.

1711
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,080
It's a check on abusive state actors.

1712
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,480
And the media wants the power to misquote, misphrase,

1713
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,480
misscript, misrepresent, and then the media wants the power.

1714
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,480
Like, what we say juries gotta do.

1715
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,440
So I found this really interesting.

1716
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,440
So what's going on here is that Barnes

1717
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,000
is coming on the show here towards the end.

1718
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And the game that they were playing,

1719
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,880
I thought was really overt.

1720
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,880
What's going on here is, so for a lot of the show,

1721
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,720
the fear that Alex has been building up to

1722
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,960
is one of a hung jury or an acquittal,

1723
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,240
which is what the globalists want

1724
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,920
because then there's gonna be riots in the streets.

1725
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,760
Naturally.

1726
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,800
This trial is essentially an elaborate setup

1727
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,280
to get people riled up to the point

1728
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,040
where there will be riots.

1729
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,840
That's what Alex's callers have suspected

1730
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,320
and Alex has mirrored this sentiment back to them.

1731
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,440
He's even said that he believes

1732
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,760
that Maxine Waters' statements were intentionally made

1733
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,240
to cause a mistrial so there would be riots.

1734
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,560
But what if that doesn't happen?

1735
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,880
You don't wanna put all your eggs in that one basket,

1736
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,160
so here comes Robert Barnes

1737
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,120
to provide the alternative narrative.

1738
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,640
In case things don't go the way Alex

1739
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,200
has been saying they will this whole episode.

1740
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,040
Yeah.

1741
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,600
In case Chauvin is found guilty,

1742
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,480
Barnes has the narrative in place here,

1743
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,240
that Maxine Waters' comments were essentially

1744
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,560
the creation of mob rule within the courtrooms

1745
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,080
in order to replace jury trials with mob justice.

1746
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,520
Until the verdict is read,

1747
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,080
if you're a listener of Infowars,

1748
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,320
you're being asked to believe

1749
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,760
that Maxine Waters' comments were simultaneously

1750
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,240
an attempt to replace juries with mob justice

1751
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,120
and also a needlessly complicated conspiracy

1752
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,760
meant to cause a mistrial that'll lead to riots.

1753
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,720
Infowars needs both of these to be true

1754
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,400
until the verdict comes.

1755
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,040
It's a game of Schrodinger's bullshit.

1756
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,000
Yeah.

1757
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,360
I do appreciate how his audience,

1758
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,760
in fact, maybe how all of conservatives

1759
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,520
view everybody on the left

1760
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,600
insofar as never speaking to them,

1761
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,080
they know exactly what the left is going to do.

1762
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,440
It's kind of amazing that if you never learn anything

1763
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,800
about your political enemy, quote unquote,

1764
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,360
you can make them say whatever it is you want them to say.

1765
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,280
True, yeah.

1766
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,440
So Infowars have these narratives established

1767
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,840
and they're ready to push their worldview

1768
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,000
and pretend that they were right

1769
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,880
regardless of how the jury decides.

1770
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,400
The act of the verdict being read

1771
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,560
actually determines which of these ideas

1772
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,680
they have to accept as truth moving forward.

1773
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,520
Yeah.

1774
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,440
If Chauvin is not guilty,

1775
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,320
Alex will say that Waters caused that to start the riots,

1776
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,440
but if he is guilty, that angle will be quickly forgotten.

1777
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,560
The reverse is true of the mob rule storyline.

1778
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,400
Yeah.

1779
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,640
This is an important point to recognize,

1780
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,440
that reality doesn't matter to someone like Alex.

1781
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,720
Real life events are just things

1782
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,160
that he incorporates like props

1783
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,760
into the story that he decided to tell long ago.

1784
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,600
Yeah.

1785
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,600
And the story with the Chauvin trial

1786
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,400
is that there's no outcome that's actually good.

1787
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,360
They're all just useful.

1788
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,200
Yep.

1789
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,040
To Alex.

1790
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,160
Yep.

1791
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,240
It is, yeah, it's very annoying.

1792
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,120
It's very annoying that they can just fucking,

1793
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,760
it's like they're pre-writing a choose your own

1794
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,280
adventure book based on the story, you know?

1795
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,880
Like they've already got where they're going to wind up,

1796
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,360
just they just have to give you

1797
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,080
the different like pathways to go down.

1798
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,880
And if they choose page 19,

1799
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,360
then you have to start over at page two

1800
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,560
and be like, okay, well now they're gonna start

1801
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,640
a race war next time.

1802
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,280
But this time it was a Maxine Waters mob rule.

1803
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,440
Well, it's basically like, you know,

1804
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,720
insistently saying both A and B,

1805
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,200
which are contradictory things.

1806
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,040
Yeah.

1807
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,040
And then B happens.

1808
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,880
Yeah.

1809
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,640
And then someone criticizes you for talking

1810
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,840
so much about A and be like, no, I said B.

1811
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1812
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,520
You said both.

1813
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1814
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,180
Dick.

1815
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,480
Well, A squared plus B squared equals

1816
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,480
either A or B squared, I believe is how the, yeah.

1817
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,380
So Barnes, he has some comments that he wants to make

1818
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,240
about how society got to the point that it is now,

1819
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,920
where you have such a nanny state.

1820
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,600
Does he say that it's his fault?

1821
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,000
No, although Alex should probably be mad at him.

1822
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,400
What did we do to let these lunatics get to this point?

1823
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,300
And how do we counter people like this?

1824
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,360
Well, it sort of starts with the culture itself.

1825
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,240
The politics is downstream from culture

1826
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,220
and the sort of the entire safe space movement

1827
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,680
that arose out of sort of the moral panic

1828
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,000
about kindergartens at elementary schools

1829
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,840
and daycare centers in the nineties,

1830
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,800
going to, you know, all of those range of cases

1831
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,440
where a lot of stories were told by the prosecutors

1832
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,640
that ended up being false,

1833
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,240
created sort of a playdate culture

1834
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,640
where we weren't allowed to let our kids go out

1835
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,640
in the street and just play with random strangers.

1836
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,000
You're saying the nanny state has created

1837
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,400
a lot of neuroses and now they can leverage that

1838
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,080
at anything they want.

1839
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:30,900
Correct.

1840
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,920
No, he was saying that's a satanic panic.

1841
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,320
So Robert Barnes' main contention

1842
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,360
is that conservative right-wing outrage

1843
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,600
towards an imaginary problem

1844
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,080
led us into a circumstance

1845
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,280
that is almost entirely conservative outrage

1846
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,840
at a made up problem?

1847
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,020
Yeah, more or less.

1848
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,100
That does make sense.

1849
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,280
But the reason that Alex should be mad about this

1850
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,120
is that Robert Barnes is saying that like the things

1851
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,440
like the McMartin School trial and stuff,

1852
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,280
there were things that were alleged that weren't true.

1853
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,160
Which Alex has often said are 100% true.

1854
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,680
He believes that Ted Gunderson

1855
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,200
is the most reliable source ever

1856
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,680
and Barnes is saying literally the opposite.

1857
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,240
This is silly.

1858
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,600
Both can be true.

1859
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,400
Yeah, and I do, I wonder if Barnes was stopping himself

1860
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,200
because you could hear him say mmm

1861
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,400
and he stopped himself from saying McMartin.

1862
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,520
Like maybe he just didn't want to be too specific

1863
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,360
or whatever, like at risk of pissing off Alex.

1864
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,480
I think there's a rule of like don't tread too closely

1865
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,920
into Alex's zones, you know,

1866
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,560
especially not with specifics.

1867
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,560
Yeah, especially when you can't bear the indignity

1868
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,640
of agreeing with Alex's stupid position on it.

1869
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,280
Well, it could be the devil this time, Alex.

1870
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,240
Norm got trounced.

1871
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,240
So look, Robert Barnes, noted gambler on politics.

1872
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,360
True.

1873
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,800
This guy loves to make a bet.

1874
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,000
May make some money, yeah.

1875
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,440
So Alex wants to know what.

1876
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,860
You know how it's great if your lawyer

1877
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,520
is also gambling on the side?

1878
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,720
You know how what you want from your lawyer

1879
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,920
is also gambling?

1880
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah, so Barnes is the kind of guy

1881
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,840
who's gonna make a definite stake

1882
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,320
in terms of like what's gonna happen with this verdict.

1883
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,920
Is he gonna put a million dollars down?

1884
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,760
No, he's not, Alex.

1885
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,640
Oh, damn.

1886
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,800
And I think that there's a decent chance

1887
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,920
that we get an acquittal.

1888
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,280
My view is there's about a 50% chance

1889
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,760
of an acquittal in this case,

1890
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,120
and that's gonna shock the media,

1891
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,440
that's gonna shock a lot of people

1892
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,860
who didn't watch the trial,

1893
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,740
but it would affirm the confidence that people rightly have

1894
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,580
in the authority of the court.

1895
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,800
And I agree, because I think the last straw

1896
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,060
is threatening the jury.

1897
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,420
People go, wait, we're the bad guys?

1898
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,480
We're being honest here, I'm a good person.

1899
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,320
I wanna do justice.

1900
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,320
You're saying I'm bad, I better do what you want?

1901
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,840
That would make me, you know,

1902
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,980
if I was on the knife's edge of which way to go,

1903
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,320
that would make me acquit.

1904
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,880
So Alex is talking about thinking

1905
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,600
that Maxine Waters has threatened the jury.

1906
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,120
So if I understand Alex correctly,

1907
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,880
were he on a jury, the main thing

1908
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,760
that protects us from a mob rule system,

1909
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,360
were he considering the actual justice,

1910
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,160
he would take somebody, anybody's comment in the media,

1911
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,680
and use it as justification for his spiteful decision

1912
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,200
to exist entirely within oppositional defiance.

1913
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,800
Oppositional defiance would rule his decision-making,

1914
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,200
not the facts of the case.

1915
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,440
The only thing protecting us from mob rule.

1916
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,120
Look, I'm pretty sure this fucking person's innocent, but.

1917
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,480
Maxine Waters said some shit.

1918
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,320
Bill Maher said.

1919
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,160
He was talking shit.

1920
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,640
Wait, Bill Maher's cool now.

1921
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,440
Oh shit, who am I mad at?

1922
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,280
Who do we choose?

1923
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,100
Jimmy Kimmel?

1924
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:39,940
Oh my god.

1925
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,920
Yeah, also, congratulations Barnes

1926
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,240
on your 50-50 bullshit.

1927
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,480
Yeah, yeah, well, it could go one way

1928
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,400
or it could go the other, or there's a third possibility.

1929
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,720
Wishy-washy nonsense.

1930
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,840
So I found this very bizarre,

1931
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,380
but not really all that bizarre.

1932
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,080
There was this phenomenon going on

1933
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,740
where you had these two possibilities

1934
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,440
and these two narratives that were built up,

1935
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,600
one at the beginning of the show

1936
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,280
and one towards the end of the show,

1937
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:10,280
where you have Maxine Waters is trying to cause a mistrial

1938
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,800
in order to get rights in the streets.

1939
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:18,280
And then Barnes, she's doing this to create mob rule

1940
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:23,280
in order for the jury to be cowed into voting guilty.

1941
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,840
And I was like, both of these things are kind of,

1942
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,540
it's tough, you have two disconnected threads.

1943
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,000
And then what I thought was really interesting

1944
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,320
is in this next clip,

1945
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,840
you can kind of see Alex tie them together.

1946
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,660
Really?

1947
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,500
Yeah.

1948
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,520
All right, I'm listening.

1949
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,360
Believe it.

1950
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,360
So bottom line, do you think threats to the jury backfire

1951
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,060
and they acquit or do they bow down?

1952
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,800
I think that's an open question.

1953
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,560
I think it worked with some jurors,

1954
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,740
didn't work and backfired with other jurors.

1955
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,720
And the question is who wins out in the end?

1956
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,320
So now what Alex has done is he's taken these two things,

1957
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,240
he's woven them together under a similar umbrella

1958
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,120
and he's made it feel like they're connected.

1959
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,800
Alex has decided that the deciding factor in this case

1960
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,600
is whether or not these threats to the jury

1961
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,640
have been successful,

1962
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,680
which is already an outrageous assumption for him to make.

1963
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,080
What this does is remove any reality

1964
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,020
of the facts of the case,

1965
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,840
or even the possibility that any of the jurors

1966
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,160
could find Chauvin guilty unless they were doing so

1967
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,600
as the result of bowing down to threats.

1968
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,060
There's no such thing as the merits of the case.

1969
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:20,900
None.

1970
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,340
By framing the conversation this way,

1971
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,680
the conclusion is that the right verdict is acquittal,

1972
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,920
that's just assumed.

1973
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,640
And the explanation for a guilty verdict

1974
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,360
is that the jury was afraid of the threats,

1975
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,740
which is nonsense.

1976
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,320
I said this makes Alex's narratives

1977
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,020
feel like they're connected,

1978
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,260
but they're actually not if you take a closer look.

1979
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:40,040
This new, cleaner framing leaves out the entire thing

1980
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,920
about Maxine Waters specifically making the comments she did

1981
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,860
in order to cause a mistrial so there would be riots.

1982
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,700
Right.

1983
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,560
This is not the same thing as threats backfiring

1984
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,920
and leading to a...

1985
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50,760
An acquittal.

1986
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,600
Yeah.

1987
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,000
One of the differences between them is really major, too.

1988
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,920
You would think,

1989
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,920
because it's part of the globalist overarching plan,

1990
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,560
that's the problem here.

1991
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,840
Why are we adding this element that destroys the plan

1992
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,520
that was already working?

1993
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,360
Yeah, I guess.

1994
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,180
Yeah.

1995
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,720
So in the conception of how Alex was talking

1996
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,420
about the verdict earlier in the episode,

1997
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,480
it was pretty clear that the globalists wanted an acquittal

1998
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,760
because their goal was to incite street riots

1999
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,600
and burning the cities.

2000
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,440
Right, which you're not gonna get with a guilty verdict.

2001
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,880
If that is the case,

2002
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,460
then these alleged threats to the jury

2003
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,520
have to have been meant to be so over the top

2004
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,140
that a mistrial is guaranteed and the riots happen.

2005
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,660
However, in the new framing,

2006
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,840
it appears that the globalists actually want Chauvin

2007
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,360
to be found guilty.

2008
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,600
It's the mob rule.

2009
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,320
These threats are either successful,

2010
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,320
in which case the verdict is guilty,

2011
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,700
or they backfire and the verdict is not guilty.

2012
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,520
But the reason that the threats are made

2013
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,940
are in service of achieving a guilty verdict.

2014
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,060
Right, if you pay close attention,

2015
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,420
over the course of one show,

2016
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,260
Alex has completely changed the primary motivation

2017
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,920
of his imaginary villains

2018
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,560
because he's just making this up as he goes along.

2019
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,080
None of this means anything.

2020
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,020
This whole thing is basically just a lazy idiot

2021
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,120
engaging in an act of really long,

2022
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,520
really bigoted improvisational storytelling.

2023
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, basically.

2024
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,760
And having weirdos like Robert Barnes

2025
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,840
help him out along the way.

2026
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,860
Oh boy.

2027
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:19,080
So that was the tale, I think, of the 20th.

2028
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,840
And then in the evening of the 20th afternoon,

2029
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,840
depending on time zone.

2030
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,660
Sure, sure.

2031
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,080
Maybe morning, who knows, maybe you're overseas.

2032
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,680
What you gonna do?

2033
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,640
Chauvin guilty.

2034
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,520
Yes.

2035
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,840
Also Ted Nugent got COVID.

2036
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,040
Yes.

2037
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,880
Other news.

2038
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,360
Is he on the 21st?

2039
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,800
No, he doesn't.

2040
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,880
He should go on.

2041
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,720
He doesn't come up.

2042
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,940
He's gotta go on.

2043
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,200
He's gotta go on with COVID, that's gotta happen.

2044
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,680
Sure, yeah, and lick Alex.

2045
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:48,480
And absolutely find a way to be like, this isn't real.

2046
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,560
So we come in on the 21st now

2047
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,880
after the verdict has happened.

2048
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,720
Yeah.

2049
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,680
And you can tell a little bit of a different tone.

2050
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,520
Oh, you think?

2051
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,160
A different vibe is happening in Info Wars Studio.

2052
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,360
We have to reach out to God to open our hearts

2053
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:10,200
and our spirits and transcend all the evil.

2054
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,920
What is wrong with you people?

2055
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,920
All the evil, poison we exhumed out by Satan's slaves.

2056
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,800
Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday,

2057
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,880
April 21st, global transmission.

2058
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,600
It's a Lana Del Rey kind of day.

2059
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,680
It is, I just, it's Europe.

2060
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:31,040
Ah, we watched him murder somebody.

2061
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,140
It's not an attack on whiteness.

2062
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,400
It's not even, it's not an attack on whiteness.

2063
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,200
Why do they all have to make it an attack on whiteness?

2064
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,520
There are so many reasons to attack whiteness.

2065
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,520
We didn't need this one.

2066
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,500
You know how you were saying

2067
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,680
that you enjoyed that nice bath?

2068
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,920
I did, loved it.

2069
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,560
I think that Alex was in a similar place

2070
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,960
that you were before the bath

2071
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,960
because of this quote unquote attack on whiteness.

2072
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:52,800
Yes, yeah, yeah, sure.

2073
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,000
And the only thing that he could have,

2074
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,880
he couldn't have a bath,

2075
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,360
so he had to listen to Lana Del Rey.

2076
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,580
He loves this album, man.

2077
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,880
I'll tell you what.

2078
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,480
Well, her new album's even better than last.

2079
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,760
Amazing.

2080
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,760
Cool album.

2081
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,760
Great Christian album, but you know,

2082
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,600
I'm sure it's not one of the things you'd ever see.

2083
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,740
It's a real Christian, not a fake one.

2084
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,660
Sure, sure.

2085
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:20,480
Avant-garde, the cutting edge, the future.

2086
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,920
Get behind me, Satan.

2087
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,240
I'm guessing that Alex just saw

2088
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,580
that one of the titles of the songs on Lana's new album

2089
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,960
is Tulsa Jesus Freak.

2090
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,680
Yeah, I was gonna say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2091
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,520
He just decided this is a Christian album now.

2092
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,680
Absolutely, yep, yep, all he needed to see.

2093
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,780
Has Alex forgotten that just three years ago

2094
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,660
he was spending quite a bit of time on his show

2095
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,560
yelling about how Lana Del Rey was a witch

2096
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,280
who'd used evil spells against Donald Trump

2097
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,500
because she'd said in an interview

2098
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,120
that she used witchcraft against Trump?

2099
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,280
Yep, that does sound right.

2100
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,280
Does he now remember how the entire right wing

2101
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,860
was up in arms about her breakthrough album

2102
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,760
being called Born to Die?

2103
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,820
That was the other outrage machine time.

2104
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,800
That was back then when the outrage machine

2105
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,280
was cranking out that bullshit.

2106
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,960
It's just, it's so interesting.

2107
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,320
I feel worried for him when he's playing

2108
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,480
a bunch of Lana Del Rey.

2109
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,840
Yeah, I don't appreciate that it's okay

2110
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,200
for him to love Lana Del Rey publicly,

2111
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,040
but he can't admit that he fucking loves Star Wars.

2112
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,800
Yeah, he still feels the need to be like,

2113
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,960
I don't even like those dumb movies.

2114
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,240
It's so infuriating.

2115
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,600
Now let me reference an obscure character.

2116
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,160
Yeah, exactly, someone you would only know.

2117
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,960
Someone who only exists in the books.

2118
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,480
An immediate pull from something

2119
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,200
it would be impossible to immediately pull from.

2120
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2121
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,760
Yeah, can't do it because Star Wars is not Christian

2122
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,120
like Lana Del Rey's new album.

2123
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,320
Oh boy.

2124
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,760
So in Christianity.

2125
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,300
How's Christianity doing, still kicking it?

2126
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,040
Well, God's real, Satan's real.

2127
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,200
Yeah.

2128
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,640
Well, I guess that means Christianity

2129
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,600
is having a great time, there's right.

2130
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,480
Satan is real and God is real and you are real.

2131
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,000
And this is not a simulation.

2132
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,680
That sounds like something a simulation would say.

2133
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,600
This is the great test of consciousness.

2134
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,200
That's exactly like what somebody

2135
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,040
in a simulation would say. Consciousness

2136
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,880
or the seed of the universe,

2137
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:18,760
the seed of infinity is not just given away freely.

2138
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,680
You must be tested.

2139
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,960
I must be tested.

2140
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,880
And so when you see the Nancy Pelosi's

2141
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,960
and the Maxine Waters and the Prince Phillips.

2142
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,000
What?

2143
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,520
And the David Rockefeller's

2144
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,520
and the Bill Gates's of the world.

2145
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:42,440
These are people that failed the test.

2146
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:47,200
These are people held in mindless clown-like bondage.

2147
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,440
Did I mostly keep that clip in for the turn

2148
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,040
of phrase clown-like bondage?

2149
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:51,880
Ah, it's a good one.

2150
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,720
Possibly.

2151
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,560
It is a good one.

2152
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,040
Clown-like bondage is not bad.

2153
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,120
That's very evocative.

2154
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:59,120
Yeah. Also, I mean, it's just indicative

2155
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,840
of like kind of this mood that Alex is in

2156
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,960
at the beginning of the show, like over Lana Del Rey

2157
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,480
he's talking about Satan and like God

2158
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,120
and he's in a very, very deeply spiritual.

2159
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,840
Yeah, it does seem like we're going to get

2160
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,320
into more esoteric Christianity for a little bit.

2161
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:18,880
Yeah, lest we deal with the covering the verdict.

2162
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,160
No, we don't want to do that.

2163
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,440
No, there's a lot of racist things that you would say

2164
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,400
if you were to cover that verdict and you were out.

2165
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,120
You should probably just talk about Satan.

2166
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,600
Satan's a real good guy.

2167
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,520
We are in the process of not humans' extermination

2168
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,520
but the slow destruction of all carbon-based life forms

2169
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,720
on this planet is the goal of Satan.

2170
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,760
Does that matter?

2171
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,680
Because God created this carbon-based system.

2172
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,640
We are made in the image of God

2173
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,440
and Satan hates our supremacy.

2174
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,280
Why?

2175
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,840
Humans are incredible when we're unchained.

2176
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,000
We are beautiful.

2177
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,280
We can experience the universe

2178
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,840
and communion with the creator.

2179
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,160
We're like rods and cones in the eye of God.

2180
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:18,640
We are God's vessels, God's tentacles, God's probes

2181
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,200
God's system experiencing consciousness.

2182
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,480
I don't want to be any of that.

2183
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,480
And nothing Satan can do will ever change that.

2184
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,320
What?

2185
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,160
I don't know.

2186
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,240
I feel like maybe he should have gone to college

2187
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,080
and got high.

2188
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,240
Maybe you would have worked some of this out of his system.

2189
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,040
Like having like really annoying conversations with people.

2190
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2191
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:42,720
Cause that's very simple.

2192
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,120
Okay, so you're telling me that one, this life.

2193
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2194
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,600
Hit it again.

2195
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,920
Hit it again.

2196
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,120
One, one.

2197
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,160
I got to break out the ball.

2198
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,480
Yeah, you're going to need it.

2199
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,120
This life is a test, right?

2200
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,160
Consciousness is a test.

2201
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,880
And that's all it is

2202
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,360
because God is testing you to see if you can come

2203
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,320
and hang out with him.

2204
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,160
I guess.

2205
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,000
Right.

2206
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,360
But Satan is the person or entity doing the testing.

2207
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,200
Sure.

2208
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,760
Thus he is part of God's plan.

2209
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,600
Right.

2210
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,800
And if you're like Pelosi or Prince Phillip,

2211
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,160
you have failed the test and you're in clown-like bondage.

2212
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,120
You're in clown-like bondage, naturally.

2213
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,720
But I mean, it's like, he's been doing this for,

2214
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,160
you know, thousands of years.

2215
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,480
Why is he still taking it so personally?

2216
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,160
You know, the devil is like, I'm already part of the plan.

2217
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,280
And God's like, he's not going to succeed

2218
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,880
at destroying all of the people.

2219
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,440
We've got Alex fighting him.

2220
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,080
It's because the last 999 years of this thousand year plan

2221
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,920
has been all leading up to this.

2222
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,280
Well, that's why God gave us Alex.

2223
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,600
There's this sort of bias that people have

2224
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,320
about like immediacy or currency.

2225
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,360
Like the time right now is the most important time ever.

2226
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,680
And every generation thinks they're the last generation.

2227
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,640
Exactly.

2228
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,000
And obviously there's reasons to feel that way sometimes,

2229
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,160
but Alex suffers from that in a way that intersects deeply

2230
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,040
with narcissism and kind of scary.

2231
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,440
Yeah, it's not good.

2232
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,480
So yeah, I just, I remember,

2233
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,520
I had a lot of conversations like that.

2234
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,600
Like maybe when I started to like, I don't know,

2235
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,600
explore some of the elementary ideas about

2236
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,960
Gnosticism or something.

2237
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2238
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,200
You know, like, oh, blowing minds.

2239
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,120
Yeah, that's when you should have that,

2240
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,080
your head is empty, you're a big dumb dumb.

2241
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,840
You should be smoking weed and having dumb conversations.

2242
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,120
But at the same time, when you're not smoking weed,

2243
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,320
you should be reading books

2244
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,360
and struggling with reading comprehension.

2245
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,280
And then you won't have to have

2246
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,800
those conversations ever again.

2247
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,600
I love of never having those conversations, Dan.

2248
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,280
So one thing that I thought was really bizarre

2249
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,440
and maybe off-putting was where he goes immediately

2250
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,960
after this conversation about how we're elements

2251
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,600
of God's eye experiencing things for God.

2252
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,440
Also tentacles.

2253
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,320
Mic down for this, because this,

2254
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,560
I want to see if this hits your ear

2255
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,400
the same way it hit mine.

2256
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:10,400
We're like rods and cones in the eye of God.

2257
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,840
We are God's vessels, God's tentacles,

2258
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,560
God's probes, God's system experiencing consciousness

2259
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,480
and nothing Satan can do will ever change that.

2260
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,920
So don't let the enemy get you down.

2261
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,920
I know it gets me down, it's sad.

2262
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,400
And don't let their religion of race war

2263
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,520
and their religion of worshiping black people

2264
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,760
on the surface when they're doing the opposite

2265
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,800
or killing them ever get you down.

2266
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,920
Ever get you down.

2267
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,520
That really felt weird.

2268
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,600
Do you, do you, do you?

2269
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,360
I don't feel comfortable.

2270
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,200
No.

2271
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,600
No, that makes me feel very uncomfortable.

2272
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,440
That's really weird.

2273
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,040
That's really gross because now you're transforming

2274
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:06,040
the fight for even the slightest modicum

2275
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,400
of racial justice into a holy war against anyone

2276
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:14,240
who would try and get a modicum of racial justice.

2277
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,080
Try and get a modicum of racial justice.

2278
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,840
Yeah, there's some of that.

2279
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,960
And also the pronouns that are used

2280
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,040
are a little bit strange.

2281
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,120
He's using we a lot when he's talking about

2282
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,120
the eyes of God and what have you.

2283
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,160
And then them when he's talking about black people.

2284
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,000
It does seem like what he was doing.

2285
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,720
It does seem to be a little bit of a disconnect.

2286
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,680
I think he has a very different view of people

2287
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,640
based upon their skin and appearance.

2288
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,040
And that's just me, that's just me, I could be wrong.

2289
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,600
I'll tell you what, that seemed very strange.

2290
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,160
That hits my ear very weird except

2291
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,840
there's a very easy explanation

2292
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,880
that would not make it hit my ear very weird.

2293
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,520
And that is if Alex knows that he's just talking

2294
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,360
to white people.

2295
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,840
Yes, yes, then what he said makes total sense.

2296
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,120
Makes perfect sense, yep, yep.

2297
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,320
But if he thinks that he's talking to a diverse audience,

2298
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,880
that's weird, that doesn't make sense.

2299
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,720
That's not cool.

2300
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,040
The structure of that sentence is bizarre.

2301
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,360
I would be more careful if I were him.

2302
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,200
Anyway.

2303
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,000
What I'm saying is that we denizens of the great Rhodesia

2304
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
and, wait, wait, I shouldn't have said that.

2305
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,960
Well, I mean, we Christians.

2306
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,200
Alex's buddy Gary Allen loved Rhodesia.

2307
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,640
It was surprising.

2308
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,040
So, you know, I always like to find these kinds of moments

2309
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,400
where there's olive branches, where there's a possibility

2310
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,920
for Alex and I to agree on something.

2311
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,880
Sure, we want reconciliation as always.

2312
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
I mean, even if it's superficial, I'll take it.

2313
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,700
Sure.

2314
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,740
I kind of thought that maybe Nancy Pelosi's

2315
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:47,340
very unfortunate and poorly constructed comments.

2316
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:50,020
Oh boy, boy, boy, boy, Nancy,

2317
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,500
you're really putting your name at the top of the list

2318
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,300
to go fuck yourselves.

2319
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,640
Nancy Pelosi came out and referred to George Floyd's murder

2320
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:02,420
as a sacrifice for justice, which was real shit.

2321
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:03,260
Woof.

2322
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,620
I thought that maybe there would be an opportunity

2323
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:09,180
for Alex and I to come to some sort of an agreement

2324
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:10,420
that, hey, that was not good.

2325
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,740
Yeah, it seems like it wouldn't be hard.

2326
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:16,780
That's the level of shit that if I was Nancy Pelosi's aide,

2327
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:19,860
I would immediately tackle her off the stage.

2328
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,980
I would be like, everybody will like you more

2329
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,380
if you get hurt for this.

2330
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,020
And then come up with an excuse of, like,

2331
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,420
I saw someone, a threat.

2332
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,540
I ate chili, just anything.

2333
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,500
Unfortunately, this would have been a layup for Alex

2334
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,100
to get me to agree with him,

2335
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,860
but somehow he manages to not only miss the shot,

2336
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:42,060
he broke his ankle midair.

2337
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:42,900
Critical failure.

2338
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,740
Let me see Nancy Pelosi say we'll play it in a moment.

2339
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:48,860
She said yesterday, breathing through her face diaper,

2340
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:51,200
huffing and puffing at 82 years old,

2341
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,200
with her tenuous grasp to life,

2342
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:03,080
as her spirit begins its descent to her master,

2343
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:08,080
and she thanked George Floyd for his sacrifice,

2344
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,160
like he was a veteran, like he was Jesus on the cross,

2345
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,880
like he was a Messiah.

2346
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,680
Oh boy.

2347
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,760
A drugged out,

2348
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,340
male prostitute,

2349
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,900
devastatedly unhappy,

2350
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:29,320
possessed by the spirit of the world

2351
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,800
until the moment he died.

2352
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,240
Just missed it.

2353
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,200
Just missed the mark.

2354
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,200
Just incredible.

2355
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,280
Just incredible.

2356
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,480
Something so...

2357
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,320
So easy.

2358
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,840
He's too racist to even criticize Nancy Pelosi

2359
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,120
when she's being racist.

2360
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:44,960
Yeah, yeah.

2361
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,800
Wow.

2362
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,640
Remarkable.

2363
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:50,760
That is a level I just didn't expect.

2364
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,720
I just didn't expect it.

2365
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:53,560
Yep.

2366
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,640
I mean, there's disappointment,

2367
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,480
and then there's disappointment.

2368
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,680
And then there's that.

2369
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,080
Yeah.

2370
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,280
Not you, like, Alex,

2371
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,800
you can't even clear that incredibly low hurdle

2372
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,640
of critiquing Nancy Pelosi for that kind of a bungle.

2373
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,720
How dare she not be racist enough for me?

2374
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,560
Yeah.

2375
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,920
That's not good.

2376
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,760
No.

2377
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:13,580
That's not good.

2378
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,420
Nope.

2379
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,320
So the feds, they're taking over policing,

2380
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,400
which means actually the UN is in charge,

2381
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,200
and uh-oh, we have no government.

2382
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,040
Okay.

2383
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,040
And there is

2384
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,520
Pelosi announcing the globalist,

2385
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,440
UN-controlled federal,

2386
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,120
and the feds are run by the UN now,

2387
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,480
meaning UN takeover of our police,

2388
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,540
just like they control our medicine and our speech

2389
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,300
and policies of our military.

2390
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,820
We are now a conquered nation.

2391
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,880
And until we realize we're a conquered nation,

2392
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,880
we have no hope.

2393
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,320
But if we unified against their evil,

2394
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,520
we could easily take back our government.

2395
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,160
This is just about the Department of Justice

2396
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,200
opening an inquiry into the Minneapolis Police Department.

2397
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,120
Alex is such a dramatic little baby

2398
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,360
that he's turned that into the UN running the country,

2399
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,680
and the only people who can stop them

2400
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,720
and take the country back are him and his buddies.

2401
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,560
Yeah.

2402
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,520
It's ridiculous.

2403
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,120
You gotta escalate things a lot quicker

2404
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,900
whenever your big bad is the devil.

2405
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,320
You know, you can't be like, this is just going to,

2406
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,760
he couldn't even possibly be like,

2407
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,900
they're just going to root out the patriots

2408
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,280
in the police state, and that's why it's bad.

2409
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,800
It has to be a complete overthrow

2410
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,480
of the United States government.

2411
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,320
Sure.

2412
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,080
Yeah, yeah, gotcha.

2413
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,960
So, I don't know if you're aware of this,

2414
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,840
but we live in a multiverse.

2415
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,800
I am aware of that.

2416
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,520
Do you know that we live in those universes simultaneously?

2417
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,840
It has to be true.

2418
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:35,920
It's real heady stuff.

2419
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,760
Yeah.

2420
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,320
We do not just live in one dimension.

2421
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,320
We live throughout the multiverse.

2422
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,280
I want to open the phones up

2423
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,280
until the bottom of the next hour

2424
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,160
and the constitutional lawyer joins us, Norm Pattis.

2425
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,480
I'd like to shift to dimensions.

2426
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,760
Yeah, I would very much like to not do that.

2427
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,360
Yeah, how do I live in the dimension

2428
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,320
where Norm Pattis isn't coming back on the show?

2429
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,040
How about that, you dick?

2430
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,960
Yeah, what's the quantum suicide thing?

2431
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,600
Can you just quantum suicide

2432
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,280
until you get into a good universe?

2433
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,400
How do I get to the universe

2434
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,320
where you have a better fucking booking agent?

2435
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,360
Yeah, no kidding.

2436
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,320
It's ridiculous.

2437
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,680
Too much, Norm.

2438
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,580
Nope, can't do it.

2439
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:15,440
So, I want to tell you in advance here,

2440
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,800
this is not a good clip.

2441
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,120
This is a bit racist.

2442
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:24,080
Oh, well, if you're saying that now after where we've come.

2443
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,840
Well, this has to do with a lead-in to conversation.

2444
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,640
He doesn't actually have much of a conversation

2445
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,840
about the Bryant shooting in Columbus.

2446
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,680
Sure, sure.

2447
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:40,040
But the way he does get into it is not good.

2448
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,520
It's already been at historic highs, black on white crime,

2449
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,880
because a lot of black young people

2450
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,320
are buying into the lie and doing it, and it's terrible.

2451
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,640
But they're highly impressionable,

2452
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:54,640
and they're being told that this is what you should do.

2453
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,760
And I just saw a video of this morning.

2454
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,320
It's an article on Infowars.com.

2455
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,120
We'll play it next hour while we take your calls.

2456
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,360
Columbus, Ohio, a quote,

2457
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,520
little black baby, the media said.

2458
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,560
She's a big girl for 15.

2459
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,820
Looks like she hasn't missed out on any cheeseburgers.

2460
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:11,960
How fucking dare you?

2461
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,680
She was stabbing a white woman and a black woman

2462
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:18,040
with a eight-inch knife.

2463
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,580
It looks like a short butcher knife.

2464
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,720
Black people called the police.

2465
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,260
She gets there and she keeps stabbing people.

2466
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,820
And so they were stabbed, two people were stabbed.

2467
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,400
And because the white devil shot the black angel,

2468
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,040
Black Lives Matter's protesting and rioting.

2469
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,680
There's a lot of details that are yet to be sorted out

2470
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,520
about this shooting.

2471
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,240
And I don't feel like I have an ability

2472
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,040
to fully assess the situation yet.

2473
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,160
I'm gonna leave that to more information to come out,

2474
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,160
time to process and what have you.

2475
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,600
I wanted to play this clip, however,

2476
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,200
to demonstrate how open and shut things are for Alex

2477
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,040
and how coverage of this story begins by discussing

2478
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,760
how impressionable black youth are

2479
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,520
and how they're being taught to attack white people.

2480
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,760
The actual details of this case are secondary

2481
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,760
and not nearly as important as how explicitly racist Alex

2482
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,600
and his show are.

2483
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,200
This is outrageous.

2484
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,720
That is so fucked up.

2485
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,880
I just don't know.

2486
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,560
Black youth are very impressionable.

2487
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,560
How can, I don't, I will never understand

2488
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:27,160
quite how easy it is for white racists to get to like,

2489
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:30,280
well, if you're 15 and black though, you're big.

2490
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,120
Right.

2491
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,500
You're bigger than 15 year old white people.

2492
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,720
So whatever happens is fine.

2493
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:39,360
I just, how, how do you get there?

2494
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,600
Like, it's just unconscionable.

2495
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,440
It just really is.

2496
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,120
I don't disagree.

2497
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,720
Like for all they're screaming about pedophilia,

2498
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,840
it's fine if teenagers get killed though,

2499
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,960
because they're black and that means they're bigger

2500
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,200
or whatever, fuck off, unreal.

2501
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,000
Yeah, it's pretty breathtaking.

2502
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,840
And the ability for content that is this racist

2503
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,720
to not be like, it's amazing that it exists.

2504
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,120
Yeah, it really is.

2505
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,680
It's shocking that it exists and isn't dealt with

2506
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,400
in the proper context.

2507
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,040
You know, like it's not related to as like,

2508
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,520
this might as well be a Klan show.

2509
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,200
No, it's 100% a Klan show.

2510
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2511
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,440
Granted, sometimes it's a milder Klan show.

2512
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,880
Sometimes they talk about other things.

2513
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,500
Well, I'm sure the Klan had to talk about like anniversaries

2514
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,560
and oh, like we have a new kid, you know, like that kind of.

2515
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,880
Bitcoin comes up from time to time.

2516
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,480
Sure, sure.

2517
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,740
But man, this is, this is some pretty,

2518
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:36,560
pretty out in the open racist shit.

2519
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,400
That's unreal.

2520
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,240
Yeah.

2521
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,060
That's just unreal.

2522
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,240
But if you were to ask Alex,

2523
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,000
he has a completely different idea.

2524
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,120
He thinks his show is like full of sophisticated information.

2525
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,360
Really?

2526
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,960
I've always believed in the people.

2527
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,800
And that's why I-

2528
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,620
You said you hate them.

2529
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,640
This broadcast is a populist program

2530
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,040
to just put out very sophisticated information,

2531
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,200
but also simple truths at the same time,

2532
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,980
believing that if you up the level of information,

2533
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,800
that ups the level of understanding,

2534
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,800
not dumb the information down

2535
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,720
and dumb down the population of feedback loop.

2536
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,560
Wow.

2537
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,280
But that said, when I do this governmental briefing style,

2538
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,540
PowerPoints and guests and just go over documents,

2539
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:21,200
that is extremely effective, not just with like General Flynn

2540
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,360
but I can tell you prime ministers, world leaders,

2541
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,160
they had CIA boardrooms two weeks ago in our spars,

2542
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:34,160
2025, 2028 report because it was done in a briefing format.

2543
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,560
Not a fucking chance.

2544
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,260
I feel like this is a simulation

2545
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,760
because there's no way a human being

2546
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,720
could possibly be that unself-aware.

2547
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,580
Well, I think he is self-aware.

2548
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:44,840
I just think that's the image

2549
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,040
that he wants the audience to have of him.

2550
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,720
He can't possibly fucking believe

2551
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,400
that anybody took that shit seriously.

2552
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,600
Cannot possibly believe that.

2553
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,320
That spars video that he did

2554
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,360
was so fucking offensively clunky.

2555
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,540
It was so dumb that Mike Guy was a total weirdo.

2556
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:02,280
They were taking lines completely out of context,

2557
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,440
making completely false assertions about the document.

2558
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:10,120
Anybody who actually read it without just already

2559
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,480
pre-deciding that Alex was right

2560
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,320
would come away from that like,

2561
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,120
this doesn't say what you say it says.

2562
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:15,960
Yeah, that's true.

2563
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,780
There's a CIA fucking boardroom.

2564
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:19,640
Oh my God, not a fucking chance.

2565
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:22,120
Here's the thing that I have to say.

2566
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:22,960
Sure, sure, sure.

2567
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,080
I do like the idea that Alex thinks

2568
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,420
that he has another speed.

2569
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:28,260
Right.

2570
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:30,480
I do like that idea because I think it's funny

2571
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,440
when he does that.

2572
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,280
Yes, it is very funny.

2573
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:34,320
I think it's really funny when he tries.

2574
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,680
He thinks he's ramping it up.

2575
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,520
Because it's very bad.

2576
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2577
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,880
And he just doesn't have it.

2578
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,840
He doesn't have that pitch anymore.

2579
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,840
Maybe never did.

2580
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,680
No.

2581
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,080
But he was certainly better at looking

2582
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,680
like he did earlier in his career.

2583
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,520
Right, right, right, right.

2584
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,600
But I like that because I would like for him

2585
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,400
to take this way more seriously,

2586
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,860
because I will too, and I do.

2587
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:57,680
And I don't want to talk about conceptions of the devil.

2588
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,520
I don't care.

2589
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,340
Right, right, right.

2590
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:00,180
I don't give a shit.

2591
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:02,760
You don't even know how fast your fastball goes.

2592
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,600
Yeah.

2593
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,800
But you've been hanging around 75,

2594
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,840
like sooner or later he's going to get better

2595
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,240
at batting practice and it's just not happening.

2596
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,200
It's not happening.

2597
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,040
No.

2598
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,040
Nope.

2599
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,240
It's just, it's frustrating.

2600
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:18,640
And I would like you to do some CIA boardroom shit.

2601
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,480
Yeah, that's kind of interesting though,

2602
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,280
because once you find out like the FBI

2603
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:27,680
was listening to Joe Biggs on like Antifa protests,

2604
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:30,240
you realize like, oh, these people are morons.

2605
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,080
You know, like I could buy that the CIA had meetings on it

2606
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,080
because I don't know if I trust any of them

2607
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,220
to do a fundamental Google search at this point.

2608
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,060
Let me actually.

2609
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:38,880
They're all insane.

2610
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,720
Let me say this.

2611
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:40,560
Yes.

2612
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,480
If I worked in the CIA,

2613
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:43,440
I might want to have a meeting on it too,

2614
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,800
but just for a day off.

2615
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2616
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,620
Hey guys.

2617
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,460
Get some pizza.

2618
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,300
Guys, we got a new Alex.

2619
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,240
We got a new Alex, guys.

2620
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,160
Get in the boardroom.

2621
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,880
We're going to, we'll put it on the big screen.

2622
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,880
Ain't no way this is going to turn into any work.

2623
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:54,720
Yeah.

2624
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:55,560
Yeah.

2625
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,920
Yeah.

2626
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:57,760
So anyway.

2627
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,600
Yes.

2628
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,420
It's time for the big enchilada.

2629
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:00,260
Okay.

2630
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:01,400
Let me just give you the big enchilada,

2631
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,040
then I'll go to your phone calls.

2632
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:09,240
The globalists with their money have got the universities,

2633
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:13,360
the banks, the medical system, the media system,

2634
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,480
the world council of churches.

2635
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,980
Almost all the churches are just

2636
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,840
country club feel good groups.

2637
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:20,400
I don't care if it's Protestant, Catholic.

2638
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,320
It doesn't matter.

2639
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,920
They've got Hollywood.

2640
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:24,760
They've got the EU.

2641
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,880
They've got radical Islam and Orthodox Islam.

2642
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:28,960
They've got Israel.

2643
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,720
They've got South Africa.

2644
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:31,820
They got everybody.

2645
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,760
Wow.

2646
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,560
There's one thing they don't have.

2647
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,320
You?

2648
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,800
And that's the US military.

2649
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,640
Okay.

2650
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:46,480
Now the US military has got its own stuff going on.

2651
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,520
It's got its own problems.

2652
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,360
Believe me.

2653
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,180
It's getting a divorce.

2654
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:52,160
But it's still men and chivalry.

2655
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,920
And to operate at that level,

2656
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,960
some form of honor, even though it's predatory.

2657
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,020
And so the globalists want to intimidate it, attack it,

2658
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:01,280
cause race riots, to selectively demonize

2659
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,640
the military and police with these purges

2660
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,000
to get control of them.

2661
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,280
They don't need to.

2662
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,660
They have a plan B.

2663
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:09,640
There's a fucking super bio weapon release

2664
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,480
that they can do.

2665
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,600
None of this makes sense.

2666
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,040
Why would they have?

2667
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,720
They don't need to take over the police.

2668
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,780
Also, if Alex's beliefs mean anything,

2669
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:19,560
they don't have Russia, right?

2670
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,440
Like he, what?

2671
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,000
No, they've got everything.

2672
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
They've got everything except the military

2673
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,840
and the police.

2674
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,680
They've got everything except the United States military

2675
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,760
and the police.

2676
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,560
The fact that you're putting those two together

2677
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,120
kind of makes you realize what the police is.

2678
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:32,960
Don't you?

2679
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,880
I mean, like this is so ridiculous.

2680
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:39,240
I just, I have a hard time like even taking this seriously.

2681
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,780
The good news is there's still plenty of white nationalists

2682
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:44,560
in the US military and the police.

2683
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,040
Still a lot of heavily armed weirdos.

2684
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,880
We got plenty of white nationalists really rooting

2685
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,360
for us to kill people.

2686
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,160
So we got that.

2687
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2688
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,660
This is just, it feels like it just felt like

2689
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:58,960
that was what was gonna like work for him to say.

2690
01:34:58,960 --> 01:34:59,800
Yeah, yeah.

2691
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,280
And it just doesn't match with any of the stuff he says.

2692
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:05,040
Normally, it doesn't make sense why the globalists

2693
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,320
need the military and the police.

2694
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,520
Yeah, you know what I feel like?

2695
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,840
I feel like if you're somebody who identifies

2696
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,240
with the police and the military, you're a fascist.

2697
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,200
That's what I would go with.

2698
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:20,360
Again, this is just like improvisational storytelling.

2699
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,480
And one of the things that keeps people excited

2700
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,200
in storytelling is like, you know,

2701
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,920
sometimes the hero is doing well.

2702
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,360
Sometimes the hero's doing poorly.

2703
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,200
Yeah.

2704
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,560
And when the hero's down, you gotta cheer

2705
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,400
for him to come back up.

2706
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,600
Absolutely.

2707
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,520
The hero's journey.

2708
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,160
Come on, it's 12 steps or whatever it is.

2709
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,680
I think it was a couple weeks ago

2710
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,660
that Alex was riding pretty high.

2711
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:43,720
They were defeating the globalists.

2712
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:45,080
Sure, killing it.

2713
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:47,200
Unfortunately, they are now losing.

2714
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,040
Ooh, that's trouble.

2715
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,440
I wanna give you the honest prognosis.

2716
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,600
I'm not like the Q people that tell you everything's fine.

2717
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:55,080
We've won the war and just don't, no, no, no.

2718
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,960
We're losing and everything's collapsing

2719
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,040
and we have no future unless you get upset

2720
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,320
and speak out and take action.

2721
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,320
Now it's because we were winning culturally.

2722
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,660
There was a huge awakening, great victory.

2723
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,720
But now the globalists have taken their whole plan

2724
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,240
and launched it and accelerated their timetable,

2725
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:15,520
which is extremely reckless.

2726
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,640
They were 10 years behind.

2727
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,040
God, you just can't not hear this

2728
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,720
over and over and over again.

2729
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,560
Wow.

2730
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,040
He's gotta get a new bit.

2731
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,480
Because this bit is tired, stale.

2732
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:30,480
I just don't feel like I can handle this infinite battle

2733
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,380
between Alex and his evil enemies.

2734
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,600
And everybody is either accelerating

2735
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,480
or decelerating their plans at all times.

2736
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,600
Nobody's ever like, let's put our chip,

2737
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,840
yeah, nobody's putting their chips on the table.

2738
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,040
Let's fucking do this.

2739
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,040
Well, apparently they have.

2740
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,720
So if it doesn't work this time,

2741
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,160
I guess they've been defeated.

2742
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:51,140
Well then, what are they gonna do next?

2743
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:51,980
I don't know.

2744
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:52,800
Eh, me neither.

2745
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,320
It'll probably be boring and not real.

2746
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,280
That's true.

2747
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,400
This next clip, I would say

2748
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,240
that this should get Alex institutionalized.

2749
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,680
Okay, all right.

2750
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,380
There's a lot of things that he says

2751
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,460
that are like, you know, offensive.

2752
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:09,720
Like really offensive.

2753
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,360
Yeah, they should get him shunned,

2754
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,560
but not institutionalized.

2755
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,400
Maybe Bood.

2756
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,400
Yeah, Bood is a good one, yeah.

2757
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:19,920
This, if he really believes this,

2758
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,600
he should be put in a padded cell.

2759
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,680
Okay.

2760
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,040
But I have decided to be Christ-like,

2761
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,240
and I don't mean that blasting me, I'm serious.

2762
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,640
I have taken on the sins.

2763
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,340
I have taken them on.

2764
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:33,920
I am in a poison vision of the enemy

2765
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,880
so I can see the enemy's operations.

2766
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,520
So Alex has taken on the sins of humanity.

2767
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,360
All right.

2768
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,500
So he can see the globalist's plan.

2769
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,000
Like he's taken on the role of Jesus.

2770
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,820
Right, right, right.

2771
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:47,280
He's basically Jesus against the globalist.

2772
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,120
I was gonna say.

2773
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:50,240
This is not blasphemy.

2774
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:55,080
Alex is very close to declaring himself the new Messiah.

2775
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,600
Well, I mean, it's an interesting progression

2776
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,240
because he was like sort of getting more and more

2777
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,800
comfortable with talking about himself as a prophet

2778
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,640
over the last six months or so.

2779
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,320
John the Baptist and Trump was the, yeah, yeah, of course.

2780
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,760
And now that is not satisfying.

2781
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:07,720
Nope. At all.

2782
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,240
I've gotta take that next step.

2783
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,080
Yep.

2784
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,880
I must make myself the Christ.

2785
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,760
Look, you can only be a three-star general

2786
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,280
for so long before you want that next star, baby.

2787
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,400
Anyway.

2788
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,240
Okay.

2789
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,060
Alex takes some calls.

2790
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:26,960
I am the new Messiah.

2791
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,760
Anyways, let's go to the phones.

2792
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,720
Let's go to the calls and let's see if we can talk

2793
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,240
to a fucking dumb racist.

2794
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,720
Mainly, I want to get this out of the point.

2795
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,320
It's overwhelming to finally talk to you

2796
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,640
because for decades, people have been telling me

2797
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,960
I was too volatile and paranoid

2798
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,060
because I've been telling them about all this stuff

2799
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:44,840
except the pedophile stuff.

2800
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:47,040
I didn't have your connections, but about the

2801
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,560
we're all slaves and China's evil

2802
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,760
and how everything's propaganda against the white man.

2803
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,120
And everybody thought I was, I'm talking about all the way

2804
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:57,680
back to the nineties and everybody was just telling me

2805
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,520
I was crazy.

2806
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:01,260
Well, what they do is they brand freedom and guns

2807
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,480
and private property as the white man.

2808
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,120
And then communism is the black man.

2809
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,040
And they go, the black man's good.

2810
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,200
The white man's bad.

2811
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,120
When it has nothing to do with white men and black men

2812
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,040
it's all branding.

2813
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,040
Does that make sure?

2814
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,400
Does that make sense?

2815
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,240
Yeah.

2816
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,880
And it's been, I mean, even in commercials, you know

2817
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,120
the white man's always an idiot or, and then, and

2818
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,600
I was always showing people how, you know

2819
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,280
always shows people like abusing white men

2820
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,280
and women hitting them.

2821
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,040
And just, it was just always just-

2822
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,600
Sure goes back to married with children.

2823
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,300
Every white man on TV is an idiot.

2824
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,320
And then, and then several years ago

2825
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,000
I heard you for the first time.

2826
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,760
And I realized I'm not the only person that sees this.

2827
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,680
You know, I thought I was like cursed with this site.

2828
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,000
Oh boy.

2829
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,060
So I think the trope of the bumbling husband

2830
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,680
probably dates back a little further

2831
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,440
than married with children, but whatever.

2832
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,920
I guess it's better than if they were like

2833
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,760
I think we should go back to the honeymooners

2834
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,800
when it was fine to beat your wife.

2835
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,800
Also if Alec has a problem with the character trope

2836
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,740
of the dumb husband, he's going to really hate

2837
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:00,920
when he learns about all the other historical characters

2838
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,240
of people who weren't white.

2839
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,480
Oh boy.

2840
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:05,840
In terms of just explaining a little bit of this

2841
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,600
one of the reasons that there's such a large number

2842
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,720
of husbands and fathers who are kind of idiots

2843
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,320
is because it's the easiest way to make

2844
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,760
their character lovable and flexible enough

2845
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,040
to fit into the comedic premises that are required

2846
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,540
for a sitcom to work.

2847
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:19,480
Most of the situations the characters get into

2848
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,920
probably wouldn't happen, or if they did

2849
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,720
they would be resolved in way less comical ways

2850
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,800
if one of the characters in charge wasn't a goof.

2851
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,240
You could make every show like Father Knows Best,

2852
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,080
but guess what?

2853
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,500
Father Knows Best sucked.

2854
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,900
It's a trash show.

2855
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:36,740
Also, it's just.

2856
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:39,160
You know what, I also hate the depiction

2857
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:43,040
of white people in films being stupid,

2858
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,440
which is why I hate Breakfast at Tiffany's.

2859
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,480
Do you know what I hate about Breakfast at Tiffany's?

2860
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,000
The way they treated that poor white man

2861
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,600
who was definitely meant to read as white, 100%.

2862
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,440
Yeah.

2863
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,520
This is not an attack on the white man,

2864
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,600
but it does make sense that this guy

2865
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,400
would have these clearly racist feelings towards media

2866
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:08,320
and everything that he experiences as an attack on whites,

2867
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,880
and then he hears Alex and he's like,

2868
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,240
I've found my people.

2869
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:12,920
Of course, no shit.

2870
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,040
Yep.

2871
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,040
I mean, it's like.

2872
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,040
It gets a lot worse.

2873
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:21,600
How can you, white people have had it

2874
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,600
so fucking pathetically easy for so goddamn long

2875
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:32,100
that the idea of one appearance in movies or film

2876
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,400
where the white guy is the bad guy is like,

2877
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,520
how could anybody do this?

2878
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,360
Well, look, you're saying that white people

2879
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,560
have had it so easy for so long.

2880
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,000
Alex would beg to differ.

2881
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,840
Oh, I'm sure.

2882
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:43,660
Based on his own.

2883
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,800
Millions and millions of dollars.

2884
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,920
Brother, I mean, listen,

2885
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,280
there's not any black people that have been attacked,

2886
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:56,280
let's not exaggerate, 75 times by white people I have,

2887
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:57,800
but I actually enjoyed it.

2888
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,260
I mean, I grew up with black folks trying to kill me

2889
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:02,280
and I learned how to fight really good.

2890
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,720
I mean, in fact, people ask how Alex Jones did all this.

2891
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,520
I owe this to black races beating the living shit out of me.

2892
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,360
I mean, I have just,

2893
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,520
and I started hospitalizing a lot of black people

2894
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,360
and they pretty soon started, you know, appreciated me,

2895
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,200
but, and I love those folks.

2896
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,840
I love the ones even I put in comas.

2897
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:18,680
Yeesh.

2898
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,280
I wanna go back to whistling.

2899
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,440
Do you remember when he whistled, Dan?

2900
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,040
I appreciated the whistling, that was great.

2901
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,280
If, oh, that's what they should do.

2902
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,780
If he gets on too much of a racist rant,

2903
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:35,360
they should just start playing the Andy Griffith theme

2904
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,560
and they'll be like, okay, I'm Andy Blackman.

2905
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,160
And they should get like one of those

2906
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,880
intermission type images and it's just.

2907
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,800
Let's all go to the lobby.

2908
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,640
But no, it's Photoshopped Alex's face onto Andy Griffith,

2909
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,560
holding hands with young Richie Cunningham.

2910
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,000
Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.

2911
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,800
Little Opie carrying a fish and pole.

2912
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,280
What a piece of shit.

2913
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,120
Yeah, he's the worst.

2914
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,240
Absolute piece of shit.

2915
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,080
He is the worst.

2916
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,720
Hey, I'm a huge racist,

2917
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:09,440
but also I'm gonna brag about how good I am

2918
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,800
and about how I defeated them in fights

2919
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,680
and put them in comas, sure.

2920
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,600
It's very strange.

2921
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,720
What a fucked up dude.

2922
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,440
But I'm just saying, I wouldn't be who I was

2923
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,760
if I wasn't put in the hospital and broken legs

2924
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,280
and broken arms and subdermal hematomas

2925
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,360
and stabbed and everything else I did.

2926
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,840
I really wanna thank black people

2927
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,640
for what they did to me, I'm serious.

2928
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,720
All right, I'm not gonna pretend to not understand

2929
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,960
the point Alex is trying to make here poorly.

2930
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,800
Oh boy.

2931
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,160
This is the old idea of being like battle hardened

2932
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:40,360
and Alex is thankful for the struggles that he went through

2933
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,840
that made him who he is today.

2934
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,680
Boy named Sue.

2935
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,740
You hear variations of that from all sorts of people

2936
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:46,320
and I think generally, you know,

2937
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,920
there's a fine version of it.

2938
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,760
Sure.

2939
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,480
But what's not fine is the way Alex is ascribing

2940
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,560
the series of beatings that he got when he was younger

2941
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,920
to quote, black people.

2942
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:54,760
Yeah.

2943
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,640
As opposed to quote, specific people he got in fights with.

2944
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:58,480
Yeah.

2945
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,920
This is generalizing to the larger black population here

2946
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,160
in a way that is incredibly fucked up.

2947
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,240
From listening to this, I'm not actually even sure

2948
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,320
if Alex realizes he's doing what he's doing,

2949
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:10,160
but man, it is embarrassing and real racist.

2950
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:14,800
Yeah, that's, this has been a real fucking highlight reel.

2951
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,560
This is, this is a...

2952
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,440
It's not been, it's not been really good.

2953
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,180
No, no.

2954
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:25,320
I would say that you might as well just come out

2955
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,960
and be like, yeah, I guess I'm a racist.

2956
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,320
I feel like I can't be too far off now.

2957
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:30,440
Yeah, it's gotta happen.

2958
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:33,380
It's like, and he can try and justify his racism,

2959
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:35,780
but you can't pretend that you're not.

2960
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:37,600
It's too late for that now.

2961
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,440
Yeah.

2962
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,280
Yeah.

2963
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,840
We have one last clip here and it's to get a little bit

2964
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,640
of a, you know, a little bit of parsley perhaps.

2965
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,760
Sure, sure.

2966
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,760
But Alex has this caller who's calling in from Brooklyn.

2967
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,600
Right?

2968
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,880
One of the last holdouts in Brooklyn.

2969
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,720
Okay.

2970
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,560
A stronghold.

2971
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:53,380
Yeah.

2972
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:54,220
Read that how you will.

2973
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:55,040
Okay.

2974
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2975
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,720
I live in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

2976
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:01,760
It's an Irish, Norwegian, Italian, German area.

2977
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,320
It's like the last Republican stronghold in Brooklyn.

2978
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:08,080
So what they're doing is they're sending people

2979
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,320
from Park Slope, other places in Brooklyn,

2980
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,800
to come in and try and take Bay Ridge over

2981
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,700
and make it a liberal town.

2982
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:19,600
Also, what they're doing is they're shutting down restaurants.

2983
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,120
They're shutting down all the restaurants

2984
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,960
and they're letting illegal immigrants sell products

2985
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,960
in the street, which is crazy to me.

2986
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,440
Elaborate on that.

2987
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:31,280
Yeah.

2988
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,520
Ha, ha, ha.

2989
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:33,360
There it is.

2990
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,600
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

2991
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,440
Been a little while since we've heard Alex eating lunch.

2992
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:38,840
That's a good one, that's a good one.

2993
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,960
So that was enjoyable.

2994
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,560
Yeah, that was nice.

2995
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:44,960
Yeah, I mean, look, I don't think that there was anything

2996
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,120
else you could really expect from this period

2997
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,920
other than like some pretty-

2998
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:49,760
Brutal racism.

2999
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,600
Some pounding racism.

3000
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:51,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3001
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,000
But I think it was interesting the way it manifested,

3002
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,240
you know, like I don't think it made sense

3003
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,920
based on real life conditions.

3004
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:00,920
No, no.

3005
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,920
And yeah, it sucks.

3006
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,880
I'm going to not listen, or I'm gonna listen eventually.

3007
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,720
Sure, sure, sure.

3008
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,120
For our next episode, I am gonna go back to 2003,

3009
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,560
because that way, over my birthday weekend,

3010
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,080
I can spend my time in the past as opposed to

3011
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,520
focusing too much on the present.

3012
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,080
That is my gift to you, dear.

3013
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,280
And that's my compromise.

3014
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,760
But yeah, this sucked.

3015
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:26,760
Yeah, that's, man, it's like that violent candle, you know?

3016
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:32,360
Like it's got, in order to move forward,

3017
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,960
we have to get rid of this bullshit.

3018
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,400
We gotta not do this anymore.

3019
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:41,120
But while we're fighting it, they're fighting so much,

3020
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,560
so fucking hard, it's insane.

3021
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,440
It's insane.

3022
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:46,160
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

3023
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,880
Fuck racists.

3024
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:52,360
So, we'll be back, but Jordan, until then,

3025
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:53,720
we have a website and all that stuff.

3026
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,560
Indeed.

3027
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,800
But more importantly, let's go out on a positive note.

3028
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:58,640
Ooh, we gotta hear it.

3029
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:01,760
And this is another track from DJ Danarki.

3030
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,600
DJ Danarki, hell yeah.

3031
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,440
Thank you so much for creating this.

3032
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,480
We'll catch you next time.

3033
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,560
Daryl Rundis, blah, blah, blah.

3034
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:27,760
Thanks.

3035
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:52,560
