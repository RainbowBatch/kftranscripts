WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.140
it's a downward slide. It's a downward slide is it? A couple of

00:06.140 --> 00:09.920
greasy overgrown man-children. They have a podcast called

00:09.920 --> 00:17.580
Knowledge Fight. Alex Jones's podcasting hecklers knowledge fight

00:17.580 --> 00:20.600
calm. They're doing research you ever listen to the show

00:20.640 --> 00:24.900
Knowledge Fight? Knowledge Fight? Oh, a couple of neck beards

00:24.900 --> 00:27.920
indeed, they literally just make stuff up. They don't appreciate

00:27.920 --> 00:29.680
literally just make stuff up.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.620
They don't ever talk about

00:30.620 --> 00:32.260
what Alex Jones actually talked about.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.180
They don't actually say what he actually says.

00:34.180 --> 00:37.980
They don't actually delve into his sources of information.

00:39.780 --> 00:42.260
Mr. Friesen, Mr. Friesen.

00:42.260 --> 00:44.420
I was live, you numbskulls.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.380
They're in the league with some sort of cult leader

00:46.380 --> 00:47.460
called Selene.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.100
Knowledge Fight, mocking Infowars every single day.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.820
It's really just incredible.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.820
It's almost hard to comprehend.

00:55.820 --> 00:58.320
Knowledgefight.com.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.160
I love you.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.460
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.200
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.040
I'm Dan.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.380
I'm Jordan.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.540
We're a couple dudes like Sir Raptor,

01:07.540 --> 01:09.340
Donald T. Crouches, and talk a little bit

01:09.340 --> 01:11.180
about Alex Jones and his sources.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.900
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.380
Shout out to DJ Dan Arkey.

01:14.380 --> 01:15.540
Oh, of course.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.540
Thank you so much for whipping up that.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.740
Fourth or fifth absolute banger of a track.

01:21.740 --> 01:22.980
We're gonna close the episode

01:22.980 --> 01:26.060
with a little special DJ Dan Arkey track also.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.700
So stay tuned for that at the end of the episode.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.100
It's incredible.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.540
But yeah, hey, what's up?

01:31.540 --> 01:33.220
Oh, that's right, Dan.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.040
Jordan.

01:34.040 --> 01:34.880
What's your bright spot?

01:34.880 --> 01:36.460
Why don't you go first?

01:36.460 --> 01:38.060
I have a little thinking to do.

01:38.060 --> 01:42.660
I will tell you, I had some stressful times

01:42.660 --> 01:45.660
past couple of days, and then last night

01:45.660 --> 01:49.060
my partner was like, I'm just vibrating

01:49.060 --> 01:51.860
with fury and stress and all this stuff.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.420
And she's like, you know what you should do?

01:53.420 --> 01:54.580
You should take a bath.

01:54.580 --> 01:59.580
So I took a downright ecstatic bath.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.300
I absolute.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.620
This makes me furious.

02:03.620 --> 02:04.460
Incredible.

02:04.460 --> 02:06.860
So what I did, I used a whole thing of bath salts.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.700
That's twice as much as you're supposed to use.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.380
Maybe, I mean, depends on the size of the bag.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.940
Deep relaxation is what it was called.

02:12.940 --> 02:15.780
I had that, I had the Cubs game on my computer.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.780
I could watch that.

02:16.780 --> 02:18.700
And I had my vape pen to my left hand.

02:18.700 --> 02:19.900
It was the best.

02:19.900 --> 02:20.740
Nice.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.560
It was the best.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.400
I'm happy for you.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.140
Although this really, really sets me off

02:24.140 --> 02:25.860
because I do feel like.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.580
You don't own baths.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.420
No, no, no.

02:28.420 --> 02:29.240
That's not why.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.080
Oh, okay.

02:30.080 --> 02:30.920
I'm happy for you to enjoy a bath.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.740
Okay, thank you.

02:31.740 --> 02:32.580
But I do have visceral memories

02:32.580 --> 02:35.100
of me telling you, yeah, baths are great.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.140
And you judging me for it.

02:36.140 --> 02:36.980
Of course I did.

02:36.980 --> 02:38.780
And now your partner comes in and she's like,

02:38.780 --> 02:40.260
hey, come on, why don't you take a bath?

02:40.260 --> 02:44.380
We both haven't matured over the years.

02:44.380 --> 02:45.220
Bullshit.

02:45.220 --> 02:47.100
I've come more towards your direction on baths.

02:47.100 --> 02:47.940
Bullshit.

02:47.940 --> 02:48.760
Yeah.

02:48.760 --> 02:53.380
I guess, what's your bright spot, buddy?

02:53.380 --> 02:54.620
What might my bright spot be?

02:54.620 --> 02:55.560
I don't know, man.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.840
I've, I don't know.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.460
I guess not caring.

03:01.460 --> 03:02.780
Is that kind of a bright spot?

03:02.780 --> 03:04.260
I would say that's kind of a bright spot.

03:04.260 --> 03:05.500
I don't give a shit.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.980
Like, okay, here's what I would say, I guess,

03:07.980 --> 03:09.180
in terms of a bright spot.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.140
Hey, there's nothing left to lose.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.580
There was a, you know, I had a lot of anxiety

03:13.580 --> 03:17.100
about the prospect of Knowledge Fight getting noticed.

03:17.100 --> 03:17.940
Sure, sure, sure.

03:17.940 --> 03:19.660
Usually by Info Wars.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.860
There's something that was kind of,

03:20.860 --> 03:22.940
it was always in the back of my mind

03:22.940 --> 03:24.460
as like being a little bit like,

03:24.460 --> 03:26.300
oh, that's kind of scary.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.140
And it doesn't matter if nothing happened.

03:29.140 --> 03:29.980
Nope, nothing happened.

03:29.980 --> 03:30.820
Nobody cares.

03:30.820 --> 03:31.740
It's fantastic.

03:31.740 --> 03:32.660
It's great.

03:32.660 --> 03:36.500
Best case scenario, we got a new theme song out of it.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.700
That's all we needed.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.060
Yeah, so like some kind of like fear that I had

03:40.060 --> 03:42.380
about the acknowledgement.

03:42.380 --> 03:43.220
Sure, sure.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.380
And granted, maybe I'll be killed

03:44.380 --> 03:45.660
by an Info Warrior tomorrow.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.500
Well.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.940
At this point, you know,

03:47.940 --> 03:49.860
there's been a couple of harassing emails

03:49.860 --> 03:52.860
and they're all from the same email address.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.700
I found the guy's address really easily, so.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.140
So if you're listening, buddy.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.300
Yeah, congrats.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.100
Just do a little bit more security on,

04:01.100 --> 04:02.780
don't send threatening emails

04:02.780 --> 04:04.340
from your personal email account.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.180
Try a proton mail account.

04:05.180 --> 04:06.580
Yeah, yeah, something like that would be good.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.420
Go for it.

04:08.580 --> 04:11.740
Yeah, I mean, I'm not too worried about this nonsense.

04:11.740 --> 04:12.580
It's great.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.060
I think a lot of people are probably tuning in

04:15.060 --> 04:19.180
and hoping to hear like sort of a deconstruction of that.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.020
Naturally.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.940
That's kind of, you know, that's kind of a big deal.

04:21.940 --> 04:22.780
And I think they will be-

04:22.780 --> 04:24.580
Everybody likes feuds, you know?

04:24.580 --> 04:25.420
Sure.

04:25.420 --> 04:26.260
Yeah.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.500
I think they will be sorely disappointed.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.860
Super.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.700
I have no interest in really talking

04:30.700 --> 04:33.020
about Harrison Smith's breakdown of-

04:33.020 --> 04:33.860
Not at all.

04:33.860 --> 04:34.700
And part of the reason is

04:34.700 --> 04:36.220
because he wasn't critiquing our show.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.020
He was critiquing an article that we didn't write.

04:38.020 --> 04:38.860
Yeah.

04:38.860 --> 04:39.700
I don't care.

04:39.700 --> 04:40.540
No, I don't give a shit.

04:40.540 --> 04:41.380
Give a shit.

04:41.380 --> 04:42.500
Yeah.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.660
So anyway, I figured the only thing we can do

04:44.660 --> 04:46.700
is move ahead and do the stuff that we do.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.420
And that is, we're going to be talking

04:48.420 --> 04:51.860
about April 20th and 21st, 2021, Blackjack.

04:51.860 --> 04:52.900
Oh, wow.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.780
Man, now you see, you were doing updated 2021.

04:55.780 --> 04:56.620
I almost did.

04:56.620 --> 04:57.940
You almost did.

04:57.940 --> 04:58.780
I almost did.

04:58.780 --> 05:00.900
You can't surprise me with a bit change mid-bit.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.060
I surprised myself.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.980
Yeah, so we're just going to do business as usual.

05:04.980 --> 05:05.820
We're going to be talking about-

05:05.820 --> 05:07.900
And I was going to, my birthday is this weekend.

05:07.900 --> 05:08.740
It is.

05:08.740 --> 05:09.580
And so one of the things that I was going to do

05:09.580 --> 05:13.260
is I was going to treat myself to going back to 2003.

05:13.260 --> 05:14.100
Mm-hmm.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.860
But I just felt like, you know,

05:15.860 --> 05:18.780
we've got the issue with the Chauvin trial.

05:18.780 --> 05:19.620
Sure.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.380
And I think that it probably is more important

05:22.380 --> 05:24.220
that we go ahead and talk about that.

05:24.220 --> 05:25.060
Yeah, yeah.

05:25.060 --> 05:26.820
And take care of some of this present day business.

05:26.820 --> 05:27.660
Not a bad business.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.620
And what better present I could give myself

05:29.620 --> 05:31.340
than to do some work?

05:31.340 --> 05:33.740
As usual.

05:33.740 --> 05:36.100
So Jordan, we're going to get into business on this,

05:36.100 --> 05:37.860
but before we do, you take a little moment to say,

05:37.860 --> 05:39.980
hey-o, what's up to some new wands?

05:39.980 --> 05:41.100
That's a great idea.

05:41.100 --> 05:44.300
So first, Paul Joseph Watson's laminated map of solitude.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.140
Thank you so much.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.180
You are now a policy wonk.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.220
I'm a policy wonk.

05:47.220 --> 05:50.380
Hey-o, Paul Joseph Watson's, et cetera.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.460
Rude.

05:51.460 --> 05:54.140
Next, Bigsby Smalls should point out that's a dog.

05:54.140 --> 05:54.980
Thank you so much.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.020
You are now a policy wonk.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.140
I'm a policy wonk.

05:57.140 --> 05:59.540
Hey-o, Bigsby Smalls.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.420
Next, Rachel.

06:00.420 --> 06:01.260
Thank you so much.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.100
You are now a policy wonk.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.300
I'm a policy wonk.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.060
Hey-o, Rachel.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.620
Every time you shake your head, it gives me hope.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.260
Like I'm fed by it.

06:09.260 --> 06:12.180
I'm growing stronger when you shake your head.

06:12.180 --> 06:14.460
Next, this one's actually possible.

06:14.460 --> 06:15.860
There's two possible names, so you

06:15.860 --> 06:17.580
could choose which one you prefer at the end of it.

06:17.580 --> 06:18.140
OK, all right.

06:18.140 --> 06:21.660
First is The Most Delicious Hamburger in the Galaxy.

06:21.660 --> 06:24.580
And the second is Simon's Disappointed Dad.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.060
First or second?

06:26.060 --> 06:27.780
I'm going to have to go with second, just

06:27.780 --> 06:30.060
for non-personal reasons.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.780
All right, Simon's Disappointed Dad, you are now a policy wonk.

06:32.780 --> 06:33.780
I'm a policy wonk.

06:33.780 --> 06:36.380
Hey-o, Simon's Disappointed Dad.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.980
I gave you eyebrow raise that time.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.100
I know, it might be the last time.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.140
Next, it's pronounced A-T-A-T, not At-At.

06:44.140 --> 06:44.860
Thank you so much.

06:44.860 --> 06:46.500
You are now a policy wonk.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.220
I'm a policy wonk.

06:48.220 --> 06:51.820
Hey-o, Mr. At-At Imperial Walker.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.460
That was straight at you, Jordan.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.700
Yes, it was.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.820
And I'd like to give a little technocrat shout out

06:56.820 --> 06:58.460
to a couple of folks out there.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.100
Tom and Kelsey, thank you so much.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.500
You are now a technocrat, or two technocrats in a pod.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.660
I'm a policy wonk.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.420
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

07:06.420 --> 07:07.740
Have yourself a brew.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.220
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:09.220 --> 07:11.420
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson,

07:11.420 --> 07:12.020
all right?

07:12.020 --> 07:13.340
Let's just get down to business.

07:13.340 --> 07:15.300
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.220
Why are you pimps so good?

07:17.220 --> 07:18.980
My neck is freakishly large.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.620
I declare info war on you.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.220
Thank you so much, Tom and Kelsey.

07:23.220 --> 07:23.980
Yes.

07:23.980 --> 07:27.100
Two peas in a pod-lacy wonk.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.420
I would call them a dick-tick in the porse.

07:30.420 --> 07:32.140
Policy wonk force?

07:32.140 --> 07:33.140
No, lost it.

07:33.140 --> 07:33.740
Lost it.

07:33.740 --> 07:34.260
OK.

07:34.260 --> 07:35.220
I was trying.

07:35.220 --> 07:36.980
So hey, this weekend, not only my birthday

07:36.980 --> 07:38.380
coming up, very excited about that.

07:38.380 --> 07:44.340
But also, I should tell you that coming to theaters and VOD,

07:44.340 --> 07:46.540
the Mortal Kombat, we're sponsored by Mortal Kombat.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.340
We are not sponsored by Mortal Kombat.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.340
We are not sponsored by Mortal Kombat.

07:51.340 --> 07:51.980
Please no.

07:51.980 --> 07:56.740
Jordan, Shang Tsung got in touch with me.

07:56.740 --> 07:59.700
He sent you an email from shangtsung at gmail.com.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.660
It's a real threatening email.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.060
All this publicity you've been getting.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.180
You will take your soul.

08:04.180 --> 08:05.860
All this publicity you've been getting,

08:05.860 --> 08:09.340
you guys got to promote the movie.

08:09.340 --> 08:11.860
No, also this weekend, though, very exciting.

08:11.860 --> 08:12.340
Yes.

08:12.340 --> 08:15.220
Now, I want to call myself out on this just right off the top.

08:15.220 --> 08:16.460
Of course, naturally.

08:16.460 --> 08:22.820
I made an incomplete note about what kind of shout-out this is.

08:22.820 --> 08:27.860
So on the 24th, this Saturday, this is Shan and Jay, right?

08:27.860 --> 08:31.260
They either have an anniversary or they're getting married.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.060
Or.

08:32.060 --> 08:34.340
So that could be your 0th anniversary.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.740
Or they're going to a dog marriage.

08:35.740 --> 08:36.140
No, no, no.

08:36.140 --> 08:36.940
It's one of the two.

08:36.940 --> 08:40.140
It's either their wedding is this Saturday

08:40.140 --> 08:41.260
or it's their anniversary.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.380
I think it's their wedding.

08:42.380 --> 08:42.900
All right.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.620
If this is your anniversary, cut this out, play it next year.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.180
If it's your wedding, cut it out and play it

08:50.180 --> 08:52.100
at your goddamn wedding.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.700
Congratulations, either way.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.500
Yes, yes.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.980
Congratulations, either way.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.460
And thank you for helping me remind myself.

08:58.460 --> 09:01.260
I've got to write more specific notes.

09:01.260 --> 09:01.900
Jeez.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.580
I like the idea that you, like when

09:04.580 --> 09:06.380
you said I wrote an incomplete note,

09:06.380 --> 09:10.420
I had this mental picture of like that Civil War note

09:10.420 --> 09:11.740
where the guy is being murdered.

09:11.740 --> 09:13.740
It's like, ah, right at the end.

09:13.740 --> 09:15.420
That's what I was looking for.

09:15.420 --> 09:19.260
So Jordan, today, like I said, 20th and 21st of April.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.260
Sure.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.580
But before we get into today's episode,

09:22.580 --> 09:24.180
we have a out of context drop.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.260
And it comes in the form of the game show

09:27.260 --> 09:29.060
that is taking over the country.

09:29.060 --> 09:29.580
OK.

09:29.580 --> 09:33.940
And that is, who is Alex going to tell to burn in hell?

09:33.940 --> 09:35.300
Is that taking over the country?

09:35.300 --> 09:36.660
We've done it a couple of times.

09:36.660 --> 09:41.380
Can I get three, can I get R, S, T, L, N, and E?

09:41.380 --> 09:41.940
None.

09:41.940 --> 09:42.980
OK.

09:42.980 --> 09:43.700
None of those.

09:43.700 --> 09:44.500
OK, fine.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.260
I was going to try.

09:45.260 --> 09:45.940
Yeah.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.140
You're going for Wheel of Fortune shit?

09:47.140 --> 09:48.380
I was going for Wheel of Fortune shit.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.260
None of those letters.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.140
OK.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.060
Do you have a guess?

09:51.060 --> 09:52.260
None of those letters?

09:52.260 --> 09:54.460
No.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.980
No.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.460
Burn in hell, CIA.

09:57.460 --> 09:58.100
Burn in hell.

09:58.100 --> 09:58.820
Damn it.

09:58.820 --> 10:01.820
How was I supposed to know that it was those letters?

10:01.820 --> 10:03.460
Well, it wasn't any of the ones you said.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.900
It wasn't any of the ones I said.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.420
So he wants the CIA to burn in hell.

10:06.420 --> 10:09.100
Man, I am bad at Wheel of Fortune.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.980
So Alex gets to talk in here.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.380
We're going to start on the 20th.

10:12.380 --> 10:16.220
And this is a day where, of course, in the afternoon,

10:16.220 --> 10:19.300
the Derek Chauvin trial's verdict comes out.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.060
But there's a good bit of anticipation surrounding that.

10:22.060 --> 10:25.500
People were kind of aware that closing arguments had been done

10:25.500 --> 10:28.580
and the jurors had been deliberating.

10:28.580 --> 10:33.500
And Maxine Waters had come out and made some comments

10:33.500 --> 10:34.740
that Alex isn't happy about.

10:34.740 --> 10:35.460
Oh, of course not.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.340
This will take up quite a bit of the show.

10:37.340 --> 10:37.860
Yeah.

10:37.860 --> 10:39.580
And then Alex.

10:39.580 --> 10:42.100
But he doesn't have a problem with black women speaking.

10:42.100 --> 10:42.740
Not at all.

10:42.740 --> 10:43.580
No, no, no, no.

10:43.580 --> 10:44.340
Not a pattern.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.460
It doesn't matter in the scheme of things about George Floyd

10:47.460 --> 10:50.700
or about Chauvin.

10:50.700 --> 10:51.700
They're both humans.

10:51.700 --> 10:52.700
They both have red blood.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.620
God made them both.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.300
I mean, they matter to God.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.500
But to the globalist, they don't matter.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.780
They're just pawns in this game.

10:59.780 --> 11:01.380
I guarantee you George Floyd didn't

11:01.380 --> 11:03.020
want to get addicted to methamphetamine

11:03.020 --> 11:06.620
and to fentanyl.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.100
And I guarantee you the cop that turned out was friends with him

11:09.100 --> 11:13.980
and worked at the same club with him didn't want to kill him.

11:13.980 --> 11:16.020
But they're humans.

11:16.020 --> 11:19.820
And so we're flawed and things go wrong and bad things happen.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.780
But now the media can sit there and divide and conquer us

11:22.780 --> 11:24.500
and control us.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.340
Turns out they've gone to the former home.

11:27.340 --> 11:28.380
I'll cover next segment.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.140
Guys got my article out there in the printer.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.180
Thanks.

11:32.180 --> 11:35.660
Of one of the defense witnesses.

11:35.660 --> 11:37.620
Went to his home, hadn't lived there in two years,

11:37.620 --> 11:40.060
threw a dead pig head on his property,

11:40.060 --> 11:45.500
on the former property, and spread blood all over it.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.260
We'll show you all that coming up next segment.

11:48.260 --> 11:52.180
There's some of it right there.

11:52.180 --> 11:54.100
Barry Brode's former residence.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.780
And they went to the other jurors' homes

11:55.780 --> 11:58.740
because CBS doxed them yesterday.

11:58.740 --> 12:02.380
CBS said, here's who they are, so you can go harass them.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.340
The Maxine Waters commentary is going

12:04.340 --> 12:07.500
to be a major part of this, but where Alex begins

12:07.500 --> 12:12.580
is this pig's head and the idea of CBS doxing folks.

12:12.580 --> 12:15.380
So I've seen that story reported in other outlets than Infowars.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.860
I'm going to go ahead and assume that this act of vandalism

12:17.860 --> 12:19.660
towards the defense witness's former home

12:19.660 --> 12:22.340
did happen more or less at the same time.

12:22.340 --> 12:25.460
Although Alex does still seem to be embellishing it a tiny bit.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.460
Like, blood all over.

12:26.460 --> 12:27.460
Yeah, well, come on.

12:27.460 --> 12:28.460
It's a better story.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.580
To be clear, I am against this kind of thing,

12:30.580 --> 12:31.980
and I feel like it's counterproductive

12:31.980 --> 12:33.980
to the ability of trials to proceed.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.540
According to an NBC News article,

12:35.540 --> 12:37.940
the people responsible are being sought and are, quote,

12:37.940 --> 12:39.380
accused of felony vandalism.

12:39.380 --> 12:40.820
So there's a decent chance someone's

12:40.820 --> 12:42.620
going to get in trouble for that.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.940
That being said, I would be remiss

12:44.940 --> 12:48.820
if I just let Alex play this game of fake outrage.

12:48.820 --> 12:52.180
In November 2012, the NBC News article

12:52.180 --> 12:54.740
showed that in 2020, Roger Stone was on trial.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.220
And in case you don't remember, Alex

12:56.220 --> 12:57.460
spent a couple of days on his show

12:57.460 --> 13:00.220
trying to dox potential jurors in that case.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.300
Alex didn't even know for sure that the person

13:02.300 --> 13:04.900
he was naming on his show was actually even a potential juror

13:04.900 --> 13:07.380
in Roger's case, but he was still going to go ahead

13:07.380 --> 13:09.500
and put a target on them.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.940
And so nobody else will release it.

13:11.940 --> 13:15.820
That appears to be who it is with about 99% probability.

13:15.820 --> 13:18.300
Oh, hey, it just appears to be who this person is.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.260
Right, right.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.580
I still really feel like once you have put out a bounty

13:22.580 --> 13:24.660
on somebody, you don't get to be like,

13:24.660 --> 13:27.740
and now they're mistreating the jurors.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.820
You don't get to do that.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.900
After you do this whole big thing where it's like,

13:30.900 --> 13:32.500
this is the name of Roger Stone.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.740
Exactly, yeah.

13:33.740 --> 13:34.780
No, you lose.

13:34.780 --> 13:35.660
You lose forever.

13:35.660 --> 13:36.300
Goodbye.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.900
Naturally, Alex felt a little bit insecure

13:38.900 --> 13:41.300
about his actions because it's a very clear attempt

13:41.300 --> 13:42.340
at jury tampering.

13:42.340 --> 13:45.060
So he even addressed that on his show on November 6.

13:45.060 --> 13:47.420
Keep in mind that Roger wouldn't be found guilty

13:47.420 --> 13:49.580
until November 15.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.700
This trial was still ongoing.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.020
And then Media Matters goes, Jones

13:54.020 --> 13:57.460
should get arrested for jury tampering and harassing jurors.

14:01.780 --> 14:06.180
It's completely legal and lawful when someone's a public figure.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.540
What if Brad Pitt was on the jury?

14:09.540 --> 14:10.900
What if Obama was on the jury?

14:10.900 --> 14:12.140
What if it was Robert Mueller?

14:12.140 --> 14:13.380
What if?

14:13.380 --> 14:14.300
What if it was Hillary Clinton?

14:14.300 --> 14:15.620
What if it was Chelsea Clinton?

14:15.620 --> 14:16.700
Oh, she got called.

14:16.700 --> 14:17.540
Oh, she's on it.

14:17.540 --> 14:18.940
Oh, Chelsea Clinton's going to sit

14:18.940 --> 14:19.860
on the jury for Roger Stone.

14:19.860 --> 14:20.820
You'd say, that's crazy.

14:20.820 --> 14:21.540
Get her off.

14:21.540 --> 14:23.380
It's the same thing.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.620
It's one of their minions.

14:26.620 --> 14:29.300
And we've got her name.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.580
And we're going to release it.

14:30.580 --> 14:31.100
Oh, boy.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.340
Because that's what the press does.

14:35.340 --> 14:37.020
I know there's a war on the press.

14:37.020 --> 14:39.820
It's an interesting strategy to claim this juror that Alex was

14:39.820 --> 14:42.140
talking about as a public figure on the level of Brad Pitt

14:42.140 --> 14:42.900
or Hillary Clinton.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.920
But that was just desperation talking

14:44.920 --> 14:46.660
because he knew that Roger was guilty as shit.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.820
Oh, she had a lot of hits in the late 90s.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.820
She was really killing it.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.820
She got her big break with Thelma and Louisa.

14:53.820 --> 14:58.540
It's so convenient whenever you can just redefine public figure

14:58.540 --> 15:03.980
to be suspected minion of my imaginary enemy.

15:03.980 --> 15:06.660
Anyone that I despise.

15:06.660 --> 15:09.500
If the people who threw a pig's head at that house

15:09.500 --> 15:11.060
had thrown it at the house of a juror,

15:11.060 --> 15:13.260
or if one of the jurors on the Chauvin trial

15:13.260 --> 15:14.860
was being targeted, then I wouldn't

15:14.860 --> 15:16.340
be OK with that at all.

15:16.340 --> 15:18.260
That would fall into the same kind of category

15:18.260 --> 15:19.180
as Alex's behavior.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.780
But what did happen is a little bit of a gray area.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.180
And again, I'm still against it.

15:23.180 --> 15:24.900
But the person whose former house

15:24.900 --> 15:26.620
it was was a witness for the defense who'd

15:26.620 --> 15:28.580
already given their testimony.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.980
You could argue that it was a retaliatory vandalism.

15:30.980 --> 15:33.540
And I suspect that's why it's being considered a felony.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.540
But I do think that that's different than trying

15:35.540 --> 15:38.160
to intimidate jurors, which is what Alex was very publicly

15:38.160 --> 15:39.420
doing like six months ago.

15:39.420 --> 15:40.420
Yes, very much so.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.780
CBS also didn't dox anyone.

15:42.780 --> 15:46.180
The local Minnesota affiliate published an article

15:46.180 --> 15:48.220
that discusses the jurors, broadly speaking,

15:48.220 --> 15:52.300
just vaguely in details like their age and information

15:52.300 --> 15:53.340
about their perspectives.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.940
CBS, damn them.

15:54.940 --> 15:57.460
This is not the same thing as what Alex did.

15:57.460 --> 16:00.340
If Alex can show actual instances of people showing up

16:00.340 --> 16:02.100
at the jurors' homes, he should do that.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.060
But I can't find instances or any evidence

16:04.060 --> 16:05.500
of that being a real thing.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.180
I suspect he's just taking that defense witness story

16:08.180 --> 16:10.820
and then making up another story on top of it

16:10.820 --> 16:11.820
because it's more fun.

16:11.820 --> 16:17.740
I'm a huge fan of people who have really taken to heart

16:17.740 --> 16:21.540
all of the historical lessons about intimidating witnesses

16:21.540 --> 16:24.380
being a thing that puts you on the side of good.

16:24.380 --> 16:27.500
I think that's really, you know, history judges people

16:27.500 --> 16:30.940
for intimidating witnesses very positively.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.100
That's kind of history's thing.

16:33.100 --> 16:37.180
So Roger, when he was on trial, Alex did this whole thing,

16:37.180 --> 16:41.180
this whole nonsensical display on his show.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.180
Yeah.

16:42.180 --> 16:43.740
Interestingly, he doesn't bring this up

16:43.740 --> 16:46.660
when talking about the efforts that some people have made

16:46.660 --> 16:47.900
to intimidate jurors.

16:47.900 --> 16:48.980
That is surprising.

16:48.980 --> 16:51.220
Instead, on his show here on April 20th,

16:51.220 --> 16:53.540
he's just talking about how, like,

16:53.540 --> 16:55.500
when he's been in trial situations-

16:55.500 --> 16:56.540
Sure, sure.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.140
The globalists have tried, or the, I'm sorry,

16:59.140 --> 17:01.660
the media has tried to intimidate these journalists.

17:01.660 --> 17:02.660
The evil CBS media.

17:02.660 --> 17:04.420
I've been involved in jury trials.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.180
I've been involved in situations we later learned

17:07.180 --> 17:10.260
where the media got involved in contact to the jurors

17:10.260 --> 17:11.860
and said, if you don't do the right thing,

17:11.860 --> 17:13.500
we're gonna dox your ass.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.940
That's how corrupt the corporate media is.

17:15.940 --> 17:18.540
They're not media, they're terrorists.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.940
They're the enemies of this country.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.460
So I guess Alex thinks he's a terrorist.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.300
Yep.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.420
I think Alex should think he's a terrorist.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.460
It's interesting.

17:29.460 --> 17:32.740
So, like I said, one of the big things

17:32.740 --> 17:34.020
that goes throughout this episode

17:34.020 --> 17:37.340
is critiques of Maxine Waters-

17:37.340 --> 17:38.620
Sure.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.980
Having some public statements about the Chauvin trial.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.500
And Alex is kind of mad.

17:44.500 --> 17:48.100
He's kind of mad that she grandstands on issues like this,

17:48.100 --> 17:50.220
but won't take on some of the bigger issues

17:50.220 --> 17:52.260
that Alex cares about. No, no, no, no.

17:52.260 --> 17:53.620
And Maxine Waters said,

17:53.620 --> 17:55.780
well, that's what civil rights looks like.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.580
But she doesn't say a word about

17:58.580 --> 18:00.180
three million Muslims in death camps,

18:00.180 --> 18:01.740
a million Christians in death camps,

18:01.740 --> 18:03.620
a million Buddhists in death camps.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.460
Uh.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.100
No, no, no, no, no.

18:09.100 --> 18:12.020
She'll pick one of the 14 black men killed each year

18:12.020 --> 18:16.420
in a wrongful situation out of 350 million people.

18:16.420 --> 18:19.780
And she'll make a huge deal about that all day

18:19.780 --> 18:21.620
and act like that's all the world's problems

18:21.620 --> 18:24.460
to distract from the fact that she's a monster

18:25.540 --> 18:28.060
that sold out to China 30 years ago

18:28.060 --> 18:30.580
and deindustrialized this country.

18:30.580 --> 18:33.020
And that she promotes planned parenthood

18:33.020 --> 18:36.220
that was established to kill black people.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.180
Can you imagine if I set up a group

18:39.180 --> 18:42.700
that's mission was to quote, kill black weeds,

18:42.700 --> 18:44.260
kill black sub-humans.

18:44.260 --> 18:46.060
That's who she works with.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.460
That's who she really funds.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.140
Isn't the Republican party exactly that?

18:50.140 --> 18:51.340
I see what they've done to black people

18:51.340 --> 18:53.380
and everybody else for that matter.

18:53.380 --> 18:54.460
They just started on them.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.540
So they're farther down than us.

18:56.540 --> 18:58.420
You think I feel strong as a human watching them

18:58.420 --> 18:59.260
brainwash me?

18:59.260 --> 19:01.580
Strong as a human watching them brainwash, dumb down,

19:01.580 --> 19:03.380
drugged out, dying, killing each other.

19:03.380 --> 19:05.460
It makes me feel like a sack of garbage.

19:05.460 --> 19:08.340
But to people like her and the Democrats and Joe Biden

19:08.340 --> 19:10.180
that passed the laws to,

19:10.180 --> 19:11.780
if a black guy gets busted with drugs,

19:11.780 --> 19:14.380
he gets three times the sentence of a white person

19:14.380 --> 19:16.220
to those real elitist,

19:16.220 --> 19:19.620
cause they're beyond racist, they're elitist.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.460
Is that beyond racist?

19:20.460 --> 19:21.460
They see us as animals.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.620
They see us weak and falling apart

19:23.620 --> 19:25.660
and dying and going bankrupt.

19:25.660 --> 19:29.340
They see that and it makes them feel big inside.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.780
Makes them feel strong.

19:31.780 --> 19:33.660
Cause the truth is they're falling and they're ugly

19:33.660 --> 19:34.820
and they're stupid and they're bad.

19:34.820 --> 19:36.700
These globalists, they're black, they're white,

19:36.700 --> 19:38.460
they're Christian, they're Catholic, they're Jewish,

19:38.460 --> 19:41.020
they're Muslim, they're Chicom, they're everything.

19:41.020 --> 19:41.860
I thought they were Satanists.

19:41.860 --> 19:43.100
They're from all our groups,

19:43.100 --> 19:46.060
but they're of their father, the dirty,

19:46.060 --> 19:46.900
lion, stinking, loser ass devil.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.220
There it was, my bad, I spoke too soon.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.820
My bad, my bad.

19:49.820 --> 19:50.940
That's a loser.

19:50.940 --> 19:51.780
He's a loser.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.580
I take it back, my bad, that's on me.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.620
He's a loser, the devil.

19:55.620 --> 19:56.660
Yeah, come on, man.

19:56.660 --> 19:59.580
I know, I should've, I should've known

19:59.580 --> 20:00.780
he was gonna pull it home.

20:00.780 --> 20:05.060
Yeah, I mean like, I do appreciate how,

20:05.060 --> 20:07.100
you know, conversations about issues

20:07.100 --> 20:12.100
like the carceral state or China end up becoming rants

20:12.380 --> 20:14.980
about how they're all from the devil.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.740
They're all children of the devil.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.300
The literal Christian devil.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.700
Who I should point out is a loser.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.540
Yes.

20:20.540 --> 20:21.460
That loser ass devil.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.980
I thought he was doing great so far, to be honest.

20:23.980 --> 20:26.500
Also, incidentally, Maxine Waters has spoken out

20:26.500 --> 20:28.940
consistently about the human rights abuses in China.

20:28.940 --> 20:31.820
On September 30th, 2020, she spoke on the House floor

20:31.820 --> 20:35.060
in support of the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020

20:35.060 --> 20:37.260
saying, quote, the government of the People's Republic

20:37.260 --> 20:39.620
of China falsely refers to these concentration camps

20:39.620 --> 20:42.140
as vocational camps or reeducation camps.

20:42.140 --> 20:44.700
Make no mistake, the truth is that today in 2020,

20:44.700 --> 20:46.260
one million human beings are being held

20:46.260 --> 20:48.700
in concentration camps where they're beaten, starved,

20:48.700 --> 20:50.580
and forced to work long hours in conditions

20:50.580 --> 20:52.260
that can only be described as inhumane.

20:52.260 --> 20:54.300
And we haven't even gotten to America yet.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.580
Their relatives often have no idea where they are

20:56.580 --> 20:58.060
or whether they are alive.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.740
They're dying each day due to the cruelty

20:59.740 --> 21:01.580
of their living conditions and the brutality

21:01.580 --> 21:03.340
of the Chinese government,

21:03.340 --> 21:05.460
which executes them with impunity.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.140
Incidentally, that bill had five co-sponsors,

21:08.140 --> 21:09.900
all of them Democrats.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.340
Some of the notable Alex-friendly folks in the House

21:12.340 --> 21:15.900
who voted nay on that include Louie Gohmert,

21:15.900 --> 21:20.900
Paul Gosar, Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, and Steve Scalise.

21:20.900 --> 21:21.740
That makes sense.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.860
Alex is making up that people like Maxine Waters

21:23.860 --> 21:25.020
don't ever deal with the issues

21:25.020 --> 21:26.220
that he wants them to deal with

21:26.220 --> 21:28.860
because that makes it easier for him to trivialize things

21:28.860 --> 21:30.660
like the George Floyd killing.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.940
The reality is, however,

21:31.940 --> 21:34.500
that Alex is just making up everything he says.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.140
He has no idea if Maxine Waters has spoken out publicly

21:37.140 --> 21:39.060
against the Chinese human rights abuses,

21:39.060 --> 21:42.180
but the idea that she hasn't is the only option

21:42.180 --> 21:44.500
that fits into how his content is supposed to feel.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.340
Totally.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.780
Because that feeling is more important

21:46.780 --> 21:48.220
than accurate reporting.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.060
That feeling is reported as fact,

21:50.060 --> 21:51.020
and this is just bad work.

21:51.020 --> 21:52.060
This is how he operates.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.980
It is the most infuriating part

21:54.980 --> 21:56.940
of the right-wing bullshit sphere

21:56.940 --> 22:00.700
is that it's like, we only pay attention to these people

22:00.700 --> 22:02.780
whenever they do something we don't like,

22:02.780 --> 22:05.420
so we have honestly no idea whatsoever

22:05.420 --> 22:06.940
if she's ever spoken about China.

22:06.940 --> 22:09.300
No clue, no clue, doesn't matter.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.260
Wasn't paying attention when she did that.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.160
I am only mad whenever she speaks out

22:13.160 --> 22:14.380
about something that I care about.

22:14.380 --> 22:17.740
Wait, what is the Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act of 2020?

22:17.740 --> 22:21.260
Totally no clue, no clue, no clue.

22:21.260 --> 22:25.980
So, you know, sometimes the world opens up a little bit.

22:25.980 --> 22:30.220
You know, like, I think that now that vaccines

22:30.220 --> 22:31.820
are going around a little bit more,

22:31.820 --> 22:34.380
we're getting to a point where there's a possibility

22:34.380 --> 22:36.780
of like meeting a friend for dinner.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.680
And it's kind of exciting,

22:38.680 --> 22:40.060
or being able to go over to a friend's house

22:40.060 --> 22:41.260
for a barbecue or something like that.

22:41.260 --> 22:44.100
There's a ball game in my future, and I'm very excited.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.620
It's kinda nice.

22:45.620 --> 22:47.940
It's very exciting.

22:47.940 --> 22:48.920
Unless.

22:48.920 --> 22:49.760
Very bad.

22:49.760 --> 22:50.580
You're like Alex.

22:50.580 --> 22:51.420
Uh-oh.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.100
And you go out to dinner with James O'Keeffe.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.900
I had a really great evening last night.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.560
I had like a two and a half hour dinner

22:58.560 --> 23:02.340
with James O'Keeffe and his fantastic crew.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.180
And it's just an honor to be around these types of souls

23:05.180 --> 23:07.300
who love liberty, who are indomitable,

23:07.300 --> 23:08.580
and who have a fighting spirit.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.380
It just makes me feel strong, and it was really great.

23:11.380 --> 23:14.660
And O'Keeffe turned to me after dinner and he said,

23:14.660 --> 23:17.300
hey, we're gonna give you a big exclusive tomorrow.

23:17.300 --> 23:21.140
We're gonna actually let you break it at 11 a.m.

23:21.140 --> 23:22.540
And it's another terrorist.

23:22.540 --> 23:24.900
They caught at the border and a coverup of what happened.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.740
They were given the internal documents.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.540
That is breaking in 10 minutes at infowars.com.

23:30.540 --> 23:33.840
James O'Keeffe operates on one thing and one thing only,

23:33.840 --> 23:35.340
and that is attention.

23:35.340 --> 23:37.700
If you're ever in a position where James O'Keeffe

23:37.700 --> 23:39.100
is offering you an exclusive,

23:39.100 --> 23:41.700
you need to ask yourself some very serious questions

23:41.700 --> 23:43.060
about the legitimacy of the story

23:43.060 --> 23:44.220
that he's trying to give you.

23:44.220 --> 23:47.540
I am 100% sure this man,

23:47.540 --> 23:51.620
whose entire career is based off of lying to the people

23:51.620 --> 23:54.380
that he is speaking to at any given point in time.

23:54.380 --> 23:55.500
For the sake of attention.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.820
For the sake of attention and profit,

23:57.820 --> 24:00.780
I am sure there's no way he would backstab Alex.

24:00.780 --> 24:02.540
I'm not saying backstab necessarily,

24:02.540 --> 24:04.700
but you gotta be asking yourself,

24:04.700 --> 24:06.900
does he just not wanna stand behind this story?

24:06.900 --> 24:08.620
As it turns out, it's not an exclusive.

24:08.620 --> 24:11.060
It's a video that's up on Project Veritas

24:11.060 --> 24:12.220
that Alex just plays.

24:12.220 --> 24:13.060
Sure, of course.

24:13.060 --> 24:13.900
He's calling it an exclusive.

24:13.900 --> 24:14.740
It doesn't fucking mean anything.

24:14.740 --> 24:15.580
No, of course not.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.420
I don't even believe they had dinner.

24:16.420 --> 24:19.340
How is it possible that you can,

24:19.340 --> 24:22.220
like, the Infowars itself is blackballed

24:22.220 --> 24:26.140
on the major right-wing conservative news networks,

24:26.140 --> 24:29.220
but O'Keeffe can hang out with Alex

24:29.220 --> 24:31.260
and then still be like, Fox News is like,

24:31.260 --> 24:33.460
look at the new O'Keeffe masterpiece.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.340
To be fair, we don't have corroboration

24:35.340 --> 24:36.180
they went to dinner with us.

24:36.180 --> 24:37.620
That's true, that's true.

24:37.620 --> 24:38.820
That is true, that's true.

24:38.820 --> 24:40.460
Alex does say a lot of shit.

24:40.460 --> 24:41.540
You can't trust him bullshitting about that.

24:41.540 --> 24:42.980
He also said this is an exclusive,

24:42.980 --> 24:43.980
and it's fucking not.

24:43.980 --> 24:44.820
It's true, that's true.

24:44.820 --> 24:46.100
So let's get to that real quick.

24:46.100 --> 24:49.260
Here is the scoop that's not.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.780
Project Veritas exclusive,

24:50.780 --> 24:53.060
Department of Homeland Security insider leaks,

24:53.060 --> 24:55.020
quote, significant event report

24:55.020 --> 24:56.900
showing suspected terrorists being tracked

24:56.900 --> 25:00.300
and apprehended on US-Mexico border.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.260
This is the third one in a couple of weeks

25:02.260 --> 25:03.940
and they want this shut down,

25:03.940 --> 25:05.740
so folks get the article out.

25:05.740 --> 25:07.980
I don't care what Project Veritas does,

25:07.980 --> 25:11.020
but also even if everything that's being said here is true,

25:11.020 --> 25:13.580
then I don't care about their scoop.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.580
A suspected terrorist was tracked and arrested

25:15.580 --> 25:17.220
when they tried to enter the country.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.420
That's just a story that tells me that border security

25:19.420 --> 25:21.260
is pretty all right in catching terrorists.

25:21.260 --> 25:22.180
No, no, it's not working.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.260
It's a failure.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.700
Biden's administration is ruining everything

25:25.700 --> 25:29.460
by catching terrorists whenever they cross into this country.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.940
Also, if I were James O'Keeffe,

25:30.940 --> 25:33.060
I'd probably shy away from stories like this

25:33.060 --> 25:35.380
about terrorists and the border.

25:35.380 --> 25:36.740
They run the risk of reminding people

25:36.740 --> 25:38.740
about that time in 2014 when he dressed up

25:38.740 --> 25:40.740
as Osama bin Laden and walked across a stretch

25:40.740 --> 25:41.940
of the Rio Grande River,

25:41.940 --> 25:43.740
supposedly illustrating how easy it would be

25:43.740 --> 25:45.900
for bin Laden to sneak into the country.

25:45.900 --> 25:48.500
It was super embarrassing and he got dunked on pretty hard,

25:48.500 --> 25:51.060
so I'd be careful about reminding people about that video.

25:51.060 --> 25:54.500
I would say go for it, O'Keeffe.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.260
I think this is a great idea.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.260
You're gonna get all the attention in the world

25:58.260 --> 26:02.020
and absolutely you should dress up like Osama again

26:02.020 --> 26:03.580
and then die in the ocean.

26:03.580 --> 26:07.860
I will say that the sort of like flare for costuming period

26:07.860 --> 26:10.340
seems to be over in James O'Keeffe's career.

26:10.340 --> 26:11.180
That could be.

26:11.180 --> 26:13.980
He seemed to love to dress up earlier on.

26:13.980 --> 26:16.620
You know, when you're young, you like to dress up.

26:16.620 --> 26:17.460
That happens.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.660
You get older, you know, you put away childish things.

26:19.660 --> 26:20.500
That happens.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.660
Now he just likes to wear a suit,

26:22.660 --> 26:23.820
act really dramatic.

26:23.820 --> 26:25.100
Oh, I hate him so much.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.100
Interview weirdos.

26:26.100 --> 26:26.940
I hate him so much.

26:26.940 --> 26:29.420
Who maybe used to work at Facebook.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.260
Yeah, he's the worst.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.260
Yep.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.300
So we got a new instance

26:34.300 --> 26:37.380
of social media censorship going on here.

26:37.380 --> 26:40.860
This one doesn't quite fit all the usual suspects.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.580
It also probably isn't true.

26:42.580 --> 26:46.020
Meanwhile, Facebook removes posts by Breonna Taylor's mother

26:46.020 --> 26:47.660
criticizing Black Lives Matter

26:47.660 --> 26:50.980
saying they never helped her and they're full of crap.

26:50.980 --> 26:51.940
Wow.

26:51.940 --> 26:55.340
So now the mother of Breonna Taylor who was killed wrongly

26:55.340 --> 26:56.740
and Senator Paul passed a law

26:56.740 --> 27:00.820
to try to stop the no-knock warrants being used too much.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.780
He gets beat up for passing a lot of protector.

27:03.780 --> 27:05.140
It's all upside down.

27:05.140 --> 27:06.060
So you can see here

27:06.060 --> 27:09.060
Alex's position on the killing of Breonna Taylor has changed

27:09.060 --> 27:10.540
now that there's an angle he can use

27:10.540 --> 27:11.380
to attack Black Lives Matter.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.100
Yeah, fuck, I wanted, oh my God, oh my God.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.260
Because he's using the mask

27:15.260 --> 27:16.780
of being sympathetic about her death

27:16.780 --> 27:19.260
to make his attack on Black Lives Matter more palatable.

27:19.260 --> 27:22.460
Oh my God, you fucking opportunist, bullshitting,

27:22.460 --> 27:23.300
oh, fuck off.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.580
This is shady as hell and I have zero respect for it.

27:25.580 --> 27:27.700
A couple of quick fact checks here though.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.380
Taylor's mother did not say

27:29.380 --> 27:31.180
that Black Lives Matter was a fraud.

27:31.180 --> 27:33.060
She was commenting on the Louisville chapter

27:33.060 --> 27:33.900
of Black Lives Matter

27:33.900 --> 27:36.220
which she said she also has never dealt with.

27:36.220 --> 27:39.340
Also, there's no indication that Facebook took down her post.

27:39.340 --> 27:41.580
It's entirely possible that she removed it herself.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.380
There's no verification on that.

27:43.380 --> 27:47.380
Also, Rand Paul was beaten up by his neighbor in 2017

27:47.380 --> 27:50.100
and reports on the neighbor's trial have called it a fight,

27:50.100 --> 27:52.620
quote, over a lawn care dispute.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.140
Breonna Taylor was killed on March 13th, 2020.

27:55.140 --> 27:58.380
So unless this neighbor attacked Rand three years in advance

27:58.380 --> 28:01.520
as retaliation for passing laws limiting no-knock warrants,

28:01.520 --> 28:03.260
then what Alex is saying makes no sense

28:03.260 --> 28:05.740
and he's just grasping at straws.

28:05.740 --> 28:10.360
Also, Rand Paul's bill, S3955, was read twice

28:10.360 --> 28:11.700
and then referred to committee

28:11.700 --> 28:14.140
where it has been since June, 2020.

28:14.140 --> 28:15.580
It is a dead bill.

28:15.580 --> 28:17.820
Rand Paul has not succeeded in doing the thing

28:17.820 --> 28:19.220
that Alex is giving him credit for

28:19.220 --> 28:20.740
which his neighbor apparently beat him up

28:20.740 --> 28:21.860
for three years prior.

28:21.860 --> 28:25.780
I would, I think that's a fun, a lawn care incident.

28:25.780 --> 28:28.420
I think if Rand and I were to get into a fight,

28:28.420 --> 28:30.260
it would be like, they would be described

28:30.260 --> 28:32.060
as an existential incident

28:32.060 --> 28:35.180
insofar as I do not appreciate his existence.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.540
So that would just be my, that would be my excuse.

28:37.540 --> 28:38.380
Sure.

28:38.380 --> 28:39.200
That's what I would have.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.900
I feel like you might be the sort of cat who would like,

28:42.900 --> 28:44.660
you could get in a lawn care dispute with him.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.500
I could find a lawn care dispute.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.820
I could find any kind of dispute.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.180
I just feel like it would be,

28:51.180 --> 28:54.100
you'd like put poison on some of his yard

28:54.100 --> 28:56.140
so it would spell out something really offensive

28:56.140 --> 28:56.980
maybe in the grass.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.860
No, but what if he has a dog that ate it?

28:58.860 --> 29:01.440
I would never, ever, ever hurt a pet

29:01.440 --> 29:03.260
despite it being Rand Paul's pet.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.220
That is still a good pet.

29:05.220 --> 29:08.180
Trim his bonsai into a offensive shape

29:08.180 --> 29:10.460
out in front of his house maybe.

29:10.460 --> 29:14.780
Oh, I think I could probably get a crane

29:14.780 --> 29:16.580
and then, you know like that gag

29:16.580 --> 29:18.140
where you've got the bottle of,

29:18.140 --> 29:21.080
or the bucket of water on the door

29:21.080 --> 29:23.020
and you like open it and then somebody gets,

29:23.020 --> 29:24.140
oh, that's terrible.

29:24.140 --> 29:26.380
I get a crane, but like a really tall one.

29:26.380 --> 29:27.220
Okay.

29:27.220 --> 29:29.340
And then when he's walking out of his house in the morning,

29:29.340 --> 29:31.060
I just pee right on his head.

29:31.060 --> 29:31.900
Hmm.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.580
And then whenever he's not sure what it is

29:33.580 --> 29:35.380
and he looks up, right into his mouth.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.220
No way to kill the dog there.

29:36.220 --> 29:37.060
That's how I do it.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.020
So that I think you're safe. Exactly.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.140
Yep.

29:39.140 --> 29:40.940
I would say that if you were doing that,

29:40.940 --> 29:43.260
you'd be playing with fire.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.100
Possibly.

29:44.100 --> 29:47.420
And now the globalists want to burn down America.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.260
They want to hold the police

29:48.260 --> 29:49.420
and all the governments hostage

29:49.420 --> 29:51.340
so they roll over and a lot of them are.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.900
But don't play with me.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.060
They're playing with fire.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.340
Cause you're playing with fire.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.260
Playing with fire now, aren't they?

30:00.260 --> 30:02.220
Fire has a way of getting away from you.

30:03.420 --> 30:04.860
Way of blowing back.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.740
Burning you real bad.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.660
That's why I don't play with fire.

30:08.660 --> 30:09.500
Is it?

30:11.900 --> 30:12.740
Don't you?

30:12.740 --> 30:13.980
Cause what did old George Washington say?

30:13.980 --> 30:17.580
Old George, our leader.

30:19.260 --> 30:20.380
What'd he say?

30:20.380 --> 30:21.380
What did he say?

30:21.380 --> 30:24.620
He said, fire is a dangerous servant

30:26.340 --> 30:27.860
and a fearful master.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.220
This isn't a real Washington quote.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.780
I was going to say that's not a Washington quote

30:31.780 --> 30:32.940
by any shot.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.700
The structure of discussing fire

30:34.700 --> 30:36.020
and this exact construction

30:36.020 --> 30:37.580
with the servant master dichotomy

30:37.580 --> 30:40.140
was traced back to at least 1637

30:40.140 --> 30:42.260
by the website quote investigator.

30:42.260 --> 30:45.220
And the same idea and quote,

30:45.220 --> 30:47.100
but being applied to water

30:47.100 --> 30:49.700
was traced back to 1562.

30:49.700 --> 30:52.220
The first time this turn of phrase

30:52.220 --> 30:54.580
was credited to Washington was in 1902

30:54.580 --> 30:56.780
in an article in the Christian Science Journal.

30:56.780 --> 30:58.620
And it's not even been consistently credited

30:58.620 --> 31:00.100
to Washington since then.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.620
It's just another example of Alex

31:01.620 --> 31:03.580
thrown around fake quotes.

31:03.580 --> 31:05.660
Man, I think that one probably goes

31:05.660 --> 31:08.620
all the way back to like 150,000 years ago

31:08.620 --> 31:09.900
whenever it was just like ugh

31:09.900 --> 31:11.260
and that meant it's hot.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.180
Run away.

31:12.180 --> 31:13.700
You can use fire for things,

31:13.700 --> 31:15.460
but also it can fuck you.

31:15.460 --> 31:16.580
Exactly.

31:16.580 --> 31:17.420
So I was listening-

31:17.420 --> 31:18.460
Don't touch it, it's hot.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.540
I was listening to that clip though

31:19.540 --> 31:20.380
and I got really excited

31:20.380 --> 31:21.500
cause you know, every now and again,

31:21.500 --> 31:22.340
I hate the doors,

31:22.340 --> 31:23.340
but every now and again,

31:23.340 --> 31:25.580
I'm in the right mood for that playing with fire.

31:25.580 --> 31:26.980
Sure, sure.

31:26.980 --> 31:27.820
I don't know.

31:27.820 --> 31:28.660
I'm just in the right mood.

31:28.660 --> 31:31.180
And the way that Alex was doing the like,

31:31.180 --> 31:32.540
don't play with fire.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.220
I learned not to play with fire.

31:34.220 --> 31:36.460
Fire has a way of biting you.

31:36.460 --> 31:37.500
I got really excited

31:37.500 --> 31:38.820
and then when he said this,

31:38.820 --> 31:40.460
I got even more excited.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.700
You're the ones playing with fire.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.500
You're the one letting it out of the box

31:46.500 --> 31:47.740
and you don't control it.

31:50.460 --> 31:53.060
And those that release the fire

31:53.060 --> 31:55.820
are almost always the ones burned by the fire.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.020
That doesn't sound true at all.

31:57.020 --> 31:59.860
You must respect the fire

31:59.860 --> 32:03.380
and you must keep the fire at arm's length.

32:03.380 --> 32:06.100
But those of you that embrace the fire

32:06.100 --> 32:09.980
of 666 will be burned by the fire.

32:09.980 --> 32:12.700
You cannot contain the fire.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.700
You are not in command of the fire.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.660
You wanna play God?

32:21.660 --> 32:22.500
You're not.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.340
You're not.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.740
I wasn't ready for the fire to be the devil.

32:28.740 --> 32:29.780
I really wasn't.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.740
Oh man, oh boy.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.460
I thought it was just about taking chances.

32:33.460 --> 32:35.380
See, now who got tricked by it

32:35.380 --> 32:36.740
winding up being the devil?

32:36.740 --> 32:37.580
Yeah, I know.

32:38.340 --> 32:41.140
I was hoisted on my own petard.

32:41.140 --> 32:42.380
I was playing with fire, if you will,

32:42.380 --> 32:43.540
and I got burned.

32:43.540 --> 32:47.980
Do Christians not know how silly it is

32:47.980 --> 32:50.580
to use 666?

32:50.580 --> 32:53.020
Ooh, it's three numbers.

32:53.020 --> 32:55.100
I also do like the idea that Clank's like,

32:55.100 --> 32:56.380
you have to respect the fire.

32:56.380 --> 32:57.540
You gotta respect the fire.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.380
Wait, the devil?

32:58.380 --> 32:59.220
You gotta respect the devil?

32:59.220 --> 33:01.100
Keep the devil at an arm's length.

33:01.100 --> 33:02.300
All right, you don't embrace it,

33:02.300 --> 33:04.260
you respect the devil.

33:04.260 --> 33:05.860
And when he was saying you gotta keep the fire,

33:05.860 --> 33:07.260
I was thinking of that Kenny Loggins song.

33:07.260 --> 33:08.900
Well, I was thinking of that too.

33:10.420 --> 33:13.900
So yeah, that little diatribe was a little fun for me.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.620
Yeah, I always appreciate it

33:15.620 --> 33:17.580
whenever he really loses the thread

33:17.580 --> 33:19.140
while trying to do lyrics.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.460
And then he's like, what if I combine the two

33:21.460 --> 33:23.060
and then I'll have a thing to say?

33:23.060 --> 33:27.140
What if I turn this into a block of content?

33:27.140 --> 33:28.860
Then I have to do less work.

33:29.860 --> 33:31.500
Then I have a good excuse

33:31.500 --> 33:33.700
to have not covered any news stories.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.500
Dumb asshole.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.900
Spoken word album is coming our way

33:39.900 --> 33:40.980
once he's off the air.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.300
Anyway, Jordan, this clip,

33:43.300 --> 33:46.500
this for me is just like every now and again

33:46.500 --> 33:48.260
you need like that cute moment.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.100
Sure.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.340
And I think that this is really cute.

33:51.340 --> 33:54.380
Because there is a war on for your mind.

33:58.940 --> 34:00.580
No, no.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.220
There are a lot of diseased,

34:07.140 --> 34:11.540
crazy people who always seek to destroy innocence.

34:11.540 --> 34:14.140
And when we bow down to them, well, we get destroyed.

34:14.140 --> 34:16.140
He can't stop himself, he can't do it.

34:16.140 --> 34:16.980
He can't.

34:16.980 --> 34:17.820
He can't do it.

34:17.820 --> 34:21.380
It's too catchy, Dan, I almost started whistling.

34:21.380 --> 34:22.580
It's too catchy.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.900
He has to start whistling in the middle of a sentence.

34:24.900 --> 34:25.740
He can't stop.

34:25.740 --> 34:26.580
It's amazing.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.620
That, my friend, is a human moment.

34:30.620 --> 34:33.460
That is very cute, that is very cute.

34:33.460 --> 34:38.460
Yep, so not so cute is Alex's story corner on this episode.

34:39.460 --> 34:40.300
Oh, no.

34:40.300 --> 34:42.140
Except a little bit of a story.

34:42.140 --> 34:46.100
About something that happened when he was getting divorced

34:46.100 --> 34:46.940
from his wife.

34:46.940 --> 34:47.780
Okay.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.620
I think.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.780
How is it possible to turn this racist?

34:51.780 --> 34:53.260
Because I feel that's where we're going.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.580
It's not going racist yet.

34:54.580 --> 34:56.420
Okay, okay.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.820
We'll get pretty deep into that later.

34:57.820 --> 34:58.660
I'm sure.

34:58.660 --> 35:01.580
This story in particular is more,

35:01.580 --> 35:03.700
I don't even know what it is.

35:03.700 --> 35:07.100
I think the story Alex is trying to tell

35:07.100 --> 35:11.100
is a couple of really high-level stories.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.420
A couple of really hot ladies

35:13.420 --> 35:14.580
after he was getting divorced, right?

35:14.580 --> 35:15.980
A couple of hot ladies.

35:15.980 --> 35:16.820
All right.

35:16.820 --> 35:18.300
Invited him to a drag show.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.700
Okay, yeah, okay.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.300
And here's what happened.

35:21.300 --> 35:23.380
And I don't know what it is about women liking this.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.340
When I was getting divorced,

35:25.340 --> 35:30.020
a couple of gorgeous women that lived in the condos with me,

35:30.020 --> 35:32.180
well, one of them did, one of them didn't live there,

35:32.180 --> 35:34.780
said, hey, we want to take you to this drag show contest.

35:34.780 --> 35:36.740
And I'm like, I don't really go to topless bars.

35:36.740 --> 35:39.060
And they go, no, no, no, this is tasteful.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.220
It was in North Austin.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.820
I lived in downtown then.

35:42.820 --> 35:44.900
I was like a year into my divorce.

35:44.900 --> 35:45.740
I wasn't divorced yet.

35:45.740 --> 35:48.900
I'm like, okay, I mean, I'll go with you.

35:48.900 --> 35:51.500
And there were two gorgeous brunettes took me.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.380
And I get there and I go, what the hell?

35:54.380 --> 35:56.340
This is like, half of these are men.

35:56.340 --> 35:58.380
And the smell of the hormones, I was sick.

35:58.380 --> 36:00.060
And then they all got mad at me that I was there.

36:00.060 --> 36:01.300
And we were there like, well, you're right.

36:01.300 --> 36:02.780
We didn't know it was all men.

36:02.780 --> 36:05.220
We thought there'd be a few here, let's go.

36:05.220 --> 36:06.060
What?

36:06.060 --> 36:08.420
But I remember, and we were there like 15 minutes.

36:08.420 --> 36:09.940
This story makes no sense.

36:09.940 --> 36:13.260
This is incoherent and insane.

36:13.260 --> 36:15.660
Yeah, I wonder what the reality of the story is

36:15.660 --> 36:17.140
if he's just making all this up.

36:17.140 --> 36:21.300
Yeah, I mean, it rings true in the sense

36:21.300 --> 36:24.900
that I have no doubt that at a certain point in his life,

36:24.900 --> 36:27.500
someone invited him to a drag show.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.340
Sure.

36:28.340 --> 36:29.540
That I would believe.

36:29.540 --> 36:32.980
Well, yeah, it feels strange that you accept

36:32.980 --> 36:33.820
that invitation. I would also believe

36:33.820 --> 36:34.660
they would be incredibly,

36:34.660 --> 36:36.900
it doesn't sound like he knows what a drag show is.

36:36.900 --> 36:37.740
It's possible.

36:37.740 --> 36:40.100
I think he thinks that it's a burlesque show.

36:40.100 --> 36:40.980
Maybe.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.540
And it's not a drag show.

36:42.540 --> 36:43.780
It's tasteful.

36:43.780 --> 36:46.020
Wow, man, isn't that sad?

36:46.020 --> 36:48.480
There's a certain part of me that finds it so sad

36:48.480 --> 36:51.720
that if you're a conservative Christian white nationalist,

36:51.720 --> 36:53.820
you can't enjoy a drag show,

36:53.820 --> 36:57.300
which is one of the most joyous places that I've,

36:57.300 --> 37:00.380
there's, everybody's happy at a drag show.

37:00.380 --> 37:01.220
There's a lot of happiness.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.420
There's, it's so happy.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.620
I think that this story may or may not actually be true,

37:06.620 --> 37:08.340
or it might be greatly embellished,

37:08.340 --> 37:10.560
because I think it's really just an avenue for him

37:10.560 --> 37:12.660
to get into bashing drag queen story out.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.780
Yes, of course.

37:13.780 --> 37:15.580
And so one of the things that I've noticed

37:15.580 --> 37:18.580
that he does all the time is basically says,

37:18.580 --> 37:21.180
he says that he, his reporters have captured

37:21.180 --> 37:26.160
like pornographic footage of kids with like naked men

37:26.160 --> 37:27.140
and stuff like that.

37:27.140 --> 37:27.980
Sure, sure.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.260
And it's like, no, you haven't.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.940
Not, if you had.

37:31.940 --> 37:32.780
It would be everywhere.

37:32.780 --> 37:33.620
These people would be arrested.

37:33.620 --> 37:34.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:34.940 --> 37:35.900
Absolutely not.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.700
And so would you for playing it on your show.

37:38.700 --> 37:39.540
No, no, you can't play it on the show

37:39.540 --> 37:41.260
because the local affiliates complain.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.100
That's what I'm saying.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.420
That's what he, that's what he's saying.

37:43.420 --> 37:44.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.660
He, this is just nonsense.

37:46.660 --> 37:47.900
Yeah, this is some footage in Austin

37:47.900 --> 37:49.140
where the station's complaining about this.

37:49.140 --> 37:51.020
So don't, don't show the part with a guy

37:51.020 --> 37:54.100
totally naked with glitter with children humping him.

37:54.100 --> 37:57.620
I mean, but it's like a dude with a major slong

37:57.620 --> 37:59.260
and there's kids riding him,

37:59.260 --> 38:01.140
but he's got glitter on his genitals.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.660
So it's, oh, it's covered.

38:02.660 --> 38:04.060
I mean, this is all illegal.

38:04.060 --> 38:07.940
And so I just couldn't imagine being a child

38:07.940 --> 38:08.780
and being around these.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.460
Cause it's, it's a pack of lunatics.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.660
I mean, they're all on drugs.

38:11.660 --> 38:14.100
They're on all sorts of crazy hormones.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.220
They're doing all sorts of insane things.

38:16.220 --> 38:21.220
And I've been around it for 15 minutes

38:22.420 --> 38:25.500
and it made me physically sick.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.020
Talking about that drag show that he went to

38:27.020 --> 38:29.180
with those two very attractive ladies.

38:29.180 --> 38:30.020
Wow.

38:30.020 --> 38:30.860
For 15 minutes on that one.

38:30.860 --> 38:33.980
So, so much of that doesn't need to be part of the story.

38:33.980 --> 38:34.820
Nope.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.060
So much of it is like,

38:37.060 --> 38:39.740
those details don't help with your story.

38:39.740 --> 38:42.900
It doesn't matter how big his slong was.

38:42.900 --> 38:43.740
No, that is weird.

38:43.740 --> 38:44.820
Were that the case?

38:44.820 --> 38:47.780
It's, any size slong, it's still illegal.

38:47.780 --> 38:49.460
Let me, let me tell you this.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.180
I don't know if he was saying it was a big slong.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.900
He said it was a major slong.

38:52.900 --> 38:53.740
That's true.

38:53.740 --> 38:54.720
That's true.

38:54.720 --> 38:58.100
That means it's one rank away from giving him information.

38:58.100 --> 38:58.940
Yeah.

38:58.940 --> 39:01.660
This is not a Lieutenant Colonel slong.

39:01.660 --> 39:04.100
This, yeah, I don't know.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.340
I don't, I don't buy any of this nonsense.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.180
No, no.

39:07.180 --> 39:10.180
So Alex gets back to talking about the Chauvin trial.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.020
Sure.

39:11.020 --> 39:12.900
The anticipation is building.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.820
Maxine Waters has, you know,

39:14.820 --> 39:17.140
said some comments that Alex is not into.

39:17.140 --> 39:17.980
Sure.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.140
But the judge, you know, he's not,

39:20.140 --> 39:22.740
he's not interested in making this a mistrial.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.460
You see that judge up there.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.820
Well, we don't just listen to a Congresswoman.

39:26.820 --> 39:29.520
You know, we don't, we don't need a mistrial.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.180
No, you just have the jurors,

39:31.180 --> 39:33.340
people going to their houses the last two days,

39:33.340 --> 39:34.660
CBS news doxing them.

39:34.660 --> 39:35.620
You got people going to the,

39:35.620 --> 39:37.220
where one of the witnesses lived two years ago

39:37.220 --> 39:39.940
and putting pig blood and a severed pig head

39:39.940 --> 39:40.940
on his property.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.180
No, you just got the media saying

39:42.180 --> 39:43.780
they're going to burn down everything

39:43.780 --> 39:45.340
if you don't send him to prison.

39:45.340 --> 39:46.840
This isn't about that cop.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.900
It's about lawlessness and terrorism and this mob,

39:51.900 --> 39:56.240
this French revolution, Maoist, Bolshevik revolution,

39:56.240 --> 40:01.240
October revolution, takeover.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.960
Alex has yet to demonstrate or show any instances

40:03.960 --> 40:05.440
of jurors being doxed or harassed.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.360
So I'm not taking him repeating that claim

40:07.360 --> 40:10.240
any more seriously than I did the first time.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.860
There's another interesting thing here though,

40:11.860 --> 40:13.600
which is that the media didn't say

40:13.600 --> 40:15.280
that there would be protests and fires

40:15.280 --> 40:17.320
if Chauvin was found not guilty.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.360
Alex has played some clips from newscasts,

40:19.360 --> 40:21.640
but there are interviews with civilians in Minneapolis

40:21.640 --> 40:23.760
who are expressing that are likely beyond rest

40:23.760 --> 40:25.240
if Chauvin is acquitted.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.760
There's a really important difference here

40:26.760 --> 40:29.840
and it's one that I think Alex refuses to acknowledge.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.240
If the news goes out and interviews people

40:32.240 --> 40:34.960
and they say that they'll likely be protests

40:34.960 --> 40:36.520
if Chauvin is found not guilty,

40:36.520 --> 40:38.660
does Alex think that the news should pretend

40:38.660 --> 40:40.900
that they didn't do these interviews?

40:40.900 --> 40:42.600
If the goal is to represent the opinion

40:42.600 --> 40:44.640
of persons on the street that they talked to,

40:44.640 --> 40:47.320
it would seem like an irresponsible level of censorship

40:47.320 --> 40:48.520
to just edit their responses

40:48.520 --> 40:50.740
to reflect what you would want them to say,

40:50.740 --> 40:53.280
but that seems to be what Alex wants to happen.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.320
Well, the, okay, so the person being interviewed

40:56.320 --> 41:00.760
said specifically that if justice in this circumstance

41:00.760 --> 41:03.500
is denied when it's so overwhelmingly obvious

41:03.500 --> 41:06.320
what the verdict should be,

41:06.320 --> 41:11.020
then I'm going to help people, quote,

41:12.420 --> 41:15.120
no longer have a police precinct for a little while.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.460
And then if that was edited, it would be like a,

41:18.460 --> 41:21.040
bah, zh, bah.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.280
Well, I mean, like, I think that really what's going on

41:24.280 --> 41:28.680
is essentially that this is how Alex creates content,

41:28.680 --> 41:30.400
and so he assumes that everybody else does.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.220
Yeah, of course.

41:31.220 --> 41:35.040
Alex only puts like blurbs in and stuff that makes him,

41:35.040 --> 41:36.520
you know, like he has these-

41:36.520 --> 41:38.280
It tells the narrative he wants it to tell,

41:38.280 --> 41:39.200
so he assumes.

41:39.200 --> 41:42.280
Super cuts of Owen Schroyer dunking on libs

41:42.280 --> 41:44.200
and stuff like that.

41:44.200 --> 41:48.080
Do you think the right wing has actually convinced itself

41:48.080 --> 41:50.760
that the other side is doing what they're doing?

41:50.760 --> 41:52.800
I think Alex has probably thought that all along.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.480
Yeah, it has to be the only justification

41:55.480 --> 41:57.360
for their horrible, awful behavior, right?

41:57.360 --> 41:58.400
Yeah, I think so.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.600
Also a small point,

41:59.600 --> 42:02.140
but Maoism and Bolshevism aren't the same thing,

42:02.140 --> 42:04.400
and they have some pretty salient differences.

42:04.400 --> 42:07.120
I think Alex just picks and chooses commie words

42:07.120 --> 42:08.840
that he thinks will scare the audience.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.080
Communism is a single block.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.820
I would love for him to try and explain

42:11.820 --> 42:14.380
what he meant by the end of that sentence.

42:14.380 --> 42:16.180
That would be amazing.

42:16.180 --> 42:17.020
Yeah.

42:17.020 --> 42:20.520
So Alex is not a racist, as we've discussed many times,

42:20.520 --> 42:22.840
but usually in the reverse.

42:22.840 --> 42:23.680
He is a racist.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.500
Yes.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.020
And one of the ways that you can tell that

42:26.020 --> 42:28.400
is when he says things like this.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.880
But in all these BLM events,

42:29.880 --> 42:32.480
it's like 20, 30 white people

42:32.480 --> 42:33.760
and three or four black people

42:33.760 --> 42:35.360
who they have at the front of the line,

42:35.360 --> 42:37.880
who they admit they use at the front of the line.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.920
And then the black controllers trained as Marxists

42:39.920 --> 42:42.960
even say white allies in the back

42:42.960 --> 42:44.540
because they don't want them seen.

42:44.540 --> 42:46.600
They want it to look like it's blacks doing it.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.560
To scapegoat the blacks while they start the race war.

42:49.560 --> 42:50.520
Wow.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.000
So I'm smart enough to play chess

42:52.000 --> 42:53.280
while their folks are playing checkers.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.120
Really?

42:54.120 --> 42:54.960
Wow.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.640
That was your chess game right there.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.480
4D.

42:57.480 --> 42:58.300
Ah, yeah.

42:58.300 --> 43:00.380
I would say three moves is all it takes to defeat him.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.840
So Alex seems to be hitting this note

43:01.840 --> 43:04.280
a little bit more regularly in recent days.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.300
This idea that social justice causes

43:06.300 --> 43:09.240
are meant to incite racist backlash from white people

43:09.240 --> 43:11.360
and are orchestrated to do that by white people

43:11.360 --> 43:15.080
putting a few black scapegoats at the front of their actions.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.320
This is a pretty outrageously racist idea.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.520
And as I've mentioned in the past,

43:20.520 --> 43:22.040
particularly on the last episode,

43:22.040 --> 43:23.580
this is very much in the same tradition

43:23.580 --> 43:25.080
as Alex's forefathers who fought

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
against the civil rights movement.

43:27.080 --> 43:29.400
I realized in hindsight that maybe I should explain

43:29.400 --> 43:30.760
my point a little bit further.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.720
And now Alex has kind of given me an opening

43:32.720 --> 43:33.680
to do just that.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.520
Yeah.

43:34.520 --> 43:35.560
Alex's favorite book,

43:35.560 --> 43:37.360
the one that turned him on to the new world order

43:37.360 --> 43:40.600
was called None Dare Call It Conspiracy by Gary Allen.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.180
Apparently Alex read it at 12 and his mind was blown.

43:43.180 --> 43:45.240
Although he was still a Satanist a few years later

43:45.240 --> 43:46.380
and got a bunch of people pregnant,

43:46.380 --> 43:48.120
but honestly the timeline doesn't matter.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.200
Let's not worry about that.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.200
This book is a primer that has been cited by many people,

43:52.200 --> 43:54.560
not just Alex, but people like Richard Belzer

43:54.560 --> 43:56.360
as being like a revelation to them.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.840
Wow, the bell's tolls.

43:57.840 --> 43:58.740
Mm-hmm.

43:58.740 --> 44:01.580
Gary Allen was a longtime member of the John Birch Society

44:01.580 --> 44:03.880
and None Dare wasn't his first book.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.160
Previously he'd written a book called

44:05.160 --> 44:06.760
Communist Revolution in the Streets,

44:06.760 --> 44:09.160
which was a scathing and very racist attack

44:09.160 --> 44:10.740
on the civil rights movement.

44:10.740 --> 44:12.240
There are a lot of arguments made in the book

44:12.240 --> 44:13.600
that look very bad in hindsight,

44:13.600 --> 44:15.400
but one of the predominant themes in the text

44:15.400 --> 44:17.680
is the idea that black rights organizations

44:17.680 --> 44:20.780
were secretly not actually black rights organizations,

44:20.780 --> 44:22.740
but actually communist fronts,

44:22.740 --> 44:23.920
typically run by white people.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.560
Just in case any white people reading this

44:26.560 --> 44:29.840
are concerned about unequal treatment,

44:29.840 --> 44:32.760
let's just 100% get rid of that idea

44:32.760 --> 44:34.460
that race even exists at all.

44:34.460 --> 44:37.200
It's just white people versus white people.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.900
From page 33, quote,

44:38.900 --> 44:40.920
We arrive at the interesting possibility

44:40.920 --> 44:43.780
that the black Muslims were started by the communists,

44:43.780 --> 44:45.700
knowing that the majority of American Negroes

44:45.700 --> 44:48.120
felt no kinship with Soviet Russia.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.620
By establishing a pseudo-religion

44:49.620 --> 44:52.200
based on Negro racial supremacy

44:52.200 --> 44:54.240
and annihilation of the blue-eyed devils,

44:54.240 --> 44:56.240
a revolutionary cadre could be built

44:56.240 --> 44:58.420
within the United States without the majority of people

44:58.420 --> 45:00.920
realizing its true significance.

45:00.920 --> 45:04.400
Probably not surprisingly, Allen never actually justifies

45:04.400 --> 45:06.620
this quote, interesting possibility,

45:06.620 --> 45:09.160
because as he goes on to say, quote,

45:09.160 --> 45:11.320
If the black Muslims were a communist setup

45:11.320 --> 45:13.320
from the beginning, it's doubtful that any

45:13.320 --> 45:16.180
but the very top oligarchy were aware.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.480
That's some classic Infowars-style proof right there.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.320
That's great.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.460
This thing is true, and I can't prove it,

45:21.460 --> 45:23.600
because only the top level of the conspiracy

45:23.600 --> 45:25.800
that I swear is real has that proof.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.360
And you can trust my credentials,

45:27.360 --> 45:30.240
because my previous and former professors,

45:30.240 --> 45:31.760
all of whom top professors,

45:31.760 --> 45:34.140
I mean, you could, look, you can interview them,

45:34.140 --> 45:36.960
all of them are dead, but you can trust that I'm great.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.920
Right, you understand this construction

45:38.920 --> 45:40.080
that he's using is basically,

45:40.080 --> 45:42.440
in order to prove the basis for my conspiracy

45:42.440 --> 45:44.200
and the suspicion that I have,

45:44.200 --> 45:47.000
you have to assume the existence of the very conspiracy

45:47.000 --> 45:48.960
that I've failed to prove exists.

45:48.960 --> 45:49.800
It's circular.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.440
It's kind of, yeah, no, it's him saying

45:52.440 --> 45:55.480
that if I'm right, you would already know,

45:55.480 --> 45:58.800
or if my information was public by them,

45:58.800 --> 46:00.600
you would have already, yeah.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.920
This runs constantly throughout his book.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.260
Quote, The real cause of the riots is agitation

46:05.260 --> 46:08.380
by revolutionaries, power-craving civil rights leaders,

46:08.380 --> 46:10.460
and vote-hungry politicians who are willing to trade

46:10.460 --> 46:13.920
a citizen's safety for the vote of a minority bloc.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.120
Every group is a front,

46:15.120 --> 46:17.400
every event is incited by communists,

46:17.400 --> 46:19.100
it's all very boring.

46:19.100 --> 46:20.800
On page 48, Allen lays out

46:20.800 --> 46:23.200
what is essentially an overarching thesis.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.180
Quote, The communists have been working for over 30 years

46:26.180 --> 46:28.520
on mass recruitment of Negroes in America.

46:28.520 --> 46:29.800
Their efforts have usually failed

46:29.800 --> 46:32.300
because Negroes have proved to be loyal Americans,

46:32.300 --> 46:35.280
but this has not caused the communists to slacken,

46:35.280 --> 46:38.120
because they see civil rights as America's Achilles heel,

46:38.120 --> 46:40.360
and the Negro is the sacrificial cannon fodder

46:40.360 --> 46:43.160
for a communist-instigated revolution.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.000
This is the exact same rhetoric that Alex Jones uses now,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.520
which is being deployed by Gary Allen

46:48.520 --> 46:50.120
to attack the civil rights movement

46:50.120 --> 46:52.840
and Martin Luther King back in the mid-60s.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.040
I would challenge Alex to reflect on this more or less

46:55.040 --> 46:57.200
one-to-one overlap between his rhetoric

46:57.200 --> 46:59.320
that's being used to attack social justice protests

46:59.320 --> 47:02.100
of the modern era, and the rhetoric that Gary Allen used

47:02.100 --> 47:03.620
to attack social justice protests

47:03.620 --> 47:05.160
from our country's recent past.

47:05.160 --> 47:08.160
I mean, you could, again, this goes back to slavery.

47:08.160 --> 47:10.600
This goes all the way back to them being like,

47:10.600 --> 47:12.140
well, there's no way that slaves

47:12.140 --> 47:14.480
could ever organize on their own,

47:14.480 --> 47:18.160
so it must be white people agitating the slaves,

47:18.160 --> 47:19.720
and it's probably poor white people,

47:19.720 --> 47:22.160
because they don't like us having all the money.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.800
It goes all the way back.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.680
It's there.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.560
There is that.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.880
I choose to focus this towards this,

47:29.880 --> 47:32.560
because this is part of Alex's intellectual tradition.

47:32.560 --> 47:35.560
Right, right, the anti-communism hadn't been attached to.

47:35.560 --> 47:40.200
And this is the worldview that Alex espouses very deeply,

47:40.200 --> 47:44.080
this anti-communism stuff, and this rooting of it

47:44.080 --> 47:47.040
is something that he needs to understand

47:47.040 --> 47:49.680
and stop obfuscating.

47:49.680 --> 47:51.040
It's nonsense.

47:51.040 --> 47:55.880
You can't play the exact same game that your forefathers did

47:55.880 --> 47:57.360
against the civil rights movement

47:57.360 --> 48:00.240
and pretend like that's not what you're doing.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.600
It's not about communism.

48:01.600 --> 48:02.880
No, of course not.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.040
So Alex won't do any of this reflection,

48:05.040 --> 48:06.840
and everyone in his orbit pretends

48:06.840 --> 48:09.200
like books like Communist Revolution in the Street

48:09.200 --> 48:11.880
don't exist, because they make it too obvious that,

48:11.880 --> 48:13.800
like I said, this isn't about communism.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.600
It never was.

48:14.600 --> 48:17.560
That's all just a mask that they use to hide behind.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.360
Yeah, absolutely.

48:18.360 --> 48:21.760
Whenever the communists was used as an excuse

48:21.760 --> 48:24.640
to blackball Jews in Hollywood, it's

48:24.640 --> 48:26.560
not like J. Edgar Hoover was like,

48:26.560 --> 48:29.320
this will never work against black people.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.400
Yeah.

48:30.400 --> 48:34.520
And just to give you some idea of how

48:34.520 --> 48:39.600
little people want people to read books like this,

48:39.600 --> 48:41.880
it was very hard to find that book.

48:41.880 --> 48:42.600
I believe that.

48:42.600 --> 48:46.520
I had to get it on loan from another university's

48:46.520 --> 48:49.520
private library that I got it for like a week

48:49.520 --> 48:52.720
and was able to photocopy it.

48:52.720 --> 48:53.480
It's out of print.

48:53.480 --> 48:56.400
It's buried, probably because it's super offensive.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.520
It is a terrifyingly racist thing.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.760
I've read, you've given me one page,

49:00.760 --> 49:02.520
and I was like, Jesus Christ.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.920
Yeah, it's terrifyingly offensive and very similar

49:04.920 --> 49:08.360
to the rhetoric that Alex Jones uses now,

49:08.360 --> 49:10.680
vis-a-vis things like Black Lives Matter.

49:10.680 --> 49:13.440
Any white replacement theory in there?

49:13.440 --> 49:14.240
Yeah, probably.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.080
Yeah, we'll get there sooner or later.

49:16.080 --> 49:16.720
Yeah.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.560
So Alex goes to calls, and he wants

49:20.560 --> 49:22.640
to talk about what do you think is going to happen

49:22.640 --> 49:24.160
with this verdict, ma'am?

49:24.160 --> 49:25.720
What do you think?

49:25.720 --> 49:27.840
OK, so number one on the verdict,

49:27.840 --> 49:29.720
I think it's going to be a hung jury.

49:29.720 --> 49:32.920
I think a lot of people got scared about the Maxine Waters

49:32.920 --> 49:33.560
comment.

49:33.560 --> 49:35.400
Even the defense lawyer brought it up

49:35.400 --> 49:38.080
that his phone was blowing up on the trial.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.200
And that's what I think.

49:39.200 --> 49:40.760
I think they're going to be hung jury,

49:40.760 --> 49:42.680
and it's going to be a retry him.

49:42.680 --> 49:46.080
I think they're going to try to keep this going all year.

49:46.080 --> 49:46.840
That's my thought.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.800
Yeah, I think Maxine's totally controlled.

49:48.800 --> 49:49.680
She's a demon.

49:49.680 --> 49:51.960
I think they told her to go do that too, hang the jury.

49:51.960 --> 49:52.720
I agree.

49:52.720 --> 49:54.080
To cause the blow up.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.240
OK, so there's going to be a hung jury,

49:56.240 --> 49:58.960
and it's going to be Maxine Waters has come out

49:58.960 --> 50:01.560
and said these things in order to precipitate that.

50:01.560 --> 50:03.160
Here is my educated guess.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.000
That way there's going to be a riot afterwards

50:05.000 --> 50:06.480
because people are going to be really upset about that.

50:06.480 --> 50:07.440
They're going to be pissed.

50:07.440 --> 50:08.080
Yeah.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.440
So that's where we're at here, and that

50:09.440 --> 50:10.760
seems to be fairly consistent.

50:10.760 --> 50:11.400
Not hard.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.080
Now, this caller has another thing to bring up.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.640
Boy, things change real fast.

50:16.640 --> 50:18.040
OK.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.360
I just want to know, did you see that Omar segment

50:20.360 --> 50:22.080
where he pretty much told his audience

50:22.080 --> 50:25.520
that the liberal media has been lying about COVID

50:25.520 --> 50:26.240
the whole time?

50:26.240 --> 50:28.240
I just want to know your thoughts on the Bill Maher

50:28.240 --> 50:31.040
segment because I haven't heard talk about that yet.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.560
Well, I think Omar is very talented, very watchable.

50:33.560 --> 50:34.720
I don't agree with a lot of what he said.

50:34.720 --> 50:35.320
What the fuck?

50:35.320 --> 50:36.160
I think he got smart.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.080
Yeah, he said COVID was basically a giant hoax.

50:38.080 --> 50:39.680
And a fraud.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.000
Oh, and I forgot that he had that.

50:41.000 --> 50:41.640
I hate you.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.240
I hate you so much.

50:43.240 --> 50:43.800
Bill Maher.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.520
I hate you so much.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.480
Bill Maher is now a secret patriot.

50:47.480 --> 50:50.800
I hate him.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.680
I can't.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.280
I can't.

50:52.280 --> 50:52.920
No.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.320
That's a bricking.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.120
I just think he's fucked pretty much.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.000
He's not going to become like a regular Democrat on the left.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.920
He's going to have to come out as a libertarian

51:01.920 --> 51:03.680
or they're going to start calling him a fraud.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.960
Oh, actually, they've been demonizing him before this,

51:05.960 --> 51:08.760
saying, stop burning down random neighborhoods.

51:08.760 --> 51:10.200
Stop shooting random police.

51:10.200 --> 51:11.720
That's what bad guys do.

51:11.720 --> 51:13.840
Yeah, no, he's, look.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.200
I can't think of anybody.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.920
The word is he's more like Tucker Carlson.

51:16.920 --> 51:20.440
He's just, he won't be on air if he doesn't tell the line.

51:20.440 --> 51:21.920
So he has to make some false statement

51:21.920 --> 51:23.360
and make a true statement.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.360
But I'm rooting for Bill Maher to go all the way.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.960
Thank you so much.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.560
I have bad news for that caller, and that

51:28.560 --> 51:30.240
is that Bill Maher is self-identified

51:30.240 --> 51:32.640
as a libertarian many times in the past.

51:32.640 --> 51:35.280
His exact political philosophy is kind of tough to nail down,

51:35.280 --> 51:38.280
but libertarianism is one of the titles he's used before.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.720
The only reason anyone would think

51:39.720 --> 51:41.280
that he's some kind of a super liberal

51:41.280 --> 51:43.160
is if they only know about his positions

51:43.160 --> 51:45.600
from listening to Alex yell about him.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.080
Also, Alex can fuck right off with this stuff about Maher

51:48.080 --> 51:49.680
being basically like Tucker Carlson,

51:49.680 --> 51:52.480
but he knows that he needs to say some things to stay on air.

51:52.480 --> 51:55.400
For years, Alex has used things that Maher has said

51:55.400 --> 51:57.760
and pretended they were globalist positions.

51:57.760 --> 51:59.360
The whole thing about how the globalists

51:59.360 --> 52:01.720
wanted to crash the economy to hurt Trump,

52:01.720 --> 52:03.640
that was entirely based on a joke

52:03.640 --> 52:06.120
that Bill Maher said on one of his shows.

52:06.120 --> 52:07.640
Alex has used Bill Maher's comments

52:07.640 --> 52:10.960
to such a prominent extent in his conspiracies

52:10.960 --> 52:13.160
that Alex had to explain Bill Maher's role

52:13.160 --> 52:15.560
in globalist operations like this.

52:15.560 --> 52:17.400
Here he is on the same show, Bill Maher.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.160
When he talks, that's a globalist mouthpiece.

52:19.160 --> 52:22.840
So it's like Satan's puppet, his little, sitting on his lap,

52:22.840 --> 52:26.840
a little, one of those things, ventriloquist dolls.

52:26.840 --> 52:29.080
Yeah, he's basically a globalist ventriloquist doll.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.560
He lays out the program.

52:30.560 --> 52:31.400
I was just gonna say,

52:31.400 --> 52:33.680
whenever he said some people have been,

52:33.680 --> 52:37.800
I'm like, that has been your job for five years.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.720
Jesus.

52:38.720 --> 52:41.400
This is a stunning reversal for Bill Maher.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.600
If I believed a word that Alex said,

52:43.600 --> 52:45.080
Bill Maher should be super worried

52:45.080 --> 52:46.640
about globalist assassin squads

52:46.640 --> 52:48.440
coming to get him for betraying his contract

52:48.440 --> 52:50.640
as a ventriloquist dummy or some dumb shit.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.200
But all of it's made up, so it doesn't matter.

52:52.200 --> 52:55.440
Isn't that something that he said on his last episode,

52:55.440 --> 52:57.400
is that the higher ranking guys

52:57.400 --> 52:59.680
eventually leave the globalists

52:59.680 --> 53:01.240
with all their money and power,

53:01.240 --> 53:02.440
and then they get killed.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.080
Yeah, Bill Maher is gonna get assassinated soon.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.840
That should be what you're saying.

53:05.840 --> 53:06.680
Yeah.

53:06.680 --> 53:07.520
Yeah.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.360
Anyway, we get a guest at this point,

53:10.360 --> 53:14.520
and it's Norm Standup Comedy Patches.

53:14.520 --> 53:15.960
Does he have a new bit for us?

53:15.960 --> 53:16.800
No, but he has.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.200
If he did Lumerics, if he just out of nowhere

53:19.200 --> 53:22.320
started doing Lumerics, that's a full circle for us.

53:22.320 --> 53:25.000
Isn't Schachter's name Norm too?

53:25.000 --> 53:25.840
No, Marty Schachter.

53:25.840 --> 53:27.840
No, it's Marty, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.920
I will say that Norm doesn't have a new bit,

53:29.920 --> 53:31.120
but he does have an old one.

53:31.120 --> 53:31.960
Okay.

53:31.960 --> 53:34.680
I mean, I'm sure not gonna call Black Lives Matter

53:34.680 --> 53:36.400
if somebody's breaking my door down tonight.

53:36.400 --> 53:39.800
I'm dialing 911 and hoping somebody like Derek Chauvin

53:39.800 --> 53:41.160
responds to the call.

53:41.160 --> 53:42.920
Again, great bit.

53:42.920 --> 53:45.080
I mean, you would if you were white.

53:45.080 --> 53:47.560
And I do love the idea that he's insistent

53:47.560 --> 53:50.840
on making sure people know that Black Lives Matter

53:50.840 --> 53:52.600
does not address burglaries.

53:52.600 --> 53:53.840
Yes, yes.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.840
Just to make sure everyone knows.

53:55.840 --> 53:56.680
Thank you, Norm.

53:56.680 --> 53:59.080
One, the number for Black Lives Matter,

53:59.080 --> 54:01.560
significantly longer than 911.

54:01.560 --> 54:04.280
I also wouldn't call the police to deal

54:04.280 --> 54:06.400
with like racial injustice issues.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.240
Nope, nope.

54:07.240 --> 54:11.320
So I wouldn't call them to deal with like advocacy

54:11.320 --> 54:12.160
for causes.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.000
Uh, yeah.

54:13.000 --> 54:13.840
Woo.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.360
We've made an amazing point.

54:15.360 --> 54:16.200
I think it's good.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.320
It's so good that Norm had to do it again.

54:18.320 --> 54:19.160
Yeah.

54:19.160 --> 54:22.520
The same fucking point on my back to back episodes.

54:22.520 --> 54:23.880
Mic down for this.

54:23.880 --> 54:27.720
Cause Norm's gonna lie a little bit about the idea

54:27.720 --> 54:30.160
of reassignment surgery for minors.

54:30.160 --> 54:31.000
Oh no.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.560
But that's less important than the exchange

54:33.560 --> 54:34.760
that happens at the end of this clip.

54:34.760 --> 54:35.600
Okay, okay.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.920
Cause it is so heartbreaking.

54:37.920 --> 54:38.760
Okay.

54:38.760 --> 54:39.600
It is so sad.

54:39.600 --> 54:42.040
We cherish difference for the sake of difference.

54:42.040 --> 54:44.480
We're in a situation where parents could be accused

54:44.480 --> 54:46.360
of risk of injury to a minor by not heeding

54:46.360 --> 54:49.640
their minor children's desire for sex change operations.

54:49.640 --> 54:51.880
I mean, it's just absolutely insane.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.360
And I don't really know who benefits from this.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.160
It's hard to imagine that anyone does.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.000
Satan.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.320
Well, yeah, you know, that would be one candidate.

55:01.320 --> 55:02.160
Oh my God.

55:02.160 --> 55:03.080
You're a fucking lawyer.

55:03.080 --> 55:07.320
Who benefits from this?

55:07.320 --> 55:08.360
Satan.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.840
Oh boy.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.680
Oh boy.

55:10.680 --> 55:14.800
Your honor, I ask that this case be thrown out.

55:14.800 --> 55:18.600
Seeing as how half of the jury is Satanists.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.760
How embarrassing would it be to be like,

55:20.760 --> 55:24.240
well, maybe we used to be taken seriously.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.880
Now I'm sitting here with this dumb fuck Alex.

55:26.880 --> 55:29.560
He's telling me the answer to Qui Bono is Satan.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.800
And I have to be like, well, that's one option.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.760
That's a possibility.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.640
To take this bullshit seriously.

55:35.640 --> 55:38.000
At no point in time could I consider that perhaps

55:38.000 --> 55:41.160
somebody would benefit from not having their emotional life

55:41.160 --> 55:44.720
destroyed by their real identity being denied them,

55:44.720 --> 55:46.880
but it's gotta be the devil.

55:46.880 --> 55:50.840
So I think that Alex has a disease.

55:50.840 --> 55:55.840
I think he has a compulsion, sickness and addiction.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.360
And that is whenever Norm Pattis is on the show,

56:00.360 --> 56:01.600
he can't help himself,

56:01.600 --> 56:04.800
but make declarations that involve a million dollars.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.120
Probably put her face up.

56:06.120 --> 56:08.240
She's under lights, like 10 lights

56:08.240 --> 56:09.600
that are on her at a press conference.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.160
And she's got almost pure pupils.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.440
Talking about Maxine Waters.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.640
Yeah, I put that together.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.760
From my research, you've got to at least,

56:16.760 --> 56:18.640
we're talking 10 lines of methamphetamine,

56:18.640 --> 56:20.240
cocaine or LSD to do that.

56:20.240 --> 56:23.120
I mean, those eyes are, she is jacked.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.760
What the hell is she on, man?

56:26.200 --> 56:27.840
She's, I mean, she's on self-righteous fumes.

56:27.840 --> 56:28.680
No, seriously.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.440
Look, I'll bet anybody a million dollars.

56:30.440 --> 56:32.920
You can't shine bright lights in somebody's eyeballs

56:32.920 --> 56:34.840
and have them be 95% pupil.

56:34.840 --> 56:37.880
I mean, look at that, God almighty.

56:37.880 --> 56:39.840
I don't understand enough of the physiology

56:39.840 --> 56:40.680
of pupil dilation.

56:40.680 --> 56:41.960
Let me get into this flash.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.720
Any police training, let me tell you.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.760
I, it's remarkable.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.840
I mean, once is a, I mean, it's still not a pattern,

56:49.840 --> 56:53.000
I guess, but Norm has been on for two instances

56:53.000 --> 56:56.320
of Alex offering million dollar bounties on things.

56:57.520 --> 56:59.080
If it were Norm, I'd be like, is it me?

56:59.080 --> 56:59.920
I do appreciate it.

56:59.920 --> 57:00.760
Is it something about me?

57:00.760 --> 57:03.040
Am I so boring that Alex needs to spice this up

57:03.040 --> 57:04.920
with millions of dollars on the line?

57:04.920 --> 57:07.320
I do appreciate that Norm is like,

57:07.320 --> 57:09.360
well, I think she's on self-righteousness

57:09.360 --> 57:13.240
because I am not going to insist that she is on drugs.

57:13.240 --> 57:14.160
That's not what I do.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.760
You already pimped me out into saying

57:15.760 --> 57:16.600
that maybe the devil.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.560
Maybe it was the devil.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.160
You forced me to say that.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.040
Yeah. Yeah.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.640
So, man, interesting.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.760
Norm, not Norm's appearance, very boring.

57:24.760 --> 57:25.600
No, of course.

57:25.600 --> 57:28.480
But what is interesting is that immediately after this,

57:28.480 --> 57:30.600
Alex has Barnes on.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.440
Why?

57:31.440 --> 57:32.280
His other lawyer friend.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.880
You always have the double lawyer attack.

57:33.880 --> 57:36.440
I think it's because it's the law day.

57:36.440 --> 57:37.280
Well, that's right.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.280
Chauvin trials going on.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.120
Chauvin trials, yeah.

57:39.120 --> 57:40.840
You might as well have as many lawyers on as you can

57:40.840 --> 57:42.160
and there are only two who will.

57:42.160 --> 57:45.240
Yeah, but I might have accidentally skipped a minute

57:45.240 --> 57:48.560
or something because Alex was in the middle

57:48.560 --> 57:52.320
of talking to Norm and then he's talking about

57:52.320 --> 57:55.200
how Barnes is the smartest lawyer that he knows.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.040
Oh, boy.

57:56.040 --> 57:58.080
And I'm like, did he just say that but he meant Norm?

57:58.080 --> 57:58.920
I don't know.

57:58.920 --> 58:01.520
I couldn't tell until Barnes started talking to himself

58:01.520 --> 58:03.640
and I'm like, okay, I guess they just had them back to back.

58:03.640 --> 58:05.640
So maybe we just stroked out for a minute there.

58:05.640 --> 58:07.400
Yeah, but as soon as he was on,

58:07.400 --> 58:10.480
I kind of figured out what was going on.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.800
The whole point of a jury trial

58:11.800 --> 58:13.520
is to not have mob justice.

58:13.520 --> 58:15.400
It's the counter to mob justice.

58:15.400 --> 58:18.560
It's the opposite point to mob justice.

58:18.560 --> 58:20.880
It's the remedy to mob justice.

58:20.880 --> 58:24.360
So by trying to create mob justice inside the courtroom

58:24.360 --> 58:27.160
and convert the jury into a mob,

58:27.160 --> 58:29.360
they are completely defeating the entire point

58:29.360 --> 58:32.320
of jury trial justice and maybe their goal,

58:32.320 --> 58:33.880
much like with policing,

58:33.880 --> 58:36.240
will be to ultimately replace juries.

58:36.240 --> 58:37.080
Exactly.

58:37.080 --> 58:38.120
Why the bold assault?

58:38.120 --> 58:39.200
Why are they so arrogant?

58:39.200 --> 58:40.040
How do we counter this?

58:40.040 --> 58:42.360
Because this should really threaten all Americans.

58:42.360 --> 58:46.000
This is just as bad as going after free speech or guns.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.520
But one of the greatest protection

58:48.520 --> 58:52.440
against total control by the state is the jury system

58:52.440 --> 58:55.480
because it's ordinary, everyday people coming together.

58:55.480 --> 58:58.600
It says the power of the judiciary lies with the people.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.720
Absolutely.

58:59.720 --> 59:02.760
The power of the state is in the power of the jury.

59:02.760 --> 59:05.240
And it's a check on politicians.

59:05.240 --> 59:07.080
It's a check on abusive state actors.

59:07.080 --> 59:10.480
And the media wants the power to misquote, misphrase,

59:10.480 --> 59:15.480
misscript, misrepresent, and then the media wants the power.

59:15.520 --> 59:17.480
Like, what we say juries gotta do.

59:17.480 --> 59:19.440
So I found this really interesting.

59:19.440 --> 59:21.440
So what's going on here is that Barnes

59:21.440 --> 59:24.000
is coming on the show here towards the end.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And the game that they were playing,

59:26.000 --> 59:27.880
I thought was really overt.

59:27.880 --> 59:30.880
What's going on here is, so for a lot of the show,

59:30.880 --> 59:32.720
the fear that Alex has been building up to

59:32.720 --> 59:34.960
is one of a hung jury or an acquittal,

59:34.960 --> 59:36.240
which is what the globalists want

59:36.240 --> 59:37.920
because then there's gonna be riots in the streets.

59:37.920 --> 59:38.760
Naturally.

59:38.760 --> 59:40.800
This trial is essentially an elaborate setup

59:40.800 --> 59:42.280
to get people riled up to the point

59:42.280 --> 59:44.040
where there will be riots.

59:44.040 --> 59:46.840
That's what Alex's callers have suspected

59:46.840 --> 59:49.320
and Alex has mirrored this sentiment back to them.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.440
He's even said that he believes

59:50.440 --> 59:52.760
that Maxine Waters' statements were intentionally made

59:52.760 --> 59:55.240
to cause a mistrial so there would be riots.

59:55.240 --> 59:57.560
But what if that doesn't happen?

59:57.560 --> 59:59.880
You don't wanna put all your eggs in that one basket,

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.160
so here comes Robert Barnes

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.120
to provide the alternative narrative.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.640
In case things don't go the way Alex

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.200
has been saying they will this whole episode.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.040
Yeah.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.600
In case Chauvin is found guilty,

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.480
Barnes has the narrative in place here,

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.240
that Maxine Waters' comments were essentially

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.560
the creation of mob rule within the courtrooms

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.080
in order to replace jury trials with mob justice.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.520
Until the verdict is read,

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.080
if you're a listener of Infowars,

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.320
you're being asked to believe

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.760
that Maxine Waters' comments were simultaneously

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.240
an attempt to replace juries with mob justice

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.120
and also a needlessly complicated conspiracy

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.760
meant to cause a mistrial that'll lead to riots.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.720
Infowars needs both of these to be true

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.400
until the verdict comes.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.040
It's a game of Schrodinger's bullshit.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.000
Yeah.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.360
I do appreciate how his audience,

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.760
in fact, maybe how all of conservatives

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.520
view everybody on the left

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.600
insofar as never speaking to them,

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.080
they know exactly what the left is going to do.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.440
It's kind of amazing that if you never learn anything

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.800
about your political enemy, quote unquote,

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.360
you can make them say whatever it is you want them to say.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.280
True, yeah.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.440
So Infowars have these narratives established

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.840
and they're ready to push their worldview

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.000
and pretend that they were right

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.880
regardless of how the jury decides.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.400
The act of the verdict being read

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.560
actually determines which of these ideas

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.680
they have to accept as truth moving forward.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.520
Yeah.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.440
If Chauvin is not guilty,

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.320
Alex will say that Waters caused that to start the riots,

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.440
but if he is guilty, that angle will be quickly forgotten.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.560
The reverse is true of the mob rule storyline.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.400
Yeah.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.640
This is an important point to recognize,

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.440
that reality doesn't matter to someone like Alex.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.720
Real life events are just things

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.160
that he incorporates like props

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.760
into the story that he decided to tell long ago.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.600
Yeah.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.600
And the story with the Chauvin trial

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.400
is that there's no outcome that's actually good.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.360
They're all just useful.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.200
Yep.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.040
To Alex.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.160
Yep.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.240
It is, yeah, it's very annoying.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.120
It's very annoying that they can just fucking,

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.760
it's like they're pre-writing a choose your own

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.280
adventure book based on the story, you know?

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.880
Like they've already got where they're going to wind up,

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.360
just they just have to give you

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.080
the different like pathways to go down.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.880
And if they choose page 19,

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.360
then you have to start over at page two

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.560
and be like, okay, well now they're gonna start

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.640
a race war next time.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.280
But this time it was a Maxine Waters mob rule.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.440
Well, it's basically like, you know,

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.720
insistently saying both A and B,

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.200
which are contradictory things.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.040
Yeah.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040
And then B happens.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.880
Yeah.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.640
And then someone criticizes you for talking

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.840
so much about A and be like, no, I said B.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.520
You said both.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.180
Dick.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.480
Well, A squared plus B squared equals

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.480
either A or B squared, I believe is how the, yeah.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.380
So Barnes, he has some comments that he wants to make

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.240
about how society got to the point that it is now,

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.920
where you have such a nanny state.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.600
Does he say that it's his fault?

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.000
No, although Alex should probably be mad at him.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.400
What did we do to let these lunatics get to this point?

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.300
And how do we counter people like this?

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.360
Well, it sort of starts with the culture itself.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.240
The politics is downstream from culture

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.220
and the sort of the entire safe space movement

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.680
that arose out of sort of the moral panic

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.000
about kindergartens at elementary schools

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.840
and daycare centers in the nineties,

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.800
going to, you know, all of those range of cases

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.440
where a lot of stories were told by the prosecutors

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.640
that ended up being false,

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.240
created sort of a playdate culture

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.640
where we weren't allowed to let our kids go out

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.640
in the street and just play with random strangers.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.000
You're saying the nanny state has created

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.400
a lot of neuroses and now they can leverage that

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.080
at anything they want.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:30.900
Correct.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.920
No, he was saying that's a satanic panic.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.320
So Robert Barnes' main contention

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.360
is that conservative right-wing outrage

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.600
towards an imaginary problem

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.080
led us into a circumstance

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.280
that is almost entirely conservative outrage

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.840
at a made up problem?

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.020
Yeah, more or less.

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.100
That does make sense.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.280
But the reason that Alex should be mad about this

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.120
is that Robert Barnes is saying that like the things

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.440
like the McMartin School trial and stuff,

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.280
there were things that were alleged that weren't true.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.160
Which Alex has often said are 100% true.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.680
He believes that Ted Gunderson

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.200
is the most reliable source ever

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.680
and Barnes is saying literally the opposite.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.240
This is silly.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.600
Both can be true.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.400
Yeah, and I do, I wonder if Barnes was stopping himself

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.200
because you could hear him say mmm

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.400
and he stopped himself from saying McMartin.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.520
Like maybe he just didn't want to be too specific

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.360
or whatever, like at risk of pissing off Alex.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.480
I think there's a rule of like don't tread too closely

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.920
into Alex's zones, you know,

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.560
especially not with specifics.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.560
Yeah, especially when you can't bear the indignity

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.640
of agreeing with Alex's stupid position on it.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.280
Well, it could be the devil this time, Alex.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.240
Norm got trounced.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.240
So look, Robert Barnes, noted gambler on politics.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.360
True.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.800
This guy loves to make a bet.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.000
May make some money, yeah.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.440
So Alex wants to know what.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.860
You know how it's great if your lawyer

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.520
is also gambling on the side?

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.720
You know how what you want from your lawyer

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.920
is also gambling?

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah, so Barnes is the kind of guy

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.840
who's gonna make a definite stake

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.320
in terms of like what's gonna happen with this verdict.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.920
Is he gonna put a million dollars down?

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.760
No, he's not, Alex.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.640
Oh, damn.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.800
And I think that there's a decent chance

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.920
that we get an acquittal.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.280
My view is there's about a 50% chance

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.760
of an acquittal in this case,

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.120
and that's gonna shock the media,

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.440
that's gonna shock a lot of people

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.860
who didn't watch the trial,

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.740
but it would affirm the confidence that people rightly have

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.580
in the authority of the court.

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:40.800
And I agree, because I think the last straw

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.060
is threatening the jury.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.420
People go, wait, we're the bad guys?

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.480
We're being honest here, I'm a good person.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.320
I wanna do justice.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320
You're saying I'm bad, I better do what you want?

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.840
That would make me, you know,

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.980
if I was on the knife's edge of which way to go,

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.320
that would make me acquit.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.880
So Alex is talking about thinking

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.600
that Maxine Waters has threatened the jury.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.120
So if I understand Alex correctly,

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.880
were he on a jury, the main thing

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.760
that protects us from a mob rule system,

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.360
were he considering the actual justice,

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:14.160
he would take somebody, anybody's comment in the media,

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.680
and use it as justification for his spiteful decision

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.200
to exist entirely within oppositional defiance.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.800
Oppositional defiance would rule his decision-making,

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.200
not the facts of the case.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.440
The only thing protecting us from mob rule.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.120
Look, I'm pretty sure this fucking person's innocent, but.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.480
Maxine Waters said some shit.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.320
Bill Maher said.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.160
He was talking shit.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.640
Wait, Bill Maher's cool now.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.440
Oh shit, who am I mad at?

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.280
Who do we choose?

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.100
Jimmy Kimmel?

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.940
Oh my god.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.920
Yeah, also, congratulations Barnes

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.240
on your 50-50 bullshit.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.480
Yeah, yeah, well, it could go one way

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.400
or it could go the other, or there's a third possibility.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.720
Wishy-washy nonsense.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.840
So I found this very bizarre,

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.380
but not really all that bizarre.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.080
There was this phenomenon going on

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.740
where you had these two possibilities

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.440
and these two narratives that were built up,

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.600
one at the beginning of the show

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.280
and one towards the end of the show,

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.280
where you have Maxine Waters is trying to cause a mistrial

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.800
in order to get rights in the streets.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.280
And then Barnes, she's doing this to create mob rule

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.280
in order for the jury to be cowed into voting guilty.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.840
And I was like, both of these things are kind of,

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.540
it's tough, you have two disconnected threads.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.000
And then what I thought was really interesting

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.320
is in this next clip,

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.840
you can kind of see Alex tie them together.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.660
Really?

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.500
Yeah.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.520
All right, I'm listening.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.360
Believe it.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.360
So bottom line, do you think threats to the jury backfire

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.060
and they acquit or do they bow down?

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.800
I think that's an open question.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.560
I think it worked with some jurors,

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.740
didn't work and backfired with other jurors.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.720
And the question is who wins out in the end?

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.320
So now what Alex has done is he's taken these two things,

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.240
he's woven them together under a similar umbrella

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.120
and he's made it feel like they're connected.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.800
Alex has decided that the deciding factor in this case

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.600
is whether or not these threats to the jury

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.640
have been successful,

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.680
which is already an outrageous assumption for him to make.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.080
What this does is remove any reality

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.020
of the facts of the case,

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.840
or even the possibility that any of the jurors

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.160
could find Chauvin guilty unless they were doing so

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.600
as the result of bowing down to threats.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.060
There's no such thing as the merits of the case.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:20.900
None.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.340
By framing the conversation this way,

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.680
the conclusion is that the right verdict is acquittal,

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.920
that's just assumed.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.640
And the explanation for a guilty verdict

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.360
is that the jury was afraid of the threats,

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.740
which is nonsense.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.320
I said this makes Alex's narratives

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.020
feel like they're connected,

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:37.260
but they're actually not if you take a closer look.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.040
This new, cleaner framing leaves out the entire thing

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.920
about Maxine Waters specifically making the comments she did

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.860
in order to cause a mistrial so there would be riots.

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:46.700
Right.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.560
This is not the same thing as threats backfiring

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.920
and leading to a...

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:50.760
An acquittal.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.600
Yeah.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:56.000
One of the differences between them is really major, too.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.920
You would think,

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.920
because it's part of the globalist overarching plan,

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.560
that's the problem here.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.840
Why are we adding this element that destroys the plan

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.520
that was already working?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.360
Yeah, I guess.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.180
Yeah.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.720
So in the conception of how Alex was talking

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.420
about the verdict earlier in the episode,

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.480
it was pretty clear that the globalists wanted an acquittal

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.760
because their goal was to incite street riots

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:20.600
and burning the cities.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.440
Right, which you're not gonna get with a guilty verdict.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.880
If that is the case,

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.460
then these alleged threats to the jury

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.520
have to have been meant to be so over the top

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.140
that a mistrial is guaranteed and the riots happen.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.660
However, in the new framing,

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.840
it appears that the globalists actually want Chauvin

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.360
to be found guilty.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.600
It's the mob rule.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.320
These threats are either successful,

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.320
in which case the verdict is guilty,

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.700
or they backfire and the verdict is not guilty.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.520
But the reason that the threats are made

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.940
are in service of achieving a guilty verdict.

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.060
Right, if you pay close attention,

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.420
over the course of one show,

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.260
Alex has completely changed the primary motivation

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.920
of his imaginary villains

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.560
because he's just making this up as he goes along.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.080
None of this means anything.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.020
This whole thing is basically just a lazy idiot

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.120
engaging in an act of really long,

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.520
really bigoted improvisational storytelling.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, basically.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.760
And having weirdos like Robert Barnes

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.840
help him out along the way.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.860
Oh boy.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:19.080
So that was the tale, I think, of the 20th.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.840
And then in the evening of the 20th afternoon,

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.840
depending on time zone.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.660
Sure, sure.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.080
Maybe morning, who knows, maybe you're overseas.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.680
What you gonna do?

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.640
Chauvin guilty.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.520
Yes.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.840
Also Ted Nugent got COVID.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.040
Yes.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.880
Other news.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.360
Is he on the 21st?

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.800
No, he doesn't.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.880
He should go on.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.720
He doesn't come up.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.940
He's gotta go on.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.200
He's gotta go on with COVID, that's gotta happen.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.680
Sure, yeah, and lick Alex.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.480
And absolutely find a way to be like, this isn't real.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.560
So we come in on the 21st now

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.880
after the verdict has happened.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.720
Yeah.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.680
And you can tell a little bit of a different tone.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.520
Oh, you think?

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.160
A different vibe is happening in Info Wars Studio.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.360
We have to reach out to God to open our hearts

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.200
and our spirits and transcend all the evil.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.920
What is wrong with you people?

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.920
All the evil, poison we exhumed out by Satan's slaves.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.800
Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday,

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.880
April 21st, global transmission.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.600
It's a Lana Del Rey kind of day.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.680
It is, I just, it's Europe.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.040
Ah, we watched him murder somebody.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.140
It's not an attack on whiteness.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.400
It's not even, it's not an attack on whiteness.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.200
Why do they all have to make it an attack on whiteness?

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.520
There are so many reasons to attack whiteness.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.520
We didn't need this one.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.500
You know how you were saying

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.680
that you enjoyed that nice bath?

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.920
I did, loved it.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.560
I think that Alex was in a similar place

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.960
that you were before the bath

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.960
because of this quote unquote attack on whiteness.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.800
Yes, yeah, yeah, sure.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.000
And the only thing that he could have,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.880
he couldn't have a bath,

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.360
so he had to listen to Lana Del Rey.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.580
He loves this album, man.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.880
I'll tell you what.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.480
Well, her new album's even better than last.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.760
Amazing.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.760
Cool album.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760
Great Christian album, but you know,

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.600
I'm sure it's not one of the things you'd ever see.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.740
It's a real Christian, not a fake one.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.660
Sure, sure.

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:20.480
Avant-garde, the cutting edge, the future.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.920
Get behind me, Satan.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.240
I'm guessing that Alex just saw

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.580
that one of the titles of the songs on Lana's new album

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.960
is Tulsa Jesus Freak.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.680
Yeah, I was gonna say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.520
He just decided this is a Christian album now.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.680
Absolutely, yep, yep, all he needed to see.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.780
Has Alex forgotten that just three years ago

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.660
he was spending quite a bit of time on his show

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.560
yelling about how Lana Del Rey was a witch

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.280
who'd used evil spells against Donald Trump

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.500
because she'd said in an interview

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.120
that she used witchcraft against Trump?

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.280
Yep, that does sound right.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.280
Does he now remember how the entire right wing

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.860
was up in arms about her breakthrough album

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.760
being called Born to Die?

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.820
That was the other outrage machine time.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.800
That was back then when the outrage machine

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.280
was cranking out that bullshit.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.960
It's just, it's so interesting.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.320
I feel worried for him when he's playing

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.480
a bunch of Lana Del Rey.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.840
Yeah, I don't appreciate that it's okay

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.200
for him to love Lana Del Rey publicly,

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.040
but he can't admit that he fucking loves Star Wars.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.800
Yeah, he still feels the need to be like,

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.960
I don't even like those dumb movies.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.240
It's so infuriating.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.600
Now let me reference an obscure character.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.160
Yeah, exactly, someone you would only know.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.960
Someone who only exists in the books.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.480
An immediate pull from something

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.200
it would be impossible to immediately pull from.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.760
Yeah, can't do it because Star Wars is not Christian

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.120
like Lana Del Rey's new album.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.320
Oh boy.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.760
So in Christianity.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.300
How's Christianity doing, still kicking it?

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.040
Well, God's real, Satan's real.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.200
Yeah.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.640
Well, I guess that means Christianity

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.600
is having a great time, there's right.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.480
Satan is real and God is real and you are real.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.000
And this is not a simulation.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.680
That sounds like something a simulation would say.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.600
This is the great test of consciousness.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.200
That's exactly like what somebody

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.040
in a simulation would say. Consciousness

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.880
or the seed of the universe,

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:18.760
the seed of infinity is not just given away freely.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.680
You must be tested.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.960
I must be tested.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.880
And so when you see the Nancy Pelosi's

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.960
and the Maxine Waters and the Prince Phillips.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.000
What?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.520
And the David Rockefeller's

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.520
and the Bill Gates's of the world.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:42.440
These are people that failed the test.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:47.200
These are people held in mindless clown-like bondage.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.440
Did I mostly keep that clip in for the turn

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.040
of phrase clown-like bondage?

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:51.880
Ah, it's a good one.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.720
Possibly.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.560
It is a good one.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.040
Clown-like bondage is not bad.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.120
That's very evocative.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.120
Yeah. Also, I mean, it's just indicative

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.840
of like kind of this mood that Alex is in

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.960
at the beginning of the show, like over Lana Del Rey

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.480
he's talking about Satan and like God

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.120
and he's in a very, very deeply spiritual.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.840
Yeah, it does seem like we're going to get

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.320
into more esoteric Christianity for a little bit.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.880
Yeah, lest we deal with the covering the verdict.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.160
No, we don't want to do that.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.440
No, there's a lot of racist things that you would say

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.400
if you were to cover that verdict and you were out.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.120
You should probably just talk about Satan.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.600
Satan's a real good guy.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.520
We are in the process of not humans' extermination

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:37.520
but the slow destruction of all carbon-based life forms

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.720
on this planet is the goal of Satan.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.760
Does that matter?

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.680
Because God created this carbon-based system.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.640
We are made in the image of God

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.440
and Satan hates our supremacy.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.280
Why?

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.840
Humans are incredible when we're unchained.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.000
We are beautiful.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.280
We can experience the universe

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.840
and communion with the creator.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.160
We're like rods and cones in the eye of God.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.640
We are God's vessels, God's tentacles, God's probes

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.200
God's system experiencing consciousness.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.480
I don't want to be any of that.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.480
And nothing Satan can do will ever change that.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.320
What?

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.160
I don't know.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.240
I feel like maybe he should have gone to college

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.080
and got high.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.240
Maybe you would have worked some of this out of his system.

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.040
Like having like really annoying conversations with people.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:41.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.720
Cause that's very simple.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.120
Okay, so you're telling me that one, this life.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.600
Hit it again.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.920
Hit it again.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.120
One, one.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.160
I got to break out the ball.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.480
Yeah, you're going to need it.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.120
This life is a test, right?

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.160
Consciousness is a test.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.880
And that's all it is

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.360
because God is testing you to see if you can come

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.320
and hang out with him.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.160
I guess.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.000
Right.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.360
But Satan is the person or entity doing the testing.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.200
Sure.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.760
Thus he is part of God's plan.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.600
Right.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.800
And if you're like Pelosi or Prince Phillip,

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.160
you have failed the test and you're in clown-like bondage.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.120
You're in clown-like bondage, naturally.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.720
But I mean, it's like, he's been doing this for,

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.160
you know, thousands of years.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.480
Why is he still taking it so personally?

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.160
You know, the devil is like, I'm already part of the plan.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.280
And God's like, he's not going to succeed

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.880
at destroying all of the people.

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.440
We've got Alex fighting him.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:39.080
It's because the last 999 years of this thousand year plan

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.920
has been all leading up to this.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.280
Well, that's why God gave us Alex.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.600
There's this sort of bias that people have

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.320
about like immediacy or currency.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.360
Like the time right now is the most important time ever.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.680
And every generation thinks they're the last generation.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.640
Exactly.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.000
And obviously there's reasons to feel that way sometimes,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.160
but Alex suffers from that in a way that intersects deeply

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.040
with narcissism and kind of scary.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.440
Yeah, it's not good.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.480
So yeah, I just, I remember,

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.520
I had a lot of conversations like that.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:17.600
Like maybe when I started to like, I don't know,

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.600
explore some of the elementary ideas about

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.960
Gnosticism or something.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.200
You know, like, oh, blowing minds.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.120
Yeah, that's when you should have that,

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.080
your head is empty, you're a big dumb dumb.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.840
You should be smoking weed and having dumb conversations.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.120
But at the same time, when you're not smoking weed,

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.320
you should be reading books

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.360
and struggling with reading comprehension.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.280
And then you won't have to have

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.800
those conversations ever again.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.600
I love of never having those conversations, Dan.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.280
So one thing that I thought was really bizarre

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.440
and maybe off-putting was where he goes immediately

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.960
after this conversation about how we're elements

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.600
of God's eye experiencing things for God.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.440
Also tentacles.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.320
Mic down for this, because this,

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.560
I want to see if this hits your ear

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.400
the same way it hit mine.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.400
We're like rods and cones in the eye of God.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.840
We are God's vessels, God's tentacles,

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.560
God's probes, God's system experiencing consciousness

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.480
and nothing Satan can do will ever change that.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.920
So don't let the enemy get you down.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.920
I know it gets me down, it's sad.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.400
And don't let their religion of race war

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.520
and their religion of worshiping black people

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.760
on the surface when they're doing the opposite

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.800
or killing them ever get you down.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.920
Ever get you down.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.520
That really felt weird.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.600
Do you, do you, do you?

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.360
I don't feel comfortable.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.200
No.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.600
No, that makes me feel very uncomfortable.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.440
That's really weird.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.040
That's really gross because now you're transforming

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.040
the fight for even the slightest modicum

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:11.400
of racial justice into a holy war against anyone

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.240
who would try and get a modicum of racial justice.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.080
Try and get a modicum of racial justice.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.840
Yeah, there's some of that.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.960
And also the pronouns that are used

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.040
are a little bit strange.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.120
He's using we a lot when he's talking about

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.120
the eyes of God and what have you.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.160
And then them when he's talking about black people.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.000
It does seem like what he was doing.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.720
It does seem to be a little bit of a disconnect.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.680
I think he has a very different view of people

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.640
based upon their skin and appearance.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.040
And that's just me, that's just me, I could be wrong.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.600
I'll tell you what, that seemed very strange.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.160
That hits my ear very weird except

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.840
there's a very easy explanation

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.880
that would not make it hit my ear very weird.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.520
And that is if Alex knows that he's just talking

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.360
to white people.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.840
Yes, yes, then what he said makes total sense.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:03.120
Makes perfect sense, yep, yep.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.320
But if he thinks that he's talking to a diverse audience,

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.880
that's weird, that doesn't make sense.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.720
That's not cool.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.040
The structure of that sentence is bizarre.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.360
I would be more careful if I were him.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.200
Anyway.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.000
What I'm saying is that we denizens of the great Rhodesia

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and, wait, wait, I shouldn't have said that.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.960
Well, I mean, we Christians.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.200
Alex's buddy Gary Allen loved Rhodesia.

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:26.640
It was surprising.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.040
So, you know, I always like to find these kinds of moments

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.400
where there's olive branches, where there's a possibility

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.920
for Alex and I to agree on something.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.880
Sure, we want reconciliation as always.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.880
I mean, even if it's superficial, I'll take it.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.700
Sure.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.740
I kind of thought that maybe Nancy Pelosi's

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:47.340
very unfortunate and poorly constructed comments.

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:50.020
Oh boy, boy, boy, boy, Nancy,

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.500
you're really putting your name at the top of the list

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.300
to go fuck yourselves.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.640
Nancy Pelosi came out and referred to George Floyd's murder

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.420
as a sacrifice for justice, which was real shit.

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:03.260
Woof.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.620
I thought that maybe there would be an opportunity

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.180
for Alex and I to come to some sort of an agreement

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.420
that, hey, that was not good.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.740
Yeah, it seems like it wouldn't be hard.

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:16.780
That's the level of shit that if I was Nancy Pelosi's aide,

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.860
I would immediately tackle her off the stage.

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:21.980
I would be like, everybody will like you more

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.380
if you get hurt for this.

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.020
And then come up with an excuse of, like,

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:27.420
I saw someone, a threat.

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.540
I ate chili, just anything.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.500
Unfortunately, this would have been a layup for Alex

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.100
to get me to agree with him,

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:39.860
but somehow he manages to not only miss the shot,

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.060
he broke his ankle midair.

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:42.900
Critical failure.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.740
Let me see Nancy Pelosi say we'll play it in a moment.

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:48.860
She said yesterday, breathing through her face diaper,

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:51.200
huffing and puffing at 82 years old,

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:56.200
with her tenuous grasp to life,

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:03.080
as her spirit begins its descent to her master,

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.080
and she thanked George Floyd for his sacrifice,

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.160
like he was a veteran, like he was Jesus on the cross,

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.880
like he was a Messiah.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:16.680
Oh boy.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.760
A drugged out,

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.340
male prostitute,

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.900
devastatedly unhappy,

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:29.320
possessed by the spirit of the world

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.800
until the moment he died.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.240
Just missed it.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.200
Just missed the mark.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.200
Just incredible.

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.280
Just incredible.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.480
Something so...

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.320
So easy.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.840
He's too racist to even criticize Nancy Pelosi

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.120
when she's being racist.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:44.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.800
Wow.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.640
Remarkable.

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:50.760
That is a level I just didn't expect.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:52.720
I just didn't expect it.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.560
Yep.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.640
I mean, there's disappointment,

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.480
and then there's disappointment.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.680
And then there's that.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.080
Yeah.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.280
Not you, like, Alex,

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.800
you can't even clear that incredibly low hurdle

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.640
of critiquing Nancy Pelosi for that kind of a bungle.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.720
How dare she not be racist enough for me?

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:10.560
Yeah.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.920
That's not good.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.760
No.

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.580
That's not good.

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.420
Nope.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.320
So the feds, they're taking over policing,

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.400
which means actually the UN is in charge,

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.200
and uh-oh, we have no government.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.040
Okay.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.040
And there is

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:27.520
Pelosi announcing the globalist,

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.440
UN-controlled federal,

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.120
and the feds are run by the UN now,

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.480
meaning UN takeover of our police,

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:37.540
just like they control our medicine and our speech

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.300
and policies of our military.

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.820
We are now a conquered nation.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.880
And until we realize we're a conquered nation,

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880
we have no hope.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.320
But if we unified against their evil,

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.520
we could easily take back our government.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.160
This is just about the Department of Justice

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.200
opening an inquiry into the Minneapolis Police Department.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.120
Alex is such a dramatic little baby

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.360
that he's turned that into the UN running the country,

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.680
and the only people who can stop them

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.720
and take the country back are him and his buddies.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:03.560
Yeah.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.520
It's ridiculous.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.120
You gotta escalate things a lot quicker

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.900
whenever your big bad is the devil.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.320
You know, you can't be like, this is just going to,

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.760
he couldn't even possibly be like,

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.900
they're just going to root out the patriots

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:18.280
in the police state, and that's why it's bad.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.800
It has to be a complete overthrow

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.480
of the United States government.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.320
Sure.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.080
Yeah, yeah, gotcha.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.960
So, I don't know if you're aware of this,

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.840
but we live in a multiverse.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:30.800
I am aware of that.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.520
Do you know that we live in those universes simultaneously?

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.840
It has to be true.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.920
It's real heady stuff.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.760
Yeah.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.320
We do not just live in one dimension.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.320
We live throughout the multiverse.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.280
I want to open the phones up

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280
until the bottom of the next hour

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.160
and the constitutional lawyer joins us, Norm Pattis.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.480
I'd like to shift to dimensions.

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.760
Yeah, I would very much like to not do that.

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.360
Yeah, how do I live in the dimension

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.320
where Norm Pattis isn't coming back on the show?

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.040
How about that, you dick?

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.960
Yeah, what's the quantum suicide thing?

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.600
Can you just quantum suicide

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.280
until you get into a good universe?

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.400
How do I get to the universe

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.320
where you have a better fucking booking agent?

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.360
Yeah, no kidding.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.320
It's ridiculous.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.680
Too much, Norm.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.580
Nope, can't do it.

01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:15.440
So, I want to tell you in advance here,

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:18.800
this is not a good clip.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.120
This is a bit racist.

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.080
Oh, well, if you're saying that now after where we've come.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.840
Well, this has to do with a lead-in to conversation.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.640
He doesn't actually have much of a conversation

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.840
about the Bryant shooting in Columbus.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:34.680
Sure, sure.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:40.040
But the way he does get into it is not good.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.520
It's already been at historic highs, black on white crime,

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.880
because a lot of black young people

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.320
are buying into the lie and doing it, and it's terrible.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.640
But they're highly impressionable,

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.640
and they're being told that this is what you should do.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.760
And I just saw a video of this morning.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.320
It's an article on Infowars.com.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.120
We'll play it next hour while we take your calls.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.360
Columbus, Ohio, a quote,

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.520
little black baby, the media said.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.560
She's a big girl for 15.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.820
Looks like she hasn't missed out on any cheeseburgers.

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:11.960
How fucking dare you?

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.680
She was stabbing a white woman and a black woman

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.040
with a eight-inch knife.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.580
It looks like a short butcher knife.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.720
Black people called the police.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.260
She gets there and she keeps stabbing people.

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:30.820
And so they were stabbed, two people were stabbed.

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.400
And because the white devil shot the black angel,

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.040
Black Lives Matter's protesting and rioting.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.680
There's a lot of details that are yet to be sorted out

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:43.520
about this shooting.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.240
And I don't feel like I have an ability

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.040
to fully assess the situation yet.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.160
I'm gonna leave that to more information to come out,

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.160
time to process and what have you.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.600
I wanted to play this clip, however,

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.200
to demonstrate how open and shut things are for Alex

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.040
and how coverage of this story begins by discussing

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.760
how impressionable black youth are

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:04.520
and how they're being taught to attack white people.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.760
The actual details of this case are secondary

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.760
and not nearly as important as how explicitly racist Alex

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.600
and his show are.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.200
This is outrageous.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.720
That is so fucked up.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.880
I just don't know.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.560
Black youth are very impressionable.

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.560
How can, I don't, I will never understand

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.160
quite how easy it is for white racists to get to like,

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.280
well, if you're 15 and black though, you're big.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.120
Right.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.500
You're bigger than 15 year old white people.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.720
So whatever happens is fine.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.360
I just, how, how do you get there?

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.600
Like, it's just unconscionable.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.440
It just really is.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.120
I don't disagree.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.720
Like for all they're screaming about pedophilia,

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.840
it's fine if teenagers get killed though,

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.960
because they're black and that means they're bigger

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.200
or whatever, fuck off, unreal.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.000
Yeah, it's pretty breathtaking.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.840
And the ability for content that is this racist

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.720
to not be like, it's amazing that it exists.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.120
Yeah, it really is.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.680
It's shocking that it exists and isn't dealt with

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.400
in the proper context.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.040
You know, like it's not related to as like,

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.520
this might as well be a Klan show.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.200
No, it's 100% a Klan show.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.440
Granted, sometimes it's a milder Klan show.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.880
Sometimes they talk about other things.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:26.500
Well, I'm sure the Klan had to talk about like anniversaries

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.560
and oh, like we have a new kid, you know, like that kind of.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.880
Bitcoin comes up from time to time.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.480
Sure, sure.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.740
But man, this is, this is some pretty,

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:36.560
pretty out in the open racist shit.

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.400
That's unreal.

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.240
Yeah.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.060
That's just unreal.

01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.240
But if you were to ask Alex,

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.000
he has a completely different idea.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.120
He thinks his show is like full of sophisticated information.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.360
Really?

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.960
I've always believed in the people.

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:50.800
And that's why I-

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.620
You said you hate them.

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.640
This broadcast is a populist program

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.040
to just put out very sophisticated information,

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.200
but also simple truths at the same time,

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.980
believing that if you up the level of information,

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.800
that ups the level of understanding,

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.800
not dumb the information down

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.720
and dumb down the population of feedback loop.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.560
Wow.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.280
But that said, when I do this governmental briefing style,

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.540
PowerPoints and guests and just go over documents,

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:21.200
that is extremely effective, not just with like General Flynn

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:24.360
but I can tell you prime ministers, world leaders,

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.160
they had CIA boardrooms two weeks ago in our spars,

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:34.160
2025, 2028 report because it was done in a briefing format.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.560
Not a fucking chance.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.260
I feel like this is a simulation

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:39.760
because there's no way a human being

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.720
could possibly be that unself-aware.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.580
Well, I think he is self-aware.

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:44.840
I just think that's the image

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.040
that he wants the audience to have of him.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.720
He can't possibly fucking believe

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.400
that anybody took that shit seriously.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.600
Cannot possibly believe that.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.320
That spars video that he did

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:56.360
was so fucking offensively clunky.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.540
It was so dumb that Mike Guy was a total weirdo.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.280
They were taking lines completely out of context,

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.440
making completely false assertions about the document.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:10.120
Anybody who actually read it without just already

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.480
pre-deciding that Alex was right

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.320
would come away from that like,

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.120
this doesn't say what you say it says.

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:15.960
Yeah, that's true.

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.780
There's a CIA fucking boardroom.

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.640
Oh my God, not a fucking chance.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.120
Here's the thing that I have to say.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:22.960
Sure, sure, sure.

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.080
I do like the idea that Alex thinks

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.420
that he has another speed.

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.260
Right.

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.480
I do like that idea because I think it's funny

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.440
when he does that.

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.280
Yes, it is very funny.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.320
I think it's really funny when he tries.

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.680
He thinks he's ramping it up.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.520
Because it's very bad.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.880
And he just doesn't have it.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.840
He doesn't have that pitch anymore.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:41.840
Maybe never did.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.680
No.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.080
But he was certainly better at looking

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.680
like he did earlier in his career.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.520
Right, right, right, right.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.600
But I like that because I would like for him

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:50.400
to take this way more seriously,

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.860
because I will too, and I do.

01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:57.680
And I don't want to talk about conceptions of the devil.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.520
I don't care.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.340
Right, right, right.

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.180
I don't give a shit.

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.760
You don't even know how fast your fastball goes.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.600
Yeah.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.800
But you've been hanging around 75,

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.840
like sooner or later he's going to get better

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.240
at batting practice and it's just not happening.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.200
It's not happening.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.040
No.

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.040
Nope.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.240
It's just, it's frustrating.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:18.640
And I would like you to do some CIA boardroom shit.

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.480
Yeah, that's kind of interesting though,

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:23.280
because once you find out like the FBI

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:27.680
was listening to Joe Biggs on like Antifa protests,

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.240
you realize like, oh, these people are morons.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.080
You know, like I could buy that the CIA had meetings on it

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.080
because I don't know if I trust any of them

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.220
to do a fundamental Google search at this point.

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.060
Let me actually.

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:38.880
They're all insane.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.720
Let me say this.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.560
Yes.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.480
If I worked in the CIA,

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.440
I might want to have a meeting on it too,

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.800
but just for a day off.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.620
Hey guys.

01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.460
Get some pizza.

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:48.300
Guys, we got a new Alex.

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.240
We got a new Alex, guys.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.160
Get in the boardroom.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.880
We're going to, we'll put it on the big screen.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.880
Ain't no way this is going to turn into any work.

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.720
Yeah.

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:55.560
Yeah.

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.920
Yeah.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:57.760
So anyway.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:58.600
Yes.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.420
It's time for the big enchilada.

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:00.260
Okay.

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:01.400
Let me just give you the big enchilada,

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.040
then I'll go to your phone calls.

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:09.240
The globalists with their money have got the universities,

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.360
the banks, the medical system, the media system,

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.480
the world council of churches.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.980
Almost all the churches are just

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.840
country club feel good groups.

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.400
I don't care if it's Protestant, Catholic.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.320
It doesn't matter.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.920
They've got Hollywood.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.760
They've got the EU.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.880
They've got radical Islam and Orthodox Islam.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:28.960
They've got Israel.

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.720
They've got South Africa.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:31.820
They got everybody.

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:33.760
Wow.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.560
There's one thing they don't have.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.320
You?

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:42.800
And that's the US military.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:43.640
Okay.

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.480
Now the US military has got its own stuff going on.

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:47.520
It's got its own problems.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.360
Believe me.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.180
It's getting a divorce.

01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:52.160
But it's still men and chivalry.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.920
And to operate at that level,

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.960
some form of honor, even though it's predatory.

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.020
And so the globalists want to intimidate it, attack it,

01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:01.280
cause race riots, to selectively demonize

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.640
the military and police with these purges

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.000
to get control of them.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.280
They don't need to.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.660
They have a plan B.

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:09.640
There's a fucking super bio weapon release

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:10.480
that they can do.

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.600
None of this makes sense.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.040
Why would they have?

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.720
They don't need to take over the police.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.780
Also, if Alex's beliefs mean anything,

01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:19.560
they don't have Russia, right?

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.440
Like he, what?

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.000
No, they've got everything.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
They've got everything except the military

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:25.840
and the police.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.680
They've got everything except the United States military

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.760
and the police.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.560
The fact that you're putting those two together

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.120
kind of makes you realize what the police is.

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:32.960
Don't you?

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.880
I mean, like this is so ridiculous.

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.240
I just, I have a hard time like even taking this seriously.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.780
The good news is there's still plenty of white nationalists

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.560
in the US military and the police.

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.040
Still a lot of heavily armed weirdos.

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.880
We got plenty of white nationalists really rooting

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.360
for us to kill people.

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.160
So we got that.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.660
This is just, it feels like it just felt like

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:58.960
that was what was gonna like work for him to say.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:34:59.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.280
And it just doesn't match with any of the stuff he says.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.040
Normally, it doesn't make sense why the globalists

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.320
need the military and the police.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.520
Yeah, you know what I feel like?

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.840
I feel like if you're somebody who identifies

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.240
with the police and the military, you're a fascist.

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.200
That's what I would go with.

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.360
Again, this is just like improvisational storytelling.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.480
And one of the things that keeps people excited

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:27.200
in storytelling is like, you know,

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.920
sometimes the hero is doing well.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.360
Sometimes the hero's doing poorly.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:32.200
Yeah.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.560
And when the hero's down, you gotta cheer

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.400
for him to come back up.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.600
Absolutely.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.520
The hero's journey.

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.160
Come on, it's 12 steps or whatever it is.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.680
I think it was a couple weeks ago

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.660
that Alex was riding pretty high.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:43.720
They were defeating the globalists.

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.080
Sure, killing it.

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.200
Unfortunately, they are now losing.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.040
Ooh, that's trouble.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.440
I wanna give you the honest prognosis.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.600
I'm not like the Q people that tell you everything's fine.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:55.080
We've won the war and just don't, no, no, no.

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:58.960
We're losing and everything's collapsing

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.040
and we have no future unless you get upset

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.320
and speak out and take action.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.320
Now it's because we were winning culturally.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.660
There was a huge awakening, great victory.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.720
But now the globalists have taken their whole plan

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.240
and launched it and accelerated their timetable,

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.520
which is extremely reckless.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.640
They were 10 years behind.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.040
God, you just can't not hear this

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.720
over and over and over again.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:21.560
Wow.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.040
He's gotta get a new bit.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.480
Because this bit is tired, stale.

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:30.480
I just don't feel like I can handle this infinite battle

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.380
between Alex and his evil enemies.

01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:35.600
And everybody is either accelerating

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.480
or decelerating their plans at all times.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.600
Nobody's ever like, let's put our chip,

01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.840
yeah, nobody's putting their chips on the table.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.040
Let's fucking do this.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.040
Well, apparently they have.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.720
So if it doesn't work this time,

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.160
I guess they've been defeated.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:51.140
Well then, what are they gonna do next?

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:51.980
I don't know.

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:52.800
Eh, me neither.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.320
It'll probably be boring and not real.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.280
That's true.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.400
This next clip, I would say

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.240
that this should get Alex institutionalized.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.680
Okay, all right.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.380
There's a lot of things that he says

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.460
that are like, you know, offensive.

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.720
Like really offensive.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.360
Yeah, they should get him shunned,

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.560
but not institutionalized.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.400
Maybe Bood.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.400
Yeah, Bood is a good one, yeah.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.920
This, if he really believes this,

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.600
he should be put in a padded cell.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.680
Okay.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:25.040
But I have decided to be Christ-like,

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.240
and I don't mean that blasting me, I'm serious.

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.640
I have taken on the sins.

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.340
I have taken them on.

01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:33.920
I am in a poison vision of the enemy

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.880
so I can see the enemy's operations.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.520
So Alex has taken on the sins of humanity.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.360
All right.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.500
So he can see the globalist's plan.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.000
Like he's taken on the role of Jesus.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:45.820
Right, right, right.

01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:47.280
He's basically Jesus against the globalist.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.120
I was gonna say.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.240
This is not blasphemy.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:55.080
Alex is very close to declaring himself the new Messiah.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.600
Well, I mean, it's an interesting progression

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.240
because he was like sort of getting more and more

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.800
comfortable with talking about himself as a prophet

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.640
over the last six months or so.

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:05.320
John the Baptist and Trump was the, yeah, yeah, of course.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.760
And now that is not satisfying.

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.720
Nope. At all.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.240
I've gotta take that next step.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.080
Yep.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.880
I must make myself the Christ.

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.760
Look, you can only be a three-star general

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.280
for so long before you want that next star, baby.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.400
Anyway.

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.240
Okay.

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.060
Alex takes some calls.

01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:26.960
I am the new Messiah.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.760
Anyways, let's go to the phones.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.720
Let's go to the calls and let's see if we can talk

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.240
to a fucking dumb racist.

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.720
Mainly, I want to get this out of the point.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:36.320
It's overwhelming to finally talk to you

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.640
because for decades, people have been telling me

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.960
I was too volatile and paranoid

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.060
because I've been telling them about all this stuff

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.840
except the pedophile stuff.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.040
I didn't have your connections, but about the

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.560
we're all slaves and China's evil

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:52.760
and how everything's propaganda against the white man.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.120
And everybody thought I was, I'm talking about all the way

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.680
back to the nineties and everybody was just telling me

01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:58.520
I was crazy.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:01.260
Well, what they do is they brand freedom and guns

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:03.480
and private property as the white man.

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.120
And then communism is the black man.

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.040
And they go, the black man's good.

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.200
The white man's bad.

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.120
When it has nothing to do with white men and black men

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.040
it's all branding.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.040
Does that make sure?

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.400
Does that make sense?

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.240
Yeah.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.880
And it's been, I mean, even in commercials, you know

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.120
the white man's always an idiot or, and then, and

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.600
I was always showing people how, you know

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.280
always shows people like abusing white men

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280
and women hitting them.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.040
And just, it was just always just-

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.600
Sure goes back to married with children.

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.300
Every white man on TV is an idiot.

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.320
And then, and then several years ago

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.000
I heard you for the first time.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.760
And I realized I'm not the only person that sees this.

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:40.680
You know, I thought I was like cursed with this site.

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.000
Oh boy.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.060
So I think the trope of the bumbling husband

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:45.680
probably dates back a little further

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.440
than married with children, but whatever.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.920
I guess it's better than if they were like

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.760
I think we should go back to the honeymooners

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.800
when it was fine to beat your wife.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.800
Also if Alec has a problem with the character trope

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.740
of the dumb husband, he's going to really hate

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.920
when he learns about all the other historical characters

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.240
of people who weren't white.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.480
Oh boy.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.840
In terms of just explaining a little bit of this

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.600
one of the reasons that there's such a large number

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.720
of husbands and fathers who are kind of idiots

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.320
is because it's the easiest way to make

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.760
their character lovable and flexible enough

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:16.040
to fit into the comedic premises that are required

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.540
for a sitcom to work.

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.480
Most of the situations the characters get into

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.920
probably wouldn't happen, or if they did

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:24.720
they would be resolved in way less comical ways

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.800
if one of the characters in charge wasn't a goof.

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.240
You could make every show like Father Knows Best,

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.080
but guess what?

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.500
Father Knows Best sucked.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.900
It's a trash show.

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:36.740
Also, it's just.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.160
You know what, I also hate the depiction

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:43.040
of white people in films being stupid,

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.440
which is why I hate Breakfast at Tiffany's.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.480
Do you know what I hate about Breakfast at Tiffany's?

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.000
The way they treated that poor white man

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.600
who was definitely meant to read as white, 100%.

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.440
Yeah.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.520
This is not an attack on the white man,

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.600
but it does make sense that this guy

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.400
would have these clearly racist feelings towards media

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.320
and everything that he experiences as an attack on whites,

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.880
and then he hears Alex and he's like,

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.240
I've found my people.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.920
Of course, no shit.

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.040
Yep.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.040
I mean, it's like.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.040
It gets a lot worse.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.600
How can you, white people have had it

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.600
so fucking pathetically easy for so goddamn long

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.100
that the idea of one appearance in movies or film

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.400
where the white guy is the bad guy is like,

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.520
how could anybody do this?

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.360
Well, look, you're saying that white people

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.560
have had it so easy for so long.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.000
Alex would beg to differ.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.840
Oh, I'm sure.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.660
Based on his own.

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.800
Millions and millions of dollars.

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.920
Brother, I mean, listen,

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.280
there's not any black people that have been attacked,

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.280
let's not exaggerate, 75 times by white people I have,

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:57.800
but I actually enjoyed it.

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:00.260
I mean, I grew up with black folks trying to kill me

01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:02.280
and I learned how to fight really good.

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.720
I mean, in fact, people ask how Alex Jones did all this.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.520
I owe this to black races beating the living shit out of me.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.360
I mean, I have just,

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.520
and I started hospitalizing a lot of black people

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.360
and they pretty soon started, you know, appreciated me,

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.200
but, and I love those folks.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.840
I love the ones even I put in comas.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:18.680
Yeesh.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.280
I wanna go back to whistling.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:25.440
Do you remember when he whistled, Dan?

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.040
I appreciated the whistling, that was great.

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.280
If, oh, that's what they should do.

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.780
If he gets on too much of a racist rant,

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:35.360
they should just start playing the Andy Griffith theme

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.560
and they'll be like, okay, I'm Andy Blackman.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:42.160
And they should get like one of those

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.880
intermission type images and it's just.

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.800
Let's all go to the lobby.

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:50.640
But no, it's Photoshopped Alex's face onto Andy Griffith,

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.560
holding hands with young Richie Cunningham.

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:55.000
Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:59.800
Little Opie carrying a fish and pole.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.280
What a piece of shit.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.120
Yeah, he's the worst.

01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.240
Absolute piece of shit.

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.080
He is the worst.

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.720
Hey, I'm a huge racist,

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.440
but also I'm gonna brag about how good I am

01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:12.800
and about how I defeated them in fights

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.680
and put them in comas, sure.

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:15.600
It's very strange.

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.720
What a fucked up dude.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.440
But I'm just saying, I wouldn't be who I was

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.760
if I wasn't put in the hospital and broken legs

01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.280
and broken arms and subdermal hematomas

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.360
and stabbed and everything else I did.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.840
I really wanna thank black people

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.640
for what they did to me, I'm serious.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.720
All right, I'm not gonna pretend to not understand

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.960
the point Alex is trying to make here poorly.

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:35.800
Oh boy.

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:38.160
This is the old idea of being like battle hardened

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.360
and Alex is thankful for the struggles that he went through

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.840
that made him who he is today.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.680
Boy named Sue.

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.740
You hear variations of that from all sorts of people

01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.320
and I think generally, you know,

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.920
there's a fine version of it.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.760
Sure.

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:50.480
But what's not fine is the way Alex is ascribing

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.560
the series of beatings that he got when he was younger

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.920
to quote, black people.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.760
Yeah.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:57.640
As opposed to quote, specific people he got in fights with.

01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:58.480
Yeah.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.920
This is generalizing to the larger black population here

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:03.160
in a way that is incredibly fucked up.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.240
From listening to this, I'm not actually even sure

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.320
if Alex realizes he's doing what he's doing,

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.160
but man, it is embarrassing and real racist.

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.800
Yeah, that's, this has been a real fucking highlight reel.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.560
This is, this is a...

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:20.440
It's not been, it's not been really good.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.180
No, no.

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:25.320
I would say that you might as well just come out

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.960
and be like, yeah, I guess I'm a racist.

01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.320
I feel like I can't be too far off now.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.440
Yeah, it's gotta happen.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:33.380
It's like, and he can try and justify his racism,

01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.780
but you can't pretend that you're not.

01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:37.600
It's too late for that now.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.440
Yeah.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:39.280
Yeah.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:41.840
We have one last clip here and it's to get a little bit

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.640
of a, you know, a little bit of parsley perhaps.

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.760
Sure, sure.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.760
But Alex has this caller who's calling in from Brooklyn.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.600
Right?

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.880
One of the last holdouts in Brooklyn.

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:51.720
Okay.

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.560
A stronghold.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.380
Yeah.

01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:54.220
Read that how you will.

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:55.040
Okay.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:55.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:57.720
I live in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:01.760
It's an Irish, Norwegian, Italian, German area.

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.320
It's like the last Republican stronghold in Brooklyn.

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.080
So what they're doing is they're sending people

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.320
from Park Slope, other places in Brooklyn,

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.800
to come in and try and take Bay Ridge over

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.700
and make it a liberal town.

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:19.600
Also, what they're doing is they're shutting down restaurants.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.120
They're shutting down all the restaurants

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.960
and they're letting illegal immigrants sell products

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.960
in the street, which is crazy to me.

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:30.440
Elaborate on that.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.280
Yeah.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.520
Ha, ha, ha.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.360
There it is.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.600
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.440
Been a little while since we've heard Alex eating lunch.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.840
That's a good one, that's a good one.

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.960
So that was enjoyable.

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.560
Yeah, that was nice.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:44.960
Yeah, I mean, look, I don't think that there was anything

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:47.120
else you could really expect from this period

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.920
other than like some pretty-

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.760
Brutal racism.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.600
Some pounding racism.

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.000
But I think it was interesting the way it manifested,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.240
you know, like I don't think it made sense

01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.920
based on real life conditions.

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:00.920
No, no.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.920
And yeah, it sucks.

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.880
I'm going to not listen, or I'm gonna listen eventually.

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:07.720
Sure, sure, sure.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:10.120
For our next episode, I am gonna go back to 2003,

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:12.560
because that way, over my birthday weekend,

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:15.080
I can spend my time in the past as opposed to

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.520
focusing too much on the present.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.080
That is my gift to you, dear.

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.280
And that's my compromise.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:21.760
But yeah, this sucked.

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:26.760
Yeah, that's, man, it's like that violent candle, you know?

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:32.360
Like it's got, in order to move forward,

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.960
we have to get rid of this bullshit.

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.400
We gotta not do this anymore.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:41.120
But while we're fighting it, they're fighting so much,

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.560
so fucking hard, it's insane.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:44.440
It's insane.

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.160
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.880
Fuck racists.

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:52.360
So, we'll be back, but Jordan, until then,

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:53.720
we have a website and all that stuff.

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.560
Indeed.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.800
But more importantly, let's go out on a positive note.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.640
Ooh, we gotta hear it.

01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:01.760
And this is another track from DJ Danarki.

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:02.600
DJ Danarki, hell yeah.

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.440
Thank you so much for creating this.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.480
We'll catch you next time.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.560
Daryl Rundis, blah, blah, blah.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:27.760
Thanks.

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:52.560
