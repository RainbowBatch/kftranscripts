N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Knowledgefight.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
I need, I need money.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,360
Stop it.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
It's time to pray.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Andy and Candace, you're on the air.

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
Thanks for holding.

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller.

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
I'm a huge fan.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
I love your work.

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
Knowledgefight.com.

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:59,600
I love you.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm Dan.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
I'm Jordan.

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
We're a couple dudes.

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,280
I like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Jordan.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Dan.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's up?

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have a quick question for you.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, what's up?

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's happening?

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
My question for you today is, stayin' humble.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hashtag stayin' humble.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh boy.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh boy.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Look, I don't know a whole lot about classic rock.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sure.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And apparently I really stepped in it, I thought, I said that, so I'm playing with fire by the

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
doors.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, many people have pointed that out.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, boy.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,840
I'll tell you what, a lot of backlash whenever you misstate something about music, and hey,

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
you know what?

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
That's on me.

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
I don't know a whole lot.

48
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,520
My parents were pretty restrictive with music growing up.

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
That's true.

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,080
As I've brought up in the past, my first album that I ever bought was Alanis Morissette's

51
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
Shagged Little Pill.

52
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
True, delicious.

53
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,840
And my mom made me return it, because it was a bad influence, and I think probably everything

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,240
by the Rolling Stones was a mysterious thing to me.

55
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,040
I discovered some Beatles songs from Beatles Rock Band.

57
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
I was gonna say.

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,220
That's the kind of level of naivete I have about that stuff.

59
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,240
If Alanis Morissette is a step too far, then I would imagine that the Rolling Stones' earlier

60
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,000
work is off limits.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,960
My dad might be fucking around with Pete Seeger or something, you know?

62
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
That's where we're at.

63
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,600
You know, I've always put your dad in the secret prog rock genre of just like somebody

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,400
who when no one's around is like, time to listen to Yes, I'm gonna get in my favorite

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
chair.

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I think he might like Steely Dan.

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
We'll have to talk about that.

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Sure, sure.

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,040
As you can recall, his first concert was Blood, Sweat, and Tears.

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
He did like Chicago and some of that horn rock.

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
There was a time.

72
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,800
But I think it was because he, I don't know, was he in the marching band?

73
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
I can't remember.

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,720
Anyway, my point is I'm sorry to everybody who I disappointed by my non-knowledge of

75
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
songs.

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,460
It's okay, it's okay.

77
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,680
I will stand by my position that I don't like The Doors.

78
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,440
You know, I actually went back and listened, and at no point did you claim the song was

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,560
The Doors.

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,240
It could very easily have been a completely disconnected thought.

81
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,480
I was thinking about trying to play that game, but in the sake of sincerity and being above

82
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,400
board, I have to admit that I did fuck that up.

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,880
Anyway, Jordan, hashtag staying humble.

84
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,160
I have a simultaneous bright spot in Darkstone.

85
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,440
Dan, we had a lovely time.

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,280
We got together and watched Mortal Kombat.

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,080
Sponsored content.

88
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Fantastic time.

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,680
And I have decided that it is the worst movie ever made.

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,120
I don't think it's the worst movie ever made, but I was disappointed as hell.

91
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Yeah.

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
No, not because of the movie itself.

93
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Oh.

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
But, and this is how I'm thinking of it, all right?

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Godzilla versus Kong.

96
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,160
Do you know what I got?

97
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,640
I got Godzilla versus Kong.

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,880
Right in the name, right in the movie.

99
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
There it was.

100
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,800
It promised and it delivered.

101
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,920
And when I hear Mortal Kombat, I want a goddamn tournament, Dan.

102
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,680
This was what I was screaming most of the movie.

103
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
This was most of the movie.

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Where is this goddamn tournament?

105
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,560
Yeah, and spoiler alert for Mortal Kombat, there's no tournament.

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
It's not a spoiler.

107
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
It is a warning.

108
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Yeah.

109
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,680
And the thing that really bothers me is like, okay, I get it.

110
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,880
Some of these movies are such that like maybe the tournament will be in the third movie

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
or whatever.

112
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah.

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
I think that's cheap.

114
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
It's terrible.

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
But whatever.

116
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah.

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,720
It's not fair that this movie opens up making a big deal about how the fate of Earth depends

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
on this tournament.

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
On the tournament?

120
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
There is no tournament.

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
No tournament.

122
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Infuriating.

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
It is infuriating.

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,400
We are going to lose that sponsorship money.

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
I don't think we're going to keep it.

126
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,280
I don't think we're going to keep it.

127
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,200
The next MK12 video game will not be announced through us.

128
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
It was still fun though.

129
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,480
You know, I like the idea of getting overly excited for no reason, almost as a bit about

130
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
a movie coming out.

131
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
No, it was great.

132
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,080
And it was fun to do that and to watch a movie that was new.

133
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
It's been a very long time.

135
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,040
We haven't watched a movie together in a long time.

136
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
It's been forever.

137
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
And this was your idea.

138
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,200
You were like, we're watching Mortal Kombat.

139
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Not only my idea.

140
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I insisted.

141
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Yes, you did.

142
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Yes, you did.

143
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah, it was great.

144
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
It was a great time.

145
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Sure.

146
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Yeah, it's not a terrible movie.

147
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,480
It's the worst movie ever made.

148
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Oh boy.

149
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Okay.

150
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
So Jordan, today we're back in the past.

151
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Okay.

152
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
As promised.

153
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Good.

154
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,040
We're in 2003, continuing our march through that time to see what we can learn.

155
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

156
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,560
I realized as I was listening to this, that one of the things that I obviously am the

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,000
most interested in is seeing if that sort of bizarre Christian extremism exists within

158
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
him back then.

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Sure.

160
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He thinks he's fighting the devil.

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right, right, right, right.

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
That seems to be what I'm most interested in.

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Yes.

164
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,880
Because if that's been going on for 18 years, someone should have, you know, taken care

165
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
of it.

166
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Yes, yeah, yeah.

167
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,360
We should have a societal understanding that this guy thinks he's the fucking Messiah.

168
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,160
It has nothing to do with banking.

169
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Totally, totally.

170
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
No, no, no, no.

171
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
The Fed?

172
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Nuh-uh.

173
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
It's fighting the devil.

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,000
It's complete nonsense with a little thin veneer of political intrigue in order to trick

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,480
people into thinking that what they're involved in isn't extremist religion.

177
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Exactly.

178
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
So I was interested-

179
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,520
And we've seen signs and there have been simmering tensions, slight little bits that if you were

180
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,280
being ungenerous, perhaps you could put that in the holster.

181
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,640
Yeah, so I'm interested to see what happens here on May 6th, see if we can find any more

182
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
clues.

183
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Ooh, that's nice.

184
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
And get a better picture of what's going on.

185
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Let's see what happens.

186
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,640
First though, Jordan, we've got to give some shout-outs to some wonks.

187
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Oh, that's a great idea.

188
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,880
So first, Joanna, and then the message here is that Jordan needs to livestream some Chrono

189
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,720
Trigger pretty please, you're now a policy wonk.

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm a policy wonk.

191
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,160
Thank you very much!

192
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
And that's a good idea.

193
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
That's a great game.

194
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
We've got a request for you to stream.

195
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
That's a great game.

196
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Yeah.

197
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Yeah, also scream some Chrono Trigger.

198
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,600
Next, if it's pronounced A-T-A-T, then TIE fighters are now T-I-E fighters.

199
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
I'm a policy wonk.

201
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,920
Thank you, but also, I don't want a flame war developing through this, this is not how

202
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
we do this.

203
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Simmering controversy.

204
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,320
This is not how we do this.

205
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Ed H., thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

206
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,420
I'm a policy wonk.

207
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,120
That's actually pronounced E-D-H, Dan.

208
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Thank you very much, Ed.

209
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,320
And then, I'd like to give some shout-outs to some technocrats.

210
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,760
First we got Joel C., thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

211
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,160
Dan, I love you, but the Rolling Stones wrote Play with Fire, not The Fucking Doors.

212
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,440
Thank you so much, you're now a technocrat.

213
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,880
And Brian...

214
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
You're now a technocrat.

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
I'm a policy wonk.

216
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

217
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Have yourself a brew.

218
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,880
How's your 401k doing, bro?

219
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,200
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

220
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,760
Let's just get down to business.

221
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,840
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

222
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,760
Why you pimps so good?

223
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,420
My neck is freakishly large.

224
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,960
I declare info war on you.

225
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,640
Thank you so much, Joel, the music scolder, and Brian Seltzer.

226
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,320
Thank you very much to all of you.

227
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,600
I think I'm gonna change my bright spot to just now you staying humble.

228
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,680
Oh, you're great.

229
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Thanks.

230
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
I love you.

231
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,280
So, Jordan, today, like I said, we're in the past, here is an out of context drop from

232
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
today's show.

233
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,680
Yes, I'm a maniac, yes, I love freedom, thanks for putting up with me, folks, I, uh...

234
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,640
So that's an out of context drop, you know, he's saying I'm a maniac, but he's not being

235
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
a maniac.

236
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,720
No, no, no, no, that's almost more terrifying of just somebody in a monotone, yes, I'm a

237
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
maniac.

238
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
No, but he hasn't been earlier in the episode before that, either.

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh, not at all?

240
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
No.

241
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
What?

242
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,520
Yeah, like if you listen to present day shows, you'll be like, this guy is so subdued, and

243
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
he's like, I'm sorry, I'm being crazy.

244
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
No, you're not.

245
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Wow, that's interesting.

246
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,760
This is the first serialized content we've got, where he's referencing the fact that

247
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,000
he has been a maniac in the past.

248
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,400
At least we're aware of the past in this time period.

249
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,160
In the future, I will be so nuts that I have to apologize now.

250
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Yes, exactly.

251
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,680
So he starts off the show, and I honestly think, I'm working on a theory, this is another

252
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,080
thing I'm tracking as I'm going back to the past, and I think Joe Rogan might have ripped

253
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
off Alex.

254
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,280
All right, my friends, we have a powerful broadcast for you today.

255
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,960
Just masses of vital information developing on the police state, on the thought crime

256
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,280
front here in the home land.

257
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,200
We also have Bechtel, that wicked organization, it's now coming out in the mainstream news

258
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,240
that Bechtel is big with the bin Laden's.

259
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,560
Well, of course, you don't build anything in the Middle East unless you are with the

260
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
CIA.

261
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,600
And you became the bin Laden British intelligence family.

262
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,320
So I think Rogan might have stolen calling his show powerful from Alex.

263
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,600
This is 2003, this is before the Rogan experience started.

264
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Oh yeah, for sure.

265
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
The powerful Joe Rogan experience.

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Powerful Rogan.

267
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Got a powerful broadcast here.

268
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,920
Oh boy, I don't think so.

269
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,680
So let's talk about the Bechtel group.

270
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Sure.

271
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,200
So the story here that Alex is talking about, it begins with a piece by Jane Meyer in the

272
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,920
New Yorker, where she covers a connection between the bin Laden family and the Bechtel

273
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
group.

274
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,800
Quote, the global construction and engineering company to which the US government recently

275
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,460
awarded its first major multimillion dollar contract to reconstruct war-ravaged Iraq.

276
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,280
This was because the bin Laden family had invested about $10 million in a company called

277
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,760
Fremont Group, which began as a subsidiary of Bechtel, but had been a separate entity

278
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,800
since 1986.

279
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,840
Some of the board members of Bechtel were also board members of Fremont, but they weren't

280
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,000
connected businesses, so an investment in one isn't necessarily an investment in the

281
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
other.

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,800
There's a lot of reasons to point fingers at Bechtel and suspect they're not above board

284
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,560
in their dealings, but this tenuous connection to the bin Laden family is not one of them.

285
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,440
Even if you connect them concretely to Fremont, then you still need to demonstrate how the

286
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,880
money the bin Laden family invested in Fremont has any connections to the actions of Osama

287
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
bin Laden.

288
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Yeah.

289
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,120
There's so much work that you still need to do to make this a sensible conspiracy, and

290
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,840
all Alex is doing is just pointing at someone else's headline and then misconstruing it.

291
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,580
I can't think of anything more like, oh, I heard that the Bechtel group was into some

292
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,900
shit or I'd be like, oh yeah, of course they were.

293
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,480
Most businesses commit financial crimes of some sort.

294
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,200
I don't think they're financing terrorism.

295
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,480
That's more expensive than just committing financial crimes.

296
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,640
Well the conspiracy that they're sort of trying to dance around without explicitly saying

297
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,900
it is like, so this Bechtel group, they do a lot of construction projects, multi-million

298
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,880
dollar reconstruction projects.

299
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,560
So Osama bin Laden, they built the twin towers and they were actually fake and they were

300
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,200
made, and it was a small model that was, no, no, okay.

301
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,760
It's that like the Osama bin Laden funding of this is related to causing the need for

302
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
the construction.

303
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Sure, sure, sure.

304
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
You have a closed loop of investment.

305
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I gotcha.

306
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
I gotcha.

307
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
I gotcha.

308
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,700
That's sort of the conspiracy that's being hinted at without actually overtly saying

309
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,040
because it's like, okay, no, hold on.

310
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,600
If you were to actually assert that, people would be like, you can't prove any of this.

311
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
That's outrageous.

312
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Yeah.

313
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,640
But if you hint at it like Alex is doing, then you know, you can kind of get away with

314
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
it.

315
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,460
Pretend you've proven a case when you haven't done anything of the sort.

316
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,600
Follow the money.

317
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,120
There's a few million invested in a small company and that's terrorism.

318
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Okay.

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
All right, fine.

320
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Yeah.

321
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Okay.

322
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,200
So Alex is this guy who has always been right about everything and he's just like just waiting

323
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
to be proven right all the time.

324
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
All the time.

325
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,080
Also, a passport will carry eye prints.

326
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,680
We'll get to that.

327
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,960
Even WorldNetDaily admits it.

328
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,360
I wasn't going to cover it yesterday when the Toronto Star was saying it because I knew

329
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,960
it would come out in other conservative publications.

330
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,880
We like to go from it from that angle because we know how the liberals are.

331
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,600
Turns out what we told you about a month ago was completely true.

332
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,480
So it's interesting to see how clearly above the left-right paradigm Alex is back in 2003.

333
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Can't trust any liberals.

334
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,600
No, totally seems like a guy who is consistent about how the left-right thing is just an

335
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
illusion.

336
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Unfortunately, he doesn't seem like a dishonest, manipulative, extremely right-wing asshole.

337
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,000
The truth is that Alex does dislike the left and the right at this point in time.

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can tell that.

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,780
But it's important to recognize what his complaints are.

340
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,040
He hates the left because he hates them.

341
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,920
He hates the right because he doesn't feel like they're far enough to the right and that

342
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,520
they're secretly on the left.

343
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Right.

344
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,920
Also, 18 years later and our passports do not include eye prints.

345
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,960
Chalk that one up in the column of things Alex has not always been right about.

346
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Yeah.

347
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,160
So in this time period, Alex wants to hear George W. come out and be like, segregation

348
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:38,680
now, segregation then, you know, and then he'd be well above the left-right paradigm.

349
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Certainly beyond it.

350
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Yes, yeah, yeah.

351
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,680
So we have another echo of the past that certainly plays in the present day quite a bit and that

352
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,160
is the idea that if you pay with cash somewhere, you're going to go to prison.

353
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Well, sure.

354
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,720
So paying cash triggers alert for terrorism in the new world.

355
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,240
This is out of the Virginia pilot.

356
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,720
Paying cash anywhere is now a terrorist act.

357
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,400
They'll be phasing it out soon.

358
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,920
So that has not happened yet.

359
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,560
I mean, didn't India phase out all the paper money?

360
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,160
Didn't Narendra Modi just be like, one day he was just like, no paper money.

361
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm not sure if that's been a full and total phasing.

362
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Yeah, well.

363
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,800
I know that during COVID, there's been a lesser use of money.

364
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Well, for sure.

365
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
We still use paper money.

366
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
We do still use paper money.

367
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Totally fine.

368
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,640
I used it earlier to purchase the drink that I am enjoying right now.

369
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Yeah.

370
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,160
I was kind of suspicious about this and it takes him until the end of the episode to

371
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,160
actually talk about what this article is about.

372
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Well, sure, sure.

373
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,120
So I'm just going to jump forward now so we can close this with.

374
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Okay.

375
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,680
So we're doing this in what it sounds like a really poorly written attempt at humor,

376
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,080
but also no, but also at like, like a editorial kind of thing.

377
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Sure.

378
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,920
And here's basically what's going on, but a polite equivalent of your money's no good

379
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
here.

380
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,680
Arrived in the mail the other day in the form of a note from the Sachs department store

381
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,840
folks.

382
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,440
The only reason we have an account with them is that my wife once said she wanted to get

383
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,920
some Sachs and I hardly agree, only to learn that as a mutant Midwesterner, I'd once again

384
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
misinterpreted her soft Virginia accent.

385
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,160
Those women in Virginia do have pretty voices, fine Southern ladies.

386
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,960
Anyway, the note from Sachs said that henceforth, it would not accept cash as a form of payment

387
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,860
on store accounts in any form over $300.

388
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,560
So that's the story.

389
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,000
Some guy was, he learned that at Sachs, they don't accept cash on things over $350.

390
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm so infuriated by that.

391
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,160
And there's a little bit of a, that's how with sexy Alex's show used to get.

392
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,320
That's so fucking annoying.

393
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:01,400
I just can't imagine one opening something from Sachs in the mail that goes in the garbage.

394
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Sure.

395
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,280
That's too caring if you can't buy something more than $350 with cash.

396
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
That's fine.

397
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Yeah.

398
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
That's totally fine.

399
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Sure.

400
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,520
That's slightly annoying to people buying things more than $350.

401
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,240
It's also, if I were someone who was running a store like that, I might be suspicious of

402
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,600
someone paying a thousand dollars for something in cash.

403
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Yeah, of course.

404
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I might be.

405
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Of course.

406
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Why wouldn't you be?

407
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,720
I mean, I wouldn't judge them too much, but I'd be like, this money might be dirty.

408
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,080
No, I mean, if somebody walks up to you, they're like, Hey, I want to buy this car for 20,000

409
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,560
cash and I don't want you to give my name, you would be at least a little suspicious.

410
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Yeah.

411
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
There might be a reason.

412
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Right.

413
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,760
So Alex gets to talking some more about the Bin Laden family.

414
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,040
He does not cover this story about Bechdel in depth or anything, but he does ramble a

415
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,320
bit about the Bin Laden, how he's CIA.

416
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,200
I love the song, I love the song Ramble On.

417
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
Do you know who did that?

418
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Doors.

419
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
It was the doors.

420
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,480
One would have to hide on the dark side of the moon to not know that Bin Laden is CIA,

421
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:16,600
to not know that his family, it was set up by British intelligence over 70 years ago,

422
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,920
that they carry out dangerous missions for the new world order all over the world.

423
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,040
And that if you want to build anything in the middle East, you go one place, the Bin

424
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,000
Laden, and that you're not allowed to build any type of military structure or pipeline

425
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,120
anything unless you go through the CIA and Her Majesty's Al-Qaeda.

426
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,680
That's a lot of stuff being said.

427
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,080
It does seem like there's a lot going on there.

428
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,360
Yeah, so there's this claim that Bin Laden is CIA, and you have to be on the moon to

429
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
not know that.

430
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,440
No, he's committing worldwide wet work as we speak.

431
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
I would say that Alex can't prove this at all.

432
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Oh, you don't think so?

433
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,920
You know, the most he could probably do is say that people have theorized, and some believe

434
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,320
quite strongly, that Bin Laden received some training from the CIA back in the 1980s when

435
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,120
Bin Laden and the Mujahideen were fighting against Soviet communists.

436
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,420
You could even be pretty reasonable in assuming that some of that financial support from the

437
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,560
US did find its way to Bin Laden and his fighters in that period as part of Operation Cyclone,

438
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,120
aimed at fighting communism abroad with the help of proxy armies.

439
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,340
A strong argument could be made that the formation of Al-Qaeda was at least partially the effect

440
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,760
of blowback from these behaviors and operations.

441
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,160
The thing is that one can accept all the conventionally understood history of Bin Laden and his connections

442
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,400
to the US and the CIA and still recognize that the claims Alex is making are unfounded.

443
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,920
Saying that stupid geopolitical decisions inspired by the anti-communist hysteria of

444
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,120
the Reagan era led to unforeseen and severe consequences is not the same thing as saying

445
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,200
that Osama Bin Laden was in the CIA.

446
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
It's very different.

447
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,240
Yeah, it's wild to me to go to like, Osama is still working for the CIA, instead of immediately

448
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,520
assuming that the CIA made a stupid and short-sighted decision that is perfectly in line with literally

449
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,200
every decision that the CIA has ever made.

450
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty-

451
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
It makes sense.

452
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,920
There's narrative consistency there.

453
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Yeah.

454
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,360
So the second claim that Alex is making in that clip is that there's no construction

455
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,680
that happens in the Middle East without the involvement of the Bin Laden family, which

456
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
is nuts.

457
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Why?

458
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
How?

459
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,960
Well, Saudi Arabia is the majority owner of the Bin Laden Group Global Holding Company,

460
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
formerly known as Saudi Bin Laden Group.

461
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,000
They do have interest in a lot of construction and some incredibly high-profile projects

462
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,280
like the Jeddah Tower, but it's a little much to pretend that they run a complete racket

463
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,360
of all these construction projects in the Middle East.

464
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,320
I mean, he does not want to learn about sovereign wealth funds, I'll tell you that right now.

465
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,800
A Forbes Middle East estimate recently put the total value of projects in the Saudi Arabian

466
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,640
construction market at $1.2 trillion, and that's not even considering like 713 billion

467
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,120
in UAE projects, 578 billion in Egypt.

468
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,560
It's a fun story to tell that the Bin Laden family has a stranglehold on the market and

469
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,280
no one makes anything without their approval and that of the CIA, but it's not real.

470
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,700
It's just a cartoonish exaggeration of the news that was reported about the ties between

471
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,200
the Bin Laden family and the Bechtel Group that Alex is trying to inflate into being

472
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,380
something completely different than it actually is.

473
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,520
There are problems with the interconnectedness of these boards, and you can make some good

474
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,960
arguments about the way contracts are baited on and doled out, and the sort of conversations

475
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,600
are completely impossible.

476
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,740
If the point that you want to start from is that Bin Laden is CIA and his family runs

477
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,400
all this construction in the Middle East, it's a dead end if you're trying to understand

478
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,400
the real world, and that's what Alex is ushering his audience towards.

479
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:41,640
And also, like, the biggest construction groups in Saudi Arabia are run by the government.

480
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
It's not the Bin Laden family.

481
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,520
An incredibly corrupt government using this for their own personal gain in a way that

482
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,640
makes perfect sense if you know anything about the history of that government.

483
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
So Jordan, we've heard a lot about Alex predicting 9-11.

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,120
Sure, he nailed it.

485
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,100
We know that about a month before he did, Bill Cooper was saying the exact same stuff

486
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
on his show.

487
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Sure.

488
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, I mean, and several times before that, Osama himself was saying it, which is probably

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,200
why you could assume that it was a smart prediction.

490
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Alex in this next clip talks a little bit about where he got some of his ideas that

491
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
the...

492
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Osama bin Laden?

493
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Nope.

494
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Oh, okay.

495
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Gary Hart, one of the chief neo-cons.

496
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,800
I mean, he's a great Democrat.

497
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:28,200
Of course, he's a leading neo-con now on the board there with the CFR and with Rudman.

498
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,920
And they said, they said, we're going to be hit by terrorists when big, tall buildings

499
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
are going to be in trouble.

500
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,640
He sat on hardball, 4-9-1-1, started laughing.

501
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
Chris Matthews laughed.

502
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,760
It was a CFR moment.

503
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,840
Lots of giggling around the table, lots of smacking, lots of rubbing hands together.

504
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,480
And I got on the air and I said, look out, New York's about to get it.

505
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Call the White House, tell them to stop, to call off the attack.

506
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,120
So Alex saw Gary Hart and Chris Matthews having a moment.

507
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Yeah.

508
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,160
Was this a segment on the show back then?

509
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
The CFR moment?

510
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
Yeah.

511
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Yeah.

512
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
And that's your CFR moment for the day.

513
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Yeah.

514
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
It was like the Daily Show at the moment of Zen.

515
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Exactly.

516
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Yes.

517
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Chris Matthews had the CFR moment.

518
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
The CFR moment.

519
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Yeah.

520
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,200
He had this blatant CFR moment happening in public, and he knew that there was going to

521
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
be...

522
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Absolutely.

523
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,680
Unfortunately, if you listen to him in the present day, it's a slightly different story.

524
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
There's a different story?

525
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,120
Let me tell you, folks, I told you they were going to blow up the World Trade Center and

526
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,760
blame it on bin Laden.

527
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,040
God gave me a vision, and that's the little added ingredient of M4s everybody knows about.

528
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,360
It's not just that I know how to politically analyze all this stuff.

529
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:41,320
I can get on my knees and go to that place, and then the problem is you're just in God's

530
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
presence.

531
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,400
You don't care that now you can actually see everything going on in the universe, plugging

532
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,580
directly in to the source.

533
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,080
And there was that time that he went on Rogan's show and said that he got it from a dream?

534
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Yes, there is that.

535
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:01,200
Well, there was a two-hour thing I did in July 25th, 2001, where I went ahead and went

536
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,280
on air and said, they're going to blow up the World Trade Center, blame it on the CIS,

537
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,680
have been live, then launch all these wars.

538
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,720
And I said, oh, I just got this from analysis information, but I kept having the dream of

539
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,400
the towers, smoking, all the rest of it.

540
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,600
I love the idea that in the present day, when he's talking to Rogan to try and be interesting,

541
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,100
he's like, I claimed back then that it was based on analysis, but I just had this dream

542
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,240
over and over again.

543
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,040
Now we're looking back at 2003 and it's him saying that it was based on analysis, based

544
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
on analysis.

545
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,720
So we can only conclude that in 2003, all this episode talking about the CFR moment,

546
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
he's lying.

547
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Yes.

548
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
He's just had dreams.

549
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
100%.

550
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Yep.

551
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Wow.

552
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,320
Well, I mean, that's strangely conclusive proof that maybe he wasn't lying in the present.

553
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,600
He was, hey, hey, I was lying in the past, okay?

554
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,560
I'm coming clean on this one.

555
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,680
No matter what I do, it's based on a lie.

556
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,260
Yeah, I don't know.

557
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
That's so funny.

558
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Did you ever notice how narcissists, as time goes on, the people in their stories tend

559
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,080
to disappear and it's just them?

560
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,720
You know, that whole Gary Hart thing just disappears into the past.

561
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
The CFR moment.

562
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Yeah.

563
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Is but a dream.

564
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
No, not a worry.

565
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Not a worry.

566
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,640
In the present day, it was all me and God, baby.

567
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,080
God gave him a vision of literally everything that was going to happen because he was so

568
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
spectacular.

569
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,520
He gets hand jobs from the arcane angel Michael, yeah.

570
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,320
So we have this interesting dynamic in the past here where Alex is still trying to do

571
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,000
that whole pretending the left and the right are the same kind of game.

572
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah.

573
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I think it's a choice to get into that a little bit, and I think it's a little silly.

574
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,240
Look, I've tried to explain the real political paradigm, okay?

575
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,680
If you're on the far left, you've got police and black ski masks, giant prisons, incredible

576
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,960
taxation, regulation control, a few strong men running things.

577
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,120
That's socialism, communism, whatever you want to call it.

578
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
That is what they do to us.

579
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,760
On the far right, police and black uniforms, giant prisons, a few strong men running things,

580
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,800
total control, high taxation.

581
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,120
Sounds like the past five years.

582
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,080
Look, until 100 years ago, the universities taught liberty, freedom, Magna Carta, Bill

583
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
of Rights.

584
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,480
It was a discussion of liberty versus tyranny.

585
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,560
It wasn't a discussion of left and right.

586
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,840
They've learned how to give you false choices.

587
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,920
They go, oh, do you want the left and the right when there's no difference in substance.

588
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,720
What?

589
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,040
I do like we can kind of boil it down to the conversation is still between liberty and

590
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
tyranny.

591
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,360
I'm not just pretending that the right doesn't associate with tyranny.

592
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,160
That's kind of your problem here.

593
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,360
You guys just tried to institute a theocracy.

594
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,160
I think we know what the left-right paradigm is, liberty versus freedom.

595
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,240
Yeah, it's a little bit strange.

596
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,560
I would say that that's a superficial analysis at best.

597
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,840
The way he's trying to depict the left and the right as the same is essentially meaningless.

598
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,800
And also, I don't know how he knows what they were teaching at universities 100 years ago.

599
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Sure.

600
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Sure.

601
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,320
I would say that he is not somebody I would take as a credible source on that.

602
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Sure.

603
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,360
So yeah, that assessment I don't care too much about.

604
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,360
The left and the right, it's just simplistic.

605
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,320
You can take left-wing governments that have eroded into dictatorships and right-wing governments

606
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,000
that have also eroded into dictatorships, and then you can find some superficial similarities

607
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
between them.

608
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Sure.

609
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,920
And I think that they're all the same.

610
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,560
For a policy wonk, you'd think that he would bring up specific things that they agree on.

611
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,120
No, just superficial things like there's big jails and people and police in black uniforms.

612
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Okay.

613
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
All right, well, they solved it then.

614
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,880
Also, I want you to keep this in mind.

615
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Typically speaking, if someone is trying to tell you that there's no difference between

616
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,520
X and Y, there's a really good chance that they're super on the side of X or Y.

617
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Yes.

618
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,080
They're usually not in the middle or neutral.

619
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
It is strange.

620
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,960
They're usually an extremist for X or Y.

621
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,040
Usually they go from there's nothing between, there's no difference between X or Y, and

622
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,720
then they push you strongly towards X or Y.

623
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,040
Yes, it does seem like that is a pattern.

624
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Yeah.

625
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,320
So Alex is trying to make this point that like the left and the right are the same,

626
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
you know, blah, blah, blah.

627
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Sure.

628
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,920
Fascism and communism, same thing.

629
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,800
And here is how Alex makes that argument.

630
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,960
There's no difference in substance.

631
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,000
So call it fascism, call it communism.

632
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,400
It's all command and control, maybe a little bit different implementation system, but yeah,

633
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,600
you got Bush's grandfather getting detained and having to pay a million plus fine, Prescott

634
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,160
Bush for running almost all Nazi operations globally, over 53% of their steel production,

635
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
you name it.

636
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Prescott, the Senator.

637
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
No help at all.

638
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,640
You've at the same time got the other families funding the communists.

639
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,900
I mean, this is what they do, folks.

640
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,040
So Alex is really bad at his job in clips like this.

641
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Yeah.

642
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Like what does he mean by Prescott Bush?

643
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,960
We're in almost all the Nazi operations globally.

644
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,600
Did he run the cloning program in Brazil too?

645
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Totally.

646
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Okay, good.

647
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,780
If you pay attention to that clip, you see one of the ways that Alex lies.

648
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,440
He takes something that is true, namely that Prescott Bush did indirect business with the

649
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,840
Nazis and then he embellishes it in a completely insane way, like claiming he ran almost all

650
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
their operations globally.

651
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,280
The assertion that Alex is making is nonsensical.

652
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,960
He's saying that Prescott Bush profiteered by trading with fascists and that other rich

653
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,080
families have profiteered by trading with communists, thus they must be the same.

654
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Same thing.

655
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,960
It means nothing and is a silly argument.

656
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
No difference.

657
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,240
The argument that fascism and communism are the same because Alex believes them both to

658
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,720
be command and control systems is equally meaningless.

659
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,640
Alex throws out that term a lot, but it really is just a military term that the Joint Chiefs

660
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,480
of Staff defines thus, quote, commanding control is the exercise of authority and direction

661
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,680
by a properly designated commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of a mission.

662
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,000
The term has a broader understanding outside of strictly military situations to mean someone

663
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,360
directs other people to get a task done.

664
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,920
It does seem very self-explanatory whenever you just think of words and how they mean

665
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
things.

666
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,280
If this is the big similarity that Alex has that he thinks makes communism and fascism

667
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,760
the same, I have a short list of other things that also must be the same as the Nazis.

668
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
School.

669
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah.

670
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Any job where you have a boss.

671
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
True.

672
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Hospitals.

673
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Yeah.

674
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Firefighting.

675
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Construction.

676
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
NASCAR pit crews.

677
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Nailed it.

678
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Any sport that has a coach.

679
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Correct.

680
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Any form of acting where there's a director.

681
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Every country in the world.

682
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
This list goes on and on.

683
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,280
Well, you didn't need to add that last one.

684
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Sure.

685
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,880
By focusing on what he thinks is the only relevant factor in these two systems, Alex

686
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,400
is actually obscuring the much more real and much more important differences between them.

687
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,840
I think what Alex is trying to express is that communist countries have what's known

688
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,720
as a command economy, where the government decides what should be produced and how much

689
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,320
as opposed to letting the market decide.

690
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,960
This is a defining aspect of communism as an economic system.

691
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,200
The problem is when you try to juxtapose that with fascism, which isn't an economic system.

692
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,520
If you look at the fascist countries during World War II, for example, you can see massive

693
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,620
differences in the economic models that they employed.

694
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,680
What Alex is trying to express is that communism by definition involves a command economy and

695
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,100
that the Nazis also had a fairly command-based economy.

696
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,460
The difference is that within communism it's an element of the economic ideology, but in

697
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,160
the case of groups like the Nazis, it was just used because it was necessary to run

698
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,880
an economy almost entirely based on war.

699
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,400
We did the same thing during World War II.

700
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Yeah.

701
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
It was a great idea.

702
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,020
It worked out for everybody involved.

703
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,820
This is not a meaningful, substantive connection between these two things.

704
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,080
As I was listening to this episode, I was trying to give Alex a fair reading, and it's

705
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,960
just what he's saying doesn't make sense.

706
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,000
No, I mean, based on his definition of command and control, the fundamental idea of laws

707
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,560
can't exist, because that is a designated body telling you what you can or cannot do.

708
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,160
That simply cannot exist in his concept of both.

709
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,320
I think if you went too far with it, yeah, you probably could get to that argument.

710
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,880
I think I could get him to that argument.

711
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,760
I don't think it would be hard.

712
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,160
Oh, another thing that's command and control.

713
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Judges.

714
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Yeah, exactly.

715
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
You're right.

717
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
All laws should be abolished.

718
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,240
Okay, Alex, that wasn't quite my point, but fair enough.

719
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,600
So the thing, though, is that socialism always leads to fascism.

720
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,280
You want to use these half-baked political terms, communist, socialist, fascist, I'll

721
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
use them.

722
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Half-baked?

723
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:36,080
And to use them, and more accurately, socialism leads to fascism.

724
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,360
Over and over again, the bankers fund a socialist communist movement to consolidate power to

725
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,040
get a big government, to get people dependent, and then it is transferred, once they're dependent,

726
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,520
to a fascist government.

727
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,880
Now that's what happens over and over again.

728
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,920
That's just not true.

729
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,440
But this conversation's probably impossible to have, because I don't think Alex is using

730
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,880
any of these terms in the way that anyone else would use them.

731
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I don't know.

732
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,520
This is a completely made-up claim that Alex is peddling that he can't back up at all unless

733
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,860
he uses completely absurd definitions of the words socialism and fascism that I don't think

734
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,600
anybody would agree with him on.

735
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,740
Socialism is whatever it is he doesn't like, and if you can define it as something different

736
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,200
from that, he will tell you that that's the secret way they talk about it, to cover up

737
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,400
that what they actually mean is socialism.

738
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Sure.

739
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Yeah.

740
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,440
So Alex, one of the big breaking points in his career, one of the times that he...

741
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Also, real quick.

742
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Yeah.

743
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,200
He realized the idea that communism is half-baked.

744
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,760
One of the most documented and argued about in books over and over and over again, refined

745
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,040
and reinterpreted things, is half-fucking-baked.

746
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,440
Karl Marx made it through three-quarters of Das Kapital and was like, eh, that'll do.

747
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,760
Look, I tried.

748
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Yeah, exactly.

749
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,320
I'll put it out there and everybody else can finish the last 40 pages if they want.

750
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,760
There's a salient difference between I disagree with this and it's half-baked.

751
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Yeah, it's half-baked.

752
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Yes.

753
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
That is fake.

754
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Sorry.

755
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Sorry.

756
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
I needed to beat that dead horse real quick.

757
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Hey.

758
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
I say nay.

759
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,360
No.

760
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,840
So Alex broke into Bohemian Grove, right?

761
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Sure.

762
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Yes, he did.

763
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,800
And you know, we've heard a lot of stories of him talking about his heroics.

764
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,920
And now that we're in the future, he did it completely by himself with no other journalist

765
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,400
there whatsoever who were also documenting the situation.

766
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,120
Oh, you might be surprised to hear this then.

767
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Oh.

768
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,760
I mean, you can't write stuff this crazy.

769
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,600
I didn't believe in Bohemian Grove.

770
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
I'd read about it.

771
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
I'd heard about it.

772
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
I didn't believe it.

773
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,720
I'd read mainstream news articles.

774
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,360
The British media says, Mr. Jones, we'd like to get you to sneak in.

775
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,960
We really can't do it.

776
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,320
But we're afraid to do it, Mr. Jones.

777
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
We know you do things like this.

778
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,480
Would you like to sneak into the Grove?

779
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,480
I snuck in and I saw it, folks, okay?

780
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,600
I saw it with my own two eyes.

781
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,980
I got video of it.

782
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,760
Alex in the present day would like to say that he was the first person to ever break

783
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
the story wide open.

784
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Oh, of course, of course.

785
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,000
Here he is in 2003 talking about how he'd read about it in the mainstream news before.

786
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,240
And in fact, the British media approached him to do the story.

787
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,720
He did not think of this by himself whatsoever.

788
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,520
Hey, Alex, we hear you're a weirdo.

789
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,080
He would never do it had he not had the push from the British media.

790
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,040
Yeah, these are just some of these little differences between past versions of stories

791
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
and present.

792
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,160
Yeah, it seems like things change.

793
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Sure.

794
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,200
Alex in the present is weird sponsors.

795
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,560
Alex has a herb store or like, I don't know, I guess they have some colloidal silver and

796
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,560
stuff that they sell that he's running an ad for.

797
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,880
And it ended in a way that shocked me.

What?

806
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,560
Is this a Christian identity herbal shop?

807
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Oh, no.

808
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,240
We're going to send you our 104-page catalog.

809
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,040
Also, we've defeated the Zardons and if you call this number, we will be able to send

810
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
you this catalog.

811
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,680
Wait, you shouldn't have thrown the Zardons in there.

812
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
What did you just say?

813
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Yeah.

814
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Yeah.

815
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
We're trying to save the remnant.

816
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,920
That's interesting code to be in this commercial this far back.

817
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,960
It seems like maybe Alex was, I mean, why would you have that as a sponsor if they weren't

818
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,640
like a Christian identity type of herbal shop?

819
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Sure.

820
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
Yeah.

821
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Natural place for us to advertise.

822
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Yeah.

823
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,860
Why would you shoehorn that into your commercial?

824
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,860
Very weird.

825
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Yeah.

826
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,860
Very weird.

827
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:51,520
I can't get over the idea of like Kellogg's just... Cornflakes, they're great.

828
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,840
The thousand year war almost ended and if you want more Kellogg's cornflakes, like,

829
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,800
wait, what did you just say?

830
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,480
We will defeat the devil with my lucky charms.

831
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
You can't just toss that in there, man.

832
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
What are you doing?

833
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,840
It is strange.

834
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,360
So Alex is having a tough time with the Iraq war and all this, partially because he hates

835
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,800
the people who were doing it.

836
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Sure.

837
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Vis a vis George Bush.

838
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Naturally.

839
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
And all that.

840
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,240
And I think that by free talking a little bit too much, I think that Alex reveals certain

841
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,840
ways in which his ideology is inconsistent with what he wants the audience to believe

842
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
it is.

843
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,440
I mean, the government was leaving us alone and not trying to dumb our kids down and not

844
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,440
trying to ship heroin and cocaine in and not doing all these things.

845
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,600
They wanted to go invade a bunch of countries and, you know, bring them real republics and

846
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
really have elections.

847
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,160
I'd go, well, man, you know, maybe so.

848
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,640
Violates what George Washington said about, you know, staying out of other hemisphere,

849
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,440
but okay.

850
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,880
But no, you don't destroy everything that makes America America.

851
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,720
So Alex seems like he's fine with the idea of colonialism.

852
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Yeah, it does seem like that.

853
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,880
Regime change, installing democracies abroad.

854
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Sure.

855
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,080
Only in the case that the government wasn't doing the things that he doesn't like.

856
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,280
Right, right, right.

857
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,360
So I guess his opposition can't possibly be to meddling in the affairs of other countries

858
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,040
or regime changing nation building.

859
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,000
That is something that he is hypothetically okay with.

860
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,640
But he will pretend that he's not.

861
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Yeah.

862
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,440
I would be interested to know what Washington would consider a hemisphere.

863
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,000
Alex's argument against the Iraq war seems to be vaccines.

864
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,960
Yeah, I was going to say, it does not seem to...

865
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
This is not sensible.

866
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,240
No, no, no, no.

867
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,120
It doesn't seem like he's like, hey, hey, we should be colonizing Central South America

868
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
is what we do.

869
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,520
No other hemispheres, Washington.

870
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,980
No, I think he's saying that if our country was run the way I want it to be, we could

871
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,200
go ahead and put in democracies around the world.

872
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Sure, of course.

873
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,800
I just don't like these people.

874
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,840
It's an incoherent and silly ideology that runs into problems really fast.

875
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Yeah, it is.

876
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,000
It's the same thing with him wanting to buy Greenland when Trump is in office.

877
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
For sure, for sure.

878
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

879
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Let's just steal it.

880
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah.

881
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Okay.

882
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah.

883
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It's that kind of nonsense of like, oh, that is kind of what you believe.

884
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,280
As long as it's your idealized Christian authoritarian government, you'd be totally fine if it was

885
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,680
one world government.

886
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,680
Of course.

887
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,080
You'd be totally fine with all kinds of colonial expansivism.

888
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,860
Well, then everything's one hemisphere, Dan, if it's all America.

889
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,640
Don't care at all about the idea of freedom or self-determination and bullshit.

890
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,240
It is like, okay, I get that we both don't want the Iraq war, but I don't want it because

891
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,280
millions of people are going to be slaughtered for no reason, and you don't want it because

892
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,040
you don't like the guy?

893
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,240
I don't think we necessarily agree.

894
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I don't like tax.

895
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Yeah.

896
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,120
I don't think that's a good... So Alex does an ad pivot here, and it's very

897
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,440
sensible.

898
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,480
It makes sense.

899
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,560
This is kind of how... I'm not offended by this necessarily.

900
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,720
Because what he's doing is advertising his products, which are like his DVDs and stuff.

901
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,800
It makes sense for him to be like, there's more information on this.

902
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,640
It makes more sense than him constantly throwing to pill commercials.

903
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Yes, it does.

904
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,160
Because at least there's still hypothetical information to be found here, although I think

905
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
he's lying.

906
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,640
Well, some of us aren't afraid.

907
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,120
We'll stand up for humanity because it's people like us, the only reason we still have humanity,

908
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,560
to counterbalance the just insane filth out there.

909
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,520
Before I end this shower, if you believe in what we're doing, you want to fight the New

910
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,800
World Order, you want a tool to fight the New World Order, get my videos.

911
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,720
I produced eight of them, and we proved the globalists carried out 9-1-1, and we proved

912
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,820
they're going to carry out more, and we proved that they're enslaving you and your family.

913
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,120
So on his documentaries, he proved that the globalists carried off 9-1-1, 9-11.

914
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't recall that.

915
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,440
But do you recall when he did that interview a couple years back with Patrick Bette-David

916
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,120
and Patrick Bette-David asked him who did 9-11?

917
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,640
I do recall that.

918
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,440
Who was really behind the 9-11 with what you've studied over the years and what you've spoken

919
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
about?

920
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,680
I don't know who's behind it.

921
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,640
Oh, well, you should watch your DVDs then.

922
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,200
You should watch the proof that you made.

923
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,040
It seems like you would stick to the proof.

924
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,920
Yeah, I would say that maybe you were wrong, or maybe you didn't prove anything.

925
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:33,440
No, I'm just trying to, okay, my documentary's going to prove everything.

926
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,800
The World War is coming.

927
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,760
Now, I mean, obviously the capital gains tax should be about 40, 50%, and that's why

928
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,960
we're like, wait, no, no, no, you threw the snot sequitur in there.

929
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
It's fun.

930
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,480
It's fun for him to forget that he proved who did 9-11.

931
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Yeah.

932
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,560
It seems like a big thing to remember.

933
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
Oh, well.

934
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Who did it?

935
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,160
Alex doesn't know.

936
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,440
I think I've watched those DVDs, and I don't think I know either, based on his proof in

937
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
quotes.

938
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,160
Yeah, I would like those redacted pages is what I want, Dan.

939
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:16,360
So here's our first indication of something not being quite right in Austin.

940
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Sure.

941
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,800
Alex is going out to break, and he says this.

942
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:28,200
Again, that's 888-253-3139, defending the Republic against the forces of Satan.

943
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Uh-oh.

944
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,560
Okay, there it is.

945
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,560
The forces of Satan.

946
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,880
And you could pull that off as being like, oh, look at him, he's making that exaggeration.

947
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,600
Ah, come on, we've all used flowery language.

948
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,960
Yeah, and it's going out to break on like a pump-up kind of thing.

949
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Yeah, totally.

950
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,680
It sounds like a reasonable thing that you would say if you were just pumped up.

951
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,560
And it also does feel like this is a little bit more than I've been giving a pass to a

952
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
lot of stuff.

953
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,440
It seems like I'm fighting against the forces of Satan.

954
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,520
He's not as literal, he's not saying that as part of a 15-minute rant.

955
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Sure, sure.

956
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,760
It is just going out to break, but it made me worry.

957
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,120
It could be hyperbole, of course.

958
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:17,400
Of course, however, you can't miss the forest for the trees, if you will, Dan.

959
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,480
So Alex goes to calls, and I think I've brought this up before, but there's such a sensible

961
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,040
formula to his show at this point, and that is that he'll rant about something for a little

962
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,000
while, and then go to calls, and then maybe the caller says something that he can talk

963
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,080
about for a little bit longer, he'll read a headline or two, then go to a call, get

964
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,160
maybe a reaction, that'll lead into a rant.

965
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,520
There is just a fluidity to it that makes sense.

966
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,720
Whereas now, it's such fucking long chunks of him saying nothing.

967
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,040
Stream of consciousness chaos, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

968
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,480
So it is, it flows much easier.

969
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,680
And so this caller that Alex goes to at this point in the show brings up Rush Limbaugh.

970
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,000
What do you think Alex thinks about Rush Limbaugh?

971
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,240
He's grateful for someone giving him something to steal.

972
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Nope.

973
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,240
Oh.

974
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,120
I was listening the other day, driving in my car, and I happened to turn on Rush Slackjaw,

975
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,760
and he was talking about it.

976
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,160
You turned into the ultra-liberal, and the neo-con, and Bush is a communitarian.

977
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,760
You know what the dictionary 20 years ago said about communitarian?

978
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
No.

979
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,480
One who promotes communist systems.

980
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,520
Bush's press release for the election, I'm a communitarian, what do the communitarian

981
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,760
Rush Limbaugh say?

982
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
So apparently Rush Limbaugh's a commie.

983
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,880
Yes, the communitarian Rush Limbaugh.

984
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,880
Yes.

985
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Noted.

986
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,560
The left commie Rush Limbaugh.

987
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,800
The leftist among leftists, Rush Limbaugh.

988
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,960
Right standing next to Bill Maher is people who are leftists beyond all reason.

989
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,780
Yeah, see, I mean, you get this sense of like, okay, here's where the denial of the left-right

990
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
paradigm is.

991
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,360
Rush Limbaugh is a fucking commie.

992
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,240
Yeah, just take a hit at somebody on the right, and then you're good, you know?

993
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,320
And it doesn't have to be a substantial hit, you can just be like, that guy's a real dick.

994
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,560
Hey, I'm above the left-right paradigm.

995
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:18,160
So Alex is talking to this caller, and they bring up going to the World's Fair in the

996
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
70s, I think.

997
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
Sure.

998
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,280
And they might have seen some Russian propaganda about ecological efforts.

999
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Okay, okay.

1000
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,280
I don't know.

1001
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
I don't know what's going on anymore.

1002
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,400
Talking about your lies and propaganda, I remember in 1974 I went to the World's Fair,

1003
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,640
and the theme of that World's Fair was ecology, and the worst exhibit there, the most propagandized

1004
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,960
exhibit was the Russian exhibit at that World's Fair, and you go through the Russian exhibit

1005
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,960
from one end to the other.

1006
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,080
All they said was how wonderful it was in Russia, there was no pollution, the waters

1007
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,720
were clean, the air was clean, all this stuff, it was exactly the opposite of what was reality.

1008
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,880
But now we're turning into the same kind of a system that I saw in 74 in the World's Fair

1009
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,320
in the Russian exhibit.

1010
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:14,400
Well, I'll be honest, if it was a new world, I'd leave, but I love America.

1011
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
What did you just say?

1012
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,400
And my family's been in the Texas independence fight, and for the battle for independence

1013
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,400
in 1776, but I gotta tell you, I'd be moving down there, I'll tell you.

1014
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,960
Well, I'll tell you, we need some states to break off, break away, get out of this thing,

1015
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,080
and get back to America, call it the real United States, because this isn't the federal

1016
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,080
government.

1017
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
Why?

1018
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,200
People running the federal government, they are the enemy combatants.

1019
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,400
Yeah, the federal government's enemy combatants.

1020
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,400
Sure.

1021
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,360
Now, the thing that I think is interesting about that clip, and the reason that I pulled

1022
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,640
it out was because this caller is expressing this idea that they saw this Russian display

1023
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,880
at the 74 World's Fair, and it is a delusional portrayal of what was really going on in the

1024
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
Soviet Union.

1025
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,320
And one of the things that he brings up is, like, there's no pollution, and then you flash

1026
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,400
forward to the present day, and Alex talking about how coal power plants are all totally

1027
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
clean.

1028
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,280
No pollution, yeah, Russia is just a perfectly clean thing, yeah.

1029
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,320
It's so interesting to see Alex becoming this thing that this caller is describing as being

1030
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:17,360
this horrendous act of propaganda in 1974 that he still remembers in 2003.

1031
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,960
Just don't care.

1032
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,800
Alex is completely delusional about accepting and recognizing and dealing with the sort

1033
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:32,960
of more bad history of the United States, to the point where he's even worse than probably

1034
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,480
whatever that Soviet Union Russian display was.

1035
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:45,880
Yeah, that is one of those things about fascists, is that once you're in power, all of the past

1036
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,960
is changed to whatever you want, you know?

1037
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,120
As long as Trump is running the United States government, the United States has never ever

1038
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,880
done anything wrong.

1039
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,360
And saying so is an attempt to undermine Trump.

1040
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,360
Exactly, yeah.

1041
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,480
Oh, you're gonna bring up slavery again?

1042
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,160
It's America, come on, man.

1043
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,320
You're trying to ruin the exuberance that is being felt.

1044
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,480
You're screwing up our good time, man.

1045
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,200
We're trying to slaughter innocents, and you're really making us bummed out.

1046
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,920
Yeah, it's very strange.

1047
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,360
By that I mean it's not strange at all.

1048
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,640
So hey, we got this idea that, left, right, same thing.

1049
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,640
Sure.

1050
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,080
Last two presidents, Clinton, Bush.

1051
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,240
No difference there.

1052
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,240
Both puppets.

1053
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Sure.

1054
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,640
But were they equally responsible puppets?

1055
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,640
That's, what?

1056
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
What?

1057
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,680
Again, I have nothing really against Bush.

1058
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,000
Bush is more of a puppet than Bill Clinton.

1059
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,420
Bill Clinton was really in there, enjoyed all of it.

1060
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:45,240
Bush is really just reading off a teleprompter, and hey, thanks daddy, it's great to be able

1061
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,280
to preside him in the new world order in the end of America.

1062
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,760
So yeah, we've got these two presidents who are both puppets.

1063
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Right.

1064
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,760
The left and the right.

1065
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Sure.

1066
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,320
But somehow still the one that's on the left is worse.

1067
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,320
Right, right, right.

1068
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,020
Because he enjoyed it.

1069
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,800
So we're in a Pinocchio situation where Clinton is when Pinocchio was turned into a donkey

1070
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,800
for a while.

1071
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Sure.

1072
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,280
And W is still the puppet, but he is not yet a real boy.

1073
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,280
Sure.

1074
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,280
And then Trump is the real boy?

1075
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,280
Yes, I guess.

1076
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,280
I think that's what happened.

1077
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,280
I think I've figured it out.

1078
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,760
Yeah, it's just remarkable to look at this and be like, oh yeah, this act of the left

1079
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,080
and the right are the same is so thin.

1080
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,080
It's so transparent.

1081
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,480
Yeah, you've already done it over and over and over again.

1082
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,720
Almost any time there's a comparison between someone who's on the left and someone who's

1083
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,840
on the right, you can see like some sort of derision towards both, but the left is way

1084
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,840
worse.

1085
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Oh yeah.

1086
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
He enjoyed it.

1087
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,160
Their inclusion is what makes them evil.

1088
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:54,600
So Bush, he gave a warning to the U.S.'s supposed enemies and Alex believes that these are actually

1089
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:00,720
the globalist's enemies and here we get another wonderful prediction from Alex.

1090
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,840
Also Bush fires warnings at U.S. enemies, you mean globalist enemies, saying that other

1091
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,600
countries are next, so if they are going into other countries, they'll need to be a convenient

1092
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
terror attack.

1093
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,680
Blamed on someone though, don't worry.

1094
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,080
Much larger Gary Hart and other CFR people have told us with total confidence and then

1095
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:24,640
we'll call them profits when Dallas or Denver or Cleveland get hit by smallpox, as Gary

1096
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:32,120
Hart said on national television on hardball, well he said that before 9-1-1, he just said

1097
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,280
that on Hattie and Combs.

1098
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,260
So this is one of the problems with relying on quote-unquote CFR moments and that sort

1099
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,080
of thing as being predictive of what's going to happen in the world.

1100
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,720
When Gary Hart says something like we're worried about smallpox cases in an American city,

1101
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,560
and you read that as there's going to be, to justify another war, you're just making

1102
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
shit up.

1103
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,000
And that's what we see here.

1104
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,760
No, and it's the most powerful type of making shit up propaganda, wherein somebody trying

1105
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,880
to protect you from a thing that's happening, you have turned into the person trying to

1106
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,640
cause the thing that's happening, thus ensuring that the thing they're worried about almost

1107
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,160
certainly will happen, and then you get to bitch about how they didn't see it coming.

1108
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:24,240
And then you have these kinds of instances of things that just litter Alex's career,

1109
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,520
that just things never happen, and we're just totally talking out of his ass, he just pretends

1110
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,440
that that isn't a bulk of his career.

1111
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,480
Well the last time I visited Denver, there were about four people there after the smallpox

1112
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,240
epidemic destroyed most of the city, but they were really cool to hang out with.

1113
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,320
There's only lone survivors.

1114
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,800
They did try and eat my leg.

1115
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,400
So look, we get another caller.

1116
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,400
Sure.

1117
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
This guy's got an interesting idea.

1118
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Naturally.

1119
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,760
And by interesting I mean very stupid.

1120
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
Terrible.

1121
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,760
Yeah.

1122
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,520
So stupid that Alex has to end the conversation by saying, I don't speculate.

1123
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
No.

1124
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,760
Let's talk to Andrew in North Carolina, Andrew you're on the air, welcome.

1125
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,760
Hi Alex, how you doing?

1126
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,760
Good sir.

1127
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,640
I had an idea, I don't know if you'd support me on it, the idea popped in my head a while

1128
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,600
back while I was tying down a little glass.

1129
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:23,840
Anyway, the idea was how much of a coincidence that a little girl gets kidnapped in Utah

1130
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,040
and just so happens that her last name is Smart.

1131
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,440
And the fact that there's a Smart Chip out there and now her parents and Amber's parents

1132
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,880
have signed the Amber Alert Bill, which turns over all radio, TV, billboards to FEMA and

1133
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,920
they're now flashing report terrorist, report guns.

1134
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,800
And then it turns out that she's related to a Congressman and all this other stuff.

1135
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,320
And then there's some weird freak weather.

1136
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,240
And yeah, the whole thing stinks to high heaven, but I don't know, sir.

1137
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
I don't speculate.

1138
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,640
You were just speculating.

1139
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,640
Wow.

1140
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,520
Hey, listen, I'm going to take your wild, insane speculation and I'm going to speculate

1141
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,960
on that, but listen, I don't speculate.

1142
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,800
I'm going to rattle off things that are meant to give justification to speculation, but

1143
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,900
man, I do not speculate about whether or not the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping was an elaborate

1144
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,040
globalist plot to put chips in everybody.

1145
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,840
I would never speculate on that.

1146
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,560
I mean, obviously that plan is in play and they could do it at any point in time.

1147
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,560
And you know what?

1148
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,800
I was told there were going to be Silicon chips, turns out they're going to be made

1149
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
of Amber.

1150
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800
Yeah, exactly.

1151
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Amber.

1152
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Smart chips.

1153
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Fine.

1154
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Fine.

1155
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,800
Yeah.

1156
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,680
I think that's the type of theory if somebody comes at you with, you just have to roll up

1157
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,720
a newspaper and be like, no, bad.

1158
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:49,400
I think that I would love to just like, God, my dream job at Info Wars just keeps changing.

1159
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,280
Now it's, I want a clip of Alex saying, I don't speculate.

1160
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,760
And then every time you start speculating, it's going to hit a button.

1161
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1162
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
I don't speculate.

1163
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
The big red button.

1164
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,760
Boom.

1165
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,760
Uh oh.

1166
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,760
Stop it.

1167
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
It's just a repeat until the speculation ends.

1168
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
Yeah.

1169
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,640
So 9-11 was proven by Alex to have been carried out by people who can't remember who they

1170
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,640
are though.

1171
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,640
That was in the past.

1172
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
Yep.

1173
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:19,640
But there are some signs, there's some telltale signs of how you know that the man was behind

1174
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
it.

1175
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Sure.

1176
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:28,560
Why else would they have the Chicago Mercantile exchange on 9-1-1, the one year anniversary

1177
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,320
come up 9-1-1 point zero zero zero zero zero zero.

1178
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,320
What?

1179
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,680
I saw the article that said 9-1-1 point zero.

1180
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,720
I went and looked up on the Chicago Mercantile, the close of that day.

1181
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,160
The zeros went on basically forever.

1182
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,160
That's never happened.

1183
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,160
That's impossible.

1184
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,720
But what you're thinking, that was just a fluke.

1185
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,240
Oh, it came up 9-1-1 at the New York Lottery on 9-1-1, one year anniversary.

1186
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,240
Just their little mark.

1187
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,280
Hey, we control the lotteries, we control the exchanges, the speculation exchanges,

1188
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,120
down to the point they close it.

1189
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,200
So I'm not sure that they, I believe this, it sounds like an urban legend kind of situation.

1190
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,200
It does.

1191
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,200
It does.

1192
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,800
For one thing, according to the CME website, which is the name of the Chicago Mercantile

1193
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,600
exchange when they're listed as a publicly traded entity, the CME group, they didn't

1194
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,700
go public until December 5th, 2002, when they had their initial public offering of stock.

1195
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:27,360
They wouldn't have even been a stock price for CME on September 11th, 2002, since it

1196
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,360
wasn't traded.

1197
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,560
Oh, that was a real sneaky move by the globalists.

1198
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,880
Yeah, I don't know what he's referring to.

1199
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,760
They really nailed it.

1200
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,760
I don't know.

1201
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,600
I think he might have seen a meme or something.

1202
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,360
This level of bullshit might as well, oh, okay, okay.

1203
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,840
Did you see that George W. Bush has been complimenting people a lot lately?

1204
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
Yes.

1205
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
Another word for that is lauding.

1206
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
Do you see what I'm saying?

1207
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Oh shit.

1208
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,200
So, and he's been doing it repeatedly over time, so you could say he's been lauding people.

1209
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,400
Oh shit.

1210
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,500
What does that mean?

1211
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
We nailed it.

1212
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,500
It means something.

1213
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,500
He is been lauding.

1214
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,480
So people have looked into the lottery thing, and that one actually is true, but it doesn't

1215
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,000
actually mean anything.

1216
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,600
The state lottery in New York does, they pick two, pick three winners each day.

1217
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,600
The numbers.

1218
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,600
Sure, sure.

1219
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,600
The sets of three numbers.

1220
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Yeah, yeah.

1221
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,580
And the other combination coming up is one in a thousand.

1222
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:24,560
Because there are two drawings, the odds of 911 hitting on any given day are one in 500,

1223
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,880
which really, it's an interesting coincidence, but it's far from proof that the globalists

1224
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,320
did it to show that they control lotto numbers.

1225
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:38,040
Yeah, it's fun, but you might as well use that as also like, oh, I had to call 911 that

1226
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,040
day.

1227
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,040
It's a miracle.

1228
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,040
Sure.

1229
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1230
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,060
It's just weird how much of Alex's supposed proof of things relies on just denying that

1231
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,560
coincidences exist.

1232
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,560
Yeah.

1233
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Well, they don't.

1234
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,920
It's a little annoying.

1235
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,920
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

1236
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,560
Because there's no real way to argue that.

1237
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,080
You could be like, well, the statistical odds of that coming up are not really that insane,

1238
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,440
and I don't know what you're talking about with the mercantile exchange.

1239
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,440
Sure, yeah.

1240
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,800
But yeah, all right, go off.

1241
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,240
Anyway, Alex is talking to this caller, and they got into an argument, this caller and

1242
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,920
someone in their life, because they didn't agree on the Federal Reserve.

1243
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,920
Sure.

1244
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,920
Right?

1245
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
Well, who can?

1246
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,160
Well, there was an interesting theory about what was going on there.

1247
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,120
You guys were having a boring conversation?

1248
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,120
You bet.

1249
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,120
They don't need any facts.

1250
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,760
They just need to feel good.

1251
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,760
Exactly.

1252
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,920
Yes, and the conversation I had, I was basically being yelled at and told.

1253
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,800
I tried to tell this guy, you know, because it went in so many different directions at

1254
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,800
one time.

1255
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,000
I was telling him, you know, your income tax monies go to the IMS and Federal Reserve and

1256
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,560
so on and so forth, and no, no, they don't, no, they don't, you know, it's just a loud

1257
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,480
vehement denial makes it true.

1258
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,480
And uh...

1259
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,840
Now, wait a minute, though, if he didn't have some problems subconsciously, the subconscious

1260
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,840
is much more powerful.

1261
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
What is happening?

1262
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,760
It's a powerful processor, God gave us, it knows the truth, whereas the conscious doesn't.

1263
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,760
Don't do this.

1264
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,480
This guy, if he'd laugh at you if it wasn't serious, you know, me thinks they protest

1265
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,480
too much.

1266
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,240
Why do they get so excited then?

1267
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,240
So I guess...

1268
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,560
Because you guys are the worst to talk to!

1269
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,920
I guess anyone arguing with you is an indication that you're right now.

1270
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,920
Yeah, exactly!

1271
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,360
Because if you're wrong, they'll just laugh at you.

1272
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,360
Somebody says no.

1273
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
What?

1274
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,360
Oh, God.

1275
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,360
Yeah.

1276
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Oh, man.

1277
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,360
That's outrageous.

1278
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,360
Yeah.

1279
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,800
So this guy, this caller, he was told by someone to just believe the news.

1280
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Sure, sure.

1281
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,200
And I bet that's not what this person said to them.

1282
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
It's doubtful.

1283
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,080
But Alex's response to it is so telling.

1284
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:46,360
I wanted to lay a quote on you from this guy.

1285
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,760
I believe in too many conspiracy theories, and you just gotta watch the news and believe

1286
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,760
it.

1287
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,760
That's what he told me.

1288
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,760
And he's a successful businessman.

1289
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,760
That's right, I'm successful, I'm important, I'm part of this power system.

1290
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:05,560
You just need to watch the news and believe it, and be part of it.

1291
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,160
I'm reporting you, you're with Al-Qaeda.

1292
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,160
Nazi Germany, Nazi Germany.

1293
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:18,320
So, I don't believe that this caller is reporting things accurately that his friend just said,

1294
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,720
watch the news and believe it.

1295
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,720
Kind of doubtful.

1296
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,080
But, you know, let's imagine that that's actually someone's position.

1297
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,080
Sure.

1298
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,840
That is a crippling level of naivete and lack of critical thinking that you're approaching

1299
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,840
information that's coming to you with, and I would be opposed to what this supposed person

1300
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,840
said.

1301
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,320
You know what, I would even argue that I would be above the left-right paradigm in saying

1302
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,760
that that is a bad way of consuming media.

1303
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,760
Sure.

1304
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,440
Now, Alex has a couple of options in terms of addressing the situation.

1305
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,680
You could say something like that, like, hey, your friend should engage more critically

1306
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,840
with the information that's coming to you, and you should as well.

1307
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Or he could have blanket defiance.

1308
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,560
I think that would be a better way to go.

1309
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,440
Which I think is just as stupid.

1310
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,200
I think it's just as stupid to mock the idea of ever listening to the news and being like,

1311
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,080
it's Nazi Germany.

1312
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,240
It's not, it's the pendulum swinging too far the other direction.

1313
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,240
And that's what he wants.

1314
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:16,120
Yeah, it doesn't matter how you get to consume whatever it is uncritically, whether it be

1315
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,880
eating it or denying it.

1316
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:26,200
Yeah, whether it's CNN or World Night Daily, like, he wants them to accept World Night

1317
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Daily uncritically.

1318
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Sure.

1319
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,200
Yeah, yeah.

1320
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Of course.

1321
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,200
And hostility towards things that are saying the other.

1322
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,640
Well, you can trust them, and you can't trust anybody else, because it's Nazi Germany day.

1323
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
Sure, sure.

1324
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,640
Yeah.

1325
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,620
It's not a bad path, and I would say that he's not setting up his listeners for success.

1326
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:47,440
It's a strategy that won't get you into a better engagement with information.

1327
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,560
It'll just make you believe something else.

1328
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,960
You'll be tricked by something else.

1329
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,760
It'll make you a captive to your information source, and then you'll be like, oh, I should

1330
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,080
give him money, because he's saving me from the rest of the evil media.

1331
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:05,160
And then all of a sudden you're going to start believing that he's the Messiah, actually

1332
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,400
fighting the literal devil.

1333
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,960
And then he will believe that.

1334
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,360
And then we're all out of control.

1335
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,200
So Alex is right about something in this episode.

1336
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,200
Interesting.

1337
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,320
He is right that it's stupid that people say that they would die for George Bush.

1338
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,920
I think that is stupid.

1339
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,760
Mike Hanson does some camera work for me.

1340
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,120
He got some video that I just finally saw this week.

1341
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,120
He's had it for a month.

1342
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,080
They were having the pro-war Bush rallies downtown in Austin.

1343
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,080
They had like 30 people there.

1344
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,080
Mike walks up.

1345
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,080
I wasn't there.

1346
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,680
I was with one other person and says, hey, why are you for the war?

1347
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,320
And the guy just screams, Mike Hanson, you're with Alex Jones.

1348
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:48,600
I will, and he bleep, bleep, you're, you're hined in if you don't say you're for George

1349
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,480
Bush and started threatening to assault Mike.

1350
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,480
This is on tape.

1351
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,320
And Mike goes, hey, you're on camera.

1352
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,640
And he goes, and Mike goes, wait a minute.

1353
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,080
So what do you think of George Bush?

1354
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,520
I'll die for him, I'll die for him, I'll die for him, I'll die for him, I'll die for him.

1355
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,000
I was like a Iraqi just screaming they love the leader because the media said so.

1356
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,600
And, you know, they're mindless slaves of the media and the neocons are controlling

1357
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
them.

1358
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,800
Jump into a time machine with me, Jordan.

1359
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,800
Come to the present.

1360
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,800
Yeah.

1361
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:19,320
They can put a gun to my head and say, if you don't come out and say you hate Trump,

1362
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,720
we're going to blow your brains out.

1363
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,040
And I'd say, pull the trigger.

1364
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,680
Okay, Alex, calm down.

1365
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,680
Yeah.

1366
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,320
Also, I love how dainty he's being.

1367
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,000
This man was threatening to fight me.

1368
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,600
He's threatening my camera man.

1369
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:35,760
He came up to me and he used curse words and he said that he would hurt me physically.

1370
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,960
I can't repeat these things because it's a family show and I actually kind of mean it

1371
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,960
back at this point.

1372
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,960
Yeah, exactly.

1373
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1374
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
God.

1375
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,960
What a dick.

1376
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,440
So Alex has another caller and this guy, he had a similar vibe to me as that, that one

1377
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,520
caller who was like, it's 8 a.m. in China, time to get up.

1378
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,520
Gotta drive to work.

1379
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,520
Alright, alright.

1380
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,520
That guy.

1381
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,520
He's got a, he's got a Matthew McConaughey kind of vibe to him.

1382
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,080
It's not the same vibe, but this was a caller who was like, I want to listen to you talk

1383
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,080
some more.

1384
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,080
Alright.

1385
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,080
In the same way.

1386
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
Larry, you're on the air.

1387
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,080
Go ahead.

1388
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,080
Hey Alex, good day.

1389
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,080
How you doing?

1390
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,920
Did you hear Jeanette Hanson this morning on the Peacock Channel?

1391
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,040
Well, they call it the Peacock Channel, but if you strip his wings off, sure looks like

1392
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,120
an oblique view of a horned owl to me.

1393
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,120
Get him!

1394
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,120
I love it.

1395
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:26,120
Who the fuck are you, man?

1396
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,120
That is great.

1397
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:33,120
I just imagine that guy writing that out while he's on hold.

1398
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,040
I was gonna say, that's not a turn of phrase that one just pops into mind.

1399
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,800
Oh, the Peacock Network, it looks like an oblique horned owl to me.

1400
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,600
That's well practiced, sir.

1401
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:48,400
Yeah, that was, that's either a mirror or a thing you have said to a lot of people to

1402
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,400
bore them.

1403
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,800
Yeah, I wish his call was more interesting, but I did enjoy that.

1404
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,800
That is nice.

1405
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,800
He came out swinging.

1406
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,800
Yeah.

1407
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,800
Ah, that's good.

1408
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,720
He gets to talking about a story that his cousin told him, and I don't know if this

1409
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,720
is Buckley.

1410
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,720
I don't think it is.

1411
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
It could be any cousin.

1412
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,920
Yeah, it must be another cousin.

1413
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,160
And unfortunately, all, well, you'll see.

1414
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,160
Okay.

1415
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,960
My cousin, two Mondays ago, was sitting in my living room, been in the Army for 20 years.

1416
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
He's an officer.

1417
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,880
They were given a briefing this year.

1418
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:25,840
They're all getting microchips, the entire armed services.

1419
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,680
And then it goes into the general public, and they're telling them brace for more terror,

1420
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,480
we'll have to give up all our rights, the Army's gonna run our lives, but the border

1421
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,680
will stay wide open.

1422
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,640
Okay, so 18 years later, the military isn't all chipped, right?

1423
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,040
They are all chipped.

1424
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
Ooh.

1425
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,040
Yes.

1426
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,040
So Alex was right about this?

1427
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,040
Or was he wrong about this?

1428
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,040
No, 100%.

1429
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,920
Every single military member is chipped upon introduction.

1430
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
Uh-huh.

1431
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1432
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,280
You know those guys, the recruiters at your high school?

1433
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,280
Yeah.

1434
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,520
And when they shake their hand, they are implanting you with a computer.

1435
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,520
They have one of those little assassin's blades?

1436
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,520
Exactly, yeah, yeah.

1437
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,960
No, it's like a clown buzzer, you know?

1438
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,120
But you get it, and they're like, ha ha, wasn't that a funny joke?

1439
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,640
And then they stare deep into your eyes and program you.

1440
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,640
Right, right.

1441
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,400
And then, to get you out of your trance, a flower on their lapel squirts you with water.

1442
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
Yes, it squirts you in the...

1443
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Yeah, yeah.

1444
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,400
That's how you wake up.

1445
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,400
Yeah, yeah.

1446
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,400
And then, naturally, they slip on a banana peel, walking away from you.

1447
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,400
Of course.

1448
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
So everybody's getting chipped.

1449
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
Uh-huh.

1450
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,400
They're all getting this one to come around.

1451
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
Right.

1452
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,800
But this caller has verified Alex's story, because they have also heard that a military

1453
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,780
friend of theirs is talking about how everyone's getting chipped.

1454
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,840
Military friends are popular these days.

1455
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:40,920
And Larry in Louisiana was saying he just talked to an E-8 that got back from North

1456
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,120
Korea who said they're all getting their chipped, got the same briefing.

1457
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:49,280
You know, that's Twilight Zone, folks, but you're not patriotic if you're against it.

1458
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,160
Let me tell you what the tactic's gonna be.

1459
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,140
The globalists are gonna blow stuff up and claim that anti-chipping, anti-biometric groups

1460
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,320
are doing it.

1461
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:02,160
And so if you're anti-chip, anti-world leader, you're with the terrorists.

1462
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,360
Larry, you can see the script, can't you?

1463
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,360
Yes, I see it exactly.

1464
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:11,480
So, I mean, this is what I'm talking about when I say that this is just interactive improvisational

1465
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,480
storytelling.

1466
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,480
Yeah.

1467
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,000
Alex is just coming up with a story for them to get excited about on this day.

1468
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,080
Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about.

1469
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,400
Now, the globalists are scripting this stuff, so that's how I can predict it.

1470
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,920
I know that this is what's gonna happen, they're gonna blow up stuff and blame it on the anti-chip

1471
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,920
people.

1472
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,920
Naturally.

1473
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
Okay.

1474
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,920
Yeah.

1475
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,920
Yep.

1476
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,920
Anti-chip people.

1477
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,920
Now, here's what's interesting.

1478
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,920
What's interesting?

1479
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
I think I would be opposed to mandatory chips.

1480
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,920
Oh, yeah.

1481
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:41,000
I haven't given it enough thought to really have a strong position on it, let's say, but

1482
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,400
whatever direction I would fall on it after giving it some thought, I'd have a pretty

1483
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,760
coherent position on it.

1484
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,760
Yeah.

1485
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,160
I would want a couple of assurances like mind control.

1486
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
First question.

1487
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,160
Are you gonna mind control me?

1488
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,160
Right?

1489
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,160
You can't ask that.

1490
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,160
I've gotta ask that.

1491
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,160
What else would I ask?

1492
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,640
Well, I mean, obviously the answer is gonna be no, even if it's yes.

1493
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,680
Yeah, but I gotta look them in the eyes.

1494
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Right.

1495
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,680
I'll know if they're lying to me.

1496
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
They're evil eyes.

1497
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,680
Exactly.

1498
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,560
You gotta look into the evil eye and then I can tell.

1499
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,560
Yeah, sure.

1500
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,560
Mind control, no good.

1501
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
Yeah, exactly.

1502
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
What else?

1503
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,560
No mind control.

1504
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,560
Electroshocks, no good.

1505
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,840
No, I think I'd be fine with a little electroshock here and there, you know, but as long as it's

1506
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,600
not somebody doing something, doing it for weird reasons.

1507
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,880
Ooh, I think you're going to have to really litigate what's weird.

1508
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,360
Well, again, we're going to sit here.

1509
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,360
We're going to talk about it.

1510
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,660
I'm going to look them in their evil eyes and we're going to hammer it out.

1511
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,760
Our next bonus episode can be going over the conditions under which you approve of chips.

1512
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,760
Yes, exactly.

1513
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,760
Well, I'll have a full-

1514
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,600
We'll really work this out.

1515
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,280
Right out of contract.

1516
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,840
But for Alex, he's supposed to be totally against it.

1517
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
Yes.

1518
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,160
He thinks that it's like the mark of beast stuff.

1519
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,960
It's the mark of the beast.

1520
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,800
Unfortunately, he's inconsistent as hell.

1521
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:58,480
To be in the army, they want someone who will take a microchip.

1522
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,000
I mean, I am some weird one, you know, you can see special forces getting one, but no,

1523
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,960
the entire troops all for their identification, no, no, this is setting the precedent.

1524
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,920
Wait, so, but why wouldn't special forces getting it be setting a precedent?

1525
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,880
Well, you got to mind control special forces, Dan.

1526
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,880
But you understand, this is silly.

1527
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,880
This is nonsense.

1528
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,680
I am staunchly opposed to giving microchips to people in the military unless they're in

1529
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,680
special forces.

1530
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,680
Yeah.

1531
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,520
Well, I mean, obviously you want Green Berets to have computer chips.

1532
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,200
That's just, that just makes perfect sense.

1533
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,480
I don't understand why.

1534
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:39,080
I don't get what the relevant differences between people in special forces, if the argument

1535
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,880
is that Alex is trying to make, which is a big part of it, which is they give it to the

1536
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,880
military.

1537
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,880
That normalizes it.

1538
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,000
So then it becomes something that goes to the citizens.

1539
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Right.

1540
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,640
Now you could just take one step further and be like, they give it to special forces.

1541
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,400
That normalizes it for the military and that normalizes it for the population.

1542
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
No, no, no.

1543
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,360
Slippery slopes only work if you start where I say this top is.

1544
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,600
It doesn't make sense.

1545
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,800
No, no, no, no.

1546
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,360
Just cause we're starting in the middle of the slippery slope, meaning that we've already

1547
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,000
had to go from somewhere to get here.

1548
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,400
This is pretty dumb.

1549
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,400
Yeah.

1550
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:12,000
So 2003 was a very different time in the anti vaccination community.

1551
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Oh, that's good.

1552
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
No, it wasn't.

1553
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
No, I didn't think so.

1554
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
It wasn't great then either.

1555
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
No, I doubted it.

1556
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:24,280
So some of these ideas about autism links with vaccination and like mercury and the

1557
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:30,240
preservatives and stuff, it was a little bit less uniform in the anti-vax community.

1558
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:35,920
They hadn't had a lot of the other, let's say maybe even stupider ideas shot down.

1559
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,920
Right.

1560
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,920
Right.

1561
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,920
Was this...

1562
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:39,920
Jenny McCarthy was...

1563
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,240
I'm not positive about her timeline.

1564
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,240
Yeah.

1565
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,240
I don't know that either.

1566
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:52,160
I'm not sure, but I do know that at this point there are anti-vax proponents who are making

1567
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:58,240
the argument that mercury in the preservatives has a link to autism.

1568
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,240
Sure.

1569
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,240
Sure.

1570
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,160
Now at this point, Alex doesn't think that.

1571
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,160
Alex is trying to stake a claim on something weirder in anti vaccination.

1572
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,160
All right.

1573
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,160
Okay.

1574
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,160
That he will not stand by today, I don't think.

1575
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,160
Okay.

1576
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,160
Okay.

1577
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,680
Boy believes a mercury-based preservative added to the vaccines during the 90s may have

1578
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,680
caused the autism.

1579
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,680
Uh-uh.

1580
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,960
That's the cover story.

1581
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:27,720
It's the hormone designed in a brain development hormone to attack cerebral cortex development.

1582
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:34,320
Most of you just get an IQ reduction, people that compromise immune systems get severely

1583
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,560
retarded or autistic.

1584
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,600
Little gift from your government.

1585
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,360
So Alex doesn't say what this hormone is, and I'm not sure.

1586
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,280
I'm not going to go on a wild goose chase and then just assume that I found whatever

1587
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,280
he's talking about.

1588
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,000
But if he does get into this, we'll talk about it in greater depth.

1589
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,040
But yeah, so the argument is being put forth to him that there is mercury in the vaccines

1590
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,080
and stuff.

1591
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,320
That is pretty close to his current position on anti vaccination.

1592
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,320
Right.

1593
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,320
Right, right, right.

1594
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,960
That is safe territory for him now.

1595
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,960
Sure.

1596
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,280
But back then, he didn't have that.

1597
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,840
He wanted another, he wanted his own version of this.

1598
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,520
Yeah, he had to jump it up.

1599
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,400
It wasn't just mercury, which is a natural occurring, it's a naturally occurring element.

1600
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,520
You can drink gallons of that stuff, they're fucking with you.

1601
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1602
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:28,200
No, what it is, is they grow hormones in labs for brains to then put in there and that's

1603
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,200
what does it.

1604
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,980
Yeah, I think that's interesting.

1605
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,080
I would like to know what he feels about this now.

1606
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,080
That would be interesting.

1607
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:39,360
He believes that there's some weird hormone that's actually behind, and I wonder if he'd

1608
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,920
like to interview some of his weird anti-vax friends about that.

1609
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,920
Oh, that would be interesting.

1610
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,920
See if they stand by that nonsense.

1611
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,520
Yeah, what do you got?

1612
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,520
So Alex gets a caller.

1613
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,960
This made me so happy.

1614
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,280
God damn, did this make me happy.

1615
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,640
Was this back when Young Man House Phone was around?

1616
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,640
No.

1617
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,640
Oh.

1618
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,420
This caller is the same person who called and Alex argued with him about the Republic

1619
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:02,420
of Texas.

1620
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,420
Okay, okay.

1621
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:06,000
And Alex is clearly annoyed with this guy.

1622
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Sure.

1623
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,360
And you don't really get, like, it doesn't become clear that Alex knows who he's talking

1624
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,480
to until the end of this clip.

1625
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,200
And that's when it just, this is great.

1626
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,200
This is just so good.

1627
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
All right.

1628
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,920
Later on when this crap goes down, this bad stuff goes down, we need these people on our

1629
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:24,920
side.

1630
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,080
So just real quick as a sort of introduction, this caller has said that he took one of Alex's

1631
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,800
films to the Aspen Sheriff's Department and he woke up the sheriff and everybody on the

1632
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,800
force.

1633
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,800
And so, like, now Aspen-

1634
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,720
That really does sound like it happens, though, doesn't it?

1635
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
I don't think so.

1636
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,040
It feels like that's how they get-

1637
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,120
I think it might happen where someone is like, hey, did you watch that DVD?

1638
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
Blew my mind, man.

1639
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,120
Real good.

1640
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,120
Yeah, it killed it.

1641
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,120
It was great.

1642
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,120
Gotta go.

1643
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,120
So anyway, that's what the beginning of this call is.

1644
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,120
Well, we do.

1645
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,120
I mean, I have nothing against police.

1646
01:11:53,120 --> 01:12:00,920
Standing with a constitutionalist and standing against the New World Order and the deception,

1647
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,400
the lies, and the fraud.

1648
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,720
I heartily agree with you.

1649
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,800
What you did was just so- is this Aspen, Texas, or Aspen, Colorado?

1650
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,520
It's Aspen, the Republic of Texas.

1651
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,440
They call it Colorado, but it still belongs to the Republic of Texas.

1652
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,440
No, I understand.

1653
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,440
But-

1654
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,440
The Northwest Territory.

1655
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,440
So where is this in Texas?

1656
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,720
This is up in the Rocky Mountain.

1657
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,080
Yeah, that's what I said.

1658
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,520
Is this in Texas, or is this in Colorado?

1659
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,360
Well, they call it Colorado, but-

1660
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,360
I understand, sir, but-

1661
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,360
It belongs-

1662
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,360
Okay.

1663
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,360
Okay, Alex?

1664
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,360
No?

1665
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,360
Okay.

1666
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,360
I know.

1667
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,640
I think he called about this earlier a few days ago.

1668
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,520
He did.

1669
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,360
I like the thread that's going through these episodes that I'm getting to enjoy where Alex

1670
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,720
is pissed off by Republic of Texas people.

1671
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,720
It is nice.

1672
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,720
It is nice.

1673
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,680
I do appreciate that.

1674
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,000
Because he has this whole thing that's like, Texas is its own country, it gets a seed.

1675
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,400
But these other people are like, yeah, Texas is a country, and it involves a bunch of place

1676
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,400
to the north.

1677
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,400
Yes, I do.

1678
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,400
I do.

1679
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,600
We got most of New Mexico, Colorado.

1680
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,960
I don't appreciate how that community is still allowed to have people that are too far out

1681
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,960
there.

1682
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,960
Y'all are crazy.

1683
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,960
Don't judge them for being like, and also the Northwest Territory is ours too.

1684
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:19,300
You are mad because your ideas look just as ridiculous as theirs, and theirs make you

1685
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,440
feel ridiculous.

1686
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,440
Yeah.

1687
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,600
I think that is a part of it, and I think that something that I really enjoy is Alex's

1688
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,000
ability to sort of play with the guy back then.

1689
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah, that's true.

1690
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,120
Like, Alex could not do that now.

1691
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,120
No.

1692
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,480
The idea of him sitting there and being like, is that Aspen, Texas, or Aspen, Colorado?

1693
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:42,920
Yeah, him doubling down on like, hey man, just go ahead and say exactly what you and

1694
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,560
I both know you're about to say.

1695
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,320
I recognize your voice.

1696
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,160
You know that you're the guy who pisses me off about the Republic of Texas.

1697
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,160
Yep, yep.

1698
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,880
I know, I'm gonna ask you this leaded question.

1699
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:59,320
Hey buddy, hey buddy, Aspen, I know, I've heard a name of Aspen before, and is that

1700
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,840
a city in Colorado, buddy?

1701
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,840
Nope, Texas.

1702
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
No, Texas.

1703
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:10,600
So we get another caller, and this fella is really lauding Alex, been lauding him.

1704
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Nice.

1705
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,000
About opposition to the Patriot Act.

1706
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Yes.

1707
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,200
There have been some places that have passed resolutions, some cities, city councils, and

1708
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,200
what have you.

1709
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:26,880
If you listen closely to this clip, though, this caller is congratulating Alex for doing

1710
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,520
something that he himself is literally saying was done by communists.

1711
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:39,120
Well, the Democrat socialist, Steve Leal, the resolution's primary sponsor on the city

1712
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:44,480
council, said if the EPA were talking about lessening water's quality standards, we'd

1713
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,320
think it was a city issue, but if they're polluting our rights, it is also a city issue.

1714
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,360
So this guy, you know, you did some good, and I wanted to commend you on it, and they

1715
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:59,040
got your resolution, because I know at least a dozen people that send your resolution to

1716
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,800
the city council and also to the county.

1717
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,340
And so you got some positive results, and we want to thank you for it, and I'm really

1718
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:11,720
proud that my communist city government decided to support the Constitution of the United

1719
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,720
States.

1720
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,840
Oh, isn't that cute?

1721
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:20,680
He's calling these people super-left socialists who wrote the resolution.

1722
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,680
You can't do that.

1723
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,880
And the communist government passed it, but somehow Alex is responsible for this.

1724
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,520
It's outrageous.

1725
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,000
This is kind of amazing.

1726
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
You know what?

1727
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I get it.

1728
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I get it.

1729
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,360
Every time something good happens, it's because of the left ideas, but you can't just allow

1730
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
them.

1731
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:48,000
What's done by actual activists, primarily on the left, is sometimes yelled about and

1732
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,680
taken credit for by people who yell, like Alex.

1733
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,680
Yeah.

1734
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,680
I mean, that's all he does.

1735
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:53,680
He just yells.

1736
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1737
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:59,360
No, once something becomes popular, then it's the conservatives who did it, like, oh, man,

1738
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,800
Social Security, Medicare, we can't let that stuff get out of hand.

1739
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:08,380
I mean, naturally, when it was being passed, we would have called it a communist land grab

1740
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,840
trying to kill us all and steal our money.

1741
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,480
But now that it has, now that we have it and it works, wow, it's our favorite program.

1742
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,480
Yeah.

1743
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,480
Yep.

1744
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,480
There is that phenomenon.

1745
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,480
Yep.

1746
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:23,280
So Alex, towards the end of this episode, gets a little bit into his own head, and he's talking

1747
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:28,840
a bit about how, like, people ask him why he's not dead, fighting the globalists, and

1748
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
what have you.

1749
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,400
And he talks about being ready to die for freedom.

1750
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:38,560
I mean, if they put a gun to my head right now and said renounce freedom, renounce your

1751
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,520
family, renounce God, or we'll kill you, I'd say pull the trigger, bud.

1752
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,920
I mean, I would.

1753
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,800
Go ahead.

1754
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,840
It's remarkable how that's almost exactly mirrored by if someone had a gun to my head

1755
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,120
and told me to denounce Trump, I'd say pull the trigger.

1756
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,120
Yeah.

1757
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:01,160
Freedom, God, family, all that, just sort of Trump.

1758
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
Oh, boy.

1759
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,320
It's kind of depressing.

1760
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,440
It's super depressing.

1761
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:11,200
So we have one last clip, Jordan, and in this clip, Alex is in a bit of a rant about being

1762
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,200
alive.

1763
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,200
Right.

1764
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,200
And he has felt things.

1765
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,120
I suppose that I will accept that as a premise.

1766
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,200
And I think that this is getting a little bit closer to that territory of religiosity

1767
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,360
that we might be keeping our finger on the pulse of.

1768
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,360
That sounds right.

1769
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:34,360
If you don't know how evil they are, if you aren't burning with desire to expose the New

1770
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,480
World Order, you're nuts.

1771
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:42,320
And if we just have this upfront, ready to sacrifice, ready to stand up attitude about

1772
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,640
defending America, this New World Order would not be here.

1773
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,180
We become fat and decadent and always about the next pleasure.

1774
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:50,560
And so we're dead on the inside.

1775
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,560
So you know what?

1776
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,040
I have really lived.

1777
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,160
I can say that I have lived.

1778
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:59,280
I have been so alive, it hurts, okay?

1779
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,680
I have had understandings that are painful.

1780
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,000
I have plumbed the depths of the New World Order.

1781
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,360
I can't even articulate it.

1782
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,000
And I know a lot of you have too.

1783
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,720
And you have perspectives that I don't have and a lot of you are smarter than I am.

1784
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,720
But I know this.

1785
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,860
I am on my course and I'll tell you this, we're a lot safer standing up and speaking

1786
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:24,360
out and being bold and depending on God's preservation, depending on God's providence

1787
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,580
and God is real.

1788
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:27,580
I have had experiences.

1789
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,680
I know God is real.

1790
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,960
I have faith.

1791
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,940
And God isn't on the 700 Club, folks, I'm sorry to tell you.

1792
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,200
God isn't in these big churches.

1793
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,200
I'm sorry.

1794
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,100
He's not, folks.

1795
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,200
God is in your heart if you simply let him in.

1796
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,560
And that's what we're talking about here.

1797
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,720
And I'm telling you, if you don't hate evil and are not disgusted by it, something is

1798
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:51,120
wrong with you and you are not alive.

1799
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,920
There is not even a question.

1800
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,800
Frankly, there is not even temptation anymore.

1801
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:01,280
When you go this far into the fight against the New World Order, it is a total commitment.

1802
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,760
You will be so alive.

1803
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,360
It will completely consume your life because you will be fighting pure evil.

1804
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,900
You must join in the fight against the New World Order.

1805
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:13,440
That's one of the things that I always love, the idea that Alex brings out that it's like,

1806
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,120
I no longer feel human emotions.

1807
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,120
Yeah.

1808
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,120
Yeah.

1809
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,120
I have no longer drawn to sin.

1810
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,720
I have progressed beyond that which other mortal men know.

1811
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,720
Because the fight on the globalist is so strong in the New World Order.

1812
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,720
I found that clip to be really on the line.

1813
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,720
Yeah.

1814
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:33,920
Because I do think an argument can still be made that a lot of that is, you know, it's

1815
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,920
just kind of Christian-ish.

1816
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,720
Yeah, I think that's-

1817
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,120
God's in your heart, he's not in the 700 Club.

1818
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,120
Sure.

1819
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,760
That's not as extremist, certainly, as a lot of the stuff we hear more recent days.

1820
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,760
Right.

1821
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:50,560
And when he says that you're up against pure evil, that could still be metaphorical flourish.

1822
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,560
Sure.

1823
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,560
As opposed to what we know he believes now.

1824
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,560
Naturally.

1825
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,560
No.

1826
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,560
That's what he believes.

1827
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,560
Yes.

1828
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,560
Invading people.

1829
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,560
Yes.

1830
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,560
Yeah.

1831
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,560
Yeah, that is true.

1832
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,200
I do think that should come out much sooner in a conversation and it should be something

1833
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,520
that you have to lead with.

1834
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:09,920
Like if you're doing Alex's show, you should have to lead with like, I believe that our

1835
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,520
political enemies are literally controlled by the devil like every day.

1836
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,520
Yeah.

1837
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,780
Just like if when I meet somebody, they're like, you should have to tell me if you believe

1838
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,880
that the biblical flood story is 100% true.

1839
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,880
And then I can be like, okay, fine.

1840
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,680
Then you don't get an opinion on vaccines.

1841
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,440
You know, like just get it out of the way so we can move forward.

1842
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,560
I don't need to know anything else about you.

1843
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:36,200
I think, I think it's more like a situation where, um, if, if you're gonna like, let's

1844
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,960
say start dating somebody or whatever, and they don't tell you that they think the earth

1845
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,960
is flat.

1846
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,960
Yeah.

1847
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,960
It's rude.

1848
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,960
That's kind of irresponsible.

1849
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,960
That's rude.

1850
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:50,320
And I, yeah, I think, I think that Alex as a person who's conveying information, I think

1851
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:56,400
it is, it is relevant if you believe that the devil is behind the gears of your enemies.

1852
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,440
I think you should be upfront about it because it gives people the ability to consider that

1853
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,960
in the totality of the information you're presenting and taking it more seriously.

1854
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,560
I honestly can't quite tell yet.

1855
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,560
Yeah.

1856
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,560
Um, no, I agree.

1857
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,520
I've heard, but there's more indications than I was expecting necessarily.

1858
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,360
And I think it's probably not coincidental that like this, God is real.

1859
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,360
God is there.

1860
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,360
Right.

1861
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,360
Is at the end of his episode.

1862
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,360
Right.

1863
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,360
Right.

1864
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,360
Right.

1865
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,360
I don't think that he would leave the episode with it.

1866
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,360
No, I would doubt that.

1867
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,720
I think that's there for the, the stalwarts, the people who are, who are in.

1868
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,720
Yeah.

1869
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:36,480
If you have a disclaimer for like a video game trailer, that's like, some scenes are

1870
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,440
not actual gameplay.

1871
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,720
You should at least have to have a disclaimer for like, also believes that the devil is

1872
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,720
real.

1873
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,720
You know, like that should be there.

1874
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,720
Yeah.

1875
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,720
Somewhere.

1876
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,360
I mean, his bumpers coming in from break are like, you know, like, do you want to fight

1877
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,360
corruption?

1878
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,360
Well, so does he.

1879
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,560
Like, that's not what this is about.

1880
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,560
No, no, no, no.

1881
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,560
Yeah.

1882
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,560
Yeah.

1883
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,240
Do you believe that you're a crusader against the literal Christian devil?

1884
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,240
That's this show.

1885
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,240
Yeah.

1886
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,240
Okay.

1887
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,240
Okay.

1888
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,240
All right.

1889
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,240
Well then now we get it.

1890
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,440
Do you think that demons jump into people and make them go bleh?

1891
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,440
Yes.

1892
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,440
Yes, I do, sir.

1893
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,440
I will listen.

1894
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,440
Well, so does Alex.

1895
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,440
Yes.

1896
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,440
There we go.

1897
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,440
Yeah.

1898
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:17,360
I mean, it's, uh, it's an interesting, it's an interesting progression and I'm fascinated

1899
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,240
by this and I, and this is so much more listenable, uh, in the past.

1900
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:26,560
Like it's totally, totally, it's, it's absolutely, and these callers are weirdos in a fun way.

1901
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,560
It seems like a show.

1902
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,560
Yeah.

1903
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,560
It seems like a show.

1904
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,560
Yeah.

1905
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,560
What we listen to now is not a show.

1906
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,560
That is just a man unraveling.

1907
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,680
Well, you know, too, like one of the things that's really fun and creates comedic tension

1908
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,400
in like Frasier is that some of the callers are annoying to him.

1909
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,400
Yes.

1910
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,400
Yeah, yeah.

1911
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,400
Of course.

1912
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,400
It's a fun show.

1913
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,400
There's this tension.

1914
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,400
You don't know what you're going to get.

1915
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,400
Yeah.

1916
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,240
It's this Republic of Texas person keeps annoying.

1917
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,240
That's so funny.

1918
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:54,700
And, uh, yeah, I enjoy that and, uh, I hope that every episode I listen to he gets into

1919
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,360
a fight with somebody who believes just slightly the wrong thing.

1920
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,360
Yeah.

1921
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,360
Yeah.

1922
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,360
Yeah.

1923
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,360
Just, oh man.

1924
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,260
It's so ridiculous that you think that the Magna Carta is still the law of the land

1925
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:09,360
unless you're in capital letters and it's a corporation.

1926
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:14,900
Now obviously the literal Christian devil is sending demons into people's brains to

1927
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,720
control their actions.

1928
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,720
Tell me.

1929
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,720
Sure.

1930
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,720
Yeah.

1931
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,720
Um, anyway.

1932
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,720
Yeah.

1933
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,600
Jordan, this has been a, an episode.

1934
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
Indeed it has.

1935
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:29,000
Uh, we will be back checking in on the present day, I believe on our next episode.

1936
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,060
But until then, we got a website.

1937
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,440
We do have a website, Dan.

1938
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,440
It's knowledgefight.com.

1939
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,180
We have a Twitter.

1940
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,840
We are on Twitter, Dan.

1941
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,680
It is at knowledge underscore fight and at go to bed.

1942
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
Jordan.

1943
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,680
Yep.

We're also on Facebook.

1945
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:44,680
We are on Facebook.

1946
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,880
And if you would like to download the show, please go to, and if you could please find

1947
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,120
a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work.

1948
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,120
Yeah.

1949
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,120
We'll be back.

1950
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,120
But until then, I'm Neo.

1951
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,120
I'm Leo.

1952
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,120
I'm DZX Clark.

I'm Daryl Rundis.

1954
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,880
I'm a peacock that looks like a horned owl.

1955
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,880
Andy in Kansas.

1956
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,880
You're on the air.

1957
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,880
Thanks for holding.

1958
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,880
Hello Alex.

1959
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,880

01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,880
