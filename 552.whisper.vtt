N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
Knowledgefight.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.360
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.360
I need, I need money.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.360
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.360
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.360
Stop it.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.360
Andy and Candace, Andy and Candace.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.360
It's time to pray.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.360
Andy and Candace, you're on the air.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.360
Thanks for holding.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.360
I'm a huge fan.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.360
I love your work.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.360
Knowledgefight.com.

00:44.360 --> 00:59.600
I love you.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.320
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.320
I'm Dan.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
I'm Jordan.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
We're a couple dudes.

01:04.320 --> 01:06.280
I like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.000
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Jordan.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Dan.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
What's up?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I have a quick question for you.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, what's up?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
What's happening?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
My question for you today is, stayin' humble.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Hashtag stayin' humble.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh boy.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh boy.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Look, I don't know a whole lot about classic rock.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Sure.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
And apparently I really stepped in it, I thought, I said that, so I'm playing with fire by the

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
doors.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Yes, many people have pointed that out.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, boy.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.840
I'll tell you what, a lot of backlash whenever you misstate something about music, and hey,

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
you know what?

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
That's on me.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
I don't know a whole lot.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.520
My parents were pretty restrictive with music growing up.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
That's true.

01:44.520 --> 01:48.080
As I've brought up in the past, my first album that I ever bought was Alanis Morissette's

01:48.080 --> 01:49.080
Shagged Little Pill.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
True, delicious.

01:50.080 --> 01:57.840
And my mom made me return it, because it was a bad influence, and I think probably everything

01:57.840 --> 02:01.240
by the Rolling Stones was a mysterious thing to me.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.040
I discovered some Beatles songs from Beatles Rock Band.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
I was gonna say.

02:07.040 --> 02:11.220
That's the kind of level of naivete I have about that stuff.

02:11.220 --> 02:16.240
If Alanis Morissette is a step too far, then I would imagine that the Rolling Stones' earlier

02:16.240 --> 02:19.000
work is off limits.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.960
My dad might be fucking around with Pete Seeger or something, you know?

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
That's where we're at.

02:25.960 --> 02:30.600
You know, I've always put your dad in the secret prog rock genre of just like somebody

02:30.600 --> 02:35.400
who when no one's around is like, time to listen to Yes, I'm gonna get in my favorite

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
chair.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.400
I think he might like Steely Dan.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
We'll have to talk about that.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.400
Sure, sure.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.040
As you can recall, his first concert was Blood, Sweat, and Tears.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.760
He did like Chicago and some of that horn rock.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.760
There was a time.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.800
But I think it was because he, I don't know, was he in the marching band?

02:49.800 --> 02:50.800
I can't remember.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.720
Anyway, my point is I'm sorry to everybody who I disappointed by my non-knowledge of

02:55.720 --> 02:56.720
songs.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.460
It's okay, it's okay.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.680
I will stand by my position that I don't like The Doors.

03:00.680 --> 03:05.440
You know, I actually went back and listened, and at no point did you claim the song was

03:05.440 --> 03:06.560
The Doors.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.240
It could very easily have been a completely disconnected thought.

03:09.240 --> 03:15.480
I was thinking about trying to play that game, but in the sake of sincerity and being above

03:15.480 --> 03:19.400
board, I have to admit that I did fuck that up.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.880
Anyway, Jordan, hashtag staying humble.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.160
I have a simultaneous bright spot in Darkstone.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.440
Dan, we had a lovely time.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.280
We got together and watched Mortal Kombat.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.080
Sponsored content.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
Fantastic time.

03:34.080 --> 03:38.680
And I have decided that it is the worst movie ever made.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.120
I don't think it's the worst movie ever made, but I was disappointed as hell.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
Yeah.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
No, not because of the movie itself.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.120
Oh.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.640
But, and this is how I'm thinking of it, all right?

03:48.640 --> 03:49.640
Godzilla versus Kong.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.160
Do you know what I got?

03:51.160 --> 03:54.640
I got Godzilla versus Kong.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.880
Right in the name, right in the movie.

03:55.880 --> 03:56.880
There it was.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.800
It promised and it delivered.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.920
And when I hear Mortal Kombat, I want a goddamn tournament, Dan.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.680
This was what I was screaming most of the movie.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.680
This was most of the movie.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.480
Where is this goddamn tournament?

04:07.480 --> 04:10.560
Yeah, and spoiler alert for Mortal Kombat, there's no tournament.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.560
It's not a spoiler.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.560
It is a warning.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.560
Yeah.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.680
And the thing that really bothers me is like, okay, I get it.

04:16.680 --> 04:20.880
Some of these movies are such that like maybe the tournament will be in the third movie

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
or whatever.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.880
Yeah.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.880
I think that's cheap.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.880
It's terrible.

04:24.880 --> 04:25.880
But whatever.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.880
Yeah.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.720
It's not fair that this movie opens up making a big deal about how the fate of Earth depends

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
on this tournament.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
On the tournament?

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
There is no tournament.

04:32.720 --> 04:33.720
No tournament.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.720
Infuriating.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
It is infuriating.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.400
We are going to lose that sponsorship money.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.200
I don't think we're going to keep it.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.280
I don't think we're going to keep it.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.200
The next MK12 video game will not be announced through us.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.760
It was still fun though.

04:48.760 --> 04:54.480
You know, I like the idea of getting overly excited for no reason, almost as a bit about

04:54.480 --> 04:55.480
a movie coming out.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.480
No, it was great.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.080
And it was fun to do that and to watch a movie that was new.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.080
It's been a very long time.

05:02.080 --> 05:05.040
We haven't watched a movie together in a long time.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.040
It's been forever.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.040
And this was your idea.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.200
You were like, we're watching Mortal Kombat.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.200
Not only my idea.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
I insisted.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.200
Yes, you did.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.200
Yes, you did.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.200
Yeah, it was great.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.200
It was a great time.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
Sure.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.200
Yeah, it's not a terrible movie.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.480
It's the worst movie ever made.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.480
Oh boy.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.480
Okay.

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
So Jordan, today we're back in the past.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.480
Okay.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
As promised.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
Good.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.040
We're in 2003, continuing our march through that time to see what we can learn.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:30.040 --> 05:34.560
I realized as I was listening to this, that one of the things that I obviously am the

05:34.560 --> 05:41.000
most interested in is seeing if that sort of bizarre Christian extremism exists within

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
him back then.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Sure.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
He thinks he's fighting the devil.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Right, right, right, right.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.800
That seems to be what I'm most interested in.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.800
Yes.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.880
Because if that's been going on for 18 years, someone should have, you know, taken care

05:51.880 --> 05:52.880
of it.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.880
Yes, yeah, yeah.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.360
We should have a societal understanding that this guy thinks he's the fucking Messiah.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.160
It has nothing to do with banking.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.160
Totally, totally.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.160
No, no, no, no.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.160
The Fed?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
Nuh-uh.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.160
It's fighting the devil.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.000
It's complete nonsense with a little thin veneer of political intrigue in order to trick

06:09.000 --> 06:13.480
people into thinking that what they're involved in isn't extremist religion.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.480
Exactly.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.480
So I was interested-

06:15.480 --> 06:19.520
And we've seen signs and there have been simmering tensions, slight little bits that if you were

06:19.520 --> 06:23.280
being ungenerous, perhaps you could put that in the holster.

06:23.280 --> 06:28.640
Yeah, so I'm interested to see what happens here on May 6th, see if we can find any more

06:28.640 --> 06:29.640
clues.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.640
Ooh, that's nice.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.640
And get a better picture of what's going on.

06:31.640 --> 06:32.640
Let's see what happens.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.640
First though, Jordan, we've got to give some shout-outs to some wonks.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.640
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.880
So first, Joanna, and then the message here is that Jordan needs to livestream some Chrono

06:39.880 --> 06:42.720
Trigger pretty please, you're now a policy wonk.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
I'm a policy wonk.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.160
Thank you very much!

06:45.160 --> 06:46.160
And that's a good idea.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
That's a great game.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
We've got a request for you to stream.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.160
That's a great game.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.160
Yeah.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.160
Yeah, also scream some Chrono Trigger.

06:51.160 --> 06:58.600
Next, if it's pronounced A-T-A-T, then TIE fighters are now T-I-E fighters.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.240
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.960
I'm a policy wonk.

07:01.960 --> 07:06.920
Thank you, but also, I don't want a flame war developing through this, this is not how

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
we do this.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
Simmering controversy.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.320
This is not how we do this.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.160
Ed H., thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.420
I'm a policy wonk.

07:14.420 --> 07:17.120
That's actually pronounced E-D-H, Dan.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
Thank you very much, Ed.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.320
And then, I'd like to give some shout-outs to some technocrats.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.760
First we got Joel C., thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

07:24.760 --> 07:30.160
Dan, I love you, but the Rolling Stones wrote Play with Fire, not The Fucking Doors.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.440
Thank you so much, you're now a technocrat.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.880
And Brian...

07:35.880 --> 07:36.880
You're now a technocrat.

07:36.880 --> 07:37.880
I'm a policy wonk.

07:37.880 --> 07:38.880
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.880
Have yourself a brew.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.880
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:42.880 --> 07:45.200
We gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.760
Let's just get down to business.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.840
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.760
Why you pimps so good?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.420
My neck is freakishly large.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.960
I declare info war on you.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.640
Thank you so much, Joel, the music scolder, and Brian Seltzer.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.320
Thank you very much to all of you.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.600
I think I'm gonna change my bright spot to just now you staying humble.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.680
Oh, you're great.

08:08.680 --> 08:09.680
Thanks.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.680
I love you.

08:10.680 --> 08:14.280
So, Jordan, today, like I said, we're in the past, here is an out of context drop from

08:14.280 --> 08:15.280
today's show.

08:15.280 --> 08:20.680
Yes, I'm a maniac, yes, I love freedom, thanks for putting up with me, folks, I, uh...

08:20.680 --> 08:24.640
So that's an out of context drop, you know, he's saying I'm a maniac, but he's not being

08:24.640 --> 08:25.640
a maniac.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.720
No, no, no, no, that's almost more terrifying of just somebody in a monotone, yes, I'm a

08:29.720 --> 08:30.720
maniac.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.120
No, but he hasn't been earlier in the episode before that, either.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.120
Oh, not at all?

08:34.120 --> 08:35.120
No.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.120
What?

08:36.120 --> 08:38.520
Yeah, like if you listen to present day shows, you'll be like, this guy is so subdued, and

08:38.520 --> 08:40.520
he's like, I'm sorry, I'm being crazy.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.520
No, you're not.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
Wow, that's interesting.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.760
This is the first serialized content we've got, where he's referencing the fact that

08:46.760 --> 08:49.000
he has been a maniac in the past.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.400
At least we're aware of the past in this time period.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.160
In the future, I will be so nuts that I have to apologize now.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.160
Yes, exactly.

08:56.160 --> 09:01.680
So he starts off the show, and I honestly think, I'm working on a theory, this is another

09:01.680 --> 09:06.080
thing I'm tracking as I'm going back to the past, and I think Joe Rogan might have ripped

09:06.080 --> 09:07.080
off Alex.

09:07.080 --> 09:13.280
All right, my friends, we have a powerful broadcast for you today.

09:13.280 --> 09:19.960
Just masses of vital information developing on the police state, on the thought crime

09:19.960 --> 09:23.280
front here in the home land.

09:23.280 --> 09:28.200
We also have Bechtel, that wicked organization, it's now coming out in the mainstream news

09:28.200 --> 09:31.240
that Bechtel is big with the bin Laden's.

09:31.240 --> 09:35.560
Well, of course, you don't build anything in the Middle East unless you are with the

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
CIA.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.600
And you became the bin Laden British intelligence family.

09:40.600 --> 09:45.320
So I think Rogan might have stolen calling his show powerful from Alex.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.600
This is 2003, this is before the Rogan experience started.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.600
Oh yeah, for sure.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.200
The powerful Joe Rogan experience.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.200
Powerful Rogan.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.800
Got a powerful broadcast here.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.920
Oh boy, I don't think so.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.680
So let's talk about the Bechtel group.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
Sure.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.200
So the story here that Alex is talking about, it begins with a piece by Jane Meyer in the

10:02.200 --> 10:05.920
New Yorker, where she covers a connection between the bin Laden family and the Bechtel

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
group.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.800
Quote, the global construction and engineering company to which the US government recently

10:10.800 --> 10:16.460
awarded its first major multimillion dollar contract to reconstruct war-ravaged Iraq.

10:16.460 --> 10:20.280
This was because the bin Laden family had invested about $10 million in a company called

10:20.280 --> 10:24.760
Fremont Group, which began as a subsidiary of Bechtel, but had been a separate entity

10:24.760 --> 10:26.800
since 1986.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.840
Some of the board members of Bechtel were also board members of Fremont, but they weren't

10:30.840 --> 10:35.000
connected businesses, so an investment in one isn't necessarily an investment in the

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
other.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.800
There's a lot of reasons to point fingers at Bechtel and suspect they're not above board

10:39.800 --> 10:44.560
in their dealings, but this tenuous connection to the bin Laden family is not one of them.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.440
Even if you connect them concretely to Fremont, then you still need to demonstrate how the

10:48.440 --> 10:52.880
money the bin Laden family invested in Fremont has any connections to the actions of Osama

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
bin Laden.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.880
Yeah.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.120
There's so much work that you still need to do to make this a sensible conspiracy, and

10:58.120 --> 11:02.840
all Alex is doing is just pointing at someone else's headline and then misconstruing it.

11:02.840 --> 11:08.580
I can't think of anything more like, oh, I heard that the Bechtel group was into some

11:08.580 --> 11:10.900
shit or I'd be like, oh yeah, of course they were.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.480
Most businesses commit financial crimes of some sort.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.200
I don't think they're financing terrorism.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.480
That's more expensive than just committing financial crimes.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.640
Well the conspiracy that they're sort of trying to dance around without explicitly saying

11:23.640 --> 11:27.900
it is like, so this Bechtel group, they do a lot of construction projects, multi-million

11:27.900 --> 11:29.880
dollar reconstruction projects.

11:29.880 --> 11:34.560
So Osama bin Laden, they built the twin towers and they were actually fake and they were

11:34.560 --> 11:38.200
made, and it was a small model that was, no, no, okay.

11:38.200 --> 11:43.760
It's that like the Osama bin Laden funding of this is related to causing the need for

11:43.760 --> 11:44.760
the construction.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
Sure, sure, sure.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.760
You have a closed loop of investment.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.760
I gotcha.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.760
I gotcha.

11:48.760 --> 11:49.760
I gotcha.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.700
That's sort of the conspiracy that's being hinted at without actually overtly saying

11:51.700 --> 11:54.040
because it's like, okay, no, hold on.

11:54.040 --> 11:58.600
If you were to actually assert that, people would be like, you can't prove any of this.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.600
That's outrageous.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.600
Yeah.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.640
But if you hint at it like Alex is doing, then you know, you can kind of get away with

12:04.640 --> 12:05.640
it.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.460
Pretend you've proven a case when you haven't done anything of the sort.

12:08.460 --> 12:09.600
Follow the money.

12:09.600 --> 12:14.120
There's a few million invested in a small company and that's terrorism.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.120
Okay.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.120
All right, fine.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.120
Yeah.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.120
Okay.

12:18.120 --> 12:23.200
So Alex is this guy who has always been right about everything and he's just like just waiting

12:23.200 --> 12:24.800
to be proven right all the time.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.800
All the time.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.080
Also, a passport will carry eye prints.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.680
We'll get to that.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.960
Even WorldNetDaily admits it.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.360
I wasn't going to cover it yesterday when the Toronto Star was saying it because I knew

12:34.360 --> 12:36.960
it would come out in other conservative publications.

12:36.960 --> 12:41.880
We like to go from it from that angle because we know how the liberals are.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.600
Turns out what we told you about a month ago was completely true.

12:45.600 --> 12:50.480
So it's interesting to see how clearly above the left-right paradigm Alex is back in 2003.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.480
Can't trust any liberals.

12:51.480 --> 12:56.600
No, totally seems like a guy who is consistent about how the left-right thing is just an

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
illusion.

12:57.600 --> 13:02.200
Unfortunately, he doesn't seem like a dishonest, manipulative, extremely right-wing asshole.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.000
The truth is that Alex does dislike the left and the right at this point in time.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
You can tell that.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.780
But it's important to recognize what his complaints are.

13:09.780 --> 13:12.040
He hates the left because he hates them.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.920
He hates the right because he doesn't feel like they're far enough to the right and that

13:14.920 --> 13:16.520
they're secretly on the left.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.520
Right.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.920
Also, 18 years later and our passports do not include eye prints.

13:19.920 --> 13:23.960
Chalk that one up in the column of things Alex has not always been right about.

13:23.960 --> 13:24.960
Yeah.

13:24.960 --> 13:31.160
So in this time period, Alex wants to hear George W. come out and be like, segregation

13:31.160 --> 13:38.680
now, segregation then, you know, and then he'd be well above the left-right paradigm.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
Certainly beyond it.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.680
Yes, yeah, yeah.

13:40.680 --> 13:45.680
So we have another echo of the past that certainly plays in the present day quite a bit and that

13:45.680 --> 13:51.160
is the idea that if you pay with cash somewhere, you're going to go to prison.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
Well, sure.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.720
So paying cash triggers alert for terrorism in the new world.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.240
This is out of the Virginia pilot.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.720
Paying cash anywhere is now a terrorist act.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.400
They'll be phasing it out soon.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.920
So that has not happened yet.

14:04.920 --> 14:09.560
I mean, didn't India phase out all the paper money?

14:09.560 --> 14:15.160
Didn't Narendra Modi just be like, one day he was just like, no paper money.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.400
I'm not sure if that's been a full and total phasing.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
Yeah, well.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.800
I know that during COVID, there's been a lesser use of money.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.800
Well, for sure.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.800
We still use paper money.

14:25.800 --> 14:26.800
We do still use paper money.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.800
Totally fine.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.640
I used it earlier to purchase the drink that I am enjoying right now.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.640
Yeah.

14:32.640 --> 14:38.160
I was kind of suspicious about this and it takes him until the end of the episode to

14:38.160 --> 14:41.160
actually talk about what this article is about.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.160
Well, sure, sure.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.120
So I'm just going to jump forward now so we can close this with.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.120
Okay.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.680
So we're doing this in what it sounds like a really poorly written attempt at humor,

14:49.680 --> 14:54.080
but also no, but also at like, like a editorial kind of thing.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.080
Sure.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.920
And here's basically what's going on, but a polite equivalent of your money's no good

14:58.920 --> 14:59.920
here.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.680
Arrived in the mail the other day in the form of a note from the Sachs department store

15:03.680 --> 15:04.840
folks.

15:04.840 --> 15:09.440
The only reason we have an account with them is that my wife once said she wanted to get

15:09.440 --> 15:17.920
some Sachs and I hardly agree, only to learn that as a mutant Midwesterner, I'd once again

15:17.920 --> 15:20.880
misinterpreted her soft Virginia accent.

15:20.880 --> 15:26.160
Those women in Virginia do have pretty voices, fine Southern ladies.

15:26.160 --> 15:32.960
Anyway, the note from Sachs said that henceforth, it would not accept cash as a form of payment

15:32.960 --> 15:35.860
on store accounts in any form over $300.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.560
So that's the story.

15:37.560 --> 15:43.000
Some guy was, he learned that at Sachs, they don't accept cash on things over $350.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.040
I'm so infuriated by that.

15:46.040 --> 15:50.160
And there's a little bit of a, that's how with sexy Alex's show used to get.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.320
That's so fucking annoying.

15:53.320 --> 16:01.400
I just can't imagine one opening something from Sachs in the mail that goes in the garbage.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
Sure.

16:02.400 --> 16:08.280
That's too caring if you can't buy something more than $350 with cash.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.280
That's fine.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.280
Yeah.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.280
That's totally fine.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.280
Sure.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.520
That's slightly annoying to people buying things more than $350.

16:16.520 --> 16:22.240
It's also, if I were someone who was running a store like that, I might be suspicious of

16:22.240 --> 16:24.600
someone paying a thousand dollars for something in cash.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
Yeah, of course.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
I might be.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
Of course.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
Why wouldn't you be?

16:28.600 --> 16:32.720
I mean, I wouldn't judge them too much, but I'd be like, this money might be dirty.

16:32.720 --> 16:37.080
No, I mean, if somebody walks up to you, they're like, Hey, I want to buy this car for 20,000

16:37.080 --> 16:40.560
cash and I don't want you to give my name, you would be at least a little suspicious.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.560
Yeah.

16:41.560 --> 16:42.560
There might be a reason.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.560
Right.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.760
So Alex gets to talking some more about the Bin Laden family.

16:46.760 --> 16:51.040
He does not cover this story about Bechdel in depth or anything, but he does ramble a

16:51.040 --> 16:54.320
bit about the Bin Laden, how he's CIA.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.200
I love the song, I love the song Ramble On.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.800
Do you know who did that?

16:58.800 --> 16:59.800
Doors.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
It was the doors.

17:01.800 --> 17:06.480
One would have to hide on the dark side of the moon to not know that Bin Laden is CIA,

17:06.480 --> 17:16.600
to not know that his family, it was set up by British intelligence over 70 years ago,

17:16.600 --> 17:20.920
that they carry out dangerous missions for the new world order all over the world.

17:20.920 --> 17:25.040
And that if you want to build anything in the middle East, you go one place, the Bin

17:25.040 --> 17:32.000
Laden, and that you're not allowed to build any type of military structure or pipeline

17:32.000 --> 17:39.120
anything unless you go through the CIA and Her Majesty's Al-Qaeda.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.680
That's a lot of stuff being said.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.080
It does seem like there's a lot going on there.

17:43.080 --> 17:47.360
Yeah, so there's this claim that Bin Laden is CIA, and you have to be on the moon to

17:47.360 --> 17:48.360
not know that.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.440
No, he's committing worldwide wet work as we speak.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.600
I would say that Alex can't prove this at all.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.600
Oh, you don't think so?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.920
You know, the most he could probably do is say that people have theorized, and some believe

17:57.920 --> 18:02.320
quite strongly, that Bin Laden received some training from the CIA back in the 1980s when

18:02.320 --> 18:06.120
Bin Laden and the Mujahideen were fighting against Soviet communists.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.420
You could even be pretty reasonable in assuming that some of that financial support from the

18:10.420 --> 18:15.560
US did find its way to Bin Laden and his fighters in that period as part of Operation Cyclone,

18:15.560 --> 18:19.120
aimed at fighting communism abroad with the help of proxy armies.

18:19.120 --> 18:23.340
A strong argument could be made that the formation of Al-Qaeda was at least partially the effect

18:23.340 --> 18:27.760
of blowback from these behaviors and operations.

18:27.760 --> 18:32.160
The thing is that one can accept all the conventionally understood history of Bin Laden and his connections

18:32.160 --> 18:37.400
to the US and the CIA and still recognize that the claims Alex is making are unfounded.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.920
Saying that stupid geopolitical decisions inspired by the anti-communist hysteria of

18:41.920 --> 18:46.120
the Reagan era led to unforeseen and severe consequences is not the same thing as saying

18:46.120 --> 18:49.200
that Osama Bin Laden was in the CIA.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.200
It's very different.

18:50.200 --> 18:57.240
Yeah, it's wild to me to go to like, Osama is still working for the CIA, instead of immediately

18:57.240 --> 19:03.520
assuming that the CIA made a stupid and short-sighted decision that is perfectly in line with literally

19:03.520 --> 19:06.200
every decision that the CIA has ever made.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.200
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty-

19:07.200 --> 19:08.200
It makes sense.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.920
There's narrative consistency there.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.920
Yeah.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.360
So the second claim that Alex is making in that clip is that there's no construction

19:13.360 --> 19:16.680
that happens in the Middle East without the involvement of the Bin Laden family, which

19:16.680 --> 19:17.680
is nuts.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.680
Why?

19:18.680 --> 19:19.680
How?

19:19.680 --> 19:22.960
Well, Saudi Arabia is the majority owner of the Bin Laden Group Global Holding Company,

19:22.960 --> 19:25.200
formerly known as Saudi Bin Laden Group.

19:25.200 --> 19:29.000
They do have interest in a lot of construction and some incredibly high-profile projects

19:29.000 --> 19:33.280
like the Jeddah Tower, but it's a little much to pretend that they run a complete racket

19:33.280 --> 19:35.360
of all these construction projects in the Middle East.

19:35.360 --> 19:39.320
I mean, he does not want to learn about sovereign wealth funds, I'll tell you that right now.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.800
A Forbes Middle East estimate recently put the total value of projects in the Saudi Arabian

19:43.800 --> 19:49.640
construction market at $1.2 trillion, and that's not even considering like 713 billion

19:49.640 --> 19:54.120
in UAE projects, 578 billion in Egypt.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.560
It's a fun story to tell that the Bin Laden family has a stranglehold on the market and

19:57.560 --> 20:02.280
no one makes anything without their approval and that of the CIA, but it's not real.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.700
It's just a cartoonish exaggeration of the news that was reported about the ties between

20:05.700 --> 20:09.200
the Bin Laden family and the Bechtel Group that Alex is trying to inflate into being

20:09.200 --> 20:12.380
something completely different than it actually is.

20:12.380 --> 20:15.520
There are problems with the interconnectedness of these boards, and you can make some good

20:15.520 --> 20:19.960
arguments about the way contracts are baited on and doled out, and the sort of conversations

20:19.960 --> 20:21.600
are completely impossible.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.740
If the point that you want to start from is that Bin Laden is CIA and his family runs

20:24.740 --> 20:28.400
all this construction in the Middle East, it's a dead end if you're trying to understand

20:28.400 --> 20:33.400
the real world, and that's what Alex is ushering his audience towards.

20:33.400 --> 20:41.640
And also, like, the biggest construction groups in Saudi Arabia are run by the government.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.640
It's not the Bin Laden family.

20:42.640 --> 20:48.520
An incredibly corrupt government using this for their own personal gain in a way that

20:48.520 --> 20:52.640
makes perfect sense if you know anything about the history of that government.

20:52.640 --> 20:56.000
So Jordan, we've heard a lot about Alex predicting 9-11.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.120
Sure, he nailed it.

20:58.120 --> 21:03.100
We know that about a month before he did, Bill Cooper was saying the exact same stuff

21:03.100 --> 21:04.100
on his show.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.100
Sure.

21:05.100 --> 21:09.000
Well, I mean, and several times before that, Osama himself was saying it, which is probably

21:09.000 --> 21:11.200
why you could assume that it was a smart prediction.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.400
Alex in this next clip talks a little bit about where he got some of his ideas that

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
the...

21:16.400 --> 21:17.400
Osama bin Laden?

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
Nope.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.400
Oh, okay.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
Gary Hart, one of the chief neo-cons.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.800
I mean, he's a great Democrat.

21:21.800 --> 21:28.200
Of course, he's a leading neo-con now on the board there with the CFR and with Rudman.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.920
And they said, they said, we're going to be hit by terrorists when big, tall buildings

21:32.920 --> 21:33.920
are going to be in trouble.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.640
He sat on hardball, 4-9-1-1, started laughing.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.640
Chris Matthews laughed.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.760
It was a CFR moment.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.840
Lots of giggling around the table, lots of smacking, lots of rubbing hands together.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.480
And I got on the air and I said, look out, New York's about to get it.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.480
Call the White House, tell them to stop, to call off the attack.

21:50.480 --> 21:55.120
So Alex saw Gary Hart and Chris Matthews having a moment.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.120
Yeah.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.160
Was this a segment on the show back then?

21:58.160 --> 21:59.160
The CFR moment?

21:59.160 --> 22:00.160
Yeah.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.160
Yeah.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.160
And that's your CFR moment for the day.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.160
Yeah.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.160
It was like the Daily Show at the moment of Zen.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.160
Exactly.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
Yes.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.160
Chris Matthews had the CFR moment.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.160
The CFR moment.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.160
Yeah.

22:09.160 --> 22:14.200
He had this blatant CFR moment happening in public, and he knew that there was going to

22:14.200 --> 22:15.200
be...

22:15.200 --> 22:16.200
Absolutely.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.680
Unfortunately, if you listen to him in the present day, it's a slightly different story.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.680
There's a different story?

22:19.680 --> 22:22.120
Let me tell you, folks, I told you they were going to blow up the World Trade Center and

22:22.120 --> 22:26.760
blame it on bin Laden.

22:26.760 --> 22:32.040
God gave me a vision, and that's the little added ingredient of M4s everybody knows about.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.360
It's not just that I know how to politically analyze all this stuff.

22:34.360 --> 22:41.320
I can get on my knees and go to that place, and then the problem is you're just in God's

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
presence.

22:42.320 --> 22:48.400
You don't care that now you can actually see everything going on in the universe, plugging

22:48.400 --> 22:50.580
directly in to the source.

22:50.580 --> 22:54.080
And there was that time that he went on Rogan's show and said that he got it from a dream?

22:54.080 --> 22:55.080
Yes, there is that.

22:55.080 --> 23:01.200
Well, there was a two-hour thing I did in July 25th, 2001, where I went ahead and went

23:01.200 --> 23:03.280
on air and said, they're going to blow up the World Trade Center, blame it on the CIS,

23:03.280 --> 23:05.680
have been live, then launch all these wars.

23:05.680 --> 23:10.720
And I said, oh, I just got this from analysis information, but I kept having the dream of

23:10.720 --> 23:12.400
the towers, smoking, all the rest of it.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.600
I love the idea that in the present day, when he's talking to Rogan to try and be interesting,

23:16.600 --> 23:21.100
he's like, I claimed back then that it was based on analysis, but I just had this dream

23:21.100 --> 23:22.240
over and over again.

23:22.240 --> 23:26.040
Now we're looking back at 2003 and it's him saying that it was based on analysis, based

23:26.040 --> 23:27.040
on analysis.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.720
So we can only conclude that in 2003, all this episode talking about the CFR moment,

23:31.720 --> 23:32.720
he's lying.

23:32.720 --> 23:33.720
Yes.

23:33.720 --> 23:34.720
He's just had dreams.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.720
100%.

23:35.720 --> 23:36.720
Yep.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.720
Wow.

23:37.720 --> 23:42.320
Well, I mean, that's strangely conclusive proof that maybe he wasn't lying in the present.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.600
He was, hey, hey, I was lying in the past, okay?

23:46.600 --> 23:49.560
I'm coming clean on this one.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.680
No matter what I do, it's based on a lie.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.260
Yeah, I don't know.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.260
That's so funny.

23:54.260 --> 23:59.260
Did you ever notice how narcissists, as time goes on, the people in their stories tend

23:59.260 --> 24:02.080
to disappear and it's just them?

24:02.080 --> 24:05.720
You know, that whole Gary Hart thing just disappears into the past.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
The CFR moment.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
Yeah.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.720
Is but a dream.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.720
No, not a worry.

24:09.720 --> 24:10.720
Not a worry.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.640
In the present day, it was all me and God, baby.

24:12.640 --> 24:16.080
God gave him a vision of literally everything that was going to happen because he was so

24:16.080 --> 24:17.080
spectacular.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.520
He gets hand jobs from the arcane angel Michael, yeah.

24:20.520 --> 24:27.320
So we have this interesting dynamic in the past here where Alex is still trying to do

24:27.320 --> 24:31.000
that whole pretending the left and the right are the same kind of game.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Yeah.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
I think it's a choice to get into that a little bit, and I think it's a little silly.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.240
Look, I've tried to explain the real political paradigm, okay?

24:38.240 --> 24:42.680
If you're on the far left, you've got police and black ski masks, giant prisons, incredible

24:42.680 --> 24:45.960
taxation, regulation control, a few strong men running things.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.120
That's socialism, communism, whatever you want to call it.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
That is what they do to us.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.760
On the far right, police and black uniforms, giant prisons, a few strong men running things,

24:52.760 --> 24:54.800
total control, high taxation.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.120
Sounds like the past five years.

24:56.120 --> 25:02.080
Look, until 100 years ago, the universities taught liberty, freedom, Magna Carta, Bill

25:02.080 --> 25:03.080
of Rights.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.480
It was a discussion of liberty versus tyranny.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.560
It wasn't a discussion of left and right.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.840
They've learned how to give you false choices.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.920
They go, oh, do you want the left and the right when there's no difference in substance.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.720
What?

25:16.720 --> 25:22.040
I do like we can kind of boil it down to the conversation is still between liberty and

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
tyranny.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.360
I'm not just pretending that the right doesn't associate with tyranny.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.160
That's kind of your problem here.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.360
You guys just tried to institute a theocracy.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.160
I think we know what the left-right paradigm is, liberty versus freedom.

25:34.160 --> 25:39.240
Yeah, it's a little bit strange.

25:39.240 --> 25:43.560
I would say that that's a superficial analysis at best.

25:43.560 --> 25:47.840
The way he's trying to depict the left and the right as the same is essentially meaningless.

25:47.840 --> 25:52.800
And also, I don't know how he knows what they were teaching at universities 100 years ago.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.800
Sure.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.800
Sure.

25:54.800 --> 26:00.320
I would say that he is not somebody I would take as a credible source on that.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.320
Sure.

26:01.320 --> 26:07.360
So yeah, that assessment I don't care too much about.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.360
The left and the right, it's just simplistic.

26:10.360 --> 26:14.320
You can take left-wing governments that have eroded into dictatorships and right-wing governments

26:14.320 --> 26:19.000
that have also eroded into dictatorships, and then you can find some superficial similarities

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
between them.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Sure.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.920
And I think that they're all the same.

26:22.920 --> 26:27.560
For a policy wonk, you'd think that he would bring up specific things that they agree on.

26:27.560 --> 26:32.120
No, just superficial things like there's big jails and people and police in black uniforms.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.120
Okay.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.120
All right, well, they solved it then.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.880
Also, I want you to keep this in mind.

26:35.880 --> 26:39.000
Typically speaking, if someone is trying to tell you that there's no difference between

26:39.000 --> 26:43.520
X and Y, there's a really good chance that they're super on the side of X or Y.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.520
Yes.

26:44.520 --> 26:48.080
They're usually not in the middle or neutral.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.080
It is strange.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.960
They're usually an extremist for X or Y.

26:50.960 --> 26:56.040
Usually they go from there's nothing between, there's no difference between X or Y, and

26:56.040 --> 26:58.720
then they push you strongly towards X or Y.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.040
Yes, it does seem like that is a pattern.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
Yeah.

27:02.040 --> 27:05.320
So Alex is trying to make this point that like the left and the right are the same,

27:05.320 --> 27:06.320
you know, blah, blah, blah.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.320
Sure.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.920
Fascism and communism, same thing.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.800
And here is how Alex makes that argument.

27:12.800 --> 27:15.960
There's no difference in substance.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.000
So call it fascism, call it communism.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.400
It's all command and control, maybe a little bit different implementation system, but yeah,

27:23.400 --> 27:28.600
you got Bush's grandfather getting detained and having to pay a million plus fine, Prescott

27:28.600 --> 27:35.160
Bush for running almost all Nazi operations globally, over 53% of their steel production,

27:35.160 --> 27:36.160
you name it.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.160
Prescott, the Senator.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.160
No help at all.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.640
You've at the same time got the other families funding the communists.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.900
I mean, this is what they do, folks.

27:44.900 --> 27:48.040
So Alex is really bad at his job in clips like this.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.040
Yeah.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.040
Like what does he mean by Prescott Bush?

27:50.040 --> 27:52.960
We're in almost all the Nazi operations globally.

27:52.960 --> 27:59.600
Did he run the cloning program in Brazil too?

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
Totally.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
Okay, good.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.780
If you pay attention to that clip, you see one of the ways that Alex lies.

28:04.780 --> 28:08.440
He takes something that is true, namely that Prescott Bush did indirect business with the

28:08.440 --> 28:13.840
Nazis and then he embellishes it in a completely insane way, like claiming he ran almost all

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
their operations globally.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.280
The assertion that Alex is making is nonsensical.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.960
He's saying that Prescott Bush profiteered by trading with fascists and that other rich

28:21.960 --> 28:26.080
families have profiteered by trading with communists, thus they must be the same.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.080
Same thing.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.960
It means nothing and is a silly argument.

28:28.960 --> 28:29.960
No difference.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.240
The argument that fascism and communism are the same because Alex believes them both to

28:33.240 --> 28:38.720
be command and control systems is equally meaningless.

28:38.720 --> 28:42.640
Alex throws out that term a lot, but it really is just a military term that the Joint Chiefs

28:42.640 --> 28:47.480
of Staff defines thus, quote, commanding control is the exercise of authority and direction

28:47.480 --> 28:52.680
by a properly designated commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of a mission.

28:52.680 --> 28:57.000
The term has a broader understanding outside of strictly military situations to mean someone

28:57.000 --> 28:59.360
directs other people to get a task done.

28:59.360 --> 29:04.920
It does seem very self-explanatory whenever you just think of words and how they mean

29:04.920 --> 29:05.920
things.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.280
If this is the big similarity that Alex has that he thinks makes communism and fascism

29:09.280 --> 29:13.760
the same, I have a short list of other things that also must be the same as the Nazis.

29:13.760 --> 29:14.760
School.

29:14.760 --> 29:15.760
Yeah.

29:15.760 --> 29:16.760
Any job where you have a boss.

29:16.760 --> 29:17.760
True.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.760
Hospitals.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.760
Yeah.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.760
Firefighting.

29:20.760 --> 29:21.760
Construction.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.760
NASCAR pit crews.

29:22.760 --> 29:23.760
Nailed it.

29:23.760 --> 29:24.760
Any sport that has a coach.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.760
Correct.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.760
Any form of acting where there's a director.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
Every country in the world.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.760
This list goes on and on.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.280
Well, you didn't need to add that last one.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.280
Sure.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.880
By focusing on what he thinks is the only relevant factor in these two systems, Alex

29:34.880 --> 29:39.400
is actually obscuring the much more real and much more important differences between them.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.840
I think what Alex is trying to express is that communist countries have what's known

29:42.840 --> 29:46.720
as a command economy, where the government decides what should be produced and how much

29:46.720 --> 29:49.320
as opposed to letting the market decide.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.960
This is a defining aspect of communism as an economic system.

29:52.960 --> 29:58.200
The problem is when you try to juxtapose that with fascism, which isn't an economic system.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.520
If you look at the fascist countries during World War II, for example, you can see massive

30:01.520 --> 30:04.620
differences in the economic models that they employed.

30:04.620 --> 30:08.680
What Alex is trying to express is that communism by definition involves a command economy and

30:08.680 --> 30:12.100
that the Nazis also had a fairly command-based economy.

30:12.100 --> 30:16.460
The difference is that within communism it's an element of the economic ideology, but in

30:16.460 --> 30:20.160
the case of groups like the Nazis, it was just used because it was necessary to run

30:20.160 --> 30:22.880
an economy almost entirely based on war.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.400
We did the same thing during World War II.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.400
Yeah.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.400
It was a great idea.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.020
It worked out for everybody involved.

30:29.020 --> 30:33.820
This is not a meaningful, substantive connection between these two things.

30:33.820 --> 30:38.080
As I was listening to this episode, I was trying to give Alex a fair reading, and it's

30:38.080 --> 30:39.960
just what he's saying doesn't make sense.

30:39.960 --> 30:47.000
No, I mean, based on his definition of command and control, the fundamental idea of laws

30:47.000 --> 30:53.560
can't exist, because that is a designated body telling you what you can or cannot do.

30:53.560 --> 30:58.160
That simply cannot exist in his concept of both.

30:58.160 --> 31:03.320
I think if you went too far with it, yeah, you probably could get to that argument.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.880
I think I could get him to that argument.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.760
I don't think it would be hard.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.160
Oh, another thing that's command and control.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.160
Judges.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.160
Yeah, exactly.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.160
You're right.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.160
All laws should be abolished.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.240
Okay, Alex, that wasn't quite my point, but fair enough.

31:18.240 --> 31:23.600
So the thing, though, is that socialism always leads to fascism.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.280
You want to use these half-baked political terms, communist, socialist, fascist, I'll

31:27.280 --> 31:28.280
use them.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.280
Half-baked?

31:29.280 --> 31:36.080
And to use them, and more accurately, socialism leads to fascism.

31:36.080 --> 31:42.360
Over and over again, the bankers fund a socialist communist movement to consolidate power to

31:42.360 --> 31:48.040
get a big government, to get people dependent, and then it is transferred, once they're dependent,

31:48.040 --> 31:49.520
to a fascist government.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.880
Now that's what happens over and over again.

31:51.880 --> 31:52.920
That's just not true.

31:52.920 --> 31:56.440
But this conversation's probably impossible to have, because I don't think Alex is using

31:56.440 --> 31:58.880
any of these terms in the way that anyone else would use them.

31:58.880 --> 31:59.880
I don't know.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.520
This is a completely made-up claim that Alex is peddling that he can't back up at all unless

32:03.520 --> 32:07.860
he uses completely absurd definitions of the words socialism and fascism that I don't think

32:07.860 --> 32:09.600
anybody would agree with him on.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.740
Socialism is whatever it is he doesn't like, and if you can define it as something different

32:13.740 --> 32:19.200
from that, he will tell you that that's the secret way they talk about it, to cover up

32:19.200 --> 32:21.400
that what they actually mean is socialism.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
Sure.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.400
Yeah.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.440
So Alex, one of the big breaking points in his career, one of the times that he...

32:26.440 --> 32:27.440
Also, real quick.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.440
Yeah.

32:28.440 --> 32:32.200
He realized the idea that communism is half-baked.

32:32.200 --> 32:38.760
One of the most documented and argued about in books over and over and over again, refined

32:38.760 --> 32:43.040
and reinterpreted things, is half-fucking-baked.

32:43.040 --> 32:48.440
Karl Marx made it through three-quarters of Das Kapital and was like, eh, that'll do.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.760
Look, I tried.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.760
Yeah, exactly.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.320
I'll put it out there and everybody else can finish the last 40 pages if they want.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.760
There's a salient difference between I disagree with this and it's half-baked.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.760
Yeah, it's half-baked.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.760
Yes.

33:00.760 --> 33:01.760
That is fake.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.760
Sorry.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.760
Sorry.

33:03.760 --> 33:04.760
I needed to beat that dead horse real quick.

33:04.760 --> 33:05.760
Hey.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.760
I say nay.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.360
No.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.840
So Alex broke into Bohemian Grove, right?

33:12.840 --> 33:13.840
Sure.

33:13.840 --> 33:14.840
Yes, he did.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.800
And you know, we've heard a lot of stories of him talking about his heroics.

33:16.800 --> 33:21.920
And now that we're in the future, he did it completely by himself with no other journalist

33:21.920 --> 33:24.400
there whatsoever who were also documenting the situation.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.120
Oh, you might be surprised to hear this then.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.120
Oh.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.760
I mean, you can't write stuff this crazy.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.600
I didn't believe in Bohemian Grove.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.600
I'd read about it.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
I'd heard about it.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
I didn't believe it.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.720
I'd read mainstream news articles.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.360
The British media says, Mr. Jones, we'd like to get you to sneak in.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.960
We really can't do it.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.320
But we're afraid to do it, Mr. Jones.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.320
We know you do things like this.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.480
Would you like to sneak into the Grove?

33:45.480 --> 33:48.480
I snuck in and I saw it, folks, okay?

33:48.480 --> 33:50.600
I saw it with my own two eyes.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.980
I got video of it.

33:51.980 --> 33:55.760
Alex in the present day would like to say that he was the first person to ever break

33:55.760 --> 33:56.760
the story wide open.

33:56.760 --> 33:57.760
Oh, of course, of course.

33:57.760 --> 34:01.000
Here he is in 2003 talking about how he'd read about it in the mainstream news before.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.240
And in fact, the British media approached him to do the story.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.720
He did not think of this by himself whatsoever.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.520
Hey, Alex, we hear you're a weirdo.

34:09.520 --> 34:14.080
He would never do it had he not had the push from the British media.

34:14.080 --> 34:18.040
Yeah, these are just some of these little differences between past versions of stories

34:18.040 --> 34:19.040
and present.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.160
Yeah, it seems like things change.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.160
Sure.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.200
Alex in the present is weird sponsors.

34:23.200 --> 34:28.560
Alex has a herb store or like, I don't know, I guess they have some colloidal silver and

34:28.560 --> 34:32.560
stuff that they sell that he's running an ad for.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.880
And it ended in a way that shocked me.

34:34.880 --> 34:40.300

That's herbalhealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and

34:56.600 --> 34:57.600
education.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.600
What?

34:58.600 --> 35:02.560
Is this a Christian identity herbal shop?

35:02.560 --> 35:03.560
Oh, no.

35:03.560 --> 35:08.240
We're going to send you our 104-page catalog.

35:08.240 --> 35:14.040
Also, we've defeated the Zardons and if you call this number, we will be able to send

35:14.040 --> 35:15.040
you this catalog.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.680
Wait, you shouldn't have thrown the Zardons in there.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.680
What did you just say?

35:18.680 --> 35:19.680
Yeah.

35:19.680 --> 35:20.680
Yeah.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.680
We're trying to save the remnant.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.920
That's interesting code to be in this commercial this far back.

35:25.920 --> 35:30.960
It seems like maybe Alex was, I mean, why would you have that as a sponsor if they weren't

35:30.960 --> 35:35.640
like a Christian identity type of herbal shop?

35:35.640 --> 35:36.640
Sure.

35:36.640 --> 35:37.640
Yeah.

35:37.640 --> 35:38.640
Natural place for us to advertise.

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
Yeah.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.860
Why would you shoehorn that into your commercial?

35:42.860 --> 35:43.860
Very weird.

35:43.860 --> 35:44.860
Yeah.

35:44.860 --> 35:45.860
Very weird.

35:45.860 --> 35:51.520
I can't get over the idea of like Kellogg's just... Cornflakes, they're great.

35:51.520 --> 35:55.840
The thousand year war almost ended and if you want more Kellogg's cornflakes, like,

35:55.840 --> 35:57.800
wait, what did you just say?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.480
We will defeat the devil with my lucky charms.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.480
You can't just toss that in there, man.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.480
What are you doing?

36:03.480 --> 36:05.840
It is strange.

36:05.840 --> 36:10.360
So Alex is having a tough time with the Iraq war and all this, partially because he hates

36:10.360 --> 36:11.800
the people who were doing it.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.800
Sure.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.800
Vis a vis George Bush.

36:13.800 --> 36:14.800
Naturally.

36:14.800 --> 36:15.800
And all that.

36:15.800 --> 36:21.240
And I think that by free talking a little bit too much, I think that Alex reveals certain

36:21.240 --> 36:25.840
ways in which his ideology is inconsistent with what he wants the audience to believe

36:25.840 --> 36:26.840
it is.

36:26.840 --> 36:30.440
I mean, the government was leaving us alone and not trying to dumb our kids down and not

36:30.440 --> 36:34.440
trying to ship heroin and cocaine in and not doing all these things.

36:34.440 --> 36:39.600
They wanted to go invade a bunch of countries and, you know, bring them real republics and

36:39.600 --> 36:40.600
really have elections.

36:40.600 --> 36:44.160
I'd go, well, man, you know, maybe so.

36:44.160 --> 36:49.640
Violates what George Washington said about, you know, staying out of other hemisphere,

36:49.640 --> 36:51.440
but okay.

36:51.440 --> 36:55.880
But no, you don't destroy everything that makes America America.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.720
So Alex seems like he's fine with the idea of colonialism.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.720
Yeah, it does seem like that.

37:01.720 --> 37:05.880
Regime change, installing democracies abroad.

37:05.880 --> 37:06.880
Sure.

37:06.880 --> 37:11.080
Only in the case that the government wasn't doing the things that he doesn't like.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.280
Right, right, right.

37:12.280 --> 37:17.360
So I guess his opposition can't possibly be to meddling in the affairs of other countries

37:17.360 --> 37:20.040
or regime changing nation building.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.000
That is something that he is hypothetically okay with.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.640
But he will pretend that he's not.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.640
Yeah.

37:25.640 --> 37:30.440
I would be interested to know what Washington would consider a hemisphere.

37:30.440 --> 37:33.000
Alex's argument against the Iraq war seems to be vaccines.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.960
Yeah, I was going to say, it does not seem to...

37:35.960 --> 37:36.960
This is not sensible.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.240
No, no, no, no.

37:38.240 --> 37:45.120
It doesn't seem like he's like, hey, hey, we should be colonizing Central South America

37:45.120 --> 37:46.120
is what we do.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.520
No other hemispheres, Washington.

37:48.520 --> 37:53.980
No, I think he's saying that if our country was run the way I want it to be, we could

37:53.980 --> 37:56.200
go ahead and put in democracies around the world.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.200
Sure, of course.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.800
I just don't like these people.

38:00.800 --> 38:05.840
It's an incoherent and silly ideology that runs into problems really fast.

38:05.840 --> 38:06.840
Yeah, it is.

38:06.840 --> 38:10.000
It's the same thing with him wanting to buy Greenland when Trump is in office.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
For sure, for sure.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Yeah, yeah.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Let's just steal it.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Okay.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
It's that kind of nonsense of like, oh, that is kind of what you believe.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.280
As long as it's your idealized Christian authoritarian government, you'd be totally fine if it was

38:23.280 --> 38:24.680
one world government.

38:24.680 --> 38:25.680
Of course.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.080
You'd be totally fine with all kinds of colonial expansivism.

38:28.080 --> 38:31.860
Well, then everything's one hemisphere, Dan, if it's all America.

38:31.860 --> 38:36.640
Don't care at all about the idea of freedom or self-determination and bullshit.

38:36.640 --> 38:43.240
It is like, okay, I get that we both don't want the Iraq war, but I don't want it because

38:43.240 --> 38:48.280
millions of people are going to be slaughtered for no reason, and you don't want it because

38:48.280 --> 38:50.040
you don't like the guy?

38:50.040 --> 38:52.240
I don't think we necessarily agree.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.240
I don't like tax.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.240
Yeah.

38:54.240 --> 39:00.120
I don't think that's a good... So Alex does an ad pivot here, and it's very

39:00.120 --> 39:01.440
sensible.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.480
It makes sense.

39:02.480 --> 39:06.560
This is kind of how... I'm not offended by this necessarily.

39:06.560 --> 39:11.720
Because what he's doing is advertising his products, which are like his DVDs and stuff.

39:11.720 --> 39:15.800
It makes sense for him to be like, there's more information on this.

39:15.800 --> 39:19.640
It makes more sense than him constantly throwing to pill commercials.

39:19.640 --> 39:20.640
Yes, it does.

39:20.640 --> 39:25.160
Because at least there's still hypothetical information to be found here, although I think

39:25.160 --> 39:26.160
he's lying.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.640
Well, some of us aren't afraid.

39:27.640 --> 39:33.120
We'll stand up for humanity because it's people like us, the only reason we still have humanity,

39:33.120 --> 39:37.560
to counterbalance the just insane filth out there.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.520
Before I end this shower, if you believe in what we're doing, you want to fight the New

39:40.520 --> 39:44.800
World Order, you want a tool to fight the New World Order, get my videos.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.720
I produced eight of them, and we proved the globalists carried out 9-1-1, and we proved

39:48.720 --> 39:51.820
they're going to carry out more, and we proved that they're enslaving you and your family.

39:51.820 --> 39:56.120
So on his documentaries, he proved that the globalists carried off 9-1-1, 9-11.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.000
I don't recall that.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.440
But do you recall when he did that interview a couple years back with Patrick Bette-David

40:02.440 --> 40:05.120
and Patrick Bette-David asked him who did 9-11?

40:05.120 --> 40:06.640
I do recall that.

40:06.640 --> 40:10.440
Who was really behind the 9-11 with what you've studied over the years and what you've spoken

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
about?

40:11.440 --> 40:12.680
I don't know who's behind it.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.640
Oh, well, you should watch your DVDs then.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.200
You should watch the proof that you made.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.040
It seems like you would stick to the proof.

40:21.040 --> 40:26.920
Yeah, I would say that maybe you were wrong, or maybe you didn't prove anything.

40:26.920 --> 40:33.440
No, I'm just trying to, okay, my documentary's going to prove everything.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.800
The World War is coming.

40:35.800 --> 40:40.760
Now, I mean, obviously the capital gains tax should be about 40, 50%, and that's why

40:40.760 --> 40:45.960
we're like, wait, no, no, no, you threw the snot sequitur in there.

40:45.960 --> 40:46.960
It's fun.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.480
It's fun for him to forget that he proved who did 9-11.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.480
Yeah.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.560
It seems like a big thing to remember.

40:53.560 --> 40:54.560
Oh, well.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.560
Who did it?

40:56.560 --> 41:00.160
Alex doesn't know.

41:00.160 --> 41:04.440
I think I've watched those DVDs, and I don't think I know either, based on his proof in

41:04.440 --> 41:05.440
quotes.

41:05.440 --> 41:09.160
Yeah, I would like those redacted pages is what I want, Dan.

41:09.160 --> 41:16.360
So here's our first indication of something not being quite right in Austin.

41:16.360 --> 41:17.360
Sure.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.800
Alex is going out to break, and he says this.

41:19.800 --> 41:28.200
Again, that's 888-253-3139, defending the Republic against the forces of Satan.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.200
Uh-oh.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.560
Okay, there it is.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.560
The forces of Satan.

41:33.560 --> 41:37.880
And you could pull that off as being like, oh, look at him, he's making that exaggeration.

41:37.880 --> 41:41.600
Ah, come on, we've all used flowery language.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.960
Yeah, and it's going out to break on like a pump-up kind of thing.

41:45.960 --> 41:46.960
Yeah, totally.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.680
It sounds like a reasonable thing that you would say if you were just pumped up.

41:49.680 --> 41:55.560
And it also does feel like this is a little bit more than I've been giving a pass to a

41:55.560 --> 41:56.560
lot of stuff.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.440
It seems like I'm fighting against the forces of Satan.

41:59.440 --> 42:05.520
He's not as literal, he's not saying that as part of a 15-minute rant.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
Sure, sure.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.760
It is just going out to break, but it made me worry.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.120
It could be hyperbole, of course.

42:11.120 --> 42:17.400
Of course, however, you can't miss the forest for the trees, if you will, Dan.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
Yeah, yeah.

42:18.400 --> 42:23.480
So Alex goes to calls, and I think I've brought this up before, but there's such a sensible

42:23.480 --> 42:29.040
formula to his show at this point, and that is that he'll rant about something for a little

42:29.040 --> 42:34.000
while, and then go to calls, and then maybe the caller says something that he can talk

42:34.000 --> 42:38.080
about for a little bit longer, he'll read a headline or two, then go to a call, get

42:38.080 --> 42:41.160
maybe a reaction, that'll lead into a rant.

42:41.160 --> 42:44.520
There is just a fluidity to it that makes sense.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.720
Whereas now, it's such fucking long chunks of him saying nothing.

42:48.720 --> 42:51.040
Stream of consciousness chaos, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:51.040 --> 42:55.480
So it is, it flows much easier.

42:55.480 --> 42:59.680
And so this caller that Alex goes to at this point in the show brings up Rush Limbaugh.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.000
What do you think Alex thinks about Rush Limbaugh?

43:02.000 --> 43:05.240
He's grateful for someone giving him something to steal.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.240
Nope.

43:06.240 --> 43:07.240
Oh.

43:07.240 --> 43:12.120
I was listening the other day, driving in my car, and I happened to turn on Rush Slackjaw,

43:12.120 --> 43:14.760
and he was talking about it.

43:14.760 --> 43:21.160
You turned into the ultra-liberal, and the neo-con, and Bush is a communitarian.

43:21.160 --> 43:24.760
You know what the dictionary 20 years ago said about communitarian?

43:24.760 --> 43:25.760
No.

43:25.760 --> 43:28.480
One who promotes communist systems.

43:28.480 --> 43:32.520
Bush's press release for the election, I'm a communitarian, what do the communitarian

43:32.520 --> 43:33.760
Rush Limbaugh say?

43:33.760 --> 43:35.760
So apparently Rush Limbaugh's a commie.

43:35.760 --> 43:38.880
Yes, the communitarian Rush Limbaugh.

43:38.880 --> 43:39.880
Yes.

43:39.880 --> 43:40.880
Noted.

43:40.880 --> 43:43.560
The left commie Rush Limbaugh.

43:43.560 --> 43:47.800
The leftist among leftists, Rush Limbaugh.

43:47.800 --> 43:52.960
Right standing next to Bill Maher is people who are leftists beyond all reason.

43:52.960 --> 43:56.780
Yeah, see, I mean, you get this sense of like, okay, here's where the denial of the left-right

43:56.780 --> 43:57.780
paradigm is.

43:57.780 --> 43:59.360
Rush Limbaugh is a fucking commie.

43:59.360 --> 44:05.240
Yeah, just take a hit at somebody on the right, and then you're good, you know?

44:05.240 --> 44:09.320
And it doesn't have to be a substantial hit, you can just be like, that guy's a real dick.

44:09.320 --> 44:12.560
Hey, I'm above the left-right paradigm.

44:12.560 --> 44:18.160
So Alex is talking to this caller, and they bring up going to the World's Fair in the

44:18.160 --> 44:19.160
70s, I think.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.160
Sure.

44:20.160 --> 44:24.280
And they might have seen some Russian propaganda about ecological efforts.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.280
Okay, okay.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.280
I don't know.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.280
I don't know what's going on anymore.

44:28.280 --> 44:33.400
Talking about your lies and propaganda, I remember in 1974 I went to the World's Fair,

44:33.400 --> 44:41.640
and the theme of that World's Fair was ecology, and the worst exhibit there, the most propagandized

44:41.640 --> 44:47.960
exhibit was the Russian exhibit at that World's Fair, and you go through the Russian exhibit

44:47.960 --> 44:48.960
from one end to the other.

44:48.960 --> 44:54.080
All they said was how wonderful it was in Russia, there was no pollution, the waters

44:54.080 --> 44:59.720
were clean, the air was clean, all this stuff, it was exactly the opposite of what was reality.

44:59.720 --> 45:05.880
But now we're turning into the same kind of a system that I saw in 74 in the World's Fair

45:05.880 --> 45:07.320
in the Russian exhibit.

45:07.320 --> 45:14.400
Well, I'll be honest, if it was a new world, I'd leave, but I love America.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.400
What did you just say?

45:15.400 --> 45:19.400
And my family's been in the Texas independence fight, and for the battle for independence

45:19.400 --> 45:24.400
in 1776, but I gotta tell you, I'd be moving down there, I'll tell you.

45:24.400 --> 45:27.960
Well, I'll tell you, we need some states to break off, break away, get out of this thing,

45:27.960 --> 45:33.080
and get back to America, call it the real United States, because this isn't the federal

45:33.080 --> 45:34.080
government.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.080
Why?

45:35.080 --> 45:36.200
People running the federal government, they are the enemy combatants.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.400
Yeah, the federal government's enemy combatants.

45:38.400 --> 45:39.400
Sure.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.360
Now, the thing that I think is interesting about that clip, and the reason that I pulled

45:42.360 --> 45:47.640
it out was because this caller is expressing this idea that they saw this Russian display

45:47.640 --> 45:52.880
at the 74 World's Fair, and it is a delusional portrayal of what was really going on in the

45:52.880 --> 45:53.880
Soviet Union.

45:53.880 --> 45:58.320
And one of the things that he brings up is, like, there's no pollution, and then you flash

45:58.320 --> 46:02.400
forward to the present day, and Alex talking about how coal power plants are all totally

46:02.400 --> 46:03.400
clean.

46:03.400 --> 46:06.280
No pollution, yeah, Russia is just a perfectly clean thing, yeah.

46:06.280 --> 46:11.320
It's so interesting to see Alex becoming this thing that this caller is describing as being

46:11.320 --> 46:17.360
this horrendous act of propaganda in 1974 that he still remembers in 2003.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.960
Just don't care.

46:18.960 --> 46:25.800
Alex is completely delusional about accepting and recognizing and dealing with the sort

46:25.800 --> 46:32.960
of more bad history of the United States, to the point where he's even worse than probably

46:32.960 --> 46:36.480
whatever that Soviet Union Russian display was.

46:36.480 --> 46:45.880
Yeah, that is one of those things about fascists, is that once you're in power, all of the past

46:45.880 --> 46:48.960
is changed to whatever you want, you know?

46:48.960 --> 46:54.120
As long as Trump is running the United States government, the United States has never ever

46:54.120 --> 46:55.880
done anything wrong.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.360
And saying so is an attempt to undermine Trump.

46:58.360 --> 46:59.360
Exactly, yeah.

46:59.360 --> 47:01.480
Oh, you're gonna bring up slavery again?

47:01.480 --> 47:03.160
It's America, come on, man.

47:03.160 --> 47:06.320
You're trying to ruin the exuberance that is being felt.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.480
You're screwing up our good time, man.

47:08.480 --> 47:12.200
We're trying to slaughter innocents, and you're really making us bummed out.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.920
Yeah, it's very strange.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.360
By that I mean it's not strange at all.

47:16.360 --> 47:20.640
So hey, we got this idea that, left, right, same thing.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.640
Sure.

47:21.640 --> 47:24.080
Last two presidents, Clinton, Bush.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.240
No difference there.

47:25.240 --> 47:26.240
Both puppets.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.240
Sure.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.640
But were they equally responsible puppets?

47:29.640 --> 47:30.640
That's, what?

47:30.640 --> 47:31.640
What?

47:31.640 --> 47:33.680
Again, I have nothing really against Bush.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.000
Bush is more of a puppet than Bill Clinton.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.420
Bill Clinton was really in there, enjoyed all of it.

47:40.420 --> 47:45.240
Bush is really just reading off a teleprompter, and hey, thanks daddy, it's great to be able

47:45.240 --> 47:48.280
to preside him in the new world order in the end of America.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.760
So yeah, we've got these two presidents who are both puppets.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.760
Right.

47:51.760 --> 47:52.760
The left and the right.

47:52.760 --> 47:53.760
Sure.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.320
But somehow still the one that's on the left is worse.

47:55.320 --> 47:56.320
Right, right, right.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.020
Because he enjoyed it.

47:58.020 --> 48:03.800
So we're in a Pinocchio situation where Clinton is when Pinocchio was turned into a donkey

48:03.800 --> 48:04.800
for a while.

48:04.800 --> 48:05.800
Sure.

48:05.800 --> 48:10.280
And W is still the puppet, but he is not yet a real boy.

48:10.280 --> 48:11.280
Sure.

48:11.280 --> 48:12.280
And then Trump is the real boy?

48:12.280 --> 48:13.280
Yes, I guess.

48:13.280 --> 48:14.280
I think that's what happened.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.280
I think I've figured it out.

48:15.280 --> 48:21.760
Yeah, it's just remarkable to look at this and be like, oh yeah, this act of the left

48:21.760 --> 48:24.080
and the right are the same is so thin.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.080
It's so transparent.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.480
Yeah, you've already done it over and over and over again.

48:28.480 --> 48:31.720
Almost any time there's a comparison between someone who's on the left and someone who's

48:31.720 --> 48:37.840
on the right, you can see like some sort of derision towards both, but the left is way

48:37.840 --> 48:38.840
worse.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.840
Oh yeah.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.840
He enjoyed it.

48:40.840 --> 48:45.160
Their inclusion is what makes them evil.

48:45.160 --> 48:54.600
So Bush, he gave a warning to the U.S.'s supposed enemies and Alex believes that these are actually

48:54.600 --> 49:00.720
the globalist's enemies and here we get another wonderful prediction from Alex.

49:00.720 --> 49:06.840
Also Bush fires warnings at U.S. enemies, you mean globalist enemies, saying that other

49:06.840 --> 49:11.600
countries are next, so if they are going into other countries, they'll need to be a convenient

49:11.600 --> 49:12.600
terror attack.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.680
Blamed on someone though, don't worry.

49:14.680 --> 49:19.080
Much larger Gary Hart and other CFR people have told us with total confidence and then

49:19.080 --> 49:24.640
we'll call them profits when Dallas or Denver or Cleveland get hit by smallpox, as Gary

49:24.640 --> 49:32.120
Hart said on national television on hardball, well he said that before 9-1-1, he just said

49:32.120 --> 49:35.280
that on Hattie and Combs.

49:35.280 --> 49:40.260
So this is one of the problems with relying on quote-unquote CFR moments and that sort

49:40.260 --> 49:44.080
of thing as being predictive of what's going to happen in the world.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.720
When Gary Hart says something like we're worried about smallpox cases in an American city,

49:48.720 --> 49:55.560
and you read that as there's going to be, to justify another war, you're just making

49:55.560 --> 49:56.560
shit up.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.000
And that's what we see here.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.760
No, and it's the most powerful type of making shit up propaganda, wherein somebody trying

50:03.760 --> 50:07.880
to protect you from a thing that's happening, you have turned into the person trying to

50:07.880 --> 50:12.640
cause the thing that's happening, thus ensuring that the thing they're worried about almost

50:12.640 --> 50:18.160
certainly will happen, and then you get to bitch about how they didn't see it coming.

50:18.160 --> 50:24.240
And then you have these kinds of instances of things that just litter Alex's career,

50:24.240 --> 50:29.520
that just things never happen, and we're just totally talking out of his ass, he just pretends

50:29.520 --> 50:32.440
that that isn't a bulk of his career.

50:32.440 --> 50:36.480
Well the last time I visited Denver, there were about four people there after the smallpox

50:36.480 --> 50:41.240
epidemic destroyed most of the city, but they were really cool to hang out with.

50:41.240 --> 50:42.320
There's only lone survivors.

50:42.320 --> 50:44.800
They did try and eat my leg.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.400
So look, we get another caller.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.400
Sure.

50:48.400 --> 50:49.400
This guy's got an interesting idea.

50:49.400 --> 50:50.400
Naturally.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.760
And by interesting I mean very stupid.

50:51.760 --> 50:52.760
Terrible.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.760
Yeah.

50:53.760 --> 50:57.520
So stupid that Alex has to end the conversation by saying, I don't speculate.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.520
No.

50:58.520 --> 51:02.760
Let's talk to Andrew in North Carolina, Andrew you're on the air, welcome.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.760
Hi Alex, how you doing?

51:04.760 --> 51:05.760
Good sir.

51:05.760 --> 51:12.640
I had an idea, I don't know if you'd support me on it, the idea popped in my head a while

51:12.640 --> 51:15.600
back while I was tying down a little glass.

51:15.600 --> 51:23.840
Anyway, the idea was how much of a coincidence that a little girl gets kidnapped in Utah

51:23.840 --> 51:28.040
and just so happens that her last name is Smart.

51:28.040 --> 51:33.440
And the fact that there's a Smart Chip out there and now her parents and Amber's parents

51:33.440 --> 51:39.880
have signed the Amber Alert Bill, which turns over all radio, TV, billboards to FEMA and

51:39.880 --> 51:43.920
they're now flashing report terrorist, report guns.

51:43.920 --> 51:48.800
And then it turns out that she's related to a Congressman and all this other stuff.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.320
And then there's some weird freak weather.

51:51.320 --> 51:54.240
And yeah, the whole thing stinks to high heaven, but I don't know, sir.

51:54.240 --> 51:55.240
I don't speculate.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.640
You were just speculating.

51:56.640 --> 51:57.640
Wow.

51:57.640 --> 52:03.520
Hey, listen, I'm going to take your wild, insane speculation and I'm going to speculate

52:03.520 --> 52:05.960
on that, but listen, I don't speculate.

52:05.960 --> 52:10.800
I'm going to rattle off things that are meant to give justification to speculation, but

52:10.800 --> 52:15.900
man, I do not speculate about whether or not the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping was an elaborate

52:15.900 --> 52:18.040
globalist plot to put chips in everybody.

52:18.040 --> 52:19.840
I would never speculate on that.

52:19.840 --> 52:24.560
I mean, obviously that plan is in play and they could do it at any point in time.

52:24.560 --> 52:25.560
And you know what?

52:25.560 --> 52:27.800
I was told there were going to be Silicon chips, turns out they're going to be made

52:27.800 --> 52:28.800
of Amber.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.800
Yeah, exactly.

52:29.800 --> 52:30.800
Amber.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.800
Smart chips.

52:31.800 --> 52:32.800
Fine.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.800
Fine.

52:33.800 --> 52:34.800
Yeah.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.680
I think that's the type of theory if somebody comes at you with, you just have to roll up

52:37.680 --> 52:41.720
a newspaper and be like, no, bad.

52:41.720 --> 52:49.400
I think that I would love to just like, God, my dream job at Info Wars just keeps changing.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.280
Now it's, I want a clip of Alex saying, I don't speculate.

52:52.280 --> 52:55.760
And then every time you start speculating, it's going to hit a button.

52:55.760 --> 52:56.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:56.760 --> 52:57.760
I don't speculate.

52:57.760 --> 52:58.760
The big red button.

52:58.760 --> 52:59.760
Boom.

52:59.760 --> 53:00.760
Uh oh.

53:00.760 --> 53:01.760
Stop it.

53:01.760 --> 53:02.760
It's just a repeat until the speculation ends.

53:02.760 --> 53:03.760
Yeah.

53:03.760 --> 53:09.640
So 9-11 was proven by Alex to have been carried out by people who can't remember who they

53:09.640 --> 53:10.640
are though.

53:10.640 --> 53:11.640
That was in the past.

53:11.640 --> 53:12.640
Yep.

53:12.640 --> 53:19.640
But there are some signs, there's some telltale signs of how you know that the man was behind

53:19.640 --> 53:20.640
it.

53:20.640 --> 53:21.640
Sure.

53:21.640 --> 53:28.560
Why else would they have the Chicago Mercantile exchange on 9-1-1, the one year anniversary

53:28.560 --> 53:33.320
come up 9-1-1 point zero zero zero zero zero zero.

53:33.320 --> 53:34.320
What?

53:34.320 --> 53:37.680
I saw the article that said 9-1-1 point zero.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.720
I went and looked up on the Chicago Mercantile, the close of that day.

53:40.720 --> 53:44.160
The zeros went on basically forever.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.160
That's never happened.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.160
That's impossible.

53:46.160 --> 53:48.720
But what you're thinking, that was just a fluke.

53:48.720 --> 53:54.240
Oh, it came up 9-1-1 at the New York Lottery on 9-1-1, one year anniversary.

53:54.240 --> 53:55.240
Just their little mark.

53:55.240 --> 54:00.280
Hey, we control the lotteries, we control the exchanges, the speculation exchanges,

54:00.280 --> 54:02.120
down to the point they close it.

54:02.120 --> 54:07.200
So I'm not sure that they, I believe this, it sounds like an urban legend kind of situation.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.200
It does.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.200
It does.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.800
For one thing, according to the CME website, which is the name of the Chicago Mercantile

54:12.800 --> 54:17.600
exchange when they're listed as a publicly traded entity, the CME group, they didn't

54:17.600 --> 54:22.700
go public until December 5th, 2002, when they had their initial public offering of stock.

54:22.700 --> 54:27.360
They wouldn't have even been a stock price for CME on September 11th, 2002, since it

54:27.360 --> 54:28.360
wasn't traded.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.560
Oh, that was a real sneaky move by the globalists.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.880
Yeah, I don't know what he's referring to.

54:32.880 --> 54:34.760
They really nailed it.

54:34.760 --> 54:35.760
I don't know.

54:35.760 --> 54:38.600
I think he might have seen a meme or something.

54:38.600 --> 54:42.360
This level of bullshit might as well, oh, okay, okay.

54:42.360 --> 54:46.840
Did you see that George W. Bush has been complimenting people a lot lately?

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
Yes.

54:47.840 --> 54:48.840
Another word for that is lauding.

54:48.840 --> 54:49.840
Do you see what I'm saying?

54:49.840 --> 54:50.840
Oh shit.

54:50.840 --> 54:56.200
So, and he's been doing it repeatedly over time, so you could say he's been lauding people.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.400
Oh shit.

54:57.400 --> 54:58.500
What does that mean?

54:58.500 --> 54:59.500
We nailed it.

54:59.500 --> 55:00.500
It means something.

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
He is been lauding.

55:01.500 --> 55:05.480
So people have looked into the lottery thing, and that one actually is true, but it doesn't

55:05.480 --> 55:07.000
actually mean anything.

55:07.000 --> 55:12.600
The state lottery in New York does, they pick two, pick three winners each day.

55:12.600 --> 55:13.600
The numbers.

55:13.600 --> 55:14.600
Sure, sure.

55:14.600 --> 55:15.600
The sets of three numbers.

55:15.600 --> 55:16.600
Yeah, yeah.

55:16.600 --> 55:19.580
And the other combination coming up is one in a thousand.

55:19.580 --> 55:24.560
Because there are two drawings, the odds of 911 hitting on any given day are one in 500,

55:24.560 --> 55:28.880
which really, it's an interesting coincidence, but it's far from proof that the globalists

55:28.880 --> 55:31.320
did it to show that they control lotto numbers.

55:31.320 --> 55:38.040
Yeah, it's fun, but you might as well use that as also like, oh, I had to call 911 that

55:38.040 --> 55:39.040
day.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.040
It's a miracle.

55:40.040 --> 55:41.040
Sure.

55:41.040 --> 55:42.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:42.040 --> 55:45.060
It's just weird how much of Alex's supposed proof of things relies on just denying that

55:45.060 --> 55:46.560
coincidences exist.

55:46.560 --> 55:47.560
Yeah.

55:47.560 --> 55:48.560
Well, they don't.

55:48.560 --> 55:49.920
It's a little annoying.

55:49.920 --> 55:50.920
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.560
Because there's no real way to argue that.

55:52.560 --> 55:57.080
You could be like, well, the statistical odds of that coming up are not really that insane,

55:57.080 --> 56:00.440
and I don't know what you're talking about with the mercantile exchange.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.440
Sure, yeah.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.800
But yeah, all right, go off.

56:03.800 --> 56:08.240
Anyway, Alex is talking to this caller, and they got into an argument, this caller and

56:08.240 --> 56:12.920
someone in their life, because they didn't agree on the Federal Reserve.

56:12.920 --> 56:13.920
Sure.

56:13.920 --> 56:14.920
Right?

56:14.920 --> 56:15.920
Well, who can?

56:15.920 --> 56:18.160
Well, there was an interesting theory about what was going on there.

56:18.160 --> 56:20.120
You guys were having a boring conversation?

56:20.120 --> 56:21.120
You bet.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.120
They don't need any facts.

56:23.120 --> 56:25.760
They just need to feel good.

56:25.760 --> 56:26.760
Exactly.

56:26.760 --> 56:32.920
Yes, and the conversation I had, I was basically being yelled at and told.

56:32.920 --> 56:38.800
I tried to tell this guy, you know, because it went in so many different directions at

56:38.800 --> 56:39.800
one time.

56:39.800 --> 56:44.000
I was telling him, you know, your income tax monies go to the IMS and Federal Reserve and

56:44.000 --> 56:49.560
so on and so forth, and no, no, they don't, no, they don't, you know, it's just a loud

56:49.560 --> 56:52.480
vehement denial makes it true.

56:52.480 --> 56:53.480
And uh...

56:53.480 --> 56:58.840
Now, wait a minute, though, if he didn't have some problems subconsciously, the subconscious

56:58.840 --> 56:59.840
is much more powerful.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.840
What is happening?

57:00.840 --> 57:05.760
It's a powerful processor, God gave us, it knows the truth, whereas the conscious doesn't.

57:05.760 --> 57:06.760
Don't do this.

57:06.760 --> 57:11.480
This guy, if he'd laugh at you if it wasn't serious, you know, me thinks they protest

57:11.480 --> 57:12.480
too much.

57:12.480 --> 57:14.240
Why do they get so excited then?

57:14.240 --> 57:15.240
So I guess...

57:15.240 --> 57:18.560
Because you guys are the worst to talk to!

57:18.560 --> 57:21.920
I guess anyone arguing with you is an indication that you're right now.

57:21.920 --> 57:22.920
Yeah, exactly!

57:22.920 --> 57:24.360
Because if you're wrong, they'll just laugh at you.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.360
Somebody says no.

57:25.360 --> 57:26.360
What?

57:26.360 --> 57:27.360
Oh, God.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.360
Yeah.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.360
Oh, man.

57:29.360 --> 57:30.360
That's outrageous.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.360
Yeah.

57:31.360 --> 57:34.800
So this guy, this caller, he was told by someone to just believe the news.

57:34.800 --> 57:35.800
Sure, sure.

57:35.800 --> 57:38.200
And I bet that's not what this person said to them.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.200
It's doubtful.

57:39.200 --> 57:41.080
But Alex's response to it is so telling.

57:41.080 --> 57:46.360
I wanted to lay a quote on you from this guy.

57:46.360 --> 57:51.760
I believe in too many conspiracy theories, and you just gotta watch the news and believe

57:51.760 --> 57:52.760
it.

57:52.760 --> 57:53.760
That's what he told me.

57:53.760 --> 57:54.760
And he's a successful businessman.

57:54.760 --> 57:59.760
That's right, I'm successful, I'm important, I'm part of this power system.

57:59.760 --> 58:05.560
You just need to watch the news and believe it, and be part of it.

58:05.560 --> 58:09.160
I'm reporting you, you're with Al-Qaeda.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.160
Nazi Germany, Nazi Germany.

58:10.160 --> 58:18.320
So, I don't believe that this caller is reporting things accurately that his friend just said,

58:18.320 --> 58:19.720
watch the news and believe it.

58:19.720 --> 58:20.720
Kind of doubtful.

58:20.720 --> 58:24.080
But, you know, let's imagine that that's actually someone's position.

58:24.080 --> 58:25.080
Sure.

58:25.080 --> 58:29.840
That is a crippling level of naivete and lack of critical thinking that you're approaching

58:29.840 --> 58:34.840
information that's coming to you with, and I would be opposed to what this supposed person

58:34.840 --> 58:35.840
said.

58:35.840 --> 58:39.320
You know what, I would even argue that I would be above the left-right paradigm in saying

58:39.320 --> 58:41.760
that that is a bad way of consuming media.

58:41.760 --> 58:42.760
Sure.

58:42.760 --> 58:46.440
Now, Alex has a couple of options in terms of addressing the situation.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.680
You could say something like that, like, hey, your friend should engage more critically

58:49.680 --> 58:52.840
with the information that's coming to you, and you should as well.

58:52.840 --> 58:55.840
Or he could have blanket defiance.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.560
I think that would be a better way to go.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.440
Which I think is just as stupid.

58:59.440 --> 59:04.200
I think it's just as stupid to mock the idea of ever listening to the news and being like,

59:04.200 --> 59:06.080
it's Nazi Germany.

59:06.080 --> 59:09.240
It's not, it's the pendulum swinging too far the other direction.

59:09.240 --> 59:10.240
And that's what he wants.

59:10.240 --> 59:16.120
Yeah, it doesn't matter how you get to consume whatever it is uncritically, whether it be

59:16.120 --> 59:17.880
eating it or denying it.

59:17.880 --> 59:26.200
Yeah, whether it's CNN or World Night Daily, like, he wants them to accept World Night

59:26.200 --> 59:27.200
Daily uncritically.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.200
Sure.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.200
Yeah, yeah.

59:29.200 --> 59:30.200
Of course.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.200
And hostility towards things that are saying the other.

59:31.200 --> 59:35.640
Well, you can trust them, and you can't trust anybody else, because it's Nazi Germany day.

59:35.640 --> 59:36.640
Sure, sure.

59:36.640 --> 59:37.640
Yeah.

59:37.640 --> 59:42.620
It's not a bad path, and I would say that he's not setting up his listeners for success.

59:42.620 --> 59:47.440
It's a strategy that won't get you into a better engagement with information.

59:47.440 --> 59:50.560
It'll just make you believe something else.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.960
You'll be tricked by something else.

59:51.960 --> 59:56.760
It'll make you a captive to your information source, and then you'll be like, oh, I should

59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.080
give him money, because he's saving me from the rest of the evil media.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:05.160
And then all of a sudden you're going to start believing that he's the Messiah, actually

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.400
fighting the literal devil.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.960
And then he will believe that.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.360
And then we're all out of control.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.200
So Alex is right about something in this episode.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200
Interesting.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.320
He is right that it's stupid that people say that they would die for George Bush.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.920
I think that is stupid.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.760
Mike Hanson does some camera work for me.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.120
He got some video that I just finally saw this week.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120
He's had it for a month.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.080
They were having the pro-war Bush rallies downtown in Austin.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.080
They had like 30 people there.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080
Mike walks up.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080
I wasn't there.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.680
I was with one other person and says, hey, why are you for the war?

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.320
And the guy just screams, Mike Hanson, you're with Alex Jones.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.600
I will, and he bleep, bleep, you're, you're hined in if you don't say you're for George

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.480
Bush and started threatening to assault Mike.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480
This is on tape.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.320
And Mike goes, hey, you're on camera.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.640
And he goes, and Mike goes, wait a minute.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.080
So what do you think of George Bush?

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.520
I'll die for him, I'll die for him, I'll die for him, I'll die for him, I'll die for him.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.000
I was like a Iraqi just screaming they love the leader because the media said so.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.600
And, you know, they're mindless slaves of the media and the neocons are controlling

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.600
them.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.800
Jump into a time machine with me, Jordan.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.800
Come to the present.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800
Yeah.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.320
They can put a gun to my head and say, if you don't come out and say you hate Trump,

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.720
we're going to blow your brains out.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.040
And I'd say, pull the trigger.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.680
Okay, Alex, calm down.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.680
Yeah.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.320
Also, I love how dainty he's being.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.000
This man was threatening to fight me.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.600
He's threatening my camera man.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.760
He came up to me and he used curse words and he said that he would hurt me physically.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.960
I can't repeat these things because it's a family show and I actually kind of mean it

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960
back at this point.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.960
God.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960
What a dick.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.440
So Alex has another caller and this guy, he had a similar vibe to me as that, that one

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.520
caller who was like, it's 8 a.m. in China, time to get up.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520
Gotta drive to work.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520
Alright, alright.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520
That guy.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.520
He's got a, he's got a Matthew McConaughey kind of vibe to him.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.080
It's not the same vibe, but this was a caller who was like, I want to listen to you talk

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.080
some more.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.080
Alright.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.080
In the same way.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080
Larry, you're on the air.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080
Go ahead.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080
Hey Alex, good day.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.080
How you doing?

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.920
Did you hear Jeanette Hanson this morning on the Peacock Channel?

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.040
Well, they call it the Peacock Channel, but if you strip his wings off, sure looks like

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.120
an oblique view of a horned owl to me.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.120
Get him!

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120
I love it.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.120
Who the fuck are you, man?

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120
That is great.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:33.120
I just imagine that guy writing that out while he's on hold.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.040
I was gonna say, that's not a turn of phrase that one just pops into mind.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.800
Oh, the Peacock Network, it looks like an oblique horned owl to me.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.600
That's well practiced, sir.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.400
Yeah, that was, that's either a mirror or a thing you have said to a lot of people to

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400
bore them.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.800
Yeah, I wish his call was more interesting, but I did enjoy that.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800
That is nice.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800
He came out swinging.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800
Yeah.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.800
Ah, that's good.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.720
He gets to talking about a story that his cousin told him, and I don't know if this

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.720
is Buckley.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.720
I don't think it is.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
It could be any cousin.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.920
Yeah, it must be another cousin.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.160
And unfortunately, all, well, you'll see.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160
Okay.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.960
My cousin, two Mondays ago, was sitting in my living room, been in the Army for 20 years.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960
He's an officer.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.880
They were given a briefing this year.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:25.840
They're all getting microchips, the entire armed services.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.680
And then it goes into the general public, and they're telling them brace for more terror,

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.480
we'll have to give up all our rights, the Army's gonna run our lives, but the border

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.680
will stay wide open.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.640
Okay, so 18 years later, the military isn't all chipped, right?

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.040
They are all chipped.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.040
Ooh.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.040
Yes.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.040
So Alex was right about this?

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040
Or was he wrong about this?

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040
No, 100%.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.920
Every single military member is chipped upon introduction.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
Uh-huh.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.280
You know those guys, the recruiters at your high school?

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280
Yeah.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.520
And when they shake their hand, they are implanting you with a computer.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.520
They have one of those little assassin's blades?

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520
Exactly, yeah, yeah.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.960
No, it's like a clown buzzer, you know?

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.120
But you get it, and they're like, ha ha, wasn't that a funny joke?

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.640
And then they stare deep into your eyes and program you.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640
Right, right.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.400
And then, to get you out of your trance, a flower on their lapel squirts you with water.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400
Yes, it squirts you in the...

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400
That's how you wake up.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.400
And then, naturally, they slip on a banana peel, walking away from you.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.400
Of course.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400
So everybody's getting chipped.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400
Uh-huh.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400
They're all getting this one to come around.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.400
Right.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.800
But this caller has verified Alex's story, because they have also heard that a military

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.780
friend of theirs is talking about how everyone's getting chipped.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.840
Military friends are popular these days.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.920
And Larry in Louisiana was saying he just talked to an E-8 that got back from North

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.120
Korea who said they're all getting their chipped, got the same briefing.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.280
You know, that's Twilight Zone, folks, but you're not patriotic if you're against it.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.160
Let me tell you what the tactic's gonna be.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:56.140
The globalists are gonna blow stuff up and claim that anti-chipping, anti-biometric groups

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.320
are doing it.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.160
And so if you're anti-chip, anti-world leader, you're with the terrorists.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.360
Larry, you can see the script, can't you?

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360
Yes, I see it exactly.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:11.480
So, I mean, this is what I'm talking about when I say that this is just interactive improvisational

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.480
storytelling.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.480
Yeah.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.000
Alex is just coming up with a story for them to get excited about on this day.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.080
Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.400
Now, the globalists are scripting this stuff, so that's how I can predict it.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.920
I know that this is what's gonna happen, they're gonna blow up stuff and blame it on the anti-chip

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920
people.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.920
Naturally.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
Okay.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.920
Yeah.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920
Yep.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.920
Anti-chip people.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.920
Now, here's what's interesting.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920
What's interesting?

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920
I think I would be opposed to mandatory chips.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920
Oh, yeah.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:41.000
I haven't given it enough thought to really have a strong position on it, let's say, but

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.400
whatever direction I would fall on it after giving it some thought, I'd have a pretty

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.760
coherent position on it.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.760
Yeah.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:53.160
I would want a couple of assurances like mind control.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.160
First question.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.160
Are you gonna mind control me?

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160
Right?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160
You can't ask that.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160
I've gotta ask that.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160
What else would I ask?

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.640
Well, I mean, obviously the answer is gonna be no, even if it's yes.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.680
Yeah, but I gotta look them in the eyes.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.680
Right.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680
I'll know if they're lying to me.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.680
They're evil eyes.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680
Exactly.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.560
You gotta look into the evil eye and then I can tell.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560
Yeah, sure.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560
Mind control, no good.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.560
What else?

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.560
No mind control.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.560
Electroshocks, no good.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.840
No, I think I'd be fine with a little electroshock here and there, you know, but as long as it's

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.600
not somebody doing something, doing it for weird reasons.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.880
Ooh, I think you're going to have to really litigate what's weird.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.360
Well, again, we're going to sit here.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360
We're going to talk about it.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.660
I'm going to look them in their evil eyes and we're going to hammer it out.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:37.760
Our next bonus episode can be going over the conditions under which you approve of chips.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.760
Yes, exactly.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.760
Well, I'll have a full-

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.600
We'll really work this out.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.280
Right out of contract.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.840
But for Alex, he's supposed to be totally against it.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.840
Yes.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.160
He thinks that it's like the mark of beast stuff.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.960
It's the mark of the beast.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.800
Unfortunately, he's inconsistent as hell.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.480
To be in the army, they want someone who will take a microchip.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.000
I mean, I am some weird one, you know, you can see special forces getting one, but no,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.960
the entire troops all for their identification, no, no, this is setting the precedent.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.920
Wait, so, but why wouldn't special forces getting it be setting a precedent?

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.880
Well, you got to mind control special forces, Dan.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.880
But you understand, this is silly.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880
This is nonsense.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.680
I am staunchly opposed to giving microchips to people in the military unless they're in

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.680
special forces.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680
Yeah.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.520
Well, I mean, obviously you want Green Berets to have computer chips.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.200
That's just, that just makes perfect sense.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.480
I don't understand why.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:39.080
I don't get what the relevant differences between people in special forces, if the argument

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.880
is that Alex is trying to make, which is a big part of it, which is they give it to the

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880
military.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880
That normalizes it.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.000
So then it becomes something that goes to the citizens.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Right.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.640
Now you could just take one step further and be like, they give it to special forces.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.400
That normalizes it for the military and that normalizes it for the population.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.400
No, no, no.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.360
Slippery slopes only work if you start where I say this top is.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.600
It doesn't make sense.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.800
No, no, no, no.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.360
Just cause we're starting in the middle of the slippery slope, meaning that we've already

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.000
had to go from somewhere to get here.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.400
This is pretty dumb.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.400
Yeah.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.000
So 2003 was a very different time in the anti vaccination community.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Oh, that's good.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
No, it wasn't.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
No, I didn't think so.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
It wasn't great then either.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
No, I doubted it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:24.280
So some of these ideas about autism links with vaccination and like mercury and the

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:30.240
preservatives and stuff, it was a little bit less uniform in the anti-vax community.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.920
They hadn't had a lot of the other, let's say maybe even stupider ideas shot down.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920
Right.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.920
Right.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.920
Was this...

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.920
Jenny McCarthy was...

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.240
I'm not positive about her timeline.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.240
Yeah.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240
I don't know that either.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:52.160
I'm not sure, but I do know that at this point there are anti-vax proponents who are making

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:58.240
the argument that mercury in the preservatives has a link to autism.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.240
Sure.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.240
Sure.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.160
Now at this point, Alex doesn't think that.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.160
Alex is trying to stake a claim on something weirder in anti vaccination.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160
All right.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.160
Okay.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.160
That he will not stand by today, I don't think.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160
Okay.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.160
Okay.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.680
Boy believes a mercury-based preservative added to the vaccines during the 90s may have

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.680
caused the autism.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.680
Uh-uh.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.960
That's the cover story.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:27.720
It's the hormone designed in a brain development hormone to attack cerebral cortex development.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:34.320
Most of you just get an IQ reduction, people that compromise immune systems get severely

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.560
retarded or autistic.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.600
Little gift from your government.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.360
So Alex doesn't say what this hormone is, and I'm not sure.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.280
I'm not going to go on a wild goose chase and then just assume that I found whatever

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280
he's talking about.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.000
But if he does get into this, we'll talk about it in greater depth.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.040
But yeah, so the argument is being put forth to him that there is mercury in the vaccines

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.080
and stuff.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:01.320
That is pretty close to his current position on anti vaccination.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.320
Right.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.320
Right, right, right.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.960
That is safe territory for him now.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960
Sure.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.280
But back then, he didn't have that.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.840
He wanted another, he wanted his own version of this.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.520
Yeah, he had to jump it up.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.400
It wasn't just mercury, which is a natural occurring, it's a naturally occurring element.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.520
You can drink gallons of that stuff, they're fucking with you.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:28.200
No, what it is, is they grow hormones in labs for brains to then put in there and that's

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.200
what does it.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.980
Yeah, I think that's interesting.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.080
I would like to know what he feels about this now.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080
That would be interesting.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.360
He believes that there's some weird hormone that's actually behind, and I wonder if he'd

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.920
like to interview some of his weird anti-vax friends about that.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920
Oh, that would be interesting.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.920
See if they stand by that nonsense.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.520
Yeah, what do you got?

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.520
So Alex gets a caller.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.960
This made me so happy.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.280
God damn, did this make me happy.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.640
Was this back when Young Man House Phone was around?

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.640
No.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.640
Oh.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.420
This caller is the same person who called and Alex argued with him about the Republic

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.420
of Texas.

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.420
Okay, okay.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.000
And Alex is clearly annoyed with this guy.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Sure.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.360
And you don't really get, like, it doesn't become clear that Alex knows who he's talking

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.480
to until the end of this clip.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.200
And that's when it just, this is great.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200
This is just so good.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200
All right.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.920
Later on when this crap goes down, this bad stuff goes down, we need these people on our

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920
side.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.080
So just real quick as a sort of introduction, this caller has said that he took one of Alex's

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:34.800
films to the Aspen Sheriff's Department and he woke up the sheriff and everybody on the

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.800
force.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.800
And so, like, now Aspen-

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.720
That really does sound like it happens, though, doesn't it?

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720
I don't think so.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.040
It feels like that's how they get-

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.120
I think it might happen where someone is like, hey, did you watch that DVD?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.120
Blew my mind, man.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.120
Real good.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120
Yeah, it killed it.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120
It was great.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.120
Gotta go.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.120
So anyway, that's what the beginning of this call is.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120
Well, we do.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.120
I mean, I have nothing against police.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:00.920
Standing with a constitutionalist and standing against the New World Order and the deception,

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.400
the lies, and the fraud.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.720
I heartily agree with you.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.800
What you did was just so- is this Aspen, Texas, or Aspen, Colorado?

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.520
It's Aspen, the Republic of Texas.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.440
They call it Colorado, but it still belongs to the Republic of Texas.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.440
No, I understand.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440
But-

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440
The Northwest Territory.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440
So where is this in Texas?

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.720
This is up in the Rocky Mountain.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.080
Yeah, that's what I said.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.520
Is this in Texas, or is this in Colorado?

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.360
Well, they call it Colorado, but-

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360
I understand, sir, but-

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360
It belongs-

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360
Okay.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360
Okay, Alex?

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360
No?

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360
Okay.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.360
I know.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.640
I think he called about this earlier a few days ago.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.520
He did.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.360
I like the thread that's going through these episodes that I'm getting to enjoy where Alex

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.720
is pissed off by Republic of Texas people.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:44.720
It is nice.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:45.720
It is nice.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.680
I do appreciate that.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:52.000
Because he has this whole thing that's like, Texas is its own country, it gets a seed.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.400
But these other people are like, yeah, Texas is a country, and it involves a bunch of place

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400
to the north.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.400
Yes, I do.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400
I do.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.600
We got most of New Mexico, Colorado.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.960
I don't appreciate how that community is still allowed to have people that are too far out

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960
there.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.960
Y'all are crazy.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:13.960
Don't judge them for being like, and also the Northwest Territory is ours too.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:19.300
You are mad because your ideas look just as ridiculous as theirs, and theirs make you

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.440
feel ridiculous.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.440
Yeah.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.600
I think that is a part of it, and I think that something that I really enjoy is Alex's

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.000
ability to sort of play with the guy back then.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.120
Like, Alex could not do that now.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.120
No.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.480
The idea of him sitting there and being like, is that Aspen, Texas, or Aspen, Colorado?

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.920
Yeah, him doubling down on like, hey man, just go ahead and say exactly what you and

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.560
I both know you're about to say.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.320
I recognize your voice.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.160
You know that you're the guy who pisses me off about the Republic of Texas.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160
Yep, yep.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.880
I know, I'm gonna ask you this leaded question.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:59.320
Hey buddy, hey buddy, Aspen, I know, I've heard a name of Aspen before, and is that

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.840
a city in Colorado, buddy?

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.840
Nope, Texas.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840
No, Texas.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:10.600
So we get another caller, and this fella is really lauding Alex, been lauding him.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600
Nice.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.000
About opposition to the Patriot Act.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Yes.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.200
There have been some places that have passed resolutions, some cities, city councils, and

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.200
what have you.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.880
If you listen closely to this clip, though, this caller is congratulating Alex for doing

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:32.520
something that he himself is literally saying was done by communists.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:39.120
Well, the Democrat socialist, Steve Leal, the resolution's primary sponsor on the city

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:44.480
council, said if the EPA were talking about lessening water's quality standards, we'd

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.320
think it was a city issue, but if they're polluting our rights, it is also a city issue.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.360
So this guy, you know, you did some good, and I wanted to commend you on it, and they

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:59.040
got your resolution, because I know at least a dozen people that send your resolution to

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.800
the city council and also to the county.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.340
And so you got some positive results, and we want to thank you for it, and I'm really

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:11.720
proud that my communist city government decided to support the Constitution of the United

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720
States.

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.840
Oh, isn't that cute?

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:20.680
He's calling these people super-left socialists who wrote the resolution.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.680
You can't do that.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.880
And the communist government passed it, but somehow Alex is responsible for this.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.520
It's outrageous.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.000
This is kind of amazing.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
You know what?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I get it.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I get it.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.360
Every time something good happens, it's because of the left ideas, but you can't just allow

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.360
them.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:48.000
What's done by actual activists, primarily on the left, is sometimes yelled about and

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.680
taken credit for by people who yell, like Alex.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.680
Yeah.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.680
I mean, that's all he does.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:53.680
He just yells.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.360
No, once something becomes popular, then it's the conservatives who did it, like, oh, man,

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.800
Social Security, Medicare, we can't let that stuff get out of hand.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:08.380
I mean, naturally, when it was being passed, we would have called it a communist land grab

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.840
trying to kill us all and steal our money.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.480
But now that it has, now that we have it and it works, wow, it's our favorite program.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.480
Yeah.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480
Yep.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480
There is that phenomenon.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480
Yep.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.280
So Alex, towards the end of this episode, gets a little bit into his own head, and he's talking

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.840
a bit about how, like, people ask him why he's not dead, fighting the globalists, and

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.840
what have you.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.400
And he talks about being ready to die for freedom.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.560
I mean, if they put a gun to my head right now and said renounce freedom, renounce your

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:44.520
family, renounce God, or we'll kill you, I'd say pull the trigger, bud.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.920
I mean, I would.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.800
Go ahead.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.840
It's remarkable how that's almost exactly mirrored by if someone had a gun to my head

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.120
and told me to denounce Trump, I'd say pull the trigger.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.120
Yeah.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.160
Freedom, God, family, all that, just sort of Trump.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
Oh, boy.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.320
It's kind of depressing.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.440
It's super depressing.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:11.200
So we have one last clip, Jordan, and in this clip, Alex is in a bit of a rant about being

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200
alive.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200
Right.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.200
And he has felt things.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.120
I suppose that I will accept that as a premise.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.200
And I think that this is getting a little bit closer to that territory of religiosity

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.360
that we might be keeping our finger on the pulse of.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360
That sounds right.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:34.360
If you don't know how evil they are, if you aren't burning with desire to expose the New

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.480
World Order, you're nuts.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.320
And if we just have this upfront, ready to sacrifice, ready to stand up attitude about

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.640
defending America, this New World Order would not be here.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.180
We become fat and decadent and always about the next pleasure.

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.560
And so we're dead on the inside.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560
So you know what?

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.040
I have really lived.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.160
I can say that I have lived.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:59.280
I have been so alive, it hurts, okay?

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.680
I have had understandings that are painful.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.000
I have plumbed the depths of the New World Order.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.360
I can't even articulate it.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.000
And I know a lot of you have too.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.720
And you have perspectives that I don't have and a lot of you are smarter than I am.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.720
But I know this.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.860
I am on my course and I'll tell you this, we're a lot safer standing up and speaking

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:24.360
out and being bold and depending on God's preservation, depending on God's providence

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.580
and God is real.

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.580
I have had experiences.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.680
I know God is real.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.960
I have faith.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.940
And God isn't on the 700 Club, folks, I'm sorry to tell you.

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:35.200
God isn't in these big churches.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.200
I'm sorry.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.100
He's not, folks.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:41.200
God is in your heart if you simply let him in.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.560
And that's what we're talking about here.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.720
And I'm telling you, if you don't hate evil and are not disgusted by it, something is

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.120
wrong with you and you are not alive.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.920
There is not even a question.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.800
Frankly, there is not even temptation anymore.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:01.280
When you go this far into the fight against the New World Order, it is a total commitment.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.760
You will be so alive.

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.360
It will completely consume your life because you will be fighting pure evil.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.900
You must join in the fight against the New World Order.

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:13.440
That's one of the things that I always love, the idea that Alex brings out that it's like,

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.120
I no longer feel human emotions.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.120
Yeah.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.120
Yeah.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.120
I have no longer drawn to sin.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.720
I have progressed beyond that which other mortal men know.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.720
Because the fight on the globalist is so strong in the New World Order.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.720
I found that clip to be really on the line.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720
Yeah.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.920
Because I do think an argument can still be made that a lot of that is, you know, it's

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.920
just kind of Christian-ish.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.720
Yeah, I think that's-

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.120
God's in your heart, he's not in the 700 Club.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.120
Sure.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.760
That's not as extremist, certainly, as a lot of the stuff we hear more recent days.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760
Right.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.560
And when he says that you're up against pure evil, that could still be metaphorical flourish.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.560
Sure.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.560
As opposed to what we know he believes now.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560
Naturally.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560
No.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560
That's what he believes.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560
Yes.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.560
Invading people.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560
Yes.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560
Yeah.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560
Yeah, that is true.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.200
I do think that should come out much sooner in a conversation and it should be something

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.520
that you have to lead with.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:09.920
Like if you're doing Alex's show, you should have to lead with like, I believe that our

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:13.520
political enemies are literally controlled by the devil like every day.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.520
Yeah.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:18.780
Just like if when I meet somebody, they're like, you should have to tell me if you believe

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.880
that the biblical flood story is 100% true.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.880
And then I can be like, okay, fine.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.680
Then you don't get an opinion on vaccines.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.440
You know, like just get it out of the way so we can move forward.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.560
I don't need to know anything else about you.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:36.200
I think, I think it's more like a situation where, um, if, if you're gonna like, let's

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.960
say start dating somebody or whatever, and they don't tell you that they think the earth

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.960
is flat.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.960
Yeah.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.960
It's rude.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.960
That's kind of irresponsible.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960
That's rude.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:50.320
And I, yeah, I think, I think that Alex as a person who's conveying information, I think

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:56.400
it is, it is relevant if you believe that the devil is behind the gears of your enemies.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:01.440
I think you should be upfront about it because it gives people the ability to consider that

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.960
in the totality of the information you're presenting and taking it more seriously.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.560
I honestly can't quite tell yet.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.560
Yeah.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.560
Um, no, I agree.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.520
I've heard, but there's more indications than I was expecting necessarily.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:20.360
And I think it's probably not coincidental that like this, God is real.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360
God is there.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360
Right.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
Is at the end of his episode.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360
Right.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360
Right.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360
Right.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.360
I don't think that he would leave the episode with it.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.360
No, I would doubt that.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.720
I think that's there for the, the stalwarts, the people who are, who are in.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720
Yeah.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:36.480
If you have a disclaimer for like a video game trailer, that's like, some scenes are

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.440
not actual gameplay.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.720
You should at least have to have a disclaimer for like, also believes that the devil is

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720
real.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720
You know, like that should be there.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720
Yeah.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.720
Somewhere.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.360
I mean, his bumpers coming in from break are like, you know, like, do you want to fight

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360
corruption?

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360
Well, so does he.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.560
Like, that's not what this is about.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.560
No, no, no, no.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.560
Yeah.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.560
Yeah.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.240
Do you believe that you're a crusader against the literal Christian devil?

01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.240
That's this show.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.240
Yeah.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240
Okay.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.240
Okay.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240
All right.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.240
Well then now we get it.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.440
Do you think that demons jump into people and make them go bleh?

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.440
Yes.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440
Yes, I do, sir.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.440
I will listen.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.440
Well, so does Alex.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.440
Yes.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.440
There we go.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.440
Yeah.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:17.360
I mean, it's, uh, it's an interesting, it's an interesting progression and I'm fascinated

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:21.240
by this and I, and this is so much more listenable, uh, in the past.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:26.560
Like it's totally, totally, it's, it's absolutely, and these callers are weirdos in a fun way.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:27.560
It seems like a show.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:28.560
Yeah.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.560
It seems like a show.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560
Yeah.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.560
What we listen to now is not a show.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.560
That is just a man unraveling.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.680
Well, you know, too, like one of the things that's really fun and creates comedic tension

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.400
in like Frasier is that some of the callers are annoying to him.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.400
Yes.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400
Of course.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.400
It's a fun show.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.400
There's this tension.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.400
You don't know what you're going to get.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400
Yeah.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.240
It's this Republic of Texas person keeps annoying.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.240
That's so funny.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:54.700
And, uh, yeah, I enjoy that and, uh, I hope that every episode I listen to he gets into

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:58.360
a fight with somebody who believes just slightly the wrong thing.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360
Yeah.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360
Yeah.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360
Yeah.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360
Just, oh man.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.260
It's so ridiculous that you think that the Magna Carta is still the law of the land

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.360
unless you're in capital letters and it's a corporation.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.900
Now obviously the literal Christian devil is sending demons into people's brains to

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.720
control their actions.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.720
Tell me.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.720
Sure.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.720
Yeah.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.720
Um, anyway.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.720
Yeah.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.600
Jordan, this has been a, an episode.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600
Indeed it has.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.000
Uh, we will be back checking in on the present day, I believe on our next episode.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.060
But until then, we got a website.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.440
We do have a website, Dan.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.440
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.180
We have a Twitter.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.840
We are on Twitter, Dan.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.680
It is at knowledge underscore fight and at go to bed.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.680
Jordan.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.680
Yep.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.680
We're also on Facebook.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.680
We are on Facebook.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.880
And if you would like to download the show, please go to, and if you could please find

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:51.120
a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people doing God's work.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120
Yeah.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.120
We'll be back.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.120
But until then, I'm Neo.
