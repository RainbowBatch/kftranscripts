Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

I have great respect for Knowledgefight, Knowledgefight.

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

It's time to pray.

Andy and Kansas you're on the earth, thanks for holding.

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,800

I'm Jordan.

27
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,580
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,820
bit about Alex Jones.

29
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,820
Scratch that.

30
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,140
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a

31
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,140
little bit about Alex Jones.

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,140
Jordan!

33
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,140
Jordan.

34
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,140
Dan.

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,140
What's up?

36
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,940
I got a quick question for you.

37
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,940
What do you got going on?

38
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,980
One, who's the deity you worship?

39
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,580
And two, what's your bright spot?

40
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,580
So Selene, of course.

41
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,580
Naturally.

42
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,460
And second, my bright spot, I feel like, look, I took a lot of beating from people about

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,420
this whole doors thing.

44
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,420
Okay.

45
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:43,380
I do, look, we're in straight up Alex ad territory, where you immediately started with look.

46
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,380
Look assholes.

47
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,380
Took a lot of pummeling over that, perhaps well deserved.

48
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Sure.

49
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,940
So I've decided to open myself up to even more criticism.

50
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,940
Okay.

51
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
All right.

52
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
Okay.

53
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,820
So I went down the street the other day and I got it in my head that I was like, I haven't

54
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,740
listened to methods of mayhem in a long time.

55
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,740
Sure.

56
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,740
Sure.

57
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,740
You remember that?

58
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
The Tommy Lee rap rock project?

59
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,300
Yes, I do, Dan.

60
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,460
I happen to remember that that exists.

61
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,380
I haven't listened to that in a long time.

62
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,820
I wondered if it held up.

64
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,820
And let me say.

65
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,820
How does it hold up, Dan?

66
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
Well, I listened to three songs.

67
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,820
I wondered if it held up.

68
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,820
It never held up.

69
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,460
It was like a shelf that was on the floor.

70
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
I liked it.

71
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
It didn't hold up.

72
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
I liked it when I was younger.

73
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,460
Okay.

74
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,460
Okay.

75
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,460
I didn't have good taste.

76
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,460
Okay.

77
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,460
I had a Kid Rock period.

78
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Okay.

79
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
Look, I grew up in Missouri.

80
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,460
No, no, I'm sorry.

81
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,460
That was an overly aggressive reaction.

82
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
Sure.

83
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,380
So I listened to the Kid Rock song, New Skin.

84
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,380
Sure.

85
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Sure.

86
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
Not good.

87
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,380
Not good.

88
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,740
Also, it seems like there's a theme to the song that is supposed to be about like a new

89
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,900
beginning and like sort of like finding a new piece.

90
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Sure.

91
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,900
Tommy Lee's famous for metaphor.

92
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,620
Kid Rock did not get the memo on that.

93
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
Oh, no.

94
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,180
Nothing to do thematically with the song.

95
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,140
Second song I listened to was Get Naked.

96
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,140
And that song is embarrassing.

97
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,140
What?

98
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,140
Oh, no.

99
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,140
No, Dan.

100
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,060
I know that's your response, but it's more embarrassing even than that, like how you're

101
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,060
responding.

102
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,060
Of course it's embarrassing.

103
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,300
You would still be like, oh my God.

104
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,900
I will tell you this.

105
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,120
I have not revisited it.

106
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
No plans.

107
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,620
It's gross and weird.

108
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,620
Sure.

109
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Sure.

110
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,900
I think I'm somebody who's all kind of, you know, I'm sex positive.

111
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I think everybody's cool.

112
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Sure.

113
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,800
Did the nudes do a guest verse on it too?

114
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Is that how creepy it is?

115
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
No, no.

116
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,020
That would have been a different kind of embarrassing and uncomfortable.

117
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Okay.

118
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,020
All right.

119
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
No, it was just.

120
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,020
There's a song on there called Proposition Fuck You.

121
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,460
I think that one was actually, that actually holds up.

122
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Oh, does it?

123
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Yeah.

124
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,460
Is it about like Prop 21?

125
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
What are we talking about?

126
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,460
No.

127
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,900
It's tied to the boys in blue running up on your crew.

128
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
You know what to do.

129
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Tell them, fuck you.

130
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
All right.

131
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Well.

132
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,900
It's a proposition.

133
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Fuck you.

134
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Fuck you.

135
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
It's a proposition.

136
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,380
So the whole thing was about like, hey, yeah, I got a ballot measure for you.

137
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,780
How about you go fuck yourself.

138
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Okay.

139
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,940
See now, now I understand that previously you said that this song was good.

140
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
I think it holds up.

141
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,220
And then you just sang me a little bit of it.

142
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,220
Uh-huh.

143
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,260
I beg strongly to differ.

144
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:22,300
I feel like it's, I'm sure it wasn't intended as satire of political outrage or like an

145
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,460
expression of like some kind of, I don't know, there wasn't a greater statement other than

146
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
fuck you.

147
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,220
What if we were a fourth rate rage against the machine?

148
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,980
Look, it works on that level.

149
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
Anyway.

150
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
No, that's fair.

151
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,980
methods of mayhem, my bright spot.

152
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
What's yours?

153
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,860
Uh, well I have a hard time with this as my bright spot because it is going to be unrevealed.

154
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,500
But I have completed a new project that I will be working on.

155
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,740
Please be a rap album with Tommy Lee.

156
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,620
I will not be a rap album with Tommy Lee, it will be a sex tape with Tommy Lee.

157
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,180
And yeah, I'm very excited about it.

158
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,620
It's a whole new thing for me.

159
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,820
It's something that I've wanted to try for a long time and I've finally stepped up.

160
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I think I know what you're talking about.

161
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,820
I think you do as well.

162
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,980
I'm excited about this project as well.

163
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,980
You know, I was a little worried that you wouldn't be excited about it, but I'm excited

164
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,660
now that I know that you're pumped.

165
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,540
And also I'm excited because it does not involve more work for me.

166
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Exactly.

167
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,300
In fact, this will be almost a complete reversal of fortune where I will be planning on doing

168
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
all of the work.

169
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,900
This kind of sucks a little bit for the listeners in as much as it is like a huge tease.

170
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,660
It's a huge tease, but that's what I'm in here for.

171
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
The payoff will be great.

172
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
I hope so.

173
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,660
And I think everyone will love it.

174
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
Or it'll be a disaster.

175
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
Oh yes.

176
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,420
It'll be a future bright spot or a methods of mayhem.

177
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
Let's see.

178
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Yeah.

179
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
So today, Jordan, we are back in the present.

180
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,140
We're going to be talking about April 26th and 27th, 2021 Blackjack.

181
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,420
I was ready for it that time.

182
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,420
Shit.

183
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,980
I had the B first, but I think you said the word faster.

184
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
We tied.

185
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
We tied.

186
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,220
That was a tie.

187
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,740
So what I wanted to do for this episode was I wanted to do more of the week, but I got

188
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,820
kind of caught up in some of the Alex stuff at the beginning of the week.

189
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,300
And I didn't want to get mixed up with the Giuliani got raided kind of news of the end

190
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
of the week.

191
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,960
I thought like it would all be too much to cover in one.

192
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,220
So the end of the week we'll cover on Monday, beginning of the week, we're going to cover

193
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,220
today.

194
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,700
Um, and uh, yeah, the knowledge fight, your source for breaking news yesterday's bullshit

195
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
tomorrow.

196
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,500
We'll get, uh, get that on a shirt.

197
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,280
Yesterday's bullshit next week.

198
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,340
But before we get to the episode, we've got to give us some hellos to some walks before

199
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,340
that.

200
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,380
I have a one out of context drop because I have two today, so I'm excited to spread them

201
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
out.

202
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
Here's the first one.

203
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,580
Oh, here comes the sex robots.

204
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
Here comes the sex robots.

205
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,420
Now I have a question.

206
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,740
Does this involve also the Daleks with guns?

207
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,980
Because if you could combine the two, you're unstoppable.

208
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,340
I was thinking about introducing our, uh, shout outs with, and now here comes the sex

209
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
robots.

210
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,900
Um, so first, uh, Ville, I don't know how to pronounce that V-I-L-L-E, Ville, whatever

211
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
you want.

212
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,980
S uh, last initial.

213
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
Thank you so much.

214
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
You are now policy wonk.

215
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,580
Your birthday was on the 29th.

216
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,580
Shout out.

217
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580
I'm a policy wonk.

218
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Thank you very much.

219
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,100
Ville, Ville, or Ville.

220
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Yes.

221
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Next.

222
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Jordan Holmes, non-binary twin.

223
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Thank you so much.

224
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
You are now a policy wonk.

225
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I'm a policy wonk.

226
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Thank you very much.

227
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
My non-binary binary twin.

228
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,420
I forgot to put an apostrophe on there and I confused myself reading it.

229
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
Yeah.

230
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,660
That sounds like Jordan Holmes, the non-binary binary twin, which would be a good nickname

231
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
for me.

232
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Uh, next.

233
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,500
My wife says she has nightmares of Alex Jones voice because I listened to your podcast too

234
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
much.

235
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Uh, you are now policy wonk.

236
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm a policy wonk.

237
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,620
Thank you very much.

238
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,600
And as always, let's remind you that if you are listening too much, we are fine with you

239
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
taking a break.

240
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Please stop.

241
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Please stop.

242
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
It's bad for you.

243
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
It's bad for you.

244
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,100
Um, then, uh, get to some technocrats here to give a shout out to first we got will and

245
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
thank you so much.

246
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
You are now a technocrat.

247
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,060
Uh, Preston L thank you so much.

248
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,980
You're now a technocrat and Bob, the human animal chimera.

249
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Thank you so much.

250
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
You are now a technocrat.

251
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
I'm a policy wonk.

252
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
Crikey mate.

253
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
That's fantastic.

254
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
Have yourself a brew.

255
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
How's your 401k doing, bro?

256
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,780
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson.

257
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,620
All right, let's just get down to business.

258
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,620
We ain't making that money off that heroin while you pimp so good.

259
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,260
My neck is freakishly large.

260
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,020
I declare info war on you.

261
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Thank you all.

262
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
Yes.

263
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,020
Thank you very much to the three of you.

264
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,140
Now, Jordan, we've got one little special thing, um, on, uh, on, uh, our last episode

265
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,940
right after we finished recording right after we finished.

266
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,940
I got an email.

267
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
Of course.

268
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
I had an email from my Ashley.

269
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,340
We wanted us to give a birthday shout out to, uh, to Matthew.

270
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,500
His birthday was on Tuesday.

271
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
His birthday was on Tuesday.

272
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
We weren't able to do it.

273
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
We can't do that.

274
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
I felt like shit.

275
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
We can't do that.

276
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
It's not your fault.

277
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,260
So now in the past, Matthew, I know your birthday was on Tuesday, but I hope you had a good

278
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
one.

279
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Hope you had a great one.

280
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
And I hope things are going great.

281
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,020
And, uh, that, uh, you, you got to, I don't know, I want to know how old Matthew is before

282
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
I hope.

283
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
27.

284
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
27.

285
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
I hope he had an okay birthday.

286
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Hmm.

287
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,020
I'm just hoping for an okay birthday.

288
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,700
27, 27 is a year where you usually have a let down birth.

289
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,100
Also got a young one on the way.

290
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,420
June coming soon.

291
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,060
Uh, shout out to this baby.

292
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,780
Like a new sneakers dropping guys got a birthday and a new baby dropping baby.

293
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
First thing.

294
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,340
Don't listen to any Tommy Lee albums now or in the future or otherwise.

295
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,020
I hate to say it, but I mean, if you want to base your political identity on a proposition,

296
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
fuck you.

297
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,020
Maybe there's something to it.

298
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,780
Well, you know, I'll side with you on that though.

299
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,340
Um, so, uh, happy birthday to you, Matthew.

300
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,620
Um, Jordan, here is our next out of context.

301
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,140
Stop before we get to today's show.

302
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,420
You know, I know a major cattleman.

303
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,660
I served under major cattleman.

304
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,580
You sir are no major cattleman.

305
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Okay.

306
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,580
All right.

307
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,260
All right.

308
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,780
Here is the beginning, uh, Alex opening up the show here on April 26th and it is a bummer

309
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:07,460
or I took off Saturday and Sunday at least about 90% actually unplugged myself from the

310
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
computer.

311
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,820
It's been more time with the family and it just intensified my clarity about where we

312
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,060
are and what we're facing.

313
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,940
Are we getting our neighbors dead species on this planet and the big transformation

314
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,480
for the worst that is taking place.

315
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,060
And here's the final equation.

316
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,780
If we don't have a total awakening to the fact that we're under threat and we're under

317
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,980
attack at the globalist, you're building what they call a posthuman world, then we don't

318
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:45,500
have any shot at changing this or we're fixing this and it's been the process of industrialization.

319
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,140
It's been the process of modernization that has really turned us into these domesticated

320
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,980
ignorant creatures that don't even know how to defend ourselves, take care of ourselves

321
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,580
and each generation going forward is less human.

322
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,420
Let me tell you about the candle.

323
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Alright.

324
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,020
Yeah, yeah, the force of modernity has made us less human and each generation subsequently

325
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,020
will be less human because of computers.

326
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,900
Unsurprisingly, Alex is that guy at a party.

327
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:23,100
Listen, look, I'm not saying that the Unabomber was good, but if you've read his manifesto

328
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm not saying he was wrong.

329
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,820
He's got some stuff to say.

330
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
I don't know.

331
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
He's a smart guy.

332
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
He built his own bombs.

333
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
You gotta be smart to do that.

334
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,180
That guy at a party is a bummer.

335
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,340
That guy not at a party, also a bummer.

336
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
Let's remind ourselves.

337
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
Always a bummer.

338
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,300
So yeah, Alex is in a weird mood.

339
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Sure.

340
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,100
Unabomber is a weird mood.

341
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Yeah.

342
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,620
So we heard on our last present day episode that Bill Maher, secret patriot.

343
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,380
Yes, I'm hard time fitting that into our canon.

344
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,340
It was quite a shift for Bill.

345
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:01,580
He really got an upgrade from ventriloquist dummy of the globalists to basically Tucker

346
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,580
Carlson.

347
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,620
Here's the other reason that I know for a fact Alex is a huge fan of Star Wars.

348
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,740
Rhett Conning is his mate Raison Detre in many ways.

349
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,380
The man absolutely refuses to stick to canon.

350
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,700
Yeah, that is true, especially when things are convenient for him.

351
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,700
I have bad- Ray is not a Palpatine in my world.

353
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Anyways, sorry.

354
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
I have bad news.

355
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
What?

356
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,900
We are back to Bill Maher being one.

357
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Oh, okay.

358
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,980
I've gotten to the point where I can't watch a CNN piece or even a Bill Maher piece or

359
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,900
any of these propaganda pieces because I see the writing that's involved in it and I see

360
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,100
the multi-layered deceptions that are involved.

361
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:58,020
The level of propaganda has gotten even more sophisticated and these are very skilled,

362
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,260
very destructive people doing this.

363
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,100
Bill Maher's secret patriot run lasted two days or something.

364
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,500
That was honestly not a bad run for Bill Maher.

365
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
What the fuck?

366
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,420
I was expecting almost less than an hour.

367
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,420
So stupid.

368
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
So that's good news.

369
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,020
Oh, you think that's good news?

370
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,740
He's gotten to the point now where he can't watch a Bill- when was he not at that point?

371
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
A couple weeks ago.

372
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Okay, well that's fair.

373
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Yeah, he could watch a Bill Maher report.

374
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
That's fair.

375
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
He can see the scripting, man.

376
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Okay.

377
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
He can see all the propaganda.

378
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
All right.

379
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,060
No, but he can't watch it because the secret patriot is too secret in this circumstance.

380
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,420
Yeah, or maybe he was just talking shit the other day when he was like, I've heard from

381
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,580
higher ups that Bill Maher is actually kind of like Tucker.

382
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,740
He's like a good guy.

383
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,860
That sounds more reasonable.

384
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,540
So anyway, there's good news in the world amidst Alex's inability to watch news anymore.

385
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
Sure, sure.

386
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,900
You know, there's also a lot of positive things happening because there's always for every

387
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,380
action opposite- Wise.

388
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,980
An equal reaction.

389
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:05,100
But I've really, I don't want to say transcended, but I have risen above my enemies.

390
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,220
I've always been disgusted by them, I've always disliked them, but I haven't wanted to defeat

391
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,100
them so that I could be the top dog and be above them in this pile of skulls they sit

392
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
on top of.

393
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,300
I mean, I transcended them a long time ago.

394
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:24,700
I guess from the time I was born, the time spirit entered my body, but now I've really

395
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
transcended them.

396
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Oh boy.

397
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Oh boy.

398
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,180
So the good news is that Alex has transcended his enemies, although he did transcend them

399
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,140
when he was a baby.

400
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,220
And now he's really- Sure, sure, sure.

401
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,680
So we're on the same path as like David Lynch here.

402
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,820
Now we're into trans- What you need to do is transcend- Okay.

403
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Yeesh.

404
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
Yeah.

405
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,860
I was like, this is a mood, this is a- Unifomered to delusions of grandeur.

406
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,100
This is something- There's something there.

407
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,460
It's an interesting way to start the show.

408
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,180
And Alex pivots this talking about how he's really transcended now into saying that the

409
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
answer is transcendent.

410
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Oh, okay.

411
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
We all just have to transcend.

412
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,180
Okay, that's nice.

413
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,580
Because the answer is transcending these people.

414
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,580
We have to really transcend the new world order- Work for you.

415
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:21,300
And still resist it and still say no to it, but not even give it energy when we do it.

416
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:28,740
These are like sad, mad dogs with rabies foaming at the mouth out in the street.

417
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,700
And you know they're already done for and it's over for them.

418
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,420
So you need to just stay away from them and just try not to let them bite your children.

419
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,200
And I think that's really what it comes down to.

420
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,180
So I guess that means communes?

421
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Is that what he's trying to say?

422
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:49,340
Because if all of the world and the globalists and all the minions are all mad dogs out there-

423
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,340
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,140
Then you just gotta keep them away from biting your children and stay away from them.

425
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,200
They're gonna die of their own illness or whatever.

426
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,500
So yeah, communes?

427
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I don't know.

428
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,140
Alex got a phone call from Michelle Obama and she was like, listen, Alex, I know you've

429
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:11,500
never tried this before, but when they go low, all right, we transcend.

430
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
That's what we do.

431
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Yeah.

432
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I don't know.

433
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
It sounded like communes.

434
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Yeah.

435
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,140
And I doubt there's gonna be technology there based on his earlier statement.

436
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,160
It does seem like he's trying to go back to a pre-industrial world.

437
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,260
So not only that, he's also gonna shake up the transmission.

438
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,620
And I will say that if he had actually done this, he'd make a better show.

439
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Okay.

440
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
But he doesn't.

441
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
No.

442
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
He does not shake up the transmission.

443
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
Well, that sounds right.

444
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,980
And I'm your host, Alex Jones, promising you that this already important, informative avant-garde

445
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,100
transmission is now going to go to the next level.

446
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:56,140
And I'm gonna shake the transmission up with more of your calls, more quick guests, and

447
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,060
more special reports and more live, commercial-free podcasts.

448
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,260
You got my commitment that here in the home stretch of going into the next level, that

449
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:12,260
I will work even harder because things are moving very, very quickly and it is essential.

450
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,100
And because I'm gonna shake things up, something I never do, I always come on the show and

451
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,380
hit the big stories and dive right into the breaking, censored and suppressed information,

452
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,780
the systems fighting to make sure your family and others don't get it, then I usually just

453
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,500
barely plug at the end of the hour.

454
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,060
But a couple of big things have happened.

455
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,180
A, you need these products, they're amazing, and B, if you don't buy them, we won't be.

456
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,180
Really shaking up the show.

457
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,780
I'm shaking up the broadcast and I'm gonna listen to a bunch of stuff that I'm not gonna

458
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
do.

459
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,740
However, I just want to let everybody know, I'm gonna need to do more ad reads.

460
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,740
I'm going straight to it.

461
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,740
I'm going straight to ads from now on.

462
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,540
I'm gonna shake up the broadcast, I'm definitely gonna go to more calls.

463
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,540
Maybe not.

464
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
I'm gonna do more quick guests.

465
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
Probably not.

466
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,260
I actually don't think he took any calls on this show.

467
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,660
Why does that not surprise me?

468
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,980
I wouldn't describe any of the guests as being quick.

469
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,660
Yeah, but he did go to a plug real fast.

470
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
That's nice.

471
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,780
I got that weird mood that he was in and then right to a plug, I was like, this is fucked

472
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
up.

473
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
We're gonna be in trouble.

474
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,900
This is gonna be a ride.

475
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:21,500
So Alex gets to talking about some news and it's sort of what I believe is the new development

476
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,500
and evolution of COVID conspiracies and narratives.

477
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,740
In Europe and the UK, they're still almost completely shut down.

478
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,780
Tens of millions extra, it's just a footnote, have starved to death in the third world,

479
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:42,900
in Africa, in India, even in China, in Latin America, in areas of Asia, the Middle East.

480
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
We've got those numbers.

481
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,500
When people get malnutrition, any virus will kill them.

482
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,580
So if any virus, any virus.

483
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,820
If Alex has specific data on this, he should really discuss it because he just references

484
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,700
having this data and actually talking about it could be really illuminating.

485
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,900
I suspect he doesn't have any actual information.

486
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,140
He's just winging it and riffing off comments that were made by David Beasley, the UN food

487
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,140
program executive director back in September.

488
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,000
This is definitely a serious issue and it's one that Alex is definitely right to call

489
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
attention to.

490
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,780
But the way he calls attention to the problem of food insecurity in the developing world

491
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,460
does a disservice to the idea of actually helping understand or solve the problem.

492
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,880
And that's because Alex doesn't care about the actual problem.

493
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,900
He cares about using the impression that he cares about it to attack people who believe

494
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,440
that COVID-19 is an actual problem.

495
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,160
Food insecurity around the world is a complicated picture and you can't just say that lockdowns

496
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,820
in the US or Europe directly leads to worsening conditions in other countries.

497
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,460
For instance, this past year, countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, India, Pakistan and

498
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,540
Somalia have seen incredibly severe locust swarms that have had nothing to do with coronavirus

499
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,820
or any country's response to it.

500
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,580
COVID has affected the world's situation and made things worse, but there's a larger picture

501
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,180
than just what Alex wants to cover, which is essentially if all the businesses would

502
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,200
just open back up, everyone would be fine.

503
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,720
It's really troubling to see Alex try to get into the game of pretending that COVID deaths

504
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,280
are actually starvation deaths that are being covered up.

505
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,520
The basic problem here is that Alex is just making that up as a way for him to continue

506
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,900
his denial of this major pandemic.

507
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,940
But even beyond that, the numbers just don't work.

508
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,820
Concern USA released a list at the end of 2020 of the countries facing the greatest

509
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
food insecurity.

510
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,040
And if you compare that list to lists of countries and their COVID fatalities, you don't come

511
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,820
away with the conclusion that Alex wants you to.

512
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,900
Chad is the country facing the most food insecurity, the most severe food insecurity, but there

513
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,160
have only been 170 deaths from COVID there.

514
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,540
Timor-Leste is number two on the list, where there have been three COVID deaths.

515
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,240
Madagascar is number three, where there have been 614 deaths from COVID.

516
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,800
Haiti is number four, where they've registered 254 COVID deaths.

517
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,160
Only numbers nine and 10 on the list, Afghanistan and Nigeria respectively, have over a thousand

518
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,740
deaths total from COVID recorded.

519
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,000
Until early March, the US was seeing more COVID deaths per day than any of these countries

520
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,620
have had throughout the entire pandemic.

521
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,800
If Alex tries to redefine COVID deaths as secretly being starvation deaths, he's essentially

522
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,880
trying to use people's deaths as a political prop for his own narratives.

523
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,560
This behavior is nothing new to Alex, but it should be recognized as ghoulish, and people

524
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,240
should understand the disrespect that he's operating with towards people's humanity.

525
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,200
Yeah, you cannot, you just can't trust anybody who, when you're talking about engaging with

526
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,360
a serious issue, just goes, no, we don't need to do that.

527
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,920
What about this?

528
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,640
Because then what's the point?

529
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,280
We're always only ever going to be talking about whatever it is that you think is important,

530
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,720
and no matter what I say, it's going to change based on you not wanting to engage with what

531
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
I'm saying.

532
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,520
So how are we supposed to talk?

533
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,600
So this is primarily being deployed right now, this narrative, because there's a lot

534
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,520
of news coming out about India and how drastic the situation is there.

535
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,620
The devastation, yeah.

536
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,980
And so Alex, I wouldn't say he's doing a great job.

537
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,680
They're starving to death in Africa, they're starving to death in India, and when they

538
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:17,180
starve to death and die of malnutrition, when you look at the Indians dying, tens of thousands

539
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:23,300
a week right now, extra, they all look like concentration camp victims.

540
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,700
And the common cold is killing them, and then the media tells you that COVID-19 did it.

541
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,720
And India is starving to death now.

542
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,840
You can argue, well, there's a billion, 300 million Indians, there's too many of them.

543
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
What?

544
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,900
Well, ladies and gentlemen, they've always had outdoor cremations, they've always had

545
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,460
mass cremations for the poor, that friends and family have gone to India, there's documentaries

546
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,160
about it, CNN complains they should be able to burn their dead outside, it's bad for carbon.

547
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,280
What are you talking about?

548
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
What is happening?

549
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Yeah, how does that even-

550
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
What is happening?

551
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
What are we even doing?

552
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,140
What Alex is saying there about Indian deaths from malnutrition being called COVID, it's

553
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,220
not based on anything other than his own feelings and guesses about things.

554
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,860
The situation in India with COVID is really complicated, but there are a number of driving

555
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,940
factors that people point to in terms of what's making this period right now incredibly horrific.

556
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,280
The first appears to be a level of unpreparedness.

557
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,020
Healthcare journalist Vikas Dandekar wrote a piece recently in Stat News that explained

558
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,060
this element of the situation like this.

559
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:28,240
Quote, India's early success in nearly flattening the COVID-19 curve in 2020 may be the cause

560
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,020
of the current calamity.

561
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,300
Despite a rickety and funding-starved healthcare infrastructure, the country's ability to manage

562
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,680
the first wave of COVID-19 looked laudable as the United States, Canada, and countries

563
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,340
in Europe reeled under second and third waves of the pandemic.

564
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,720
Then things went awry.

565
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,500
The turnaround raised false hopes that the virus had run out of steam in India and the

566
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,200
country would be spared a second wave.

567
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,900
That left people unprepared to deal with the heavy blow that was coming.

568
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,260
Modi declared victory and held massive political rallies.

569
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,660
At the same time, Hindu pilgrims amassed at the Ganges River where, quote, as many as

570
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,000
2.5 million people took part with scant attention to COVID-19 safety protocols.

571
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,500
By the time an avalanche of criticism cut short the festival, the virus had infected

572
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,500
thousands of pilgrims who took it home to their neighborhoods and villages.

573
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,700
These types of massive gatherings of people allowed for a broader spread than would have

574
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,420
happened otherwise.

575
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,480
Add to that the discovery of that new strain of hyper contagious virus in India a while

576
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,180
back and how the healthcare infrastructure is pushed to its limit and you end up with

577
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,780
a situation like we're seeing now, which is terrible.

578
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,320
There's a humanitarian disaster going on right now and the people of India need all the help

579
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,060
that the international community can provide.

580
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,820
But trying to pretend that the deaths you're seeing are just malnutrition deaths that are

581
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,940
being secretly listed as COVID, that is fucking disrespectful to the people of India and what

582
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,240
they're going through.

583
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:58,080
There should be no greater thing that, no greater red flag than any right wing reactionary

584
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,400
politician declaring victory over any worldwide problem.

585
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,780
That should be the immediate sign for everybody in that country to be like, oh, we're fucked.

586
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,780
We're fucked.

587
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,620
This is the worst thing that, we're going to die.

588
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,700
That's the first thing I scream whenever I hear a politician say mission accomplished.

589
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:23,400
What I see with Alex is a complete need to justify this to his audience.

590
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,460
Because it can't be possibly COVID.

591
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,800
No, and it's India's Trump too.

592
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,300
So we can't be, yeah.

593
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,520
But what I fail to understand, and I would love for Alex to explain this, is what's the

594
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,960
Indian government's motive for supposedly calling these malnutrition deaths COVID?

595
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,840
I understand that Alex thinks that the US hospitals were in a get rich quick scheme

596
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,520
where they called other deaths COVID because Medicare pays them a certain amount for COVID

597
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
treatment.

598
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,720
But does he think that's the case in every country?

599
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,120
Does he think that doctors in India are scamming Medicare?

600
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,760
I assume the globalists have a profit sharing program for this kind of scam.

601
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,420
He must think that.

602
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,160
It's really, really bizarre.

603
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,460
And when you start to look at what's actually being said, it just doesn't make any sense.

604
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
And it's dark.

605
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
It's dark.

606
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
Right.

607
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,880
And I suppose in his conception, any and all profiting or carpet bagging goes into one

608
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,960
big pot for all the evil global scams around the world.

609
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,600
So it's like, you know.

610
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,720
All scams are fungible?

611
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
I guess.

612
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,840
I guess that's what has to happen.

613
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
That's dumb.

614
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
That's real dumb.

615
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,960
So anyway, look, there's people starving, I guess.

616
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,140
According to Alex, all these people have malnutrition and dying.

617
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,400
And also in Venezuela, people had malnutrition.

618
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
But are there more people dying in India?

619
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Yes.

620
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Of malnutrition.

621
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:50,480
You know, in Venezuela, it was a thousand, five, six years ago, dying a day extra than

622
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
it was 2000.

623
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,040
Last numbers that came out were estimated at 5000 people a week starved to death in

624
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Venezuela.

625
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,880
But the government passed a law that you can't call it starvation and you can't gather those

626
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
numbers.

627
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,680
If you're a physician or a doctor, you'll be arrested and they don't even call it malnutrition.

628
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,640
So that's how they work.

629
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,920
So I would like to challenge Alex to produce any of that information.

630
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,240
I kind of have a suspicion that he's making all that up and all those details up to try

631
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,880
and bolster this imaginary argument that malnutrition deaths in India are being called COVID deaths.

632
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,680
I think that's what's going on here.

633
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Yeah.

634
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,080
Also, food insecurity is a very real issue in Venezuela.

635
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,040
And again, the particular contributing factors are complicated.

636
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,500
However, it's important to recognize how even if all of Alex's imaginary conspiracy was

637
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,680
actually happening, the numbers don't make sense.

638
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,000
Venezuela has recorded a total of just over 2000 COVID-19 related deaths.

639
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,520
Shouldn't the number be much higher if Alex's dumb conspiracy were real?

640
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,500
I mean, roughly 250,000?

641
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,000
It's important to recognize what's going on here.

642
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,560
Alex is trying to argue that the deaths listed as COVID in India are actually just malnutrition

643
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,220
deaths that are being mislabeled.

644
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,100
In order to defend this baseless claim, Alex points to Venezuela, where there are apparently

645
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,920
tons of malnutrition deaths.

646
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,440
In order for Alex's argument to make any sense, it would need to be the case that these malnutrition

647
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,280
deaths in Venezuela were being reclassified as COVID-19 deaths, because if that weren't

648
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,560
the case, then bringing up Venezuela means absolutely nothing in this context.

649
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Alex's brain works from memes, not information.

650
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,600
When there's a story about malnutrition in the right wing media, the meme the audience

651
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,080
has been trained to respond to is just bring up Venezuela.

652
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,440
Alex has no point that he's even making here, but he knows that if he just says it's like

653
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,600
Venezuela, the listeners will just nod in agreement, thinking something was said.

654
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,280
Those lawless, socialist monsters in Venezuela.

655
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Yeah.

656
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,160
Now, lest you think that Alex cares.

657
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,320
I would be hard-pressed to get to a point where I do, but-

658
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,200
Well, this will vaccinate you from that impression taken hold.

659
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,960
Oh, look.

660
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,040
The Indians are starving to death.

661
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,040
You could even find aid groups saying they're starving to death, but by the time it hits

662
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,320
CNN, look, there's mass graves.

663
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,040
They're burning people outside.

664
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,640
That's how they get rid of people over there, and anybody that has any knowledge knows that,

665
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,280
but not the average CNN viewer.

666
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,800
So it's lie upon lie upon lie upon lie, but let me get back to what I was talking about.

667
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,800
We haven't had bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula, in five, almost six months.

668
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Wow.

669
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
What?

670
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:32,360
You know, here's just such a simple fucking, go fuck yourself on this shit.

671
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,560
Like, okay, if you're going to what about me with the Indians are starving, and we even

672
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,520
know aid groups are saying that Indians are starving.

673
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,520
All right, so you're going to tell me that that's an issue you fucking care about, that

674
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,560
the Republican party cares about.

675
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,760
So if the Republican party is in power, they should at the very least mention that they

676
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,800
care about while they are in power.

677
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,640
But when they are in power, they sure seem to forget all this bullshit.

678
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
They do.

679
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
They do.

680
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
A couple of quick clarifications.

681
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
Sorry.

682
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,680
One, it's very important to recognize that right now, Alex's brand is moving away from

683
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,840
the Republican party, because it does not look like a Trump nominee.

684
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,320
It's going to be the 2024 candidate that people are going to coalesce behind.

685
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,840
So I believe that there's that fracturing happening, and Alex is soon to be above the

686
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
left-right paradigm.

687
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,040
Sure, sure, you know, we'll get back to that.

688
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,800
Oh, that motherfucker, if he wriggles out of this bullshit.

689
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,040
So whenever you want to say complaints about the Republican party, yes.

690
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,320
Absolutely valid criticism, although Alex will be deflecting that in the future.

691
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,520
Trumpist party, the Patriot party, whatever the fuck you want.

692
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,560
Until they have an official name, it's going to be difficult to make these darts hit the

693
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
right spot.

694
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm going to call them no nothings until further notice.

695
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
That's fair enough.

696
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Yeah.

697
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,000
But yeah, I also like the idea that Alex is talking about real world stuff, or presumably

698
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
real world stuff.

699
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah, the important shit.

700
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,440
And then he's like, let me get back to what I was talking about, that's a weird transition

701
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
into the ad.

702
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,520
Listen, listen, sorry I took that tangent about important shit, did you know what else

703
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,700
we've got in our store?

704
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,840
We have, dumb pills.

705
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,440
So this next clip is fun.

706
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,320
This was something that I decided to have a little bit of a, dig to the bottom of a

707
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
hole on.

708
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Yeah, sure.

709
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,840
And it's Alex reading a headline.

710
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,320
Health experts encourage CDC to implement permanent mask mandates.

711
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,040
That's an Infowars.com article, and it links to BBC, CNN, all of them.

712
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,440
Well, I could have told you that.

713
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,840
Bill Gates said last year, over a year ago when it all started, he said, oh, it's never

714
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,000
going to end and masks will be like wearing seatbelts.

715
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,360
This is a Paul Joseph Watson article on Infowars, and I found this to be a great opportunity

716
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,520
to illustrate how Infowars misleads and doesn't actually cover the news that they're even

717
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,060
pretending to.

718
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,560
The second half of this article that Paul wrote is just the standard anti-mask stuff

719
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,920
that you find in pretty much any article on their website that has to do with masks.

720
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,960
So I'm just going to ignore all that.

721
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,420
The actual headline is, quote, health experts encourage CDC to implement permanent mask

722
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
mandates.

723
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,840
This article does not link to the BBC or CNN.

724
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,800
In fact, the entire story is based on one article from the Providence Journal.

725
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,800
This is an outlet from Rhode Island published in December 2020 with the headline, quote,

726
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,560
thinking about life without a mask?

727
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,240
Think again, say Rhode Island experts.

728
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,080
Is that where North Korea hid those ballots?

729
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,080
Must have.

730
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Must have been in Providence.

731
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Yeah.

732
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
Yeah, that makes sense.

733
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,880
Leaving aside the fact that this is almost five months old as an article and Infowars

734
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,640
is pretending it's news, if you look deeper into how the original article is misrepresented,

735
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,480
you get an even better sense of the propaganda that's being deployed here.

736
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,920
The two experts that were consulted for this Providence Journal article are Dr. Nicole

737
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,760
Alexander Scott and Dr. Leonard A. Murmill.

738
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,280
Neither of them at any point seemed to be encouraging the CDC to make mask wearing permanent

739
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,400
or mandatory, as the headline might lead you to think.

740
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,080
You would think that's where they would be going, right?

741
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Yeah.

742
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,760
Here's the part of the Infowars article that quotes Dr. Alexander Scott.

743
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,000
Quote, we have seen benefits of masking that occur, health director Dr. Nicole Alexander

744
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,960
Scott told the Providence Journal.

745
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,580
So there may be a new form of normalcy where masks don't necessarily have to go away.

746
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,200
This is all good and well, as that passage does appear in the actual article.

747
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,480
However, consider that Infowars lead.

748
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,820
Their first line of the story is quote, health experts are insisting that the CDC should

749
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,120
implement permanent mask mandates even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.

750
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,040
That doesn't seem like Alexander Scott is insisting that the CDC implement anything.

751
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,960
Just commenting that there may be a utility in continued mask wearing, obviously to cut

752
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,820
down on transmission of annual flus.

753
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,060
This sensationalizing of almost half a year old comments made by a Rhode Island doctor

754
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,320
that Alex and Paul Joseph Watson have never heard of before.

755
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
That's bad enough.

756
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,600
But if you go read the actual article, there's another quote from Alexander Scott that Paul

757
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,320
is intentionally leaving out of the article because it doesn't serve the purposes of the

758
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
propaganda.

759
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,840
She was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

760
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,280
Before you take me out of context, I know Paul Joseph Watson is reading this.

761
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
That would be great.

762
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
I can't hang.

763
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
I can't hang.

764
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,600
From the Providence Journal article, quote, Alexander Scott said state health officials

765
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,440
have much to consider before taking a final position on whether mask wearing should continue

766
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
after the pandemic.

767
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,760
Quote, I want to reserve the ability to research and see what are some of the things that we've

768
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,760
introduced because of the pandemic that are valuable to continue.

769
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,140
She said, adding she hopes the public would see the benefits of mask wearing if its continuance

770
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,140
is recommended.

771
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:35,200
Quote, my hope would be that folks would see the value of continuing that, she said.

772
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,120
It's unlikely to be a definitive mandate, but we want to be driven by the data and the

773
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
science.

774
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Yeah.

775
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,580
That's like, what if your heartless, soulless, monstrous corporate boss forces you to go

776
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,560
to work regardless of whether or not you're feeling ill, perhaps instead of the old ways

777
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,060
before the pandemic where you would just show up to work and sneeze all over everything,

778
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,140
you should try wearing a mask.

779
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,860
Or if there's no reason for you to need to go into work and you can work remotely, why

780
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860
not?

781
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,860
Why not work remotely?

782
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,480
If you're feeling well and you can be just as productive at home.

783
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Seems fairly simple.

784
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Right.

785
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
Sure.

786
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Yeah.

787
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,880
Any of these things are possible implications or ideas of what she could be talking about.

788
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Seems like it would work fine.

789
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,020
And it's important to recognize that she's very clearly talking about being driven by

790
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,520
data and science.

791
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
Yeah.

792
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,280
So that's clear, you know, that she's saying that it could be advantageous.

793
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,000
There's not likely to be a definitive mandate.

794
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Sure.

795
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,160
That position clearly articulated in the original article is completely misrepresented by the

796
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,180
Infowars article because they are liars who are doing this for profit.

797
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,220
The second expert in the article is Dr. Mermel.

798
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,280
Here's what Paul includes of his comments in the Infowars article, and it begins with

799
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,520
including a mistaken reference to Dr. Alexander Scott as his.

800
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Oh, no.

801
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,740
Quote, his sentiments were echoed by Dr. Leonard A. Mermel, medical director of epidemiology

802
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,960
and infection control at Rhode Island Hospital, who said making people wear masks all the

803
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,240
time was worth it to stop the spread of the viruses other than COVID-19.

804
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,740
Quote, within the lifespan system, we're seeing far fewer of the respiratory viruses than

805
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,000
we are used to seeing at this moment in the calendar year.

806
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So it's impressive.

807
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,380
The COVID preventative strategies are having an impact on other respiratory viruses, which

808
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
just makes sense.

809
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,400
They spread in a similar fashion, said Mermel.

810
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Quote, it would not surprise me if that became a recommendation from the CDC, he said.

811
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,480
It's a pretty low price to pay to try to reduce the risk to oneself and particularly loved

812
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,920
ones who may be at a particular risk for these sorts of infections causing harm, he added.

813
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,520
It would not surprise him if the CDC made a recommendation to continue wearing masks.

814
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,040
Does that justify the lead?

815
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,720
Quote, health experts are insisting that the CDC should implement permanent mask mandates

816
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,360
even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.

817
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,560
Does that justify that?

818
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,880
You didn't hear the tone of voice with which he said it.

819
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,760
He said, A, wouldn't surprise me if the CDC made these mandatory forever because I was

820
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,860
insisting in behind closed doors.

821
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,480
My question about whether or not that's justified is not rhetorical.

822
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
It does.

823
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
It's not.

824
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
This is bullshit.

825
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
That's fair.

826
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,240
And it gets even worse in the case of Dr. Mermel as well, because he also said some

827
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,240
stuff that Paul is just conveniently ignoring.

828
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,520
From the Providence Journal article, quote, flu has dampened significantly in the southern

829
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,560
hemisphere in those countries that had aggressive public health measures to reduce COVID risks

830
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,520
such as social distancing and masking, Mermel said.

831
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,240
The southern hemisphere acts as a sort of time machine with its winter and flu season

832
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,280
coming six months ahead of the winter in the northern hemisphere.

833
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,080
Preliminary data shows the United States having a quiet flu season with recorded cases lower

834
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,600
than each of the last six years at the same point in the season, Mermel said.

835
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,720
Quote, at the moment what we're seeing mirrors what we've seen in the southern hemisphere.

836
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,360
Let's hope that continues to be the case.

837
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,880
No guarantee, he said.

838
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,620
Quote, right now we are for this time of year seeing very low prevalence, but again, it's

839
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,960
very early, so it's hard to know what to make of that.

840
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Uh.

841
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Wow.

842
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,520
In the underlying article that Paul is covering dishonestly, both of the experts cited gave

843
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,520
very general comments to the effect that it's possible that wearing masks could be helpful

844
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,880
at lowering cases of the flu, but it was too early to say and that we should let data lead

845
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,900
us to our eventual conclusion.

846
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,760
Neither of them were saying that the CDC needs to make mask wearing permanent.

847
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,160
No one was demanding any kind of mandatory mask laws.

848
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Yeah.

849
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,900
This is pretty much always the case with InfoWars articles.

850
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,480
There may be an actual news outlet story that they're basing their coverage on, but the

851
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,280
version they're covering is a funhouse mirror of the real thing, distorted so it'll fit

852
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,560
the bullshit narratives they want to push.

853
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,380
I chose to cover this one a little more specifically because it's pretty glaring and it's super

854
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,040
embarrassing that Paul didn't check the date on the Providence Journal article before cranking

855
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,720
out his outrage blog post.

856
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,080
It's honestly hilarious.

857
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,160
And here's another paragraph from Paul's article, just because I like to poke.

858
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,200
Keep in mind that experts that he's referencing are two doctors in Rhode Island who spoke

859
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,440
to a local paper five months ago.

860
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,820
This is from Paul's article that came out this week.

861
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,360
So let me set the scene, all right?

862
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,080
So we've got these two doctors.

863
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,680
They're on the phone with a local Providence, Rhode Island Journal.

864
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
They're busy.

865
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
They're at the hospital.

866
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,000
They're dealing with shit.

867
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,280
They're talking to this person.

868
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
They might decide to set a block of time aside.

869
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,720
Then cut to five months later.

870
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,480
All right, here we are.

871
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,540
Quote, medical professionals are still attempting to have mask mandates become part of the new

872
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,360
normal despite Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledging yesterday that it would be common sense for

873
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,560
the CDC to start relaxing measures.

874
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,680
Wait, so now Fauci is- No, no, no, but do you understand what's

875
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
going on here?

876
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
There's a time warp going on.

877
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Yes, I understand.

878
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
This article's five months old.

879
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,240
This article is far older.

880
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,880
He's comparing their comments to something Fauci said yesterday in the present day.

881
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,160
No, I'm recognizing and understanding this.

882
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,480
Sloppy shit, man.

883
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,900
You know how sometimes I'm like, Dan, we can't let scientists name stuff because they accidentally

884
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,700
name it really intimidating things, or we can't let scientists talk to journalists the

885
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,160
same way they would to other scientists because other people will twist it because they can't

886
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,920
really quite comprehend it.

887
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
It's not their fault.

888
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,560
It's just they don't have that same kind of social education, that kind of thing.

889
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,420
In this circumstance, fuck it.

890
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,680
There's nothing you can do.

891
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
There's nothing you can do.

892
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,800
Well, no, I agree, because the doctors did not convey information-

893
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
No.

894
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
... poorly.

895
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,360
They just were taken- They did it every-

896
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Yeah.

897
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
Yeah.

898
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,560
I mean, if you want to really make it so you can't do the stuff that Paul does, it's like

899
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,960
no one can ever talk again.

900
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Exactly.

901
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Yeah.

902
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
There's no saving this one.

903
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
They'll just splice things open.

904
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Yeah.

905
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,160
It's not like she named it murder town is what we're going to go to.

906
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
No.

907
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,160
It's not a fictitious presentation of something that did happen in as much as two doctors

908
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,640
in Rhode Island talked to a local paper five months ago.

909
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
No.

910
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
It's fanfic.

911
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
Yeah.

912
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
This is 50 shades of bullshit.

913
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
But it's fanfic that gets people hurt.

914
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Yeah.

915
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Yeah.

916
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Yeah.

917
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Naturally.

918
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Well, like 50 shades of gray.

919
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,320
Alex, on the show here in April 26th, he has some other sources.

920
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
I'm sorry.

921
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,880
I said I'd just read you the headlines.

922
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,660
Stanford study result face masks are ineffective to block transmission of COVID-19 actually

923
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:14,080
can cause health deterioration and premature death, but who cares about the facts?

924
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,760
New studies suggest wearing a mask is ineffective.

925
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,840
New study highlights face mask problems with safety and efficacy.

926
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Oh, really?

927
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,160
It's a total damn cult.

928
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,280
If you're paying attention, you'll notice that these headlines, these three headlines

929
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,160
are all just different dumb blogs writing their own headline about the same underlying

930
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
story.

931
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Yeah.

932
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,140
A supposed Stanford study that says that masks are bad.

933
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,960
If you're not paying attention, as Alex's audience almost never is, it might appear

934
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,920
that there's a flood of studies showing that masks are dangerous and you were right all

935
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,500
along to be against them.

936
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Three studies at least.

937
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
He's just named them.

938
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Just today.

939
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,600
Just today.

940
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,280
That's the impression Alex is trying to create by repeatedly hitting the same story as if

941
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,960
it's three different stories.

942
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Also, this paper about masks was written by a guy named Baruch Vainshelboim, who is a

943
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:07,100
quote, visiting scholar on matters unrelated to this paper between 2015 and 2016 at Stanford.

944
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,580
Other than that, he has no connection with Stanford and Stanford has requested a correction

945
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,000
to take their name off this bullshit.

946
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,900
This is an important point to bring up.

947
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,500
People like Alex and the right wing media hate authoritative sources.

948
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,280
The mainstream media is the enemy of the people and the universities are just full of liars

949
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,540
trying to push the globalist agenda.

950
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,160
And yet, whenever they have the opportunity to pretend that one of their narratives is

951
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,360
backed by the authority, top scientists, top scientists, top scientists all over this place.

952
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,860
Whenever they can back their thing with the appealing to the authority of a real mainstream

953
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,720
or academic institution, they trip over their feet trying to associate their ideas with

954
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
a respectable source.

955
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,560
Of course, that's a real respectable source.

956
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,940
That's not the bullshit we normally talk about.

957
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,420
Anyone who thinks that people like Alex are legit should really question why they do that.

958
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,140
This paper was published in a journal called Medical Hypotheses, which is basically exactly

959
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,320
what it sounds like.

960
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,540
An outlet for fringe nonsense and unsubstantiated ideas.

961
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,060
This paper is trash and the conclusion runs at odds with dozens of other more rigorously

962
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,400
designed studies and it's being falsely attributed to Stanford in order to elevate its credibility.

963
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,620
This is basically the norm when it comes to information sources that Infowars uses.

964
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,620
Yeah.

965
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,620
Because it's nothing.

966
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,720
Because the underlying unspoken thing they're saying there is, look, even people who do

967
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,500
work believe this, even people who work on this shit believe.

968
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,520
If I reference the Washington Post, you know it's true because they actually have to work

969
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,520
on it.

970
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,520
Yeah.

971
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,520
Yeah.

972
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
That's bullshit.

973
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
They have standards.

974
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
Yeah.

975
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,960
So you're saying whatever you don't, you're immediately implying that you're lying all

976
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,620
of the time except, I hate it.

977
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,280
So I want to hear another lie?

978
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,080
Yes, of course.

979
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,720
Why did Merck pull out three months ago?

980
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,760
They said you cannot produce a safe vaccine for the cold virus.

981
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,720
If you do, it causes autoimmune responses, an allergic reactions in a large number of,

982
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,760
because they said, we don't care if you wave lab to test, we're doing lab test.

983
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,120
And even corrupt Merck said, we suggest you don't take vaccines and you just get herd

984
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,120
immunity.

985
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Oh really?

986
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,400
Because if you make a vaccine that is broad enough for the protein that's in a cold virus,

987
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,840
then it's going to attack your own damn body.

988
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
This isn't true.

989
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,880
Alex is just making up this entire story about why Merck decided to spend their efforts to

990
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,720
develop a COVID vaccine.

991
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,920
In reality, if you actually read their statements, it was a situation where they had two candidate

992
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,100
vaccines, which the test subjects responded well to, but quote, the immune responses were

993
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:45,280
inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19

994
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,740
vaccines.

995
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,960
The idea of trying to start from scratch on new vaccine candidates when there are already

996
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,820
other promising vaccines coming to market, that would have been a waste of resources

997
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,820
for them.

998
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,320
So what they decided to do was adjust their research strategy to focus on therapeutics

999
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,800
that they might be able to develop.

1000
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Sure.

1001
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,400
All of Alex's story about them saying you shouldn't take vaccines and a vaccine for

1002
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,840
COVID is impossible, that's just completely made up from his imagination.

1003
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
And it's fun.

1004
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,280
I'm sure the audience enjoys it, but it's not real.

1005
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
Yeah.

1006
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,640
Anyway, just bullshit.

1007
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,520
Why would anybody trust him when he says anything about viruses?

1008
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,920
Like, honestly, just tell me what a virus even looks like before you're telling me what

1009
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
viruses do.

1010
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,320
Give me an idea of what it looks like.

1011
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,640
You think I don't know what a virus looks like?

1012
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,140
I really don't think you do.

1013
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,140
They're about yay-bing.

1014
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,140
They are not about yay-bing.

1015
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,140
They're red.

1016
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,720
They are, some of them are red.

1017
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
They have horns.

1018
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
That's true.

1019
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
They have a pitchfork.

1020
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
That's all such-

1021
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
It's the devil.

1022
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
It is the devil!

1023
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
Shit!

1024
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,720
You nailed it.

1025
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,280
Alex, I would say that probably his main narrative is trying to rationalize the COVID deaths

1026
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,960
in India and recontextualize them as what he's calling malnutrition deaths.

1027
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Right, right, right.

1028
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
And it's nonsense.

1029
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Don't worry about this.

1030
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Worry about that.

1031
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
David Beasley, he's the head of it.

1032
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
We have to clip him in a moment.

1033
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:04,760
Wards of dire famines in Africa, Mideast, Asia, if COVID-19 supply change damage continues

1034
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,920
and also in India.

1035
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,220
The reality of COVID in India right now is really scary and it should be something that

1036
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,200
creates feelings of concern and care for the people in India and also creates a real sense

1037
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,340
of the stakes that people are facing when it comes to the virus.

1038
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,000
These realizations are dangerous for Alex because his entire last year of work has been

1039
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,200
dedicated to minimizing the COVID pandemic for profit and to help his God King Trump

1040
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,200
not look bad.

1041
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,360
The Infowars audience cannot be allowed to think that the human tragedy in India is real

1042
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,240
because that threatens the bottom line of Alex's operations.

1043
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,200
Thus, you see what you see here.

1044
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,840
It's a complete rewriting of the situation.

1045
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,800
You can keep the feelings of concern and care for the people of India, but you're being

1046
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,120
lied to about why you should care.

1047
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,440
It's not about the virus, it's about malnutrition.

1048
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,860
You can keep that human empathy, but Alex has to protect the business.

1049
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,300
You can see a slight of hand really clearly here.

1050
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,400
In order to make his argument that all the COVID deaths in India are secretly just malnutrition,

1051
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,320
he's referencing a May 8th, 2020 article published by the Atlantic Council warning of the possibility

1052
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,960
of famine due to supply chain breakdown.

1053
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,000
The actual headline is, quote, world food programs David Beasley warns of dire famines

1054
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,240
in Africa, Middle East, if COVID-19 supply chains damage continues.

1055
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,280
But you see how Alex amended the headline to add India in there because he needs to

1056
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,200
make it look like that for the narrative to stay.

1057
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,580
The word India doesn't appear in that article at all.

1058
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:28,640
And even this article isn't just about COVID, it's also about other influences on food insecurity

1059
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,800
like the flooding that was happening in Sudan and the massive locust swarms.

1060
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,400
It's a complicated humanitarian issue that demands attention, but Alex is attempting

1061
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,020
to hijack that attention and use it as a prop for his COVID denialist narratives, which

1062
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,020
is ghoulish.

1063
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,020
Yeah.

1064
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,020
Ghoulish, I say.

1065
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,120
Yeah, the fundamental thing that the right wing has to do first is, you know, everybody

1066
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,720
knows, your family members, people you know, you're like, how is it that these people who

1067
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,780
are in person and in conversation, so empathetic and caring and kind, how is it that on large

1068
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,860
national issues, they're fucking monsters?

1069
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,240
And it's like the right wing has to redirect that empathy.

1070
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,080
Otherwise people will never buy.

1071
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,100
People are never going to be like, hey, yeah, I think we should steal money from the poor

1072
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
and kill them.

1073
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,960
You know, you have to redirect it so they don't even care.

1074
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1075
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
Yep.

1076
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,960
And it's, it's just so...

1077
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,160
And that's what you see being done here.

1078
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,160
Yeah.

1079
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,480
And it just destroys people's brains.

1080
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,600
It really destroys them.

1081
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Yeah.

1082
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,280
And the whole end result is a crippling of your ability to care for other people in a

1083
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,280
meaningful way.

1084
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,440
No, a borderline pathological apathy.

1085
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Yeah.

1086
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
Yeah.

1087
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,040
And it's held up and supported by constant misuse of information.

1088
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Yep.

1089
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,400
And Alex does that again with another article.

1090
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:51,000
Coronavirus, India's lockdown turning into humanitarian crisis, German news, DW.

1091
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,040
That's from six, eight months ago, admitting mass starvation, millions already starve to

1092
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,040
death.

1093
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,040
Alex is lying about that article.

1094
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,040
Yeah.

1095
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,320
It's a real, and it is a real article from DW, but it's about a desperate situation that

1096
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,700
many migrant workers in India were experiencing due to COVID lockdowns.

1097
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,120
Many who found themselves without work due to business closures, and they were far away

1098
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,200
from their homes and villages outside major cities.

1099
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,000
To add to that difficulty, trains had been closed, and although there was eventually

1100
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,520
a plan put in place to help transit, you know, stranded workers back to where they were going,

1101
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,700
it was not smoothly implemented.

1102
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,520
This article doesn't admit that millions had starved to death.

1103
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,040
It's a report that's meant to bring attention to an issue that some might not be aware of,

1104
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,860
and Alex is lying about it to defend his indefensible narrative that all the COVID deaths in India

1105
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,400
are a hoax.

1106
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
That's what he's doing.

1107
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Wow.

1108
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Yep.

1109
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,520
Man, you know, guess what, Dan?

1110
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,480
It's just as horrific whenever he's doing it about a different country.

1111
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,480
True.

1112
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,480
It never changes.

1113
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,480
True.

1114
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,840
I don't feel different about it because he's lying about India instead of the United States.

1115
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
Nope.

1116
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Fuck him.

1117
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,280
So this clip is, we're jumping to another topic.

1118
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,960
I don't know how to set this clip up other than just like, this is weird, man.

1119
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,240
I don't wish you any harm myself.

1120
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,960
I'm not calling for violence against you.

1121
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,120
It's already weird.

1122
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,680
Bill Gates should publicly hang himself.

1123
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,140
I think Prince Charles should publicly hang himself.

1124
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,600
I think Ted Turner should publicly hang himself and that they would all go to one of their

1125
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,880
ranches and just have a public international thing and say, we want to kill you.

1126
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,880
We want to save the earth.

1127
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,680
We're going to start with ourselves and if Bill Gates just took an ice pick and just

1128
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,840
started ramming in his throat, hey, humanity with blood spewing, I would say, well, I respect

1129
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
that man.

1130
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
Maybe he's right.

1131
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,760
Then we can have the drones launch with the nerve gas and start the operation, which is

1132
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,120
the final mop-up operation, which I told you about a long time ago, now they're admitting

1133
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,120
it.

1134
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
The drones are ready with the nerve gas.

1135
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,120
We're in your family.

1136
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
We'll be right back.

1137
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,320
Is that plan C, the drones with nerve gas?

1138
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,200
Because that's not a biological weapon.

1139
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,200
That's a chemical weapon.

1140
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,960
I'm surprised by the drones with nerve gas.

1141
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,840
Yeah, apparently Alex just made that up to throw in.

1142
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,200
You know, I was, I was going along with him.

1143
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,320
I was like, this is a bit macabre, but ultimately, yeah, I'm fine with that.

1144
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,520
I don't give a shit.

1145
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,920
But then we got into the, then he was like, and if they killed themselves, then I would

1146
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,920
agree that so everyone else should die.

1147
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
That's weird.

1148
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,160
That's kind of, that's what he said, right?

1149
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,160
Yeah.

1150
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:19,040
I understand you're creating terms of the secondary part that are never going to happen.

1151
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,040
Of course not.

1152
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:26,760
My political positions and my beliefs are not influenced by public spectacles.

1153
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:34,600
If my political enemies kill themselves, I will join their team is his point.

1154
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
I respect the hell out of that.

1155
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,080
I respect the hell out of anybody who'd kill themselves.

1156
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:44,080
I got to, listen, my beliefs are so fungible that that's all it takes.

1157
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,640
Trump like gets up there and slaps himself in the face.

1158
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,360
He's like, don't you see what I do for this country?

1159
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,360
What a hero.

1160
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360
What a hero.

1161
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,360
Oh my God.

1162
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,360
Oh my God.

1163
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,880
This is, they look, now that he's not president, he has finally become the president of the

1164
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
United States.

1165
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,880
What the hell is this?

1166
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,800
I mean, I obviously don't believe him, but he's still saying it.

1167
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Yeah.

1168
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Yeah.

1169
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
It's weird.

1170
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
That's a weird thing to say out loud.

1171
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Yep.

1172
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,320
So we have high minded issues to cover on this April 26th show and actually it was kind

1173
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
of interesting.

1174
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,280
So far it feels like I disagree with you, but keep going.

1175
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh, it's going to get worse too, because that was me being decisious.

1176
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,600
I'm pretty disconnected from pop culture as a whole.

1177
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Sure.

1178
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,480
And I didn't actually even realize the Oscars happened.

1179
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,480
Right.

1180
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,480
Right, right, right.

1181
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Until they had happened.

1182
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,480
Sure, sure.

1183
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,680
I heard about the Anthony Hopkins sort of kerfuffle.

1184
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,440
I have no interest in the Oscars, didn't before, don't now, and I really hate Oscars drama.

1185
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,440
Yeah.

1186
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,440
I don't know.

1187
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,880
It's not something that is necessarily a huge part of stuff that takes up space in my mind.

1188
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,880
Totally.

1189
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,880
Alex hates the media.

1190
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,960
He hates movies.

1191
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,000
He hates Hollywood.

1192
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,720
He thinks about it so much more.

1193
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
All the time.

1194
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,720
It's the most important thing in the world.

1195
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,920
He was almost in Guardians of the Galaxy.

1196
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,160
He's so mad.

1197
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,480
So let's start playing some of these clips.

1198
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,120
This is Regina King, some actress that won an Oscar who's all pissed off up there with

1199
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,280
an angry looking face because she's a good person and she's up against those bad white

1200
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,280
people.

1201
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,020
And I tell you, if there hadn't been the proper ruling, she'd have been putting her boots

1202
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,680
on to march against those white people.

1203
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,240
She'll never march against Bill Gates or Hollywood.

1204
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,360
She'll never actually stand up for any black people.

1205
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,880
No, she'll just make millions of dollars and wear fancy $5,000 dresses and drive around

1206
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,240
in Ferraris and fly around in private jets and then bitch about evil America that produced

1207
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,240
so much wealth.

1208
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,280
She lives like this while Africans are starving to death by the tens of thousands every day.

1209
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,960
You can see how Alex's criticism of Regina King is 100% racially based.

1210
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
No.

1211
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,400
He doesn't know anything about her as a person or what sorts of charity work she may be involved

1212
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
in.

1213
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,040
All he sees is a black woman saying something that he doesn't like and his response is racist

1214
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,560
outrage.

1215
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,960
So in her intro speech, King mentioned how difficult the last year has been and how if

1216
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,360
the Chauvin verdict had been different, she might have traded in her heels for marching

1217
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,360
boots.

1218
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Yeah.

1219
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,680
This statement is experienced by Alex as her saying she would have been marching against

1220
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,200
evil white people because everything in his life is filtered through the lens of white

1221
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
victimhood.

1222
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,080
Yeah, it does seem like the people, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not good.

1223
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,360
Also don't come after Regina.

1224
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,800
Regina King is not somebody you want to come after.

1225
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
She's amazing.

1226
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Um.

1227
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,800
She's great.

1228
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
I don't think Alex knows anything about her.

1229
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,960
I would argue he knows nothing about her.

1230
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,240
So he also doesn't even know who this next person is.

1231
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Okay.

1232
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,240
All right.

1233
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,240
He's declaring an idiot.

1234
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,240
Okay.

1235
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,700
Here's another one of the idiots up there getting an award telling people that there's

1236
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,280
an epidemic and disproportionately police shoot black men when it's actually the other

1237
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,280
way around.

1238
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:49,600
On average, the police in America every day kill three people, which amounts to about

1239
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,960
a thousand people a year.

1240
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,160
And those people happen to disproportionately black people.

1241
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:02,920
And you know, James Baldwin once said, the most despicable thing a person can be is indifferent

1242
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,160
to other people's pain.

1243
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,920
And so I just ask that you please not be indifferent.

1244
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,520
Please don't be indifferent.

1245
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,400
I mean that guy's literally up there wearing a clown suit.

1246
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,400
I guess Alex isn't being indifferent to people's pain as much as he's being hostile towards

1247
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
it.

1248
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Reveling in it?

1249
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,400
Denying its validity.

1250
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Yeah.

1251
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,400
I think that might be worse.

1252
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Enjoying watching people's pain.

1253
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,160
Alex is wrong about those statistics because of the very important word he doesn't understand,

1254
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,160
which is proportionate.

1255
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Exactly.

1256
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,160
Yeah.

1257
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,860
He refuses to approach statistics in context because if you do that, his arguments fall

1258
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,460
apart instantly.

1259
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,840
Also that was Travon Free, the writer-director who won an Oscar for best live-action short

1260
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,720
for Two Distant Strangers.

1261
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,880
To Alex, he's just another idiot because he's a black man attempting to appeal to the better

1262
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,640
side of people's humanity.

1263
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,560
It's almost comically racist behavior on Alex's part, and it's not surprising at all.

1264
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:01,880
I mean, it's just astonishing how important skin color is to him, while at the same time

1265
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,640
how vehement he is that he's not racist.

1266
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:13,480
Like if you bring up the color of someone's skin that much, yeah, yeah.

1267
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,200
So he does spend a little while complaining about the Oscars, but-

1268
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,320
Well sure, there were black people represented at the Oscars, and we can't-

1269
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
Yeah, yeah.

1270
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,320
He's not so into that.

1271
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,820
Where was- Back in my day, you used to win an Oscar for films like Birth of a Nation

1272
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,680
because they changed film cinema forever, and that's why.

1273
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,720
The only reason that I let that film- Sure, sure, sure.

1274
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,800
So he gets onto another topic, or does he?

1275
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:46,280
Here's video, ladies and gentlemen, out of Tennessee.

1276
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:50,080
And this police officer, you know what, I'm going to come back from break, and I'm going

1277
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,360
to get to this because I've got to find my article.

1278
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,840
There's so many damn articles here and so much happening.

1279
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,200
This is just crazy though to watch this unfold.

1280
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,640
Before I go to break, ladies and gentlemen, we have some very exciting news, and I mean

1281
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,640
extremely exciting.

1282
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,360
One of our best selling products is turmeric.

1283
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,320
We have the 95% secret humanoid.

1284
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,320
He forgot the story.

1285
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,320
He forgot the story.

1286
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,320
He forgot the story.

1287
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,320
He completely forgot the story.

1288
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,000
Not sure what I'm supposed to talk about, just in case you were wondering, turmeric.

1289
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Yeah.

1290
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Okay, bye.

1291
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,720
I forgot the story, so I'm going to do a plug.

1292
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
Oh boy.

1293
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
Yep.

1294
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,000
So we get a little visit here at the end of the 26th from an old friend who declared it

1295
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
over for humanity.

1296
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Sure.

1297
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
A year ago.

1298
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Sure.

1299
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
There's only going to be lone survivors.

1300
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,400
And that has been borne out.

1301
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,280
And now he has a new story to tell.

1302
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,280
Sure.

1303
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,920
And then also he's got a new story out that's at naturalnews.com.

1304
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,860
It's also on infowars.com.

1305
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:49,880
Health Ranger posts new microscope photos of COVID slobs, COVID masks, mysterious red

1306
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,200
and blue fibers.

1307
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:57,940
And others have scanned them and found similar weird things that appear to be, well not appear,

1308
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,940
they are moving.

1309
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:05,240
And then there's also German researchers have tested what's in the Pfizer shot and it appears

1310
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,760
to have things moving around in it.

1311
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,680
And so we're going to get ahold of some samples and work with some labs like Mike Adams to

1312
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,880
test this themselves.

1313
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:19,840
But clearly this is getting weirder and weirder and stranger and stranger.

1314
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,760
So I don't know what this has to do with vaccines.

1315
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,760
This is just Mike took some pictures of masks and swabs and stuff.

1316
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,760
And in reference to like the moving stuff and that in the swabs.

1317
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,480
That's not from studies.

1318
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,280
That was from a TikTok video that came out in January.

1319
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,660
It's been pretty debunked by scientists, but the underlying claim of that video is that

1320
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:46,140
people were being intentionally given more Jelen's disease with the COVID swabs.

1321
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,900
The conspiracy was so dumb and evidence was so laughable that this one didn't really stick,

1322
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,680
but it did get a lot of viral attention.

1323
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,800
So it kind of makes sense for someone like Alex or Mike to try and, you know, wander

1324
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,960
it a little bit, see if you can whitewash it a tiny bit, put a respectable face on,

1325
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,300
see if you can make some money off this fake TikTok video.

1326
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,300
It's hard.

1327
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,320
Look, I'm not trying to get all delusions of grandeur a la Alex.

1328
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,000
However, it does seem like these guys wake up every morning and they're like, what could

1329
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,140
I do today that makes Jordan fantasize about owning a flamethrower?

1330
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,440
What could I do today?

1331
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,560
How do we bring Jordan and Elon Musk closer?

1332
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,000
Let's see what it really is going to take for Jordan to buy a flamethrower.

1333
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,240
So if you go and look at the natural news article that this is about, you can tell that

1334
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,040
Mike is even a little self-conscious about this.

1335
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,560
In a caption for the microscope image supposedly of a fiber in some mask he was looking at,

1336
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:41,000
he adds, quote, we do not know why these fibers are there and we are not claiming them to

1337
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,520
be more Jelen's fibers.

1338
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,520
Okay.

1339
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,520
All right.

1340
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,200
I applaud that attempt to be taken seriously, although I think it's difficult when the,

1341
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,640
you know, one of the other captions for an image of a mask says, quote, some areas of

1342
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,160
the carbon fiber strands appear to surround exact looking objects, but they might simply

1343
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,920
be bump textures in the white fiber layer.

1344
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,920
Oh man.

1345
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,180
Oh, might they?

1346
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:07,280
That's like saying this, okay, we don't know what this screenshot is from.

1347
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,320
We think it is absolutely an alien spacecraft.

1348
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,660
However, it could be from a video game.

1349
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,660
That's also possible.

1350
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,880
Are you talking about Eddie Page?

1351
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,920
Yes, I am talking about Eddie Page.

1352
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,720
So over the weekend, Mike released a series of completely meaningless microscope images

1353
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,320
of things that he's speculating are suspicious.

1354
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,400
One of them was that picture of fiber strands in a mask, which may be an egg sac or may

1355
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,840
be bumps in texture.

1356
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,840
Sure.

1357
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,160
By Monday, he published a blog post on his website about these images, and the exact

1358
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,780
same image now has this text along with it, quote, what is this egg sac-like structure

1359
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,320
in this first photo of a carbon fiber mask?

1360
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,080
Gone is the very sensible suggestion that it might just be bump textures.

1361
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,400
And now the goal is to push this egg sac idea as being the primary in the listeners and

1362
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,400
readers minds.

1363
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,040
This is the same shit though.

1364
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,100
Like I don't understand how it is that you can have Eddie Page be a fucking moron and

1365
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,000
everybody's like, nah, nah, nah.

1366
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Look at that idiot.

1367
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,240
He's talking about space.

1368
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,120
But then you let Mike Adams talk about microbes.

1369
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,120
Fuck my, it's just, it's a difference of big versus small, it's the macro versus the micro.

1370
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,120
It's stupid.

1371
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,120
Fine.

1372
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,120
It's the same shit.

1373
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,120
You're not wrong.

1374
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,080
This is essentially what I would call self-driven narrative escalation that Mike is engaging

1375
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
in.

1376
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,880
In the first instance, you implant the idea that something might be really suspicious

1377
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,880
or there might be a totally normal explanation for it.

1378
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,060
When you touch back on the idea, the normal explanation is gone and the speculation entirely

1379
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,600
revolves around the suspicious possibility where the burden of the conversation becomes

1380
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,340
disproving that this is an egg sac instead of the responsibility of being on Mike to

1381
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,680
prove that it's not a bump.

1382
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,520
That's basically the propagandist magic trick that they're playing, where the burden of

1383
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,200
proof is ignored and made your problem instead of theirs.

1384
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,200
Yeah.

1385
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,140
Without using this rhetorical trick and ones like it, people like Alex and Mike's game

1386
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,440
would collapse immediately because they can't defend anything that they say to any kind

1387
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,920
of reasonable standard of proof.

1388
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,200
The pope was arrested a year ago, it's a fake pope.

1389
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,200
Prove me wrong.

1390
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
Sure.

1391
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,080
Now, you'll recall that it was over for humanity and there would only be lone survivors.

1392
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,680
I do recall that.

1393
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,760
I feel like we are some of the few people who recall that and many people just ignore

1394
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,760
it.

1395
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,280
You might also recall that Mike Adams was absent from Infowars for months because he

1396
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,960
and Alex disagreed on whether or not COVID was real.

1397
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
It does.

1398
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,780
It did seem that there was a disagreement there.

1399
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:29,040
And also I think he was advocating that people take veterinary products.

1400
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,040
Well, there's an issue.

1401
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,000
But anyway, here's Mike's new thing.

1402
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,140
Fish penicillin's regular penicillin, man.

1403
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,140
Here's Mike's new bullshit.

1404
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,340
I want to say something really important here.

1405
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:45,380
If they had done nothing, no vaccines, no masks, no lockdowns, no social distancing,

1406
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,820
this thing would have already been over because natural innate immunity would have already

1407
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,080
conquered this.

1408
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,080
Okay.

1409
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,080
All right.

1410
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,080
Great.

1411
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,600
6.30, about to start my day.

1412
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:04,040
What could I say to Alex Jones that would make Jordan want to buy a flamethrower?

1413
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,900
I'll write something out.

1414
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,040
Maybe I'll just improv it.

1415
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,400
Maybe I'll just come off the top, right off the dome.

1416
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,400
Guess what?

1417
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,400
Here's what it is.

1418
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,120
Everything I've ever said is a lie, and I believe the opposite now.

1419
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
So it was over for humanity.

1420
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
There would only be lone survivors.

1421
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
And he knew that.

1422
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,560
But now if we'd done nothing, then everything would be fine now.

1423
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,560
Yep.

1424
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,560
Cool.

1425
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,560
That really is something that should-

1426
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,560
That's frustrating.

1427
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,800
That really is something that should get you...

1428
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,320
That should be more against the law than yelling fire in a movie theater.

1429
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,320
You can't do that.

1430
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,320
You just can't.

1431
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,160
I just think everybody should boo Mike Adams everywhere.

1432
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,800
He should be booed all the time.

1433
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,160
But that's why he lives on a ranch, so we can't boo him.

1434
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,840
There is a reason that rich people avoid poor people, yes.

1435
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
Too much booing.

1436
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Yeah.

1437
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,000
So I think that Mike, his progression from the initial article where he posted these

1438
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,840
pictures to the Monday blog post that overhyped and escalated things, I thought that was pretty

1439
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,840
irresponsible.

1440
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,840
Sure.

1441
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,800
And now if you listen to this, his appearance on Alex's show is going to be taking things

1442
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,920
even a step further.

1443
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,120
It's mind-blowing, Alex.

1444
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:12,520
There are little hooks, there are little gripper fibers, red and blue fibers in these masks

1445
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,280
and in the nasal swabs.

1446
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,920
I did ultraviolet photography, I did iodine staining on some of them to show the contrast.

1447
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,920
It is mind-blowing what's in these masks, and this is all getting inhaled into your

1448
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,140
lungs and the little hooks are grabbing onto your lung tissue.

1449
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:33,520
These things are designed to cause harm, not to help, and they do not block virus transmission.

1450
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,940
So that's kind of the summary of where we are, Alex, right now.

1451
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,680
So in the original post with the pictures, the game was asking questions.

1452
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,920
It even ends with a declaration that, quote, we don't know all the answers.

1453
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,200
It's all about making you worried about microscopic images and speculating about what they could

1454
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,680
be while hiding behind a very clear statement that we don't know what these things are.

1455
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,700
Then, by Monday, Mike's tone had changed.

1456
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,240
Gone was the declaration that the answers are still unclear, and in its place was this

1457
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:05,080
declaration, quote, it's clear that the masks and swabs are transferring materials to the

1458
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,760
body, not merely sampling materials or filtering materials.

1459
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,080
In other words, masks and swabs are themselves medical interventions with unknown health

1460
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,880
consequences.

1461
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,240
It seems like, with no new information and no real explanation at all, Mike had gone

1462
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,440
from questioning to definitively stating things.

1463
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,000
And now, here he is on Alex's show escalating these definitive statements that he can't

1464
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,800
back up at all.

1465
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,000
This is how the game is played for these people.

1466
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,800
They're liars, and their lies escalate, because that's how you continue to profit off them.

1467
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:39,200
It's a well-established game that they've played many, many times, and we've watched.

1468
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Oh boy.

1469
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
I...

1470
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
Flammethrower?

1471
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:51,800
I just want to find them in a restaurant and scream at them.

1472
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,440
Like I really don't know how loud I could honestly...

1473
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,920
That's why it's a priority for right-wing propagandists to learn how to cook.

1474
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,480
It's one of those things, Dan, where everybody knows I'm very loud.

1475
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,760
But because I'm very loud, I have no idea what the ceiling is.

1476
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,760
You know what I'm saying?

1477
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,760
I really don't know.

1478
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,760
You don't know your fastball.

1479
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,760
Yeah.

1480
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,840
If I could really let loose, I would like to know how loud I could be.

1481
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,180
And if I saw one of these people in a restaurant, I think we might discover it.

1482
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:21,080
It's like in Mortal Kombat, being pushed to your limit to find your superpower.

1483
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,080
Exactly.

1484
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,080
Yeah, I have to find my superpower.

1485
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,680
I have to grow mechanical arms.

1486
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,680
You'll turn into Banshee.

1487
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,680
That's what I gotta do.

1488
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,800
So, you know, we got people getting vaccinated.

1489
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,740
Mike says, don't do it.

1490
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:33,740
Don't do it.

1491
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,740
Don't.

1492
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,740
Sure.

1493
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,740
Sure.

1494
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,040
Because apparently there's going to be a dying off of vaccinated people in the fall

1495
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,040
or something.

1496
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
Fine.

1497
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,160
It's over for humanity who got vaccinated.

1498
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,160
There will only be non-vaccinated people.

1499
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,160
Fine.

1500
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Yep.

1501
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,160
That's kind of it now.

1502
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,160
Yeah.

1503
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,400
Alex, you're going to see the hospitals in the fall or the winter probably filled with

1504
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,840
people who are dying from this antibody dependent enhancement side effect of the vaccine.

1505
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,520
And they're going to say it's a new COVID variant and not even point out that it's not

1506
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,520
vaccinated.

1507
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,520
You nailed it.

1508
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,540
They're going to blame the unvaccinated for that wave.

1509
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:09,980
But if you check, it's only going to be people who have been vaccinated that are in the hospitals

1510
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:10,980
at that time.

1511
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,700
And they're going to be dying in waves.

1512
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,160
It's not a good situation.

1513
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,440
This is part of the depopulation agenda.

1514
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,960
This is going to play out over the next two to three years.

1515
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,760
And people who have already been vaccinated, there is no undo, sadly.

1516
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,760
There's no undo.

1517
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,840
Listeners, let me just tell you this.

1518
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,720
My spirit, my instinct, my intellect says, get to the country.

1519
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,720
Get dug in now.

1520
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,720
I've waited too long.

1521
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,720
I've been so busy on air.

1522
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,720
I haven't done it.

1523
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,260
Go away some in the next few months because I have to get ready.

1524
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,120
I mean, it's a miracle if it doesn't go to the next stage.

1525
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,800
Bill Gates and the UN have set things in motion now that I don't think they can turn off,

1526
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,800
Mike.

1527
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,800
Yeah.

1528
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,400
You can't turn this back.

1529
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,400
Okay.

1530
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:53,160
I guess when you're wrong, this'll be over for humanity.

1531
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:58,520
I just get, I get so frustrated with this bunker and whether or not it's set up because

1532
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,200
it keeps changing.

1533
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,760
It's either set up or I haven't finished it yet.

1534
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,560
I've been prepared for five years or yeah, it's full of survival food for me and my family

1535
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,560
are going to be great.

1536
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,560
We'll be fine now.

1537
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:14,360
Also, sometimes things are just so bad that I've got to take off the work to build a bunker.

1538
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,360
Of course.

1539
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,040
I think he's fucking with people.

1540
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,040
It's insane.

1541
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,520
Also, if he's taking off time in the near future, I would suspect that it's not because

1542
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,040
of bunker preparation.

1543
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,040
It's lawyers.

1544
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,040
I would think maybe that's more likely.

1545
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:33,100
It's fun how it's almost like a glitch in humanity where we never really think about

1546
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:39,440
how much we rely on shame just to like live in a society to the point where if you have

1547
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,400
no shame, it's almost like a glitch in the matrix.

1548
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:47,560
Like you can just get away with anything because people just assume that a human being, if

1549
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,960
they said it's over for humanity, there will only be lone survivors and then was so wrong,

1550
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,120
they didn't get to go back on the show for a while for them to come back and make a similar

1551
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:01,040
claim in the opposite direction.

1552
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,000
A human being would feel shame over this.

1553
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,360
You would think that somebody would be able to regulate themselves to the point of like,

1554
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,680
I should just stop.

1555
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,800
Listen, I've been too wrong.

1556
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,480
It's just too much.

1557
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,600
Yeah, because I think that if you were that wrong, the correct response would be to reflect

1558
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,760
on it and to be like, why was I that wrong?

1559
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,760
What is it about my method of finding information and discerning truth?

1560
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,260
What is it about that that was so wrong?

1561
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,800
Is it that I don't have a process?

1562
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,800
Yeah.

1563
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,800
Oh no.

1564
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,800
That's a problem.

1565
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,800
Yeah.

1566
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:39,960
You know what happens when you're making one of those papers for a school, or let's go

1567
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:47,120
with earlier, the Stanford situation, they felt shame having their name attached to it.

1568
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,280
They were like, we can't be a part of this and we can't let it happen.

1569
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,280
Right.

1570
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,280
Because they weren't.

1571
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,280
Because they weren't.

1572
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
Yeah.

1573
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,000
So for no reason, Mike gets pretty shitty here.

1574
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Sure.

1575
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Well, right.

1576
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,680
I believe the rapper DMX did die from the COVID vaccine that was then diagnosed as a

1577
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,680
heart attack, right?

1578
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,120
This would be an appropriate time for you to bark.

1579
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,120
Yeah.

1580
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,120
Go fuck yourself, man.

1581
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,000
Get his name out of your mouth.

1582
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah.

1583
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,480
Get his name out of your mouth.

1584
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,520
This is something that went around on social media, but there's no evidence that DMX got

1585
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,800
the COVID vaccine.

1586
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,080
And even if he did, which they don't even know, there's no way you could prove that

1587
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,280
it contributed or caused his death.

1588
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,280
This is just disgraceful.

1589
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,800
Anyway, we have one last clip of Mike and he can fuck himself and I hope he's gone for

1590
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,800
long times.

1591
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,360
Just to kind of wrap up my appearance on your show today, this is an extermination agenda.

1592
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,840
They will come for you sooner or later if they haven't already.

1593
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,800
You need to get out of the blue cities, get out of the blue states, get to someplace where

1594
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,880
you can have some self-reliance.

1595
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,200
You need to get real assets because an economic collapse is coming.

1596
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,880
They're going to confiscate all the dollars in bank accounts.

1597
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,720
Oh, that was my next point.

1598
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,720
Get scared of everything.

1599
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,840
Get out of the cities.

1600
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,640
Get all the money is gone.

1601
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,640
Go fuck yourself.

1602
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,640
Wow.

1603
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,960
So this episode started with Alex saying that he was going to switch it up.

1604
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,960
Sure, sure.

1605
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,960
Did not.

1606
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,960
No.

1607
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,960
Didn't take any calls.

1608
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,960
Nope.

1609
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,040
Talked to a dumb idiot named Mike Adams.

1610
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,040
Yep.

1611
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,640
Complained very racistly about the Oscars.

1612
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,640
You got it.

1613
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,880
And lied about human tragedy in a foreign country for his own profit.

1614
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,320
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

1615
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,280
That's a real, that's a real, what would you call that?

1616
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,280
Triple crown?

1617
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,240
I would say, would you say he hit for the cycle on that one?

1618
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,240
No.

1619
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,240
No.

1620
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:42,240
So we get to the 27th and Alex starts up and a totally different man, totally different

1621
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,240
vibe.

1622
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,240
This is going to be an incredibly jam-packed historic transmission.

1623
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,280
I know how to defeat the globalist.

1624
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,000
I've done deep research and I've had major epiphanies in the last 24 hours.

1625
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,320
I'm going to do my best to lay it all out today.

1626
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,440
Major epiphanies in the last 24 hours.

1627
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:05,440
You know, you can't go from opening your show with Unabomber to then being like, the next

1628
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,920
day, I've had some major epiphanies.

1629
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:11,280
Because that makes me feel like you've just escalated your Unabomber plan and you're feeling

1630
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,280
better about it.

1631
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,120
Well, it makes me wonder if like, what's the epiphany?

1632
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,880
Because he keeps doing this.

1633
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,040
Blow up universities and airports?

1634
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,280
He keeps doing this.

1635
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,920
It's nonsense.

1636
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,480
So many shows begin with, I had a vision last night and then it never comes.

1637
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,560
Spoiler alert, there is no epiphany.

1638
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:40,200
You know, something that really should be more annoying is that how often he says that

1639
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,000
he's transcended things and that he's above it or all of that stuff.

1640
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,320
It's like, you realize that by any definition of transcending, you would not be doing your

1641
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,320
show.

1642
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,320
Right.

1643
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,320
You would have stopped.

1644
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,320
Because you're above it.

1645
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,320
Yes.

1646
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,320
That's the point.

1647
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,320
That's how it works.

1648
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,480
You're like so bothered by petty little things.

1649
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:06,000
So bothered by Regina King at the Oscars giving a speech.

1650
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,480
I've transcended everything except for white identity fear and victimhood.

1651
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:16,780
Like Gautama wasn't sitting underneath a goddamn tree being like, oh man, Derek at the office

1652
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:18,220
is a real fucking dick.

1653
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,220
That's where you're wrong.

1654
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,220
He was.

1655
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,220
Okay, well that's fair.

1656
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,220
Nevermind.

1657
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,220
So anyway, we have big news, man.

1658
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,560
That's why this is such a big show.

1659
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,560
Sure.

1660
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,560
So here we are.

1661
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:33,840
I'm going to be very calm here because this is so important and so huge and so illegal

1662
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:41,360
and so over the top that if we just put this information out there, it'll become normalized.

1663
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,780
We must soak the sin.

1664
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,120
We must cogitate on it.

1665
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,960
We must mold around psychologically, spiritually.

1666
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:54,320
We should pray about this because this is all now revealing itself.

1667
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,320
It's coming out in the open.

1668
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,520
I want to beat up whoever taught him the word cogitate.

1669
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,520
It's really annoying.

1670
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,520
Yeah.

1671
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,520
Yeah.

1672
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,360
So anyway, we got big news and when I was listening to this, I was like, all right,

1673
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,360
hit me.

1674
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,360
I'm ready.

1675
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,360
Totally.

1677
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,360
Come at me.

1678
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,360
Come at me.

1679
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:19,360
Just in one stack, one stack of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

1680
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:32,000
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, one inch tall stack of 24 stacks.

1681
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:41,520
This is just today's news is so mind blowing, so key, so important that I shutter at even

1682
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,320
trying to properly document it.

1683
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:51,840
So I, I will just direct you in this segment to what the big stories are in my view, and

1684
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,960
then I will humbly try to cover it as best I can.

1685
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,120
And then we got big guests coming up as well.

1686
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,120
Oh boy.

1687
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,520
Oh boy.

1688
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,740
That's really become his like tonight show.

1689
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,120
We've got a great show for you tonight.

1690
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,180
We're the big shoe.

1691
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,840
They all can't be great, man.

1692
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,240
They all can't be great.

1693
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,240
Okay.

1694
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,240
It's fine.

1695
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,240
It's fine.

1696
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,240
We've got a good show for you tonight.

1697
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,240
That's fine.

1698
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
You're a night show.

1699
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,320
I've noticed that I have this little tick where I say that things are interesting and

1700
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:19,800
a part of that is because I do think a lot of this stuff is interesting, but I do realize

1701
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,960
that at a certain point I'm saying everything is interesting and maybe, well, that's fair.

1702
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,040
Maybe that's not, but for Alex, it's, it's, I have news that will shake the foundations

1703
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,040
of reality.

1704
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,920
I mean, it seems almost easy to point this out, but if you weren't interested in it,

1705
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,920
it wouldn't be in the show.

1706
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,920
That's true.

1707
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,960
But it is still a little bit redundant.

1708
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,960
That's fair.

1709
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,120
So here's the first story that Alex gets to, because I was just like, all right, let's,

1710
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,120
let's do this, man.

1711
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,320
You have 24 stacks of news, come on, rapid fire, baby.

1712
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,240
We go out and tell them, Hey, the mask are never coming off until you say no, that gives

1713
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,700
you bacterial pneumonia.

1714
01:15:54,700 --> 01:16:01,760
It psychologically screws up children and it doesn't protect you.

1715
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,560
And Carlson is now saying that you need to go out and just like you see somebody beating

1716
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:13,560
their kid at Walmart need to say, Hey, you need to stop that by frankly, you're their

1717
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,560
parent.

1718
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,560
The kid's out of control.

1719
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,560
Maybe they need a good spat.

1720
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,560
Maybe he's being too liberal there.

1721
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:23,600
The point is this is child abuse more like you see somebody breaking the skin at Walmart.

1722
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Okay.

1723
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,560
Alex trying to equivocate about, uh, beating the kids at Walmart.

1724
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,560
All right.

1725
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,360
It is so easy to see how quickly the party of personal responsibility turns into the

1726
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:39,960
party of fascist Lee attack children because their parents can't take care of them.

1727
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,200
They're wearing a mask.

1728
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,200
Yeah.

1729
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
Stop them from wearing masks.

1730
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,200
Yeah.

1731
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,200
Yeah.

1732
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,200
Yeah.

1733
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,200
Go into other people's lives.

1734
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,720
The party of personnel responsibility.

1735
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,720
Sure.

1736
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,720
Yeah.

1737
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,720
Uh, yeah.

1738
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,200
So the first story is the Tucker is anti mask.

1739
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,200
Great.

1740
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,200
Okay.

1741
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,200
Here's the second story.

1742
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
Sure.

1743
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,880
Here's the big super Supreme enchilada.

1744
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:07,200
Is that two enchiladas medical doctors all over the world from Germany to Canada that

1745
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:14,480
are being arrested by the police that's coming up German police ransacked the house of doctor

1746
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,720
after he provides evidence in court, the children are endangered in their mental, physical and

1747
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,800
spiritual wellbeing by the obligation to wear a face mask.

1748
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:30,640
This headline appears on a page on the website, daily general news.com whatever the fuck that

1749
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,640
is.

1750
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,640
All right.

1751
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,920
I know that I need to go to the general to get some insurance or something.

1752
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:41,680
But also one of the problems is that this webpage is no longer there.

1753
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,580
It's a four Oh four page doesn't exist.

1754
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:44,580
That's a problem.

1755
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:46,200
There's no snapshot of it in the way back machine.

1756
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,640
And I find all of this quite suspicious.

1757
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,640
Interestingly, I found an article on gateway pundit.

1758
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:56,580
That's clearly about the same story, but with a slightly different headline, quote German

1759
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:01,140
police ransack the home of judge after he agrees with evidence in court that children

1760
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:04,800
are endangered in their mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing by the obligation to wear

1761
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,800
face masks.

1762
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,800
Yeah.

1763
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,440
You notice the difference now longer physician.

1764
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,840
Now it's judge.

1765
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,840
Yeah.

1766
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,400
That's no, I think police should raid.

1767
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
Police should raid that.

1768
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,400
Yeah.

1769
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:19,280
There are news sources on this that I actually find credible about the story, but the narrative

1770
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,840
is presented on gateway pundit type outlets is that this judge named Christian Detmer

1771
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,560
had his house rated as retaliation for ruling the COVID-19 related cautionary measures like

1772
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,160
masks could not be enforced in schools.

1773
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:36,800
It is only related to two schools in this area.

1774
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,200
It does seem like this ruling did happen.

1775
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,680
I think I, I can be comfortable with some of the books that I've seen on that.

1776
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:48,120
Although the impact and the scope of its applicability, or if it would stand up to a hearing in a

1777
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,960
higher court, that remains an open question.

1778
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:50,960
Sure.

1779
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,960
Sure.

1780
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,400
I can't find any information about a possible raid that I feel comfortable believing someone

1781
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,480
to suspend judgment on this until there's more details.

1782
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,360
That said, Alex is telling the wrong version of this story.

1783
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,320
He said it's a doctor who provided evidence when the story is that it's a judge who handed

1784
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,840
down the opinion in the case, who ignored evidence.

1785
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,880
I suspect one of Alex's interns found the story on a site like daily general news before

1786
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,200
it was spun correctly.

1787
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,240
So he's reporting the wrong version of the story here.

1788
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,480
That's that's kind of what I think.

1789
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,280
So that's the big supermassive enchilada.

1790
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,280
Great.

1791
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:26,580
Isn't that such like a small emblem of his worldview of just like, this is happening

1792
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,840
all around the world from Canada to Germany.

1793
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,840
Yeah.

1794
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,840
Yeah.

1795
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,840
And you're like, okay.

1796
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:32,840
I cannot think of third country.

1797
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,840
All right, buddy.

1798
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:39,240
So, uh, here's the, what's another great, uh, this is the chilaquiles right here.

1799
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,360
Joe Biden announced yesterday, he's going to send aid to India.

1800
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,360
It's not vitamin C.

1801
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,180
It's not vitamin D.

1802
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,980
It's not an end of the lockdown.

1803
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,800
It's not zinc.

1804
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,080
It's not even oxygen bottles.

1805
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,860
When any medical doctor in the Indians aren't stupid, they are you talking about space balls

1806
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:02,200
because the population is so huge that you can do inhaled steroid and a hundred percent

1807
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,320
of the time helps you knocks it out.

1808
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,200
They're not telling them any of that.

1809
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:13,160
They're shipping them tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca.

1810
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:18,000
That's even banned in the U S is not authorized in the U S Biden's going to dump Europe's

1811
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,300
banned vaccine on the Indian total war crime.

1812
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:26,960
First things first, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine was actually developed by the serum

1813
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,040
Institute of India and is produced there under the name COVID shield.

1814
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,880
That vaccine has always been approved for use in India and India.

1815
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,160
Wasn't one of the countries that suspended it.

1816
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,560
The reason we're sending a bunch to India is because in order to make sure the vaccines

1817
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,120
could get made countries like the United States agreed to purchase a ton of them in advance

1818
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,960
along the way, various countries got to decide which they would approve for use in their

1819
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:52,160
country and it resulted in the situation we're in now where we have a ton of doses of the

1820
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,020
AstraZeneca vaccine, but it's not approved for use in the United States.

1821
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:00,080
It is effective and India can use it and they've chosen it's one of their approved vaccine.

1822
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,120
So it makes sense to send it to them as opposed to letting it go to waste.

1823
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,600
This could do that fake laughing nonsense all he wants, but this is not the story.

1824
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:13,120
It's not what he's making it, but we have one more.

1825
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,640
Also it's just to be clear, it is not like they're putting them all in boxes right now

1826
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,400
and they're like getting all these little vials and millions of vials and all these

1827
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,760
big boxes they're going to put up on a ship that's yeah, these, it expires.

1828
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,880
They don't even exist yet, you know, like, okay, all right, man, come on.

1829
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:37,720
So if that was the chilaquiles, then what do we got a chile relleno another dish schools

1830
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:43,720
around the world are banning people working there who've taken the experimental MRNA gene

1831
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:48,900
therapy because it can cause the spread of real viruses.

1832
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:53,820
That's even your precious wall street journal and NPR reporting that.

1833
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:58,280
So it's a big, big, big deal, ladies and gentlemen.

1834
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,280
This isn't true.

1835
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,800
There was one school in Miami called the Centner Academy that's banned vaccinated teachers

1836
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,680
from interacting with students.

1837
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,200
It's a private school that was opened in 2019 that appears to be run by nuts.

1838
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,960
So I'm not too surprised here, but it's pretty funny that Alex is exaggerating this

1839
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,480
into a phenomenon where all over the world schools are banning vaccinated teachers.

1840
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,480
Ridiculous.

1841
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,480
Wow.

1842
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:23,480
Yeah, man, you can just be a dumb dumb anywhere and Alex will find you.

1843
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:30,080
So we had, uh, our boy, the health ranger on the last episode and now we got another,

1844
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
how are we going to up the game?

1845
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,080
Oh, we got a ding dong.

1846
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,080
Okay.

1847
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:40,840
Well, ladies and gentlemen, he has been banned off of the internet as we know it, except

1848
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,640
for his own site, which is still very popular.

1849
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,880
It makes them mad.

1850
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,120
So he's not banned off the internet as we know it.

1851
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,120
Uh, yeah.

1852
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,400
I mean, he still has a verified account on Twitter.

1853
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:53,800
It seems like he's very not banned on the internet as we know it if his own page is

1854
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,800
up.

1855
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,800
Yeah.

1856
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,800
So I checked that and it's still up there verified.

1857
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,800
Sure.

1858
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,080
And while I was confirming that I checked out his pin tweet, which was captioned video

1859
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,440
proof that I'm on a no fly list.

1860
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,200
Uh, my experience of this is a little bit different.

1861
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,200
Okay.

1862
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,800
Here's a little clip that made me like, I don't know.

1863
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,440
And there's no way I could get on this plane.

1864
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,000
No, you cannot allow, they're not letting you fly with Southwest.

1865
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
With Southwest.

1866
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
But maybe Delta, maybe.

1867
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I'm not sure.

1868
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Okay.

1869
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I know that was a TSA number.

1870
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I'm not sure if you're blocking off just the no flight list.

1871
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Did they give you a reason?

1872
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
No.

1873
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
It's a no fly list you said?

1874
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I'm not sure.

1875
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Oh, okay.

1876
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,400
So that's from Nick's video.

1877
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,400
Proof!

1878
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,400
Here's Alex's coverage.

1879
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,400
Okay.

1880
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,400
So the truth gets out when you speak out and you take action.

1881
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:44,400
Here's the article from info awards.com breaking America first founder, Nick Fuentes put on

1882
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,160
no fly list.

1883
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,320
And they told him why.

1884
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,920
You were at the Capitol, not even in the Capitol.

1885
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,880
See now they've arrested 500 that went in now.

1886
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,680
So the video that Nick Fuentes posted of himself at the airport doesn't show them saying why

1887
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,640
or even that he is on a no fly list.

1888
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,640
Was that?

1889
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,640
Weird.

1890
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,640
It's weird.

1891
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,640
It's weird.

1892
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,960
The proof that is being presented doesn't seem to, it seems like it's bullshit.

1893
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:10,960
Wait.

1894
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,760
So the time that I saw all that trending nonsense about Fuentes is on a no fly list for sure.

1895
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,280
Is that what that's all based off of?

1896
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,280
What?

1897
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,240
That, that, that he's on a no fly list.

1898
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,240
His own video?

1899
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,240
Um, yeah.

1900
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,880
And I guess he, we'll, we'll talk about it a little bit more.

1901
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:26,880
Okay.

1902
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,920
He was trying to go down to a DeSantis rally in Florida and he wasn't allowed to fly.

1903
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,400
And there are some better theories as to why.

1904
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,400
Yeah, that makes sense.

1905
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,400
And we'll get to that once Nick's on the show.

1906
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,400
Okay.

1907
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,400
Okay.

1908
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,740
But Alex has to spread some other bullshit first.

1909
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:43,720
They're intimidating going to witnesses in the Chauvin trial and throwing pig blood on

1910
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,040
what they thinks their house at pig heads and going to the jurors houses.

1911
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,760
We now learned somebody had leaked it.

1912
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:53,520
That's why they voted and went along with the mob, intimidating him, whether you think

1913
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,680
show almost guilty or not.

1914
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,680
He's got to go free.

1915
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,720
I don't care if he's black or white because of that.

1916
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,200
Alex has this story completely wrong.

1917
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,620
I've still seen no evidence of any jury intimidation in the Chauvin case, but Alex is specifically

1918
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:09,020
lying about one comment that was reported where someone referred to as a Chauvin juror

1919
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,640
said, quote, I did not want to go through all the rioting and destruction again.

1920
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,960
I was concerned about people coming to my house.

1921
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,320
If they were not happy with the verdict, liars like Jack Pessobek started passing it along

1922
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,320
on social media.

1923
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,120
And the story spread pretty far that way.

1924
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:25,640
And it's almost certainly what Alex is covering as real news here.

1925
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:30,360
The problem is that this person wasn't a jury and the juror in the trial, she was an alternate

1926
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:33,640
juror who played absolutely no role in the deciding of the case.

1927
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,100
And the comment was taken out of context.

1928
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:40,320
The full context of that quote is her response to a question posed by a local Minneapolis

1929
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:46,260
news outlet about whether or not she wanted to be a juror, quote, I had mixed feelings.

1930
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:50,020
There was a question on the questionnaire about that, and I didn't know because the

1931
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:53,700
reason at that time was obviously I didn't know what the outcome was going to be.

1932
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,240
So I felt like either way, the outcome was you're going to disappoint one group or the

1933
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,240
other.

1934
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,640
So I didn't want to go through this whole rioting and destruction again.

1935
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:04,480
And, you know, a little concerned about people outside my house if they weren't happy with

1936
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,480
the verdict.

1937
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,480
Sure.

1938
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,120
She was just discussing the idea of whether or not she wanted to be a juror at the time.

1939
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,800
And totally reasonable fears, too.

1940
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:16,760
Yeah, and this has been twisted by liars like Jack Pessobic and being misreported by Alex

1941
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:22,080
in order to try and argue for getting Chauvin freed.

1942
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,080
Of course.

1943
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,080
Because of course.

1944
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,080
Yeah, naturally.

1945
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:30,280
So we get to Nick Fuentes, and I just do that because Alex likes to pronounce his name with

1946
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,920
that hard U in there.

1947
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,920
Fuentes.

1948
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:33,920
Fuentes.

1949
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:39,240
And he's going to tell a story of what happened to him at the airport.

1950
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:42,060
And I will say that, I don't know, I don't know if this did happen.

1951
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:46,040
It's certainly not in the video labeled proof that I'm on a no fly list.

1952
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,360
If this is his proof, you'd think it would be in the video.

1953
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,640
Well, his story, it sounds like the story that someone like him would tell, but it certainly

1954
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,840
doesn't match that video.

1955
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:55,840
Wow.

1956
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,000
Because she said, you know, is there anything that might be causing this?

1957
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Is it a mask thing?

1958
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,480
Did you have an incident on American before?

1959
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,120
I said, no, nothing like that.

1960
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,640
Never any issues like that on American Airlines.

1961
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,600
And you know, I've been flying pretty recently.

1962
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,480
She said, OK, well, I'll give them another call.

1963
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,720
And they relayed the same message.

1964
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,040
I'm not able to fly.

1965
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,880
And I said, well, you know, honestly, it's political.

1966
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,280
I said, I'm a political guy.

1967
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,520
I said, I think it's political.

1968
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,680
And she goes, she goes, I'm not supposed to say this, but I think this woke stuff is out

1969
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,680
of control.

1970
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,160
I don't think it's fired, but they're pushing this on the corporations.

1971
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,320
So, you know, she was even sympathetic.

1972
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,320
Yeah, sure.

1973
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,040
These people are psycho.

1974
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,040
These are absolute psychos.

1975
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,600
This is that Jacob Wall at the coffee shop kind of nonsense.

1976
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,600
Absolute lunatics.

1977
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,600
Yeah.

1978
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,680
So this is not in the video, but this is the story.

1979
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,600
He goes, he talks to these people and they say, no, you cannot fly.

1980
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,080
So he goes, he goes to United.

1981
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,080
And guess what?

1982
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,080
This isn't in the video either, because he was talking to someone from Southwest.

1983
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:52,520
Yeah, it does seem like he was talking to somebody from Southwest.

1984
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,680
I went over to United.

1985
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,320
I went all the way over to the other terminal.

1986
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,760
I booked the same flight, you know, 1040 a.m. to Palm Beach from O'Hare.

1987
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,680
I went up to the counter and she told me the exact same thing.

1988
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:06,560
She was on the phone with the TSA for a half hour, said, nope, I'm sorry.

1989
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,800
And she goes, and you know what?

1990
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,160
I just Googled you.

1991
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,560
And I think I know why that is.

1992
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,560
That's what she said.

1993
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,640
He goes, and I'm so sorry, but but there's nothing I could do.

1994
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,560
I said, OK, is there anyone I could talk to?

1995
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,700
Can I go to the TSA?

1996
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,040
She goes, nope, nobody could talk to.

1997
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,040
That's it.

1998
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,920
So I'm on the no fly list.

1999
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,240
And and it has to do with the Capitol on January 6th.

2000
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,240
OK.

2001
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:31,240
I don't see any indication that any of this is real.

2002
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,400
This is all just being suggested.

2003
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,400
Nope.

2004
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,920
A bunch of nonsense.

2005
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,000
No, but I should get a text alert if I know he's in Chicago.

2006
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
He lives in Chicago.

2007
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I know.

2008
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,760
But like where I can find him, you know, like in public, you know what I'm saying?

2009
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:51,000
Like I only because Amazon Prime is sending me something right now and you know what I'm

2010
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
saying?

2011
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I'm not going to say what it is.

2012
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Amazon Prime.

2013
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I only agree with this.

2014
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,880
If the only use of that information is avoiding wherever exactly, I would absolutely avoid

2015
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,560
it with the thing that I am going to like this kind of talk, man.

2016
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,560
Oh, come on.

2017
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:08,200
So Alex recaps Nick's story.

2018
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:11,840
And I will say there are two giant assumptions in here.

2019
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,840
Recap.

2020
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,440
You've been put on a no fly list.

2021
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:18,600
They admitted it's because you weren't simply covering the Capitol.

2022
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,600
So no fly list and because you were covering the Capitol.

2023
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,600
Right.

2024
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,600
Those are the assumptions.

2025
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,600
Right.

2026
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,740
There's no reason to suspect that Nick is on a no fly list because of the events of

2027
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,960
January 6th.

2028
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:33,880
A lot of folks might have forgotten by now, but in December 2020, Nick made a big deal

2029
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:38,540
online about getting kicked off a plane for not wearing his mask correctly and told the

2030
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:42,000
guy on the plane, fuck you and eat shit.

2031
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,160
That might have something to do with it.

2032
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,160
Yeah.

2033
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,320
You remember in that first clip that Nick was talking, he's like, is this something

2034
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,320
to do with masks?

2035
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,320
Yeah.

2036
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,560
It's obviously because you got kicked off a plane six months ago.

2037
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,560
Obviously.

2038
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,160
I don't know if he's on a no fly list.

2039
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:58,880
I would assume he's not, since the simpler explanation is that he's a public figure who

2040
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,660
made a big deal out of an altercation he initiated on a plane like six months ago.

2041
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,660
As a stunt?

2042
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:05,660
Yeah.

2043
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:07,360
So I would say that maybe airlines are like, nah.

2044
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,360
Hey, fuck you.

2045
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,360
Yeah.

2046
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,360
How about that?

2047
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:15,440
Even if it wasn't on my airline, I would maybe not let him on based on that sort of public

2048
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,440
incident.

2049
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,440
I don't want to deal with that.

2050
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,440
I don't know.

2051
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,120
You have the right to refuse service to an asshole.

2052
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,000
So why would you want that?

2053
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Even the possibility of that happening again, especially if you know that he's a provocateur.

2054
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Yeah.

2055
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,120
And him trying to pretend that that didn't happen is really funny.

2056
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,120
Yeah.

2057
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,480
Him trying to be like, oh, is there a mask thing?

2058
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,480
No.

2059
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:34,480
No.

2060
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,480
It must be the January capital six.

2061
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,480
It must be that right.

2062
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,480
Yeah.

2063
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,480
So anyway, fuck him.

2064
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,480
Fuck him.

2065
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,480
In this next clip, Alex channels Reagan in a very inspirational way.

2066
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,480
Sure.

2067
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:55,640
Ronald Reagan back in 1989, right as he was leaving office, said, Mr. Gorbachev, tear

2068
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,440
down that wall.

2069
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:05,160
Well, I say, like he said in 88 was the year, not Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.

2070
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:10,880
I say, puppet Biden, tear off that mask off your dirty bandit face.

2071
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,680
Don't think that's going to resonate through time.

2072
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:18,120
No, just as inspiring, just as inspiring that is going to be one of those, you know, in

2073
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,620
those montages where they do like, oh, the greatest generation kind of shit.

2074
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:26,040
And they go through all of that and they go through the big moments of history that is

2075
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:32,000
going 50 years from now, 50 years from now, that will be in the real show me your dirty

2076
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
bandit face.

2077
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I could see it.

2078
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Things go wrong.

2079
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
I could see it.

2080
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Yeah.

2081
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:44,680
So Alex at this point talks to a Canadian preacher who's had the police show up a couple

2082
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:48,080
times because he's not following COVID restrictions.

2083
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,080
It's not the same Canadian church that we talked about before.

2084
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,080
It's another one.

2085
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,640
I'm going to skip this because it's, it's, who cares?

2086
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:58,760
It's another, if you're a preacher that goes on Infowars, you're a piece of shit.

2087
01:31:58,760 --> 01:31:59,760
It's a bad sign.

2088
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,760
Yeah.

2089
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,760
You're a piece of shit.

2090
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,200
So, uh, we, we have, uh, also Alex just getting into this weird thing where he's complaining

2091
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,760
about the left and they're all, they're all demons now.

2092
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,600
I'll just go ahead and play it.

2093
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,600
Why not?

2094
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:16,400
When I see the trendies with their mask and I see them with their hatred and their pedophilia

2095
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,600
and I mean, cause they've converted a lot of the low level left into evil.

2096
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,100
Now, I mean, there used to be kind of high level of super evil than kind of mid level.

2097
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,800
Now the average leftist is for all intents and purposes, a devil worshiping ghoul.

2098
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,380
I don't, I don't know what's happened to them, but they're gone folks.

2099
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:37,360
They're programmed by big tech, they're programmed by media and they're a small minority of people,

2100
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,440
but they infest all the main cities.

2101
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:44,880
They command black lives matter, uh, and they command the Antifa and they're just gone.

2102
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,880
Yeah.

2103
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,280
So, you know, even the low level, this is just trickling down.

2104
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:52,960
It used to just be like the top level was, no, now we're all demons.

2105
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,440
Every single one of us.

2106
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:55,440
We're gone.

2107
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,640
There's nothing that can be done for us.

2108
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,080
There's nothing that can be done for us, Dan.

2109
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,800
I don't know if you know what kind of language that might, you know.

2110
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,880
Boy, it doesn't, it's not reminiscent.

2111
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:06,880
Nope.

2112
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,320
So, uh, at the beginning of this episode though, like Alex had such promise.

2113
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,320
He had an epiphany.

2114
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,280
He had 24 stacks of paper.

2115
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,280
Yeah.

2116
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,920
I haven't gotten through one stack today of all I've got here.

2117
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,920
Shame.

2118
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,560
I mean, it's that much news.

2119
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,560
Who's hosting the fourth hour?

2120
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,520
I may have to take it over.

2121
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,560
Oh, Paul Joseph Watson, I'll let him host.

2122
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:33,000
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is genocide going on in front of everybody.

2123
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,880
By the way, if we don't fund ourselves, we won't be here.

2124
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,120
So it's a win, win, win.

2125
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,120
Please support us at m4.com.

2126
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,120
We've got a lot of new, great t-shirts.

2127
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,760
Wonder why you didn't get through those 24 stacks.

2128
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:47,040
You know, at a certain point, I think you would recognize that like, all right, I'd

2129
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,120
never get through the first stack.

2130
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,600
Only two stacks is the maximum.

2131
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,520
Why do you have the other 22?

2132
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,480
I mean, you know, everybody needs a little set deck.

2133
01:33:56,480 --> 01:34:00,200
You're delusional if you think you're ever going to...

2134
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,200
Let's go back to late night.

2135
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,320
Why do so many of them have that mic on the desk?

2136
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,880
You know they're wearing lapel mics.

2137
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:05,880
It's just set deck.

2138
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:09,560
But it's like, okay, so you prepare a meal for yourself, right?

2139
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:15,000
And every night you make 10 servings and you get through like three quarters of one and

2140
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,580
then you're full and you throw away all that food.

2141
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:20,240
And then the next day you're like, oh, I got all this food here.

2142
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,360
This is going to be great.

2143
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,460
I got all this food.

2144
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:26,720
You get through maybe half of a serving this time because maybe you're not as hungry that

2145
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,720
night.

2146
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:33,600
Dan, there is a paper mill in Oregon that relies on Alex exclusively.

2147
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,920
That brings me to my next point.

2148
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,600
He better be fucking recycling.

2149
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,600
I doubt he is.

2150
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,600
Yeah, probably not.

2151
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,600
I doubt he is.

2152
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,960
So we have another guest here and it's another champion weirdo.

2153
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,400
This guy, God damn, what a weirdo.

2154
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:53,480
I am Alex Jones, your host and the great Steve Quayle, best selling author, filmmaker, one

2155
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,920
of the first big survivalists, one of the top survivalists.

2156
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,920
Top survivalists.

2157
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,840
And I would read his books 25 years ago, 20 years ago and say quite entertaining.

2158
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:07,040
And I knew a lot of it was true, but I thought some of the, some of the conclusions he came

2159
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,880
to were a little extreme.

2160
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,920
Well now it looks like he's been dead on.

2161
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,440
Oh, what are those extreme conclusions?

2162
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,440
Alex?

2163
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,440
You want to talk about them?

2164
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:17,440
Maybe they're giants.

2165
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,440
You know what?

2166
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,440
Here's my new pitch.

2167
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,440
Here's my new pitch, Dan.

2168
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:21,440
All right.

2169
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,440
Before these assholes get to say a God damn word about being a survivalist, you have to

2170
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,440
go on Naked and Afraid and win.

2171
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,640
You have to.

2172
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,640
That is it.

2173
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:34,120
If you call yourself a top survivalist and you have not been on Naked and Afraid, fuck

2174
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,120
off.

2175
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,120
Get out of here.

2176
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,120
I don't think Steve would make it.

2177
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,120
No, of course not.

2178
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:43,480
So I love that Steve was on because I had been wanting to play this clip for you.

2179
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,480
Sure.

2180
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:50,360
So Steve Quayle was recently on the Jim Bakker show and for just this clip, I was going to

2181
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,360
make an episode out of it.

2182
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,600
You were going to do the whole thing?

2183
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,120
Because it, but it's so boring.

2184
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,120
I couldn't do that.

2185
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:00,320
So thankfully, I listened to the whole episode and I didn't want to go back and find it.

2186
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:06,640
But thankfully Right Wing Watch had cut out this particular clip where, dude, get ready.

2187
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,580
Thank you Steve Quayle for giving us an excuse.

2188
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:14,520
Mike down to have your mind blown by Jim Bakker and Steve Quayle.

2189
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:21,360
Zombies that are on the earth are a disease like any other disease that affects people

2190
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,680
and they become like zombies.

2191
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,120
Is that right?

2192
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:28,400
Forgive me, but that's only part of the story.

2193
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:35,640
Zombies, zombies also have the evil spiritual entity known as demon possession, okay?

2194
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:40,640
Because there is no rationale with a zombie.

2195
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:46,040
The best way to explain zombies' bloodlust is this, the appetite of demons expressed

2196
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,040
through humans.

2197
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:51,760
It should be astonishing to people that the richest people in the world, not all of them,

2198
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:59,400
but some of them, are into occult ceremonies where they have to drink, you know, blood

2199
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,000
that's extracted from a tortured child.

2200
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:08,400
Now that's sick, but that's the appetite of demons expressed through humans.

2201
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:16,080
The ancient world dealt with monsters, mythological and real, and this is something that is really

2202
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,680
important to get through.

2203
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:25,800
The disease will basically destroy the human defenses.

2204
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,240
God gave us defenses as humans to resist the devil and he will flee.

2205
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:38,400
But when you're inviting, or what's the word I want, embracing abject demon possession,

2206
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:46,760
giving yourself over to be inhabitant, to be inhabited by the demons who then become

2207
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,360
your inhabitants, it's a twofold.

2208
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:55,160
What I'm saying, Jim, is they can induce zombieism, at least the appetite for human flesh.

2209
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:59,800
But at the end of the thing, it's both hands, right hand and left hand.

2210
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:07,160
And the left hand simply is the evil spiritual possession of that zombie.

2211
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:12,600
So yeah, Steve Coyle just this month was on Jim Bakker's show talking about zombies.

2212
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,600
Wow.

2213
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,600
Yeah.

2214
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:20,720
I do appreciate how much of Christianity does seem to get their idea of the world from like

2215
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,720
the Hellblazer comics.

2216
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:27,520
Like John Constantine is also a factor in Jim Bakker's reality.

2217
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,320
I would love that conversation taking place outside of a televangelist's studio.

2218
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,280
Yeah, that'd be fun.

2219
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,960
Discussing, what does make a zombie a zombie?

2220
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,600
Like me and my friends could maybe have that conversation.

2221
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,040
That would be, I mean, yeah, you'd have to argue.

2222
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,920
What are the essential elements of a zombie?

2223
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,720
I don't want Jim Bakker and Steve Coyle having that conversation.

2224
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:52,560
It'd be like a game of Scattergories, you'd have to argue your position on that, yeah.

2225
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,320
God, what a fucking weirdo.

2226
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,800
But you're going to come, ugh.

2227
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:58,800
Zombies are among us, man.

2228
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,200
You're going to really come out and say, see, but you, shouldn't Christians all uniformly

2229
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:10,560
be like, we can't be associated with this because if we really do allow zombies, people

2230
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,080
are going to put that together with the rest of the bullshit we believe and they're going

2231
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,240
to be like, maybe Christianity's stupid.

2232
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:19,680
Or that classical meme that Jesus is a zombie.

2233
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,680
Yeah, exactly.

2234
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:26,640
It's like, okay, if you start adding too many mythical elements into it, especially ones

2235
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,840
that are referenced in Night of the Living Fucking Dead.

2236
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:36,240
I would say that what your best order of business is, if you're a religion, don't incorporate

2237
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,800
any universal monsters.

2238
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,640
Uh-uh, no, no, no, no.

2239
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,640
No mummies.

2240
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,080
At no point in time should Jesus say, we're coming to get you, Barbara.

2241
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,200
No Dracula.

2242
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,760
That's not going to happen.

2243
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:47,760
Yeah.

2244
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,560
So anyway, I don't respect Steve Coyle at all.

2245
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,560
No.

2246
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:56,040
Um, and so we just have a series of him saying things and talking to Alex that I have no

2247
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,080
interest in treating as real.

2248
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,100
No, no even consideration.

2249
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,680
You think zombies are real.

2250
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:04,680
The end.

2251
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,560
So anyway, the vaccine is part of a depopulation agenda.

2252
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,360
This is what's really important.

2253
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,800
Ladies and gentlemen, this is all about one thing.

2254
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:18,000
It's about the depopulation of the world from 7.9 billion to 500 million and that's where

2255
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,600
we're at right now.

2256
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:24,080
That's a reference to the Georgia Guidestones, which apparently, uh, Steve Coyle believes

2257
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,600
are real and the globalists are, yep.

2258
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:33,520
I do love how the globalists love a round number that's easy for ridiculous idiots to

2259
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,520
understand.

2260
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:40,720
It's so convenient how ridiculous idiots are always given nice round numbers, you know?

2261
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,720
It's great.

2262
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,720
It's great.

2263
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:45,480
So, uh, you know, Alex Jones likes to talk about interviews that he did years in the

2264
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,920
past that no one can ever find.

2265
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:47,920
Of course.

2266
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,920
And certainly prove a lot of stuff.

2267
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,920
Yep.

2268
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,920
Steve does too.

2269
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:55,280
And actually I got the sense from listening to this that Alex's whole story about him

2270
01:40:55,280 --> 01:41:00,320
seeing fish people with sad human eyes is a story he cribbed from Steve Coyle.

2271
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,880
You think he's stealing that story?

2272
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,880
Oh no.

2273
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,960
Alex, I interviewed one of the Intel world's most famous assassins.

2274
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:13,280
He died 15 years ago and he said, Steve, I've been in a laboratory, some of the most secret

2275
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:21,040
places in the deep underwater, uh, in the jungles, uh, in, uh, Borneo, uh, the Island

2276
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,040
of dr.

2277
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,040
Morello.

2278
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:27,920
And he said, I've seen, I've seen things in cages, half human, half lion, by the way,

2279
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:31,340
the lion men of Moab is literally in the old Testament.

2280
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:35,560
But he said, these creatures were calling out to me in a human voice, help me, help

2281
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,560
me.

2282
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,560
I'm human.

2283
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,680
And he started to weep.

2284
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:39,680
This is a CIA guy.

2285
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:40,680
And he started to weep.

2286
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:45,180
He says, Steve, they weren't human, but there was a human component that was begging me

2287
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,180
to help.

2288
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:47,840
And there was no help for them.

2289
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,920
That stuff makes a stick in my spirit.

2290
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:51,920
Okay.

2291
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:52,920
Okay.

2292
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,800
So your story that you're telling me one of the best assassins, one of the best assassins

2293
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:03,280
for the CIA, someone who's the best at killing people.

2294
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,280
Yes.

2295
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:05,280
And especially for the CIA.

2296
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:09,680
So, you know, there's no morality within this person that cannot be, I wouldn't assume.

2297
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:12,280
So if the other details of the story are correct.

2298
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:19,800
But his breaking point, or I don't, their breaking point was half man, half man, half

2299
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,800
lion.

2300
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:28,480
And by the way, no reason, no reason whatsoever, none to add in the lion men of Moab, because

2301
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:32,880
these are genetically created now, not the lion men of Moab.

2302
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:38,080
They didn't like reconstitute the goddamn lion men from the Old Testament.

2303
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,720
That might be part of his argument.

2304
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:40,720
Okay.

2305
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,720
I'm sorry.

2306
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,720
So they discovered old lion man blood.

2307
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:50,960
I think that Steve's argument is that in biblical times before the flood, they were making human

2308
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:51,960
animal hybrids.

2309
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,320
See, that's kind of what I was thinking.

2310
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:54,320
Yep.

2311
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,320
And that history is repeating itself now.

2312
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,320
Right.

2313
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,320
Yep.

2314
01:42:58,320 --> 01:42:59,320
That's where we're at.

2315
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:00,320
Yeah.

2316
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,320
Yep.

2317
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,320
So anyway.

2318
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,320
You got to cop to this.

2319
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,320
If you're a Christian, you got to cop to the lion men.

2320
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,440
You believe that lion men are real.

2321
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,440
The end.

2322
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:07,440
Cop to it.

2323
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,440
Okay.

2324
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:16,920
So look, there's some similarities between zombies and lion men already in Steve Quayles.

2325
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:17,920
Okay.

2326
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:18,920
And giants.

2327
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:19,920
Those are always in the background.

2328
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:21,560
Well, giants were always in play.

2329
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:27,600
So there are some similarities between what Steve believes and let's say ancient aliens.

2330
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,600
Sure.

2331
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,600
Could be.

2332
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,480
He thinks that there's a few differences.

2333
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:35,920
The difference between, let's say my position, the ancient aliens position is my position

2334
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:42,320
is the fallen angels, a third of them basically had sex with earth women.

2335
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:47,360
This is before Noah's flood and corrupt the entire gene pool on the planet.

2336
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:51,880
Now we are seeing in the book of Enoch that people used to say, was it true?

2337
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:54,920
And then they try to suppress the Dead Sea Scrolls, but it got leaked out.

2338
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:58,360
I've talked to some of the folks that are involved and it's all in there.

2339
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:01,960
So they got 2000 year old scrolls saying that, wait, you talk to some people who are involved

2340
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:06,760
in the leaking of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2341
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,760
What?

2342
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,760
Oh boy.

2343
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:09,760
Okay.

2344
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:10,760
Yeah.

2345
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,760
So anyway, yes.

2346
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,080
Where Steve breaks off from ancient aliens.

2347
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:21,720
I do love the combination of defensiveness and confidence in his position while saying

2348
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,840
something so abjectly ridiculous.

2349
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:29,200
If you are trying to be taken seriously and you need to clarify your position against

2350
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:32,480
the ancient aliens position, you're underwater, man.

2351
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2352
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:34,480
You're screwed.

2353
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,680
Look, these ancient aliens people are crazy.

2354
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:41,480
They believe that before the flood, aliens came down and built the pyramids.

2355
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,480
That's stupid.

2356
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:47,480
See, what happened is before the flood, interdimensional angels came down and built the pyramids.

2357
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,800
It's completely different.

2358
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,400
I'm obviously right.

2359
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,400
Sure.

2360
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,400
Okay.

2361
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,760
So this fiddling around with human and animal hybrids and what have you, creating supermen

2362
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,480
and sad human eyes, even assassins.

2363
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:03,440
So that was going on in olden times.

2364
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,520
And it's going on again.

2365
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:07,520
I'll just let this play.

2366
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,520
Okay.

2367
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,520
Let's hear it.

2368
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,520
Let's hear them out.

2369
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:11,520
Let's hear them out.

2370
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:16,640
The Human Genome Project was to identify the DNA of the fallen angels.

2371
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:19,760
When they had sex with earth women, they produced a hybrid.

2372
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:25,320
Those hybrid became the mighty men of renown, the gods the ancient worlds worship.

2373
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:30,780
And obviously now we're coming to that point where we're messing with genetics.

2374
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:32,960
So I see you scribbling notes.

2375
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:39,000
I just wanted to make sure that forever throughout all of history, written down in this notebook

2376
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,440
is the Human Genome Project was about angels.

2377
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:47,360
That's just what I wanted to be very clear and find the Nephilim DNA or whatever.

2378
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,720
I'm going to underline it.

2379
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:52,660
I'm going to make sure that no matter what happens, that's what it was all about, man.

2380
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:59,020
The Human Genome Project was trying to find Thor, it was trying to find Zeus, it's trying

2381
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:01,140
to find Heracles.

2382
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,360
It makes sense.

2383
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:12,920
I really, really, like honestly, and I mean this with all none respect, this is sad even

2384
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,520
for Alex to listen to.

2385
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:15,520
Yeah.

2386
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,520
This is bad.

2387
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:17,520
It really is.

2388
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,520
Yeah.

2389
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:21,260
Because it goes against his interdimensional theories.

2390
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:25,160
I think that all of it's so nonspecific that you'd have a really hard time.

2391
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,160
You can fit it in somewhere.

2392
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,160
Yeah.

2393
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2394
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,160
I get you.

2395
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:30,160
I understand why you think it doesn't fit.

2396
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:34,080
I think that's a good, I think you should keep that in your back pocket.

2397
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:39,040
I understand that because you work from sort of a grounded place of reality where things

2398
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,040
mean things.

2399
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:41,440
Or at least narrative consistency.

2400
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:42,440
Yeah.

2401
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:46,460
I think that they could make this work just because nothing matters.

2402
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:47,460
That's fair.

2403
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,160
When you have no shame, it's like a glitch in humanity.

2404
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,360
You can figure it out.

2405
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:51,360
Yep.

2406
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,360
Yep.

2407
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:56,280
So Steve is this guy who like, I really think that, I mean we've listened to him a little

2408
01:46:56,280 --> 01:47:02,720
bit in the past and he has a worse version of thinking he's a prophet than Alex.

2409
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,720
Yeah.

2410
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,200
Like he legitimately is just like, I know all God.

2411
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:11,200
His whole story is that God gave him a vision of everything, but told him that he would

2412
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:14,400
lock these things up until he needed to know them.

2413
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,400
Yeah.

2414
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:19,880
And this just is like, this clip I think is just a guy doing an impression of a prophet.

2415
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,880
Wow.

2416
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:27,160
The day will come, mark my words, when even vitamins will be made illegal.

2417
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,080
Possession of vitamins, capital offense.

2418
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,240
Possession of a Bible, capital offense.

2419
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,600
Speaking the name of Jesus, capital offense.

2420
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,600
You know, everything is going to be a capital offense.

2421
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,600
I'd be fucked.

2422
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,600
Here's what it boils down to, Alex.

2423
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,040
Anybody but them are scheduled to be terminated.

2424
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:43,040
Terninated.

2425
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,040
Terninated!

2426
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:48,880
I would like to mark his words about possession of vitamins becoming a capital offense.

2427
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,880
B12!

2428
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,360
Get it out of here!

2429
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:52,360
Kill him!

2430
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:53,360
Summary execution.

2431
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,360
Kill him!

2432
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:55,360
If you have riboflavin.

2433
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,800
What about vitamins and just food?

2434
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,240
No, you can't have it.

2435
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,240
No.

2436
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:03,120
Are you talking about regulations for the supplement industry?

2437
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:07,280
I think that's what you're talking about, and I think that's something that terrifies

2438
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,120
you more than anything in the world.

2439
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,200
It's a little bit different.

2440
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,200
Yeah.

2441
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:15,380
So anyway, this was a nonsensical interview with a lunatic who has a bunch of really stupid

2442
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:16,680
ideas about dumb shit.

2443
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,960
The Human Genome Project, Dan, was about angels.

2444
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,960
Great.

2445
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,960
Also, zombies.

2446
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,900
A group of scientists got together and they were like, listen, we can't not know about

2447
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:31,060
these angels who fucked women in the past to create Thor.

2448
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:32,720
We just can't not know.

2449
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:35,240
So these zombies are also in play.

2450
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,240
Sure, of course.

2451
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:37,240
And all this is great.

2452
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,240
Yeah.

2453
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:41,640
But I think there might be ulterior motives to this interview.

2454
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,640
Oh yeah?

2455
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:48,040
When I heard this clip, mic down for this, because when I heard this, I took off my headphones

2456
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:49,040
and walked out of the room.

2457
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,380
I was just like, go fuck yourself.

2458
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:55,040
So Steve Quayle, I know you want to talk about the Infowars phone here briefly.

2459
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,120
I just want to thank you.

2460
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,640
You knew that we were having trouble funding ourselves.

2461
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:01,840
You said, listen, this is one of the best deals that the sponsors have had for many

2462
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:02,840
years.

2463
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:04,640
You tried to get me to give them as a sponsor years ago.

2464
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,640
We did it.

2465
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,640
The listeners love it.

2466
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:07,640
I didn't realize it's one of the best deals out there.

2467
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,920
Just let me tell people about it briefly.

2468
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:10,920
It's not why you're here.

2469
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,800
I just mentioned a new function that you were excited about.

2470
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:13,800
Oh sure, sure.

2471
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,000
Sure, that's not why you're here?

2472
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,560
You got me a satellite phone sponsor, that's not why you're here, talking about your

2473
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,600
dumbass ideas about the genome project.

2474
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,600
Wow.

2475
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:29,080
Wow, Alex, you're really willing to let him go that long just so he can sell a satellite

2476
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,080
phone for you.

2477
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,080
Yep.

2478
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,080
Ooh, that's not good.

2479
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,080
Yep.

2480
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:36,600
I don't know what the deal is here with this phone exactly, but there's the website

2481
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:43,040
infowarsphone.com and it redirects to a website satellite phone store.

2482
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:46,240
I don't know if they have an Infowars promotion going on, but if they do, they're keeping

2483
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:48,360
Infowars and Alex's name the fuck off it.

2484
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,360
Yeah, that would make sense.

2485
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,360
Yeah, yeah.

2486
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:51,360
I would do that too.

2487
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:52,360
Yeah.

2488
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:53,360
I don't know what's going on.

2489
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:56,040
I guess Steve Quayle got him a sponsor and now, yeah.

2490
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:59,760
That must have been a really rough marketing meeting for that company whenever they're

2491
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:05,280
getting together, having like, okay.

2492
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:11,440
I have, I got Alex on the hook for about 5K.

2493
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,480
Alex Jones from Infowars.

2494
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,200
Are we there yet?

2495
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,200
Are we that far down?

2496
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,200
Revenue is negative 10 billion.

2497
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,200
Yes.

2498
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,200
We'll take anything.

2499
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,200
Yeah.

2500
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,200
That's the only explanation.

2501
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,200
Yeah, it's outrageous.

2502
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:28,280
Although, I do think that there's a certain delicious humor of the trajectory of that

2503
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,280
interview.

2504
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,280
That's true.

2505
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:34,920
Just saying these stupidest shit, the one where even you are feeling bad for Alex sitting

2506
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:35,920
through this.

2507
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:36,920
That is really sad.

2508
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,600
And then the payoff, of course, is you got me a sponsor.

2509
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,800
Oh, I really, really feel bad.

2510
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:41,800
Yep.

2511
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,880
I wonder if you got Jim Bakery that satellite phone sponsor.

2512
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:45,880
That would make sense.

2513
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:46,880
Man.

2514
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,920
That would explain his recent air time.

2515
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,920
He's a middle man.

2516
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,920
Yeah, exactly.

2517
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:51,920
Yeah.

2518
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:52,920
Hey, I get you this.

2519
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:53,920
You get me some air time.

2520
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,920
You let me talk shit.

2521
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:55,920
Yep.

2522
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,320
Anyway, Jordan, this has been our exploration of the beginning of the week on Alex's show.

2523
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:05,840
I'm excited to see the response to the Giuliani raid, and I apologize that we don't have that

2524
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:11,640
on this episode, but it was just too much with this bulk of bullshit that Alex was doing.

2525
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:15,640
No, we're either going to have to focus a lot on the Giuliani raid, or it's going to

2526
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:19,760
be one of those things where he mentions it, says that it's unfair, and then does not speak

2527
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,760
of it anymore.

2528
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:23,920
He might say that it's the end of the world, and he might not talk about it at all.

2529
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,920
Entirely.

2530
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,920
The range is infinite.

2531
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:27,920
Who knows?

2532
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:28,920
Yeah.

2533
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:29,920
But we will find out soon enough.

2534
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:30,920
Until then, we have a website.

2535
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:31,920
We do have a website.
