00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for Knowledgefight, Knowledgefight.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

Andy and Kansas you're on the earth, thanks for holding.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.800
Hello Alex I'm a sister in color I'm a huge fan.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
I love your lot.

N-N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com

00:56.660 --> 00:57.660
I'm Dan.

00:57.660 --> 00:58.660
I'm Jordan.

00:58.660 --> 01:04.580
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little

01:04.580 --> 01:05.820
bit about Alex Jones.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.820
Scratch that.

01:06.820 --> 01:11.140
We're a couple dudes that like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a

01:11.140 --> 01:13.140
little bit about Alex Jones.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.140
Jordan!

01:14.140 --> 01:15.140
Jordan.

01:15.140 --> 01:16.140
Dan.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.140
What's up?

01:17.140 --> 01:18.940
I got a quick question for you.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.940
What do you got going on?

01:20.940 --> 01:22.980
One, who's the deity you worship?

01:22.980 --> 01:25.580
And two, what's your bright spot?

01:25.580 --> 01:26.580
So Selene, of course.

01:26.580 --> 01:27.580
Naturally.

01:27.580 --> 01:32.460
And second, my bright spot, I feel like, look, I took a lot of beating from people about

01:32.460 --> 01:34.420
this whole doors thing.

01:34.420 --> 01:35.420
Okay.

01:35.420 --> 01:43.380
I do, look, we're in straight up Alex ad territory, where you immediately started with look.

01:43.380 --> 01:44.380
Look assholes.

01:44.380 --> 01:48.380
Took a lot of pummeling over that, perhaps well deserved.

01:48.380 --> 01:49.380
Sure.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.940
So I've decided to open myself up to even more criticism.

01:51.940 --> 01:52.940
Okay.

01:52.940 --> 01:53.940
All right.

01:53.940 --> 01:54.940
Okay.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.820
So I went down the street the other day and I got it in my head that I was like, I haven't

01:58.820 --> 02:01.740
listened to methods of mayhem in a long time.

02:01.740 --> 02:02.740
Sure.

02:02.740 --> 02:03.740
Sure.

02:03.740 --> 02:04.740
You remember that?

02:04.740 --> 02:05.740
The Tommy Lee rap rock project?

02:05.740 --> 02:07.300
Yes, I do, Dan.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.460
I happen to remember that that exists.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.380
I haven't listened to that in a long time.

02:11.380 --> 02:12.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.820
I wondered if it held up.

02:14.820 --> 02:15.820
And let me say.

02:15.820 --> 02:16.820
How does it hold up, Dan?

02:16.820 --> 02:17.820
Well, I listened to three songs.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.820
I wondered if it held up.

02:18.820 --> 02:19.820
It never held up.

02:19.820 --> 02:23.460
It was like a shelf that was on the floor.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.460
I liked it.

02:24.460 --> 02:25.460
It didn't hold up.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.460
I liked it when I was younger.

02:26.460 --> 02:27.460
Okay.

02:27.460 --> 02:28.460
Okay.

02:28.460 --> 02:29.460
I didn't have good taste.

02:29.460 --> 02:30.460
Okay.

02:30.460 --> 02:31.460
I had a Kid Rock period.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.460
Okay.

02:32.460 --> 02:33.460
Look, I grew up in Missouri.

02:33.460 --> 02:34.460
No, no, I'm sorry.

02:34.460 --> 02:35.460
That was an overly aggressive reaction.

02:35.460 --> 02:36.460
Sure.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.380
So I listened to the Kid Rock song, New Skin.

02:38.380 --> 02:39.380
Sure.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.380
Sure.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.380
Not good.

02:41.380 --> 02:42.380
Not good.

02:42.380 --> 02:44.740
Also, it seems like there's a theme to the song that is supposed to be about like a new

02:44.740 --> 02:47.900
beginning and like sort of like finding a new piece.

02:47.900 --> 02:48.900
Sure.

02:48.900 --> 02:49.900
Tommy Lee's famous for metaphor.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.620
Kid Rock did not get the memo on that.

02:51.620 --> 02:52.620
Oh, no.

02:52.620 --> 02:55.180
Nothing to do thematically with the song.

02:55.180 --> 02:57.140
Second song I listened to was Get Naked.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.140
And that song is embarrassing.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.140
What?

02:59.140 --> 03:00.140
Oh, no.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.140
No, Dan.

03:01.140 --> 03:08.060
I know that's your response, but it's more embarrassing even than that, like how you're

03:08.060 --> 03:09.060
responding.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.060
Of course it's embarrassing.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.300
You would still be like, oh my God.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.900
I will tell you this.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.120
I have not revisited it.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
No plans.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.620
It's gross and weird.

03:19.620 --> 03:20.620
Sure.

03:20.620 --> 03:21.620
Sure.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.900
I think I'm somebody who's all kind of, you know, I'm sex positive.

03:23.900 --> 03:24.900
I think everybody's cool.

03:24.900 --> 03:25.900
Sure.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.800
Did the nudes do a guest verse on it too?

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
Is that how creepy it is?

03:28.800 --> 03:29.800
No, no.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.020
That would have been a different kind of embarrassing and uncomfortable.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.020
Okay.

03:33.020 --> 03:34.020
All right.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.020
No, it was just.

03:35.020 --> 03:39.020
There's a song on there called Proposition Fuck You.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.460
I think that one was actually, that actually holds up.

03:41.460 --> 03:42.460
Oh, does it?

03:42.460 --> 03:43.460
Yeah.

03:43.460 --> 03:46.460
Is it about like Prop 21?

03:46.460 --> 03:47.460
What are we talking about?

03:47.460 --> 03:48.460
No.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.900
It's tied to the boys in blue running up on your crew.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
You know what to do.

03:50.900 --> 03:51.900
Tell them, fuck you.

03:51.900 --> 03:52.900
All right.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.900
Well.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.900
It's a proposition.

03:54.900 --> 03:55.900
Fuck you.

03:55.900 --> 03:56.900
Fuck you.

03:56.900 --> 03:57.900
It's a proposition.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.380
So the whole thing was about like, hey, yeah, I got a ballot measure for you.

04:00.380 --> 04:01.780
How about you go fuck yourself.

04:01.780 --> 04:02.780
Okay.

04:02.780 --> 04:06.940
See now, now I understand that previously you said that this song was good.

04:06.940 --> 04:07.940
I think it holds up.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.220
And then you just sang me a little bit of it.

04:10.220 --> 04:11.220
Uh-huh.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.260
I beg strongly to differ.

04:13.260 --> 04:22.300
I feel like it's, I'm sure it wasn't intended as satire of political outrage or like an

04:22.300 --> 04:27.460
expression of like some kind of, I don't know, there wasn't a greater statement other than

04:27.460 --> 04:28.460
fuck you.

04:28.460 --> 04:31.220
What if we were a fourth rate rage against the machine?

04:31.220 --> 04:32.980
Look, it works on that level.

04:32.980 --> 04:33.980
Anyway.

04:33.980 --> 04:34.980
No, that's fair.

04:34.980 --> 04:35.980
methods of mayhem, my bright spot.

04:35.980 --> 04:36.980
What's yours?

04:36.980 --> 04:42.860
Uh, well I have a hard time with this as my bright spot because it is going to be unrevealed.

04:42.860 --> 04:48.500
But I have completed a new project that I will be working on.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.740
Please be a rap album with Tommy Lee.

04:49.740 --> 04:54.620
I will not be a rap album with Tommy Lee, it will be a sex tape with Tommy Lee.

04:54.620 --> 04:57.180
And yeah, I'm very excited about it.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.620
It's a whole new thing for me.

04:58.620 --> 05:01.820
It's something that I've wanted to try for a long time and I've finally stepped up.

05:01.820 --> 05:02.820
I think I know what you're talking about.

05:02.820 --> 05:03.820
I think you do as well.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.980
I'm excited about this project as well.

05:05.980 --> 05:08.980
You know, I was a little worried that you wouldn't be excited about it, but I'm excited

05:08.980 --> 05:10.660
now that I know that you're pumped.

05:10.660 --> 05:14.540
And also I'm excited because it does not involve more work for me.

05:14.540 --> 05:15.540
Exactly.

05:15.540 --> 05:20.300
In fact, this will be almost a complete reversal of fortune where I will be planning on doing

05:20.300 --> 05:21.300
all of the work.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.900
This kind of sucks a little bit for the listeners in as much as it is like a huge tease.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.660
It's a huge tease, but that's what I'm in here for.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.660
The payoff will be great.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.660
I hope so.

05:28.660 --> 05:29.660
And I think everyone will love it.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.660
Or it'll be a disaster.

05:30.660 --> 05:31.660
Oh yes.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.420
It'll be a future bright spot or a methods of mayhem.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.420
Let's see.

05:35.420 --> 05:36.420
Yeah.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.420
So today, Jordan, we are back in the present.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.140
We're going to be talking about April 26th and 27th, 2021 Blackjack.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.420
I was ready for it that time.

05:42.420 --> 05:43.420
Shit.

05:43.420 --> 05:44.980
I had the B first, but I think you said the word faster.

05:44.980 --> 05:45.980
We tied.

05:45.980 --> 05:46.980
We tied.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.220
That was a tie.

05:48.220 --> 05:52.740
So what I wanted to do for this episode was I wanted to do more of the week, but I got

05:52.740 --> 05:56.820
kind of caught up in some of the Alex stuff at the beginning of the week.

05:56.820 --> 06:03.300
And I didn't want to get mixed up with the Giuliani got raided kind of news of the end

06:03.300 --> 06:04.300
of the week.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.960
I thought like it would all be too much to cover in one.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.220
So the end of the week we'll cover on Monday, beginning of the week, we're going to cover

06:10.220 --> 06:11.220
today.

06:11.220 --> 06:16.700
Um, and uh, yeah, the knowledge fight, your source for breaking news yesterday's bullshit

06:16.700 --> 06:17.700
tomorrow.

06:17.700 --> 06:21.500
We'll get, uh, get that on a shirt.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.280
Yesterday's bullshit next week.

06:24.280 --> 06:29.340
But before we get to the episode, we've got to give us some hellos to some walks before

06:29.340 --> 06:30.340
that.

06:30.340 --> 06:34.380
I have a one out of context drop because I have two today, so I'm excited to spread them

06:34.380 --> 06:35.380
out.

06:35.380 --> 06:36.380
Here's the first one.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.580
Oh, here comes the sex robots.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.580
Here comes the sex robots.

06:40.580 --> 06:42.420
Now I have a question.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.740
Does this involve also the Daleks with guns?

06:45.740 --> 06:48.980
Because if you could combine the two, you're unstoppable.

06:48.980 --> 06:54.340
I was thinking about introducing our, uh, shout outs with, and now here comes the sex

06:54.340 --> 06:55.340
robots.

06:55.340 --> 07:01.900
Um, so first, uh, Ville, I don't know how to pronounce that V-I-L-L-E, Ville, whatever

07:01.900 --> 07:02.900
you want.

07:02.900 --> 07:03.980
S uh, last initial.

07:03.980 --> 07:04.980
Thank you so much.

07:04.980 --> 07:05.980
You are now policy wonk.

07:05.980 --> 07:07.580
Your birthday was on the 29th.

07:07.580 --> 07:08.580
Shout out.

07:08.580 --> 07:09.580
I'm a policy wonk.

07:09.580 --> 07:10.580
Thank you very much.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.100
Ville, Ville, or Ville.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.100
Yes.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.100
Next.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.100
Jordan Holmes, non-binary twin.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.100
Thank you so much.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.100
You are now a policy wonk.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.100
I'm a policy wonk.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.100
Thank you very much.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.100
My non-binary binary twin.

07:22.100 --> 07:26.420
I forgot to put an apostrophe on there and I confused myself reading it.

07:26.420 --> 07:27.420
Yeah.

07:27.420 --> 07:30.660
That sounds like Jordan Holmes, the non-binary binary twin, which would be a good nickname

07:30.660 --> 07:31.660
for me.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.660
Uh, next.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.500
My wife says she has nightmares of Alex Jones voice because I listened to your podcast too

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
much.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Uh, you are now policy wonk.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.500
I'm a policy wonk.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.620
Thank you very much.

07:39.620 --> 07:43.600
And as always, let's remind you that if you are listening too much, we are fine with you

07:43.600 --> 07:44.600
taking a break.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.600
Please stop.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.600
Please stop.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
It's bad for you.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.600
It's bad for you.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.100
Um, then, uh, get to some technocrats here to give a shout out to first we got will and

07:52.100 --> 07:53.100
thank you so much.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.100
You are now a technocrat.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.060
Uh, Preston L thank you so much.

07:56.060 --> 08:00.980
You're now a technocrat and Bob, the human animal chimera.

08:00.980 --> 08:01.980
Thank you so much.

08:01.980 --> 08:02.980
You are now a technocrat.

08:02.980 --> 08:03.980
I'm a policy wonk.

08:03.980 --> 08:04.980
Crikey mate.

08:04.980 --> 08:05.980
That's fantastic.

08:05.980 --> 08:06.980
Have yourself a brew.

08:06.980 --> 08:07.980
How's your 401k doing, bro?

08:07.980 --> 08:10.780
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.620
All right, let's just get down to business.

08:12.620 --> 08:16.620
We ain't making that money off that heroin while you pimp so good.

08:16.620 --> 08:18.260
My neck is freakishly large.

08:18.260 --> 08:21.020
I declare info war on you.

08:21.020 --> 08:22.020
Thank you all.

08:22.020 --> 08:23.020
Yes.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.020
Thank you very much to the three of you.

08:24.020 --> 08:28.140
Now, Jordan, we've got one little special thing, um, on, uh, on, uh, our last episode

08:28.140 --> 08:30.940
right after we finished recording right after we finished.

08:30.940 --> 08:31.940
I got an email.

08:31.940 --> 08:32.940
Of course.

08:32.940 --> 08:33.940
I had an email from my Ashley.

08:33.940 --> 08:37.340
We wanted us to give a birthday shout out to, uh, to Matthew.

08:37.340 --> 08:38.500
His birthday was on Tuesday.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.500
His birthday was on Tuesday.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.500
We weren't able to do it.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
We can't do that.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
I felt like shit.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
We can't do that.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
It's not your fault.

08:44.500 --> 08:48.260
So now in the past, Matthew, I know your birthday was on Tuesday, but I hope you had a good

08:48.260 --> 08:49.260
one.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.260
Hope you had a great one.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.260
And I hope things are going great.

08:51.260 --> 08:55.020
And, uh, that, uh, you, you got to, I don't know, I want to know how old Matthew is before

08:55.020 --> 08:56.020
I hope.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.020
27.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.020
27.

08:58.020 --> 08:59.020
I hope he had an okay birthday.

08:59.020 --> 09:00.020
Hmm.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.020
I'm just hoping for an okay birthday.

09:01.020 --> 09:04.700
27, 27 is a year where you usually have a let down birth.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.100
Also got a young one on the way.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.420
June coming soon.

09:07.420 --> 09:11.060
Uh, shout out to this baby.

09:11.060 --> 09:16.780
Like a new sneakers dropping guys got a birthday and a new baby dropping baby.

09:16.780 --> 09:17.780
First thing.

09:17.780 --> 09:23.340
Don't listen to any Tommy Lee albums now or in the future or otherwise.

09:23.340 --> 09:28.020
I hate to say it, but I mean, if you want to base your political identity on a proposition,

09:28.020 --> 09:29.020
fuck you.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.020
Maybe there's something to it.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.780
Well, you know, I'll side with you on that though.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.340
Um, so, uh, happy birthday to you, Matthew.

09:36.340 --> 09:39.620
Um, Jordan, here is our next out of context.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.140
Stop before we get to today's show.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.420
You know, I know a major cattleman.

09:43.420 --> 09:46.660
I served under major cattleman.

09:46.660 --> 09:49.580
You sir are no major cattleman.

09:49.580 --> 09:50.580
Okay.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.580
All right.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.260
All right.

09:54.260 --> 09:59.780
Here is the beginning, uh, Alex opening up the show here on April 26th and it is a bummer

09:59.780 --> 10:07.460
or I took off Saturday and Sunday at least about 90% actually unplugged myself from the

10:07.460 --> 10:08.460
computer.

10:08.460 --> 10:13.820
It's been more time with the family and it just intensified my clarity about where we

10:13.820 --> 10:15.060
are and what we're facing.

10:15.060 --> 10:19.940
Are we getting our neighbors dead species on this planet and the big transformation

10:19.940 --> 10:23.480
for the worst that is taking place.

10:23.480 --> 10:28.060
And here's the final equation.

10:28.060 --> 10:32.780
If we don't have a total awakening to the fact that we're under threat and we're under

10:32.780 --> 10:37.980
attack at the globalist, you're building what they call a posthuman world, then we don't

10:37.980 --> 10:45.500
have any shot at changing this or we're fixing this and it's been the process of industrialization.

10:45.500 --> 10:51.140
It's been the process of modernization that has really turned us into these domesticated

10:51.140 --> 10:56.980
ignorant creatures that don't even know how to defend ourselves, take care of ourselves

10:56.980 --> 11:01.580
and each generation going forward is less human.

11:01.580 --> 11:03.420
Let me tell you about the candle.

11:03.420 --> 11:04.420
Alright.

11:04.420 --> 11:10.020
Yeah, yeah, the force of modernity has made us less human and each generation subsequently

11:10.020 --> 11:13.020
will be less human because of computers.

11:13.020 --> 11:16.900
Unsurprisingly, Alex is that guy at a party.

11:16.900 --> 11:23.100
Listen, look, I'm not saying that the Unabomber was good, but if you've read his manifesto

11:23.100 --> 11:24.940
I'm not saying he was wrong.

11:24.940 --> 11:26.820
He's got some stuff to say.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.820
I don't know.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.820
He's a smart guy.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.820
He built his own bombs.

11:29.820 --> 11:30.820
You gotta be smart to do that.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.180
That guy at a party is a bummer.

11:32.180 --> 11:36.340
That guy not at a party, also a bummer.

11:36.340 --> 11:37.340
Let's remind ourselves.

11:37.340 --> 11:38.340
Always a bummer.

11:38.340 --> 11:40.300
So yeah, Alex is in a weird mood.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.300
Sure.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.100
Unabomber is a weird mood.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.100
Yeah.

11:44.100 --> 11:48.620
So we heard on our last present day episode that Bill Maher, secret patriot.

11:48.620 --> 11:52.380
Yes, I'm hard time fitting that into our canon.

11:52.380 --> 11:55.340
It was quite a shift for Bill.

11:55.340 --> 12:01.580
He really got an upgrade from ventriloquist dummy of the globalists to basically Tucker

12:01.580 --> 12:04.580
Carlson.

12:04.580 --> 12:09.620
Here's the other reason that I know for a fact Alex is a huge fan of Star Wars.

12:09.620 --> 12:13.740
Rhett Conning is his mate Raison Detre in many ways.

12:13.740 --> 12:17.380
The man absolutely refuses to stick to canon.

12:17.380 --> 12:21.700
Yeah, that is true, especially when things are convenient for him.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.700
Yeah, yeah.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.700
I have bad- Ray is not a Palpatine in my world.

12:25.700 --> 12:26.700
Anyways, sorry.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.700
I have bad news.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.700
What?

12:28.700 --> 12:30.900
We are back to Bill Maher being one.

12:30.900 --> 12:31.900
Oh, okay.

12:31.900 --> 12:37.980
I've gotten to the point where I can't watch a CNN piece or even a Bill Maher piece or

12:37.980 --> 12:42.900
any of these propaganda pieces because I see the writing that's involved in it and I see

12:42.900 --> 12:47.100
the multi-layered deceptions that are involved.

12:47.100 --> 12:58.020
The level of propaganda has gotten even more sophisticated and these are very skilled,

12:58.020 --> 13:00.260
very destructive people doing this.

13:00.260 --> 13:04.100
Bill Maher's secret patriot run lasted two days or something.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.500
That was honestly not a bad run for Bill Maher.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
What the fuck?

13:07.500 --> 13:10.420
I was expecting almost less than an hour.

13:10.420 --> 13:11.420
So stupid.

13:11.420 --> 13:12.420
So that's good news.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.020
Oh, you think that's good news?

13:14.020 --> 13:18.740
He's gotten to the point now where he can't watch a Bill- when was he not at that point?

13:18.740 --> 13:19.740
A couple weeks ago.

13:19.740 --> 13:20.740
Okay, well that's fair.

13:20.740 --> 13:21.740
Yeah, he could watch a Bill Maher report.

13:21.740 --> 13:22.740
That's fair.

13:22.740 --> 13:23.740
He can see the scripting, man.

13:23.740 --> 13:24.740
Okay.

13:24.740 --> 13:25.740
He can see all the propaganda.

13:25.740 --> 13:26.740
All right.

13:26.740 --> 13:31.060
No, but he can't watch it because the secret patriot is too secret in this circumstance.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.420
Yeah, or maybe he was just talking shit the other day when he was like, I've heard from

13:34.420 --> 13:37.580
higher ups that Bill Maher is actually kind of like Tucker.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.740
He's like a good guy.

13:38.740 --> 13:39.860
That sounds more reasonable.

13:39.860 --> 13:44.540
So anyway, there's good news in the world amidst Alex's inability to watch news anymore.

13:44.540 --> 13:45.540
Sure, sure.

13:45.540 --> 13:49.900
You know, there's also a lot of positive things happening because there's always for every

13:49.900 --> 13:53.380
action opposite- Wise.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.980
An equal reaction.

13:55.980 --> 14:05.100
But I've really, I don't want to say transcended, but I have risen above my enemies.

14:05.100 --> 14:09.220
I've always been disgusted by them, I've always disliked them, but I haven't wanted to defeat

14:09.220 --> 14:14.100
them so that I could be the top dog and be above them in this pile of skulls they sit

14:14.100 --> 14:15.100
on top of.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.300
I mean, I transcended them a long time ago.

14:17.300 --> 14:24.700
I guess from the time I was born, the time spirit entered my body, but now I've really

14:24.700 --> 14:25.700
transcended them.

14:25.700 --> 14:26.700
Oh boy.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.700
Oh boy.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.180
So the good news is that Alex has transcended his enemies, although he did transcend them

14:31.180 --> 14:33.140
when he was a baby.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.220
And now he's really- Sure, sure, sure.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.680
So we're on the same path as like David Lynch here.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.820
Now we're into trans- What you need to do is transcend- Okay.

14:43.820 --> 14:44.820
Yeesh.

14:44.820 --> 14:45.820
Yeah.

14:45.820 --> 14:51.860
I was like, this is a mood, this is a- Unifomered to delusions of grandeur.

14:51.860 --> 14:54.100
This is something- There's something there.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.460
It's an interesting way to start the show.

14:56.460 --> 15:01.180
And Alex pivots this talking about how he's really transcended now into saying that the

15:01.180 --> 15:02.180
answer is transcendent.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.180
Oh, okay.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.180
We all just have to transcend.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.180
Okay, that's nice.

15:05.180 --> 15:08.580
Because the answer is transcending these people.

15:08.580 --> 15:13.580
We have to really transcend the new world order- Work for you.

15:13.580 --> 15:21.300
And still resist it and still say no to it, but not even give it energy when we do it.

15:21.300 --> 15:28.740
These are like sad, mad dogs with rabies foaming at the mouth out in the street.

15:28.740 --> 15:32.700
And you know they're already done for and it's over for them.

15:32.700 --> 15:37.420
So you need to just stay away from them and just try not to let them bite your children.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.200
And I think that's really what it comes down to.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.180
So I guess that means communes?

15:42.180 --> 15:43.180
Is that what he's trying to say?

15:43.180 --> 15:49.340
Because if all of the world and the globalists and all the minions are all mad dogs out there-

15:49.340 --> 15:50.340
Yeah, yeah.

15:50.340 --> 15:53.140
Then you just gotta keep them away from biting your children and stay away from them.

15:53.140 --> 15:57.200
They're gonna die of their own illness or whatever.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.500
So yeah, communes?

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
I don't know.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.140
Alex got a phone call from Michelle Obama and she was like, listen, Alex, I know you've

16:04.140 --> 16:11.500
never tried this before, but when they go low, all right, we transcend.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.500
That's what we do.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.500
Yeah.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.500
I don't know.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.500
It sounded like communes.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
Yeah.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.140
And I doubt there's gonna be technology there based on his earlier statement.

16:19.140 --> 16:23.160
It does seem like he's trying to go back to a pre-industrial world.

16:23.160 --> 16:28.260
So not only that, he's also gonna shake up the transmission.

16:28.260 --> 16:32.620
And I will say that if he had actually done this, he'd make a better show.

16:32.620 --> 16:33.620
Okay.

16:33.620 --> 16:34.620
But he doesn't.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
No.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.620
He does not shake up the transmission.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.620
Well, that sounds right.

16:37.620 --> 16:43.980
And I'm your host, Alex Jones, promising you that this already important, informative avant-garde

16:43.980 --> 16:48.100
transmission is now going to go to the next level.

16:48.100 --> 16:56.140
And I'm gonna shake the transmission up with more of your calls, more quick guests, and

16:56.140 --> 17:01.060
more special reports and more live, commercial-free podcasts.

17:01.060 --> 17:06.260
You got my commitment that here in the home stretch of going into the next level, that

17:06.260 --> 17:12.260
I will work even harder because things are moving very, very quickly and it is essential.

17:12.260 --> 17:17.100
And because I'm gonna shake things up, something I never do, I always come on the show and

17:17.100 --> 17:21.380
hit the big stories and dive right into the breaking, censored and suppressed information,

17:21.380 --> 17:25.780
the systems fighting to make sure your family and others don't get it, then I usually just

17:25.780 --> 17:27.500
barely plug at the end of the hour.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.060
But a couple of big things have happened.

17:29.060 --> 17:34.180
A, you need these products, they're amazing, and B, if you don't buy them, we won't be.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.180
Really shaking up the show.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.780
I'm shaking up the broadcast and I'm gonna listen to a bunch of stuff that I'm not gonna

17:39.780 --> 17:40.780
do.

17:40.780 --> 17:43.740
However, I just want to let everybody know, I'm gonna need to do more ad reads.

17:43.740 --> 17:44.740
I'm going straight to it.

17:44.740 --> 17:46.740
I'm going straight to ads from now on.

17:46.740 --> 17:49.540
I'm gonna shake up the broadcast, I'm definitely gonna go to more calls.

17:49.540 --> 17:50.540
Maybe not.

17:50.540 --> 17:51.540
I'm gonna do more quick guests.

17:51.540 --> 17:52.540
Probably not.

17:52.540 --> 17:57.260
I actually don't think he took any calls on this show.

17:57.260 --> 17:58.660
Why does that not surprise me?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.980
I wouldn't describe any of the guests as being quick.

18:00.980 --> 18:04.660
Yeah, but he did go to a plug real fast.

18:04.660 --> 18:05.660
That's nice.

18:05.660 --> 18:10.780
I got that weird mood that he was in and then right to a plug, I was like, this is fucked

18:10.780 --> 18:11.780
up.

18:11.780 --> 18:12.780
We're gonna be in trouble.

18:12.780 --> 18:13.900
This is gonna be a ride.

18:13.900 --> 18:21.500
So Alex gets to talking about some news and it's sort of what I believe is the new development

18:21.500 --> 18:25.500
and evolution of COVID conspiracies and narratives.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.740
In Europe and the UK, they're still almost completely shut down.

18:28.740 --> 18:34.780
Tens of millions extra, it's just a footnote, have starved to death in the third world,

18:34.780 --> 18:42.900
in Africa, in India, even in China, in Latin America, in areas of Asia, the Middle East.

18:42.900 --> 18:43.900
We've got those numbers.

18:43.900 --> 18:47.500
When people get malnutrition, any virus will kill them.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.580
So if any virus, any virus.

18:50.580 --> 18:54.820
If Alex has specific data on this, he should really discuss it because he just references

18:54.820 --> 18:58.700
having this data and actually talking about it could be really illuminating.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.900
I suspect he doesn't have any actual information.

19:00.900 --> 19:05.140
He's just winging it and riffing off comments that were made by David Beasley, the UN food

19:05.140 --> 19:08.140
program executive director back in September.

19:08.140 --> 19:12.000
This is definitely a serious issue and it's one that Alex is definitely right to call

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
attention to.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.780
But the way he calls attention to the problem of food insecurity in the developing world

19:16.780 --> 19:22.460
does a disservice to the idea of actually helping understand or solve the problem.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.880
And that's because Alex doesn't care about the actual problem.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.900
He cares about using the impression that he cares about it to attack people who believe

19:28.900 --> 19:31.440
that COVID-19 is an actual problem.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.160
Food insecurity around the world is a complicated picture and you can't just say that lockdowns

19:35.160 --> 19:39.820
in the US or Europe directly leads to worsening conditions in other countries.

19:39.820 --> 19:44.460
For instance, this past year, countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, India, Pakistan and

19:44.460 --> 19:49.540
Somalia have seen incredibly severe locust swarms that have had nothing to do with coronavirus

19:49.540 --> 19:51.820
or any country's response to it.

19:51.820 --> 19:55.580
COVID has affected the world's situation and made things worse, but there's a larger picture

19:55.580 --> 19:59.180
than just what Alex wants to cover, which is essentially if all the businesses would

19:59.180 --> 20:02.200
just open back up, everyone would be fine.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.720
It's really troubling to see Alex try to get into the game of pretending that COVID deaths

20:05.720 --> 20:09.280
are actually starvation deaths that are being covered up.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.520
The basic problem here is that Alex is just making that up as a way for him to continue

20:12.520 --> 20:14.900
his denial of this major pandemic.

20:14.900 --> 20:17.940
But even beyond that, the numbers just don't work.

20:17.940 --> 20:21.820
Concern USA released a list at the end of 2020 of the countries facing the greatest

20:21.820 --> 20:22.820
food insecurity.

20:22.820 --> 20:28.040
And if you compare that list to lists of countries and their COVID fatalities, you don't come

20:28.040 --> 20:30.820
away with the conclusion that Alex wants you to.

20:30.820 --> 20:34.900
Chad is the country facing the most food insecurity, the most severe food insecurity, but there

20:34.900 --> 20:38.160
have only been 170 deaths from COVID there.

20:38.160 --> 20:42.540
Timor-Leste is number two on the list, where there have been three COVID deaths.

20:42.540 --> 20:47.240
Madagascar is number three, where there have been 614 deaths from COVID.

20:47.240 --> 20:51.800
Haiti is number four, where they've registered 254 COVID deaths.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.160
Only numbers nine and 10 on the list, Afghanistan and Nigeria respectively, have over a thousand

20:56.160 --> 20:58.740
deaths total from COVID recorded.

20:58.740 --> 21:03.000
Until early March, the US was seeing more COVID deaths per day than any of these countries

21:03.000 --> 21:05.620
have had throughout the entire pandemic.

21:05.620 --> 21:09.800
If Alex tries to redefine COVID deaths as secretly being starvation deaths, he's essentially

21:09.800 --> 21:13.880
trying to use people's deaths as a political prop for his own narratives.

21:13.880 --> 21:18.560
This behavior is nothing new to Alex, but it should be recognized as ghoulish, and people

21:18.560 --> 21:24.240
should understand the disrespect that he's operating with towards people's humanity.

21:24.240 --> 21:30.200
Yeah, you cannot, you just can't trust anybody who, when you're talking about engaging with

21:30.200 --> 21:34.360
a serious issue, just goes, no, we don't need to do that.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.920
What about this?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.640
Because then what's the point?

21:37.640 --> 21:43.280
We're always only ever going to be talking about whatever it is that you think is important,

21:43.280 --> 21:47.720
and no matter what I say, it's going to change based on you not wanting to engage with what

21:47.720 --> 21:48.720
I'm saying.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.520
So how are we supposed to talk?

21:50.520 --> 21:55.600
So this is primarily being deployed right now, this narrative, because there's a lot

21:55.600 --> 22:00.520
of news coming out about India and how drastic the situation is there.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.620
The devastation, yeah.

22:01.620 --> 22:05.980
And so Alex, I wouldn't say he's doing a great job.

22:05.980 --> 22:10.680
They're starving to death in Africa, they're starving to death in India, and when they

22:10.680 --> 22:17.180
starve to death and die of malnutrition, when you look at the Indians dying, tens of thousands

22:17.180 --> 22:23.300
a week right now, extra, they all look like concentration camp victims.

22:23.300 --> 22:28.700
And the common cold is killing them, and then the media tells you that COVID-19 did it.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.720
And India is starving to death now.

22:31.720 --> 22:35.840
You can argue, well, there's a billion, 300 million Indians, there's too many of them.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.840
What?

22:36.840 --> 22:40.900
Well, ladies and gentlemen, they've always had outdoor cremations, they've always had

22:40.900 --> 22:45.460
mass cremations for the poor, that friends and family have gone to India, there's documentaries

22:45.460 --> 22:50.160
about it, CNN complains they should be able to burn their dead outside, it's bad for carbon.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.280
What are you talking about?

22:51.280 --> 22:52.280
What is happening?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.280
Yeah, how does that even-

22:53.280 --> 22:54.280
What is happening?

22:54.280 --> 22:55.280
What are we even doing?

22:55.280 --> 23:00.140
What Alex is saying there about Indian deaths from malnutrition being called COVID, it's

23:00.140 --> 23:04.220
not based on anything other than his own feelings and guesses about things.

23:04.220 --> 23:07.860
The situation in India with COVID is really complicated, but there are a number of driving

23:07.860 --> 23:12.940
factors that people point to in terms of what's making this period right now incredibly horrific.

23:12.940 --> 23:16.280
The first appears to be a level of unpreparedness.

23:16.280 --> 23:21.020
Healthcare journalist Vikas Dandekar wrote a piece recently in Stat News that explained

23:21.020 --> 23:23.060
this element of the situation like this.

23:23.060 --> 23:28.240
Quote, India's early success in nearly flattening the COVID-19 curve in 2020 may be the cause

23:28.240 --> 23:30.020
of the current calamity.

23:30.020 --> 23:34.300
Despite a rickety and funding-starved healthcare infrastructure, the country's ability to manage

23:34.300 --> 23:38.680
the first wave of COVID-19 looked laudable as the United States, Canada, and countries

23:38.680 --> 23:42.340
in Europe reeled under second and third waves of the pandemic.

23:42.340 --> 23:43.720
Then things went awry.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.500
The turnaround raised false hopes that the virus had run out of steam in India and the

23:47.500 --> 23:50.200
country would be spared a second wave.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.900
That left people unprepared to deal with the heavy blow that was coming.

23:53.900 --> 23:57.260
Modi declared victory and held massive political rallies.

23:57.260 --> 24:01.660
At the same time, Hindu pilgrims amassed at the Ganges River where, quote, as many as

24:01.660 --> 24:07.000
2.5 million people took part with scant attention to COVID-19 safety protocols.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.500
By the time an avalanche of criticism cut short the festival, the virus had infected

24:10.500 --> 24:14.500
thousands of pilgrims who took it home to their neighborhoods and villages.

24:14.500 --> 24:18.700
These types of massive gatherings of people allowed for a broader spread than would have

24:18.700 --> 24:20.420
happened otherwise.

24:20.420 --> 24:24.480
Add to that the discovery of that new strain of hyper contagious virus in India a while

24:24.480 --> 24:28.180
back and how the healthcare infrastructure is pushed to its limit and you end up with

24:28.180 --> 24:31.780
a situation like we're seeing now, which is terrible.

24:31.780 --> 24:36.320
There's a humanitarian disaster going on right now and the people of India need all the help

24:36.320 --> 24:39.060
that the international community can provide.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.820
But trying to pretend that the deaths you're seeing are just malnutrition deaths that are

24:42.820 --> 24:47.940
being secretly listed as COVID, that is fucking disrespectful to the people of India and what

24:47.940 --> 24:50.240
they're going through.

24:50.240 --> 24:58.080
There should be no greater thing that, no greater red flag than any right wing reactionary

24:58.080 --> 25:02.400
politician declaring victory over any worldwide problem.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.780
That should be the immediate sign for everybody in that country to be like, oh, we're fucked.

25:06.780 --> 25:07.780
We're fucked.

25:07.780 --> 25:10.620
This is the worst thing that, we're going to die.

25:10.620 --> 25:15.700
That's the first thing I scream whenever I hear a politician say mission accomplished.

25:15.700 --> 25:23.400
What I see with Alex is a complete need to justify this to his audience.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.460
Because it can't be possibly COVID.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.800
No, and it's India's Trump too.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.300
So we can't be, yeah.

25:30.300 --> 25:34.520
But what I fail to understand, and I would love for Alex to explain this, is what's the

25:34.520 --> 25:38.960
Indian government's motive for supposedly calling these malnutrition deaths COVID?

25:38.960 --> 25:42.840
I understand that Alex thinks that the US hospitals were in a get rich quick scheme

25:42.840 --> 25:46.520
where they called other deaths COVID because Medicare pays them a certain amount for COVID

25:46.520 --> 25:47.520
treatment.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.720
But does he think that's the case in every country?

25:49.720 --> 25:52.120
Does he think that doctors in India are scamming Medicare?

25:52.120 --> 25:56.760
I assume the globalists have a profit sharing program for this kind of scam.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.420
He must think that.

25:58.420 --> 26:01.160
It's really, really bizarre.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.460
And when you start to look at what's actually being said, it just doesn't make any sense.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.460
And it's dark.

26:06.460 --> 26:07.460
It's dark.

26:07.460 --> 26:08.460
Right.

26:08.460 --> 26:14.880
And I suppose in his conception, any and all profiting or carpet bagging goes into one

26:14.880 --> 26:18.960
big pot for all the evil global scams around the world.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.600
So it's like, you know.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.720
All scams are fungible?

26:21.720 --> 26:22.720
I guess.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.840
I guess that's what has to happen.

26:24.840 --> 26:25.840
That's dumb.

26:25.840 --> 26:26.840
That's real dumb.

26:26.840 --> 26:30.960
So anyway, look, there's people starving, I guess.

26:30.960 --> 26:35.140
According to Alex, all these people have malnutrition and dying.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.400
And also in Venezuela, people had malnutrition.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.200
But are there more people dying in India?

26:40.200 --> 26:41.200
Yes.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.200
Of malnutrition.

26:42.200 --> 26:50.480
You know, in Venezuela, it was a thousand, five, six years ago, dying a day extra than

26:50.480 --> 26:51.480
it was 2000.

26:51.480 --> 26:58.040
Last numbers that came out were estimated at 5000 people a week starved to death in

26:58.040 --> 26:59.040
Venezuela.

26:59.040 --> 27:03.880
But the government passed a law that you can't call it starvation and you can't gather those

27:03.880 --> 27:04.880
numbers.

27:04.880 --> 27:11.680
If you're a physician or a doctor, you'll be arrested and they don't even call it malnutrition.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.640
So that's how they work.

27:13.640 --> 27:17.920
So I would like to challenge Alex to produce any of that information.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.240
I kind of have a suspicion that he's making all that up and all those details up to try

27:21.240 --> 27:25.880
and bolster this imaginary argument that malnutrition deaths in India are being called COVID deaths.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.680
I think that's what's going on here.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.680
Yeah.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.080
Also, food insecurity is a very real issue in Venezuela.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.040
And again, the particular contributing factors are complicated.

27:34.040 --> 27:38.500
However, it's important to recognize how even if all of Alex's imaginary conspiracy was

27:38.500 --> 27:42.680
actually happening, the numbers don't make sense.

27:42.680 --> 27:47.000
Venezuela has recorded a total of just over 2000 COVID-19 related deaths.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.520
Shouldn't the number be much higher if Alex's dumb conspiracy were real?

27:50.520 --> 27:54.500
I mean, roughly 250,000?

27:54.500 --> 27:57.000
It's important to recognize what's going on here.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.560
Alex is trying to argue that the deaths listed as COVID in India are actually just malnutrition

28:00.560 --> 28:02.220
deaths that are being mislabeled.

28:02.220 --> 28:06.100
In order to defend this baseless claim, Alex points to Venezuela, where there are apparently

28:06.100 --> 28:07.920
tons of malnutrition deaths.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.440
In order for Alex's argument to make any sense, it would need to be the case that these malnutrition

28:11.440 --> 28:15.280
deaths in Venezuela were being reclassified as COVID-19 deaths, because if that weren't

28:15.280 --> 28:19.560
the case, then bringing up Venezuela means absolutely nothing in this context.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.400
Alex's brain works from memes, not information.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.600
When there's a story about malnutrition in the right wing media, the meme the audience

28:25.600 --> 28:29.080
has been trained to respond to is just bring up Venezuela.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.440
Alex has no point that he's even making here, but he knows that if he just says it's like

28:32.440 --> 28:36.600
Venezuela, the listeners will just nod in agreement, thinking something was said.

28:36.600 --> 28:40.280
Those lawless, socialist monsters in Venezuela.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.280
Yeah.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.160
Now, lest you think that Alex cares.

28:44.160 --> 28:47.320
I would be hard-pressed to get to a point where I do, but-

28:47.320 --> 28:53.200
Well, this will vaccinate you from that impression taken hold.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.960
Oh, look.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.040
The Indians are starving to death.

28:58.040 --> 29:03.040
You could even find aid groups saying they're starving to death, but by the time it hits

29:03.040 --> 29:05.320
CNN, look, there's mass graves.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.040
They're burning people outside.

29:07.040 --> 29:11.640
That's how they get rid of people over there, and anybody that has any knowledge knows that,

29:11.640 --> 29:13.280
but not the average CNN viewer.

29:13.280 --> 29:18.800
So it's lie upon lie upon lie upon lie, but let me get back to what I was talking about.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.800
We haven't had bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula, in five, almost six months.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.800
Wow.

29:23.800 --> 29:24.800
What?

29:24.800 --> 29:32.360
You know, here's just such a simple fucking, go fuck yourself on this shit.

29:32.360 --> 29:36.560
Like, okay, if you're going to what about me with the Indians are starving, and we even

29:36.560 --> 29:40.520
know aid groups are saying that Indians are starving.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.520
All right, so you're going to tell me that that's an issue you fucking care about, that

29:44.520 --> 29:46.560
the Republican party cares about.

29:46.560 --> 29:51.760
So if the Republican party is in power, they should at the very least mention that they

29:51.760 --> 29:53.800
care about while they are in power.

29:53.800 --> 29:57.640
But when they are in power, they sure seem to forget all this bullshit.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.640
They do.

29:58.640 --> 29:59.640
They do.

29:59.640 --> 30:00.640
A couple of quick clarifications.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.640
Sorry.

30:01.640 --> 30:06.680
One, it's very important to recognize that right now, Alex's brand is moving away from

30:06.680 --> 30:10.840
the Republican party, because it does not look like a Trump nominee.

30:10.840 --> 30:15.320
It's going to be the 2024 candidate that people are going to coalesce behind.

30:15.320 --> 30:20.840
So I believe that there's that fracturing happening, and Alex is soon to be above the

30:20.840 --> 30:21.840
left-right paradigm.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.040
Sure, sure, you know, we'll get back to that.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.800
Oh, that motherfucker, if he wriggles out of this bullshit.

30:26.800 --> 30:31.040
So whenever you want to say complaints about the Republican party, yes.

30:31.040 --> 30:35.320
Absolutely valid criticism, although Alex will be deflecting that in the future.

30:35.320 --> 30:39.520
Trumpist party, the Patriot party, whatever the fuck you want.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.560
Until they have an official name, it's going to be difficult to make these darts hit the

30:43.560 --> 30:44.560
right spot.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.880
I'm going to call them no nothings until further notice.

30:46.880 --> 30:47.880
That's fair enough.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.880
Yeah.

30:48.880 --> 30:54.000
But yeah, I also like the idea that Alex is talking about real world stuff, or presumably

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
real world stuff.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Yeah, the important shit.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.440
And then he's like, let me get back to what I was talking about, that's a weird transition

30:59.440 --> 31:00.440
into the ad.

31:00.440 --> 31:05.520
Listen, listen, sorry I took that tangent about important shit, did you know what else

31:05.520 --> 31:06.700
we've got in our store?

31:06.700 --> 31:08.840
We have, dumb pills.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.440
So this next clip is fun.

31:11.440 --> 31:17.320
This was something that I decided to have a little bit of a, dig to the bottom of a

31:17.320 --> 31:18.320
hole on.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.320
Yeah, sure.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.840
And it's Alex reading a headline.

31:21.840 --> 31:26.320
Health experts encourage CDC to implement permanent mask mandates.

31:26.320 --> 31:31.040
That's an Infowars.com article, and it links to BBC, CNN, all of them.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.440
Well, I could have told you that.

31:33.440 --> 31:37.840
Bill Gates said last year, over a year ago when it all started, he said, oh, it's never

31:37.840 --> 31:41.000
going to end and masks will be like wearing seatbelts.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.360
This is a Paul Joseph Watson article on Infowars, and I found this to be a great opportunity

31:45.360 --> 31:49.520
to illustrate how Infowars misleads and doesn't actually cover the news that they're even

31:49.520 --> 31:51.060
pretending to.

31:51.060 --> 31:54.560
The second half of this article that Paul wrote is just the standard anti-mask stuff

31:54.560 --> 31:57.920
that you find in pretty much any article on their website that has to do with masks.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.960
So I'm just going to ignore all that.

32:00.960 --> 32:06.420
The actual headline is, quote, health experts encourage CDC to implement permanent mask

32:06.420 --> 32:07.420
mandates.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.840
This article does not link to the BBC or CNN.

32:10.840 --> 32:14.800
In fact, the entire story is based on one article from the Providence Journal.

32:14.800 --> 32:20.800
This is an outlet from Rhode Island published in December 2020 with the headline, quote,

32:20.800 --> 32:22.560
thinking about life without a mask?

32:22.560 --> 32:24.240
Think again, say Rhode Island experts.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.080
Is that where North Korea hid those ballots?

32:27.080 --> 32:28.080
Must have.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.080
Must have been in Providence.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.080
Yeah.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.080
Yeah, that makes sense.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.880
Leaving aside the fact that this is almost five months old as an article and Infowars

32:33.880 --> 32:38.640
is pretending it's news, if you look deeper into how the original article is misrepresented,

32:38.640 --> 32:42.480
you get an even better sense of the propaganda that's being deployed here.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.920
The two experts that were consulted for this Providence Journal article are Dr. Nicole

32:45.920 --> 32:49.760
Alexander Scott and Dr. Leonard A. Murmill.

32:49.760 --> 32:54.280
Neither of them at any point seemed to be encouraging the CDC to make mask wearing permanent

32:54.280 --> 32:57.400
or mandatory, as the headline might lead you to think.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.080
You would think that's where they would be going, right?

33:00.080 --> 33:01.080
Yeah.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.760
Here's the part of the Infowars article that quotes Dr. Alexander Scott.

33:03.760 --> 33:09.000
Quote, we have seen benefits of masking that occur, health director Dr. Nicole Alexander

33:09.000 --> 33:10.960
Scott told the Providence Journal.

33:10.960 --> 33:15.580
So there may be a new form of normalcy where masks don't necessarily have to go away.

33:15.580 --> 33:19.200
This is all good and well, as that passage does appear in the actual article.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.480
However, consider that Infowars lead.

33:21.480 --> 33:26.820
Their first line of the story is quote, health experts are insisting that the CDC should

33:26.820 --> 33:32.120
implement permanent mask mandates even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.

33:32.120 --> 33:37.040
That doesn't seem like Alexander Scott is insisting that the CDC implement anything.

33:37.040 --> 33:40.960
Just commenting that there may be a utility in continued mask wearing, obviously to cut

33:40.960 --> 33:43.820
down on transmission of annual flus.

33:43.820 --> 33:48.060
This sensationalizing of almost half a year old comments made by a Rhode Island doctor

33:48.060 --> 33:51.320
that Alex and Paul Joseph Watson have never heard of before.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.320
That's bad enough.

33:52.320 --> 33:56.600
But if you go read the actual article, there's another quote from Alexander Scott that Paul

33:56.600 --> 34:00.320
is intentionally leaving out of the article because it doesn't serve the purposes of the

34:00.320 --> 34:01.320
propaganda.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.840
She was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.280
Before you take me out of context, I know Paul Joseph Watson is reading this.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.280
That would be great.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.280
I can't hang.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.280
I can't hang.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.600
From the Providence Journal article, quote, Alexander Scott said state health officials

34:12.600 --> 34:16.440
have much to consider before taking a final position on whether mask wearing should continue

34:16.440 --> 34:17.440
after the pandemic.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.760
Quote, I want to reserve the ability to research and see what are some of the things that we've

34:21.760 --> 34:24.760
introduced because of the pandemic that are valuable to continue.

34:24.760 --> 34:29.140
She said, adding she hopes the public would see the benefits of mask wearing if its continuance

34:29.140 --> 34:30.140
is recommended.

34:30.140 --> 34:35.200
Quote, my hope would be that folks would see the value of continuing that, she said.

34:35.200 --> 34:39.120
It's unlikely to be a definitive mandate, but we want to be driven by the data and the

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
science.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.120
Yeah.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.580
That's like, what if your heartless, soulless, monstrous corporate boss forces you to go

34:45.580 --> 34:50.560
to work regardless of whether or not you're feeling ill, perhaps instead of the old ways

34:50.560 --> 34:55.060
before the pandemic where you would just show up to work and sneeze all over everything,

34:55.060 --> 34:57.140
you should try wearing a mask.

34:57.140 --> 35:01.860
Or if there's no reason for you to need to go into work and you can work remotely, why

35:01.860 --> 35:02.860
not?

35:02.860 --> 35:03.860
Why not work remotely?

35:03.860 --> 35:06.480
If you're feeling well and you can be just as productive at home.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.480
Seems fairly simple.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.480
Right.

35:08.480 --> 35:09.480
Sure.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.480
Yeah.

35:10.480 --> 35:14.880
Any of these things are possible implications or ideas of what she could be talking about.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.880
Seems like it would work fine.

35:15.880 --> 35:19.020
And it's important to recognize that she's very clearly talking about being driven by

35:19.020 --> 35:20.520
data and science.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.520
Yeah.

35:21.520 --> 35:26.280
So that's clear, you know, that she's saying that it could be advantageous.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.000
There's not likely to be a definitive mandate.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Sure.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.160
That position clearly articulated in the original article is completely misrepresented by the

35:33.160 --> 35:37.180
Infowars article because they are liars who are doing this for profit.

35:37.180 --> 35:40.220
The second expert in the article is Dr. Mermel.

35:40.220 --> 35:44.280
Here's what Paul includes of his comments in the Infowars article, and it begins with

35:44.280 --> 35:48.520
including a mistaken reference to Dr. Alexander Scott as his.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
Oh, no.

35:49.520 --> 35:54.740
Quote, his sentiments were echoed by Dr. Leonard A. Mermel, medical director of epidemiology

35:54.740 --> 35:58.960
and infection control at Rhode Island Hospital, who said making people wear masks all the

35:58.960 --> 36:03.240
time was worth it to stop the spread of the viruses other than COVID-19.

36:03.240 --> 36:07.740
Quote, within the lifespan system, we're seeing far fewer of the respiratory viruses than

36:07.740 --> 36:11.000
we are used to seeing at this moment in the calendar year.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
So it's impressive.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.380
The COVID preventative strategies are having an impact on other respiratory viruses, which

36:16.380 --> 36:17.380
just makes sense.

36:17.380 --> 36:19.400
They spread in a similar fashion, said Mermel.

36:19.400 --> 36:24.400
Quote, it would not surprise me if that became a recommendation from the CDC, he said.

36:24.400 --> 36:28.480
It's a pretty low price to pay to try to reduce the risk to oneself and particularly loved

36:28.480 --> 36:33.920
ones who may be at a particular risk for these sorts of infections causing harm, he added.

36:33.920 --> 36:38.520
It would not surprise him if the CDC made a recommendation to continue wearing masks.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.040
Does that justify the lead?

36:40.040 --> 36:44.720
Quote, health experts are insisting that the CDC should implement permanent mask mandates

36:44.720 --> 36:47.360
even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.560
Does that justify that?

36:48.560 --> 36:51.880
You didn't hear the tone of voice with which he said it.

36:51.880 --> 36:58.760
He said, A, wouldn't surprise me if the CDC made these mandatory forever because I was

36:58.760 --> 37:00.860
insisting in behind closed doors.

37:00.860 --> 37:04.480
My question about whether or not that's justified is not rhetorical.

37:04.480 --> 37:05.480
It does.

37:05.480 --> 37:06.480
It's not.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.480
This is bullshit.

37:07.480 --> 37:08.480
That's fair.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.240
And it gets even worse in the case of Dr. Mermel as well, because he also said some

37:11.240 --> 37:14.240
stuff that Paul is just conveniently ignoring.

37:14.240 --> 37:18.520
From the Providence Journal article, quote, flu has dampened significantly in the southern

37:18.520 --> 37:23.560
hemisphere in those countries that had aggressive public health measures to reduce COVID risks

37:23.560 --> 37:26.520
such as social distancing and masking, Mermel said.

37:26.520 --> 37:30.240
The southern hemisphere acts as a sort of time machine with its winter and flu season

37:30.240 --> 37:33.280
coming six months ahead of the winter in the northern hemisphere.

37:33.280 --> 37:38.080
Preliminary data shows the United States having a quiet flu season with recorded cases lower

37:38.080 --> 37:42.600
than each of the last six years at the same point in the season, Mermel said.

37:42.600 --> 37:47.720
Quote, at the moment what we're seeing mirrors what we've seen in the southern hemisphere.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.360
Let's hope that continues to be the case.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.880
No guarantee, he said.

37:50.880 --> 37:55.620
Quote, right now we are for this time of year seeing very low prevalence, but again, it's

37:55.620 --> 37:58.960
very early, so it's hard to know what to make of that.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.960
Uh.

37:59.960 --> 38:00.960
Wow.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.520
In the underlying article that Paul is covering dishonestly, both of the experts cited gave

38:04.520 --> 38:08.520
very general comments to the effect that it's possible that wearing masks could be helpful

38:08.520 --> 38:12.880
at lowering cases of the flu, but it was too early to say and that we should let data lead

38:12.880 --> 38:14.900
us to our eventual conclusion.

38:14.900 --> 38:18.760
Neither of them were saying that the CDC needs to make mask wearing permanent.

38:18.760 --> 38:22.160
No one was demanding any kind of mandatory mask laws.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.160
Yeah.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.900
This is pretty much always the case with InfoWars articles.

38:25.900 --> 38:29.480
There may be an actual news outlet story that they're basing their coverage on, but the

38:29.480 --> 38:34.280
version they're covering is a funhouse mirror of the real thing, distorted so it'll fit

38:34.280 --> 38:36.560
the bullshit narratives they want to push.

38:36.560 --> 38:40.380
I chose to cover this one a little more specifically because it's pretty glaring and it's super

38:40.380 --> 38:44.040
embarrassing that Paul didn't check the date on the Providence Journal article before cranking

38:44.040 --> 38:46.720
out his outrage blog post.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.080
It's honestly hilarious.

38:48.080 --> 38:52.160
And here's another paragraph from Paul's article, just because I like to poke.

38:52.160 --> 38:57.200
Keep in mind that experts that he's referencing are two doctors in Rhode Island who spoke

38:57.200 --> 39:00.440
to a local paper five months ago.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.820
This is from Paul's article that came out this week.

39:02.820 --> 39:06.360
So let me set the scene, all right?

39:06.360 --> 39:08.080
So we've got these two doctors.

39:08.080 --> 39:12.680
They're on the phone with a local Providence, Rhode Island Journal.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.680
They're busy.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.680
They're at the hospital.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.000
They're dealing with shit.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.280
They're talking to this person.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.920
They might decide to set a block of time aside.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.720
Then cut to five months later.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.480
All right, here we are.

39:24.480 --> 39:28.540
Quote, medical professionals are still attempting to have mask mandates become part of the new

39:28.540 --> 39:33.360
normal despite Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledging yesterday that it would be common sense for

39:33.360 --> 39:35.560
the CDC to start relaxing measures.

39:35.560 --> 39:39.680
Wait, so now Fauci is- No, no, no, but do you understand what's

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
going on here?

39:40.680 --> 39:41.680
There's a time warp going on.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.680
Yes, I understand.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.680
This article's five months old.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.240
This article is far older.

39:45.240 --> 39:48.880
He's comparing their comments to something Fauci said yesterday in the present day.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.160
No, I'm recognizing and understanding this.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.480
Sloppy shit, man.

39:53.480 --> 39:57.900
You know how sometimes I'm like, Dan, we can't let scientists name stuff because they accidentally

39:57.900 --> 40:02.700
name it really intimidating things, or we can't let scientists talk to journalists the

40:02.700 --> 40:07.160
same way they would to other scientists because other people will twist it because they can't

40:07.160 --> 40:08.920
really quite comprehend it.

40:08.920 --> 40:09.920
It's not their fault.

40:09.920 --> 40:13.560
It's just they don't have that same kind of social education, that kind of thing.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.420
In this circumstance, fuck it.

40:15.420 --> 40:16.680
There's nothing you can do.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.680
There's nothing you can do.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.800
Well, no, I agree, because the doctors did not convey information-

40:20.800 --> 40:21.800
No.

40:21.800 --> 40:22.800
... poorly.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.360
They just were taken- They did it every-

40:24.360 --> 40:25.360
Yeah.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.360
Yeah.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.560
I mean, if you want to really make it so you can't do the stuff that Paul does, it's like

40:28.560 --> 40:29.960
no one can ever talk again.

40:29.960 --> 40:30.960
Exactly.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.960
Yeah.

40:31.960 --> 40:32.960
There's no saving this one.

40:32.960 --> 40:33.960
They'll just splice things open.

40:33.960 --> 40:34.960
Yeah.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.160
It's not like she named it murder town is what we're going to go to.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.160
No.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.160
It's not a fictitious presentation of something that did happen in as much as two doctors

40:43.160 --> 40:45.640
in Rhode Island talked to a local paper five months ago.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.640
No.

40:46.640 --> 40:47.640
It's fanfic.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.640
Yeah.

40:48.640 --> 40:49.640
This is 50 shades of bullshit.

40:49.640 --> 40:50.640
But it's fanfic that gets people hurt.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.640
Yeah.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.640
Yeah.

40:52.640 --> 40:53.640
Yeah.

40:53.640 --> 40:54.640
Naturally.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.640
Well, like 50 shades of gray.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.320
Alex, on the show here in April 26th, he has some other sources.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.320
I'm sorry.

40:59.320 --> 41:02.880
I said I'd just read you the headlines.

41:02.880 --> 41:07.660
Stanford study result face masks are ineffective to block transmission of COVID-19 actually

41:07.660 --> 41:14.080
can cause health deterioration and premature death, but who cares about the facts?

41:14.080 --> 41:19.760
New studies suggest wearing a mask is ineffective.

41:19.760 --> 41:22.840
New study highlights face mask problems with safety and efficacy.

41:22.840 --> 41:23.840
Oh, really?

41:23.840 --> 41:25.160
It's a total damn cult.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.280
If you're paying attention, you'll notice that these headlines, these three headlines

41:28.280 --> 41:32.160
are all just different dumb blogs writing their own headline about the same underlying

41:32.160 --> 41:33.160
story.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.160
Yeah.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.140
A supposed Stanford study that says that masks are bad.

41:36.140 --> 41:39.960
If you're not paying attention, as Alex's audience almost never is, it might appear

41:39.960 --> 41:43.920
that there's a flood of studies showing that masks are dangerous and you were right all

41:43.920 --> 41:45.500
along to be against them.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.500
Three studies at least.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.500
He's just named them.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.500
Just today.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.600
Just today.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.280
That's the impression Alex is trying to create by repeatedly hitting the same story as if

41:53.280 --> 41:54.960
it's three different stories.

41:54.960 --> 41:59.960
Also, this paper about masks was written by a guy named Baruch Vainshelboim, who is a

41:59.960 --> 42:07.100
quote, visiting scholar on matters unrelated to this paper between 2015 and 2016 at Stanford.

42:07.100 --> 42:10.580
Other than that, he has no connection with Stanford and Stanford has requested a correction

42:10.580 --> 42:13.000
to take their name off this bullshit.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.900
This is an important point to bring up.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.500
People like Alex and the right wing media hate authoritative sources.

42:18.500 --> 42:22.280
The mainstream media is the enemy of the people and the universities are just full of liars

42:22.280 --> 42:24.540
trying to push the globalist agenda.

42:24.540 --> 42:28.160
And yet, whenever they have the opportunity to pretend that one of their narratives is

42:28.160 --> 42:34.360
backed by the authority, top scientists, top scientists, top scientists all over this place.

42:34.360 --> 42:38.860
Whenever they can back their thing with the appealing to the authority of a real mainstream

42:38.860 --> 42:42.720
or academic institution, they trip over their feet trying to associate their ideas with

42:42.720 --> 42:43.720
a respectable source.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.560
Of course, that's a real respectable source.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.940
That's not the bullshit we normally talk about.

42:47.940 --> 42:53.420
Anyone who thinks that people like Alex are legit should really question why they do that.

42:53.420 --> 42:58.140
This paper was published in a journal called Medical Hypotheses, which is basically exactly

42:58.140 --> 42:59.320
what it sounds like.

42:59.320 --> 43:02.540
An outlet for fringe nonsense and unsubstantiated ideas.

43:02.540 --> 43:07.060
This paper is trash and the conclusion runs at odds with dozens of other more rigorously

43:07.060 --> 43:11.400
designed studies and it's being falsely attributed to Stanford in order to elevate its credibility.

43:11.400 --> 43:16.620
This is basically the norm when it comes to information sources that Infowars uses.

43:16.620 --> 43:17.620
Yeah.

43:17.620 --> 43:18.620
Because it's nothing.

43:18.620 --> 43:23.720
Because the underlying unspoken thing they're saying there is, look, even people who do

43:23.720 --> 43:29.500
work believe this, even people who work on this shit believe.

43:29.500 --> 43:33.520
If I reference the Washington Post, you know it's true because they actually have to work

43:33.520 --> 43:34.520
on it.

43:34.520 --> 43:35.520
Yeah.

43:35.520 --> 43:36.520
Yeah.

43:36.520 --> 43:37.520
That's bullshit.

43:37.520 --> 43:38.520
They have standards.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.520
Yeah.

43:39.520 --> 43:44.960
So you're saying whatever you don't, you're immediately implying that you're lying all

43:44.960 --> 43:48.620
of the time except, I hate it.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.280
So I want to hear another lie?

43:50.280 --> 43:52.080
Yes, of course.

43:52.080 --> 43:55.720
Why did Merck pull out three months ago?

43:55.720 --> 43:58.760
They said you cannot produce a safe vaccine for the cold virus.

43:58.760 --> 44:05.720
If you do, it causes autoimmune responses, an allergic reactions in a large number of,

44:05.720 --> 44:09.760
because they said, we don't care if you wave lab to test, we're doing lab test.

44:09.760 --> 44:14.120
And even corrupt Merck said, we suggest you don't take vaccines and you just get herd

44:14.120 --> 44:15.120
immunity.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.120
Oh really?

44:16.120 --> 44:21.400
Because if you make a vaccine that is broad enough for the protein that's in a cold virus,

44:21.400 --> 44:23.840
then it's going to attack your own damn body.

44:23.840 --> 44:24.840
This isn't true.

44:24.840 --> 44:28.880
Alex is just making up this entire story about why Merck decided to spend their efforts to

44:28.880 --> 44:30.720
develop a COVID vaccine.

44:30.720 --> 44:34.920
In reality, if you actually read their statements, it was a situation where they had two candidate

44:34.920 --> 44:39.100
vaccines, which the test subjects responded well to, but quote, the immune responses were

44:39.100 --> 44:45.280
inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19

44:45.280 --> 44:46.740
vaccines.

44:46.740 --> 44:49.960
The idea of trying to start from scratch on new vaccine candidates when there are already

44:49.960 --> 44:53.820
other promising vaccines coming to market, that would have been a waste of resources

44:53.820 --> 44:54.820
for them.

44:54.820 --> 44:58.320
So what they decided to do was adjust their research strategy to focus on therapeutics

44:58.320 --> 44:59.800
that they might be able to develop.

44:59.800 --> 45:00.800
Sure.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.400
All of Alex's story about them saying you shouldn't take vaccines and a vaccine for

45:03.400 --> 45:06.840
COVID is impossible, that's just completely made up from his imagination.

45:06.840 --> 45:07.840
And it's fun.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.280
I'm sure the audience enjoys it, but it's not real.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.280
Yeah.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.640
Anyway, just bullshit.

45:12.640 --> 45:16.520
Why would anybody trust him when he says anything about viruses?

45:16.520 --> 45:21.920
Like, honestly, just tell me what a virus even looks like before you're telling me what

45:21.920 --> 45:22.920
viruses do.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.320
Give me an idea of what it looks like.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.640
You think I don't know what a virus looks like?

45:26.640 --> 45:28.140
I really don't think you do.

45:28.140 --> 45:29.140
They're about yay-bing.

45:29.140 --> 45:30.140
They are not about yay-bing.

45:30.140 --> 45:31.140
They're red.

45:31.140 --> 45:32.720
They are, some of them are red.

45:32.720 --> 45:33.720
They have horns.

45:33.720 --> 45:34.720
That's true.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.720
They have a pitchfork.

45:35.720 --> 45:36.720
That's all such-

45:36.720 --> 45:37.720
It's the devil.

45:37.720 --> 45:38.720
It is the devil!

45:38.720 --> 45:39.720
Shit!

45:39.720 --> 45:40.720
You nailed it.

45:40.720 --> 45:47.280
Alex, I would say that probably his main narrative is trying to rationalize the COVID deaths

45:47.280 --> 45:51.960
in India and recontextualize them as what he's calling malnutrition deaths.

45:51.960 --> 45:52.960
Right, right, right.

45:52.960 --> 45:53.960
And it's nonsense.

45:53.960 --> 45:54.960
Don't worry about this.

45:54.960 --> 45:55.960
Worry about that.

45:55.960 --> 45:56.960
David Beasley, he's the head of it.

45:56.960 --> 45:57.960
We have to clip him in a moment.

45:57.960 --> 46:04.760
Wards of dire famines in Africa, Mideast, Asia, if COVID-19 supply change damage continues

46:04.760 --> 46:05.920
and also in India.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.220
The reality of COVID in India right now is really scary and it should be something that

46:09.220 --> 46:14.200
creates feelings of concern and care for the people in India and also creates a real sense

46:14.200 --> 46:17.340
of the stakes that people are facing when it comes to the virus.

46:17.340 --> 46:21.000
These realizations are dangerous for Alex because his entire last year of work has been

46:21.000 --> 46:25.200
dedicated to minimizing the COVID pandemic for profit and to help his God King Trump

46:25.200 --> 46:26.200
not look bad.

46:26.200 --> 46:30.360
The Infowars audience cannot be allowed to think that the human tragedy in India is real

46:30.360 --> 46:34.240
because that threatens the bottom line of Alex's operations.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.200
Thus, you see what you see here.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.840
It's a complete rewriting of the situation.

46:38.840 --> 46:42.800
You can keep the feelings of concern and care for the people of India, but you're being

46:42.800 --> 46:45.120
lied to about why you should care.

46:45.120 --> 46:47.440
It's not about the virus, it's about malnutrition.

46:47.440 --> 46:51.860
You can keep that human empathy, but Alex has to protect the business.

46:51.860 --> 46:54.300
You can see a slight of hand really clearly here.

46:54.300 --> 46:58.400
In order to make his argument that all the COVID deaths in India are secretly just malnutrition,

46:58.400 --> 47:03.320
he's referencing a May 8th, 2020 article published by the Atlantic Council warning of the possibility

47:03.320 --> 47:05.960
of famine due to supply chain breakdown.

47:05.960 --> 47:10.000
The actual headline is, quote, world food programs David Beasley warns of dire famines

47:10.000 --> 47:14.240
in Africa, Middle East, if COVID-19 supply chains damage continues.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.280
But you see how Alex amended the headline to add India in there because he needs to

47:18.280 --> 47:21.200
make it look like that for the narrative to stay.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.580
The word India doesn't appear in that article at all.

47:23.580 --> 47:28.640
And even this article isn't just about COVID, it's also about other influences on food insecurity

47:28.640 --> 47:32.800
like the flooding that was happening in Sudan and the massive locust swarms.

47:32.800 --> 47:36.400
It's a complicated humanitarian issue that demands attention, but Alex is attempting

47:36.400 --> 47:41.020
to hijack that attention and use it as a prop for his COVID denialist narratives, which

47:41.020 --> 47:42.020
is ghoulish.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.020
Yeah.

47:43.020 --> 47:44.020
Ghoulish, I say.

47:44.020 --> 47:49.120
Yeah, the fundamental thing that the right wing has to do first is, you know, everybody

47:49.120 --> 47:54.720
knows, your family members, people you know, you're like, how is it that these people who

47:54.720 --> 48:01.780
are in person and in conversation, so empathetic and caring and kind, how is it that on large

48:01.780 --> 48:04.860
national issues, they're fucking monsters?

48:04.860 --> 48:08.240
And it's like the right wing has to redirect that empathy.

48:08.240 --> 48:11.080
Otherwise people will never buy.

48:11.080 --> 48:15.100
People are never going to be like, hey, yeah, I think we should steal money from the poor

48:15.100 --> 48:16.100
and kill them.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.960
You know, you have to redirect it so they don't even care.

48:18.960 --> 48:19.960
Yeah, absolutely.

48:19.960 --> 48:20.960
Yep.

48:20.960 --> 48:21.960
And it's, it's just so...

48:21.960 --> 48:23.160
And that's what you see being done here.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.160
Yeah.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.480
And it just destroys people's brains.

48:25.480 --> 48:27.600
It really destroys them.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.600
Yeah.

48:28.600 --> 48:33.280
And the whole end result is a crippling of your ability to care for other people in a

48:33.280 --> 48:34.280
meaningful way.

48:34.280 --> 48:36.440
No, a borderline pathological apathy.

48:36.440 --> 48:37.440
Yeah.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.440
Yeah.

48:38.440 --> 48:42.040
And it's held up and supported by constant misuse of information.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.040
Yep.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.400
And Alex does that again with another article.

48:45.400 --> 48:51.000
Coronavirus, India's lockdown turning into humanitarian crisis, German news, DW.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.040
That's from six, eight months ago, admitting mass starvation, millions already starve to

48:55.040 --> 48:56.040
death.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.040
Alex is lying about that article.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.040
Yeah.

48:58.040 --> 49:02.320
It's a real, and it is a real article from DW, but it's about a desperate situation that

49:02.320 --> 49:06.700
many migrant workers in India were experiencing due to COVID lockdowns.

49:06.700 --> 49:10.120
Many who found themselves without work due to business closures, and they were far away

49:10.120 --> 49:13.200
from their homes and villages outside major cities.

49:13.200 --> 49:17.000
To add to that difficulty, trains had been closed, and although there was eventually

49:17.000 --> 49:21.520
a plan put in place to help transit, you know, stranded workers back to where they were going,

49:21.520 --> 49:23.700
it was not smoothly implemented.

49:23.700 --> 49:26.520
This article doesn't admit that millions had starved to death.

49:26.520 --> 49:31.040
It's a report that's meant to bring attention to an issue that some might not be aware of,

49:31.040 --> 49:34.860
and Alex is lying about it to defend his indefensible narrative that all the COVID deaths in India

49:34.860 --> 49:36.400
are a hoax.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.400
That's what he's doing.

49:37.400 --> 49:38.400
Wow.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.400
Yep.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.520
Man, you know, guess what, Dan?

49:41.520 --> 49:45.480
It's just as horrific whenever he's doing it about a different country.

49:45.480 --> 49:46.480
True.

49:46.480 --> 49:47.480
It never changes.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.480
True.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.840
I don't feel different about it because he's lying about India instead of the United States.

49:51.840 --> 49:52.840
Nope.

49:52.840 --> 49:53.840
Fuck him.

49:53.840 --> 49:58.280
So this clip is, we're jumping to another topic.

49:58.280 --> 50:02.960
I don't know how to set this clip up other than just like, this is weird, man.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.240
I don't wish you any harm myself.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.960
I'm not calling for violence against you.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.120
It's already weird.

50:07.120 --> 50:10.680
Bill Gates should publicly hang himself.

50:10.680 --> 50:13.140
I think Prince Charles should publicly hang himself.

50:13.140 --> 50:18.600
I think Ted Turner should publicly hang himself and that they would all go to one of their

50:18.600 --> 50:21.880
ranches and just have a public international thing and say, we want to kill you.

50:21.880 --> 50:22.880
We want to save the earth.

50:22.880 --> 50:25.680
We're going to start with ourselves and if Bill Gates just took an ice pick and just

50:25.680 --> 50:30.840
started ramming in his throat, hey, humanity with blood spewing, I would say, well, I respect

50:30.840 --> 50:31.840
that man.

50:31.840 --> 50:32.840
Maybe he's right.

50:32.840 --> 50:35.760
Then we can have the drones launch with the nerve gas and start the operation, which is

50:35.760 --> 50:39.120
the final mop-up operation, which I told you about a long time ago, now they're admitting

50:39.120 --> 50:40.120
it.

50:40.120 --> 50:41.120
The drones are ready with the nerve gas.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.120
We're in your family.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.120
We'll be right back.

50:43.120 --> 50:46.320
Is that plan C, the drones with nerve gas?

50:46.320 --> 50:48.200
Because that's not a biological weapon.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.200
That's a chemical weapon.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.960
I'm surprised by the drones with nerve gas.

50:50.960 --> 50:53.840
Yeah, apparently Alex just made that up to throw in.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.200
You know, I was, I was going along with him.

50:56.200 --> 51:00.320
I was like, this is a bit macabre, but ultimately, yeah, I'm fine with that.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.520
I don't give a shit.

51:01.520 --> 51:05.920
But then we got into the, then he was like, and if they killed themselves, then I would

51:05.920 --> 51:08.920
agree that so everyone else should die.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.920
That's weird.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.160
That's kind of, that's what he said, right?

51:12.160 --> 51:13.160
Yeah.

51:13.160 --> 51:19.040
I understand you're creating terms of the secondary part that are never going to happen.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.040
Of course not.

51:20.040 --> 51:26.760
My political positions and my beliefs are not influenced by public spectacles.

51:26.760 --> 51:34.600
If my political enemies kill themselves, I will join their team is his point.

51:34.600 --> 51:35.600
I respect the hell out of that.

51:35.600 --> 51:38.080
I respect the hell out of anybody who'd kill themselves.

51:38.080 --> 51:44.080
I got to, listen, my beliefs are so fungible that that's all it takes.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.640
Trump like gets up there and slaps himself in the face.

51:46.640 --> 51:49.360
He's like, don't you see what I do for this country?

51:49.360 --> 51:50.360
What a hero.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.360
What a hero.

51:51.360 --> 51:52.360
Oh my God.

51:52.360 --> 51:53.360
Oh my God.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.880
This is, they look, now that he's not president, he has finally become the president of the

51:56.880 --> 51:57.880
United States.

51:57.880 --> 51:58.880
What the hell is this?

51:58.880 --> 52:02.800
I mean, I obviously don't believe him, but he's still saying it.

52:02.800 --> 52:03.800
Yeah.

52:03.800 --> 52:04.800
Yeah.

52:04.800 --> 52:05.800
It's weird.

52:05.800 --> 52:06.800
That's a weird thing to say out loud.

52:06.800 --> 52:07.800
Yep.

52:07.800 --> 52:11.320
So we have high minded issues to cover on this April 26th show and actually it was kind

52:11.320 --> 52:12.320
of interesting.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.280
So far it feels like I disagree with you, but keep going.

52:14.280 --> 52:19.000
Oh, it's going to get worse too, because that was me being decisious.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.600
I'm pretty disconnected from pop culture as a whole.

52:22.600 --> 52:23.600
Sure.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.480
And I didn't actually even realize the Oscars happened.

52:25.480 --> 52:26.480
Right.

52:26.480 --> 52:27.480
Right, right, right.

52:27.480 --> 52:28.480
Until they had happened.

52:28.480 --> 52:29.480
Sure, sure.

52:29.480 --> 52:33.680
I heard about the Anthony Hopkins sort of kerfuffle.

52:33.680 --> 52:38.440
I have no interest in the Oscars, didn't before, don't now, and I really hate Oscars drama.

52:38.440 --> 52:39.440
Yeah.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.440
I don't know.

52:40.440 --> 52:45.880
It's not something that is necessarily a huge part of stuff that takes up space in my mind.

52:45.880 --> 52:46.880
Totally.

52:46.880 --> 52:47.880
Alex hates the media.

52:47.880 --> 52:48.960
He hates movies.

52:48.960 --> 52:51.000
He hates Hollywood.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.720
He thinks about it so much more.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.720
All the time.

52:53.720 --> 52:54.720
It's the most important thing in the world.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.920
He was almost in Guardians of the Galaxy.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.160
He's so mad.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.480
So let's start playing some of these clips.

53:02.480 --> 53:09.120
This is Regina King, some actress that won an Oscar who's all pissed off up there with

53:09.120 --> 53:12.280
an angry looking face because she's a good person and she's up against those bad white

53:12.280 --> 53:13.280
people.

53:13.280 --> 53:18.020
And I tell you, if there hadn't been the proper ruling, she'd have been putting her boots

53:18.020 --> 53:21.680
on to march against those white people.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.240
She'll never march against Bill Gates or Hollywood.

53:23.240 --> 53:25.360
She'll never actually stand up for any black people.

53:25.360 --> 53:29.880
No, she'll just make millions of dollars and wear fancy $5,000 dresses and drive around

53:29.880 --> 53:35.240
in Ferraris and fly around in private jets and then bitch about evil America that produced

53:35.240 --> 53:36.240
so much wealth.

53:36.240 --> 53:40.280
She lives like this while Africans are starving to death by the tens of thousands every day.

53:40.280 --> 53:44.960
You can see how Alex's criticism of Regina King is 100% racially based.

53:44.960 --> 53:45.960
No.

53:45.960 --> 53:50.400
He doesn't know anything about her as a person or what sorts of charity work she may be involved

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400
in.

53:51.400 --> 53:55.040
All he sees is a black woman saying something that he doesn't like and his response is racist

53:55.040 --> 53:56.560
outrage.

53:56.560 --> 54:00.960
So in her intro speech, King mentioned how difficult the last year has been and how if

54:00.960 --> 54:04.360
the Chauvin verdict had been different, she might have traded in her heels for marching

54:04.360 --> 54:05.360
boots.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.360
Yeah.

54:06.360 --> 54:08.680
This statement is experienced by Alex as her saying she would have been marching against

54:08.680 --> 54:13.200
evil white people because everything in his life is filtered through the lens of white

54:13.200 --> 54:14.200
victimhood.

54:14.200 --> 54:18.080
Yeah, it does seem like the people, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not good.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.360
Also don't come after Regina.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.800
Regina King is not somebody you want to come after.

54:21.800 --> 54:22.800
She's amazing.

54:22.800 --> 54:23.800
Um.

54:23.800 --> 54:24.800
She's great.

54:24.800 --> 54:25.800
I don't think Alex knows anything about her.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.960
I would argue he knows nothing about her.

54:27.960 --> 54:31.240
So he also doesn't even know who this next person is.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.240
Okay.

54:32.240 --> 54:33.240
All right.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.240
He's declaring an idiot.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.240
Okay.

54:35.240 --> 54:37.700
Here's another one of the idiots up there getting an award telling people that there's

54:37.700 --> 54:42.280
an epidemic and disproportionately police shoot black men when it's actually the other

54:42.280 --> 54:43.280
way around.

54:43.280 --> 54:49.600
On average, the police in America every day kill three people, which amounts to about

54:49.600 --> 54:52.960
a thousand people a year.

54:52.960 --> 54:57.160
And those people happen to disproportionately black people.

54:57.160 --> 55:02.920
And you know, James Baldwin once said, the most despicable thing a person can be is indifferent

55:02.920 --> 55:04.160
to other people's pain.

55:04.160 --> 55:09.920
And so I just ask that you please not be indifferent.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.520
Please don't be indifferent.

55:13.520 --> 55:16.400
I mean that guy's literally up there wearing a clown suit.

55:16.400 --> 55:20.400
I guess Alex isn't being indifferent to people's pain as much as he's being hostile towards

55:20.400 --> 55:21.400
it.

55:21.400 --> 55:22.400
Reveling in it?

55:22.400 --> 55:23.400
Denying its validity.

55:23.400 --> 55:24.400
Yeah.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.400
I think that might be worse.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
Enjoying watching people's pain.

55:26.400 --> 55:30.160
Alex is wrong about those statistics because of the very important word he doesn't understand,

55:30.160 --> 55:31.160
which is proportionate.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.160
Exactly.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.160
Yeah.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.860
He refuses to approach statistics in context because if you do that, his arguments fall

55:36.860 --> 55:38.460
apart instantly.

55:38.460 --> 55:42.840
Also that was Travon Free, the writer-director who won an Oscar for best live-action short

55:42.840 --> 55:44.720
for Two Distant Strangers.

55:44.720 --> 55:48.880
To Alex, he's just another idiot because he's a black man attempting to appeal to the better

55:48.880 --> 55:50.640
side of people's humanity.

55:50.640 --> 55:54.560
It's almost comically racist behavior on Alex's part, and it's not surprising at all.

55:54.560 --> 56:01.880
I mean, it's just astonishing how important skin color is to him, while at the same time

56:01.880 --> 56:05.640
how vehement he is that he's not racist.

56:05.640 --> 56:13.480
Like if you bring up the color of someone's skin that much, yeah, yeah.

56:13.480 --> 56:19.200
So he does spend a little while complaining about the Oscars, but-

56:19.200 --> 56:22.320
Well sure, there were black people represented at the Oscars, and we can't-

56:22.320 --> 56:23.320
Yeah, yeah.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.320
He's not so into that.

56:24.320 --> 56:29.820
Where was- Back in my day, you used to win an Oscar for films like Birth of a Nation

56:29.820 --> 56:33.680
because they changed film cinema forever, and that's why.

56:33.680 --> 56:37.720
The only reason that I let that film- Sure, sure, sure.

56:37.720 --> 56:41.800
So he gets onto another topic, or does he?

56:41.800 --> 56:46.280
Here's video, ladies and gentlemen, out of Tennessee.

56:46.280 --> 56:50.080
And this police officer, you know what, I'm going to come back from break, and I'm going

56:50.080 --> 56:52.360
to get to this because I've got to find my article.

56:52.360 --> 56:54.840
There's so many damn articles here and so much happening.

56:54.840 --> 56:57.200
This is just crazy though to watch this unfold.

56:57.200 --> 57:02.640
Before I go to break, ladies and gentlemen, we have some very exciting news, and I mean

57:02.640 --> 57:03.640
extremely exciting.

57:03.640 --> 57:06.360
One of our best selling products is turmeric.

57:06.360 --> 57:08.320
We have the 95% secret humanoid.

57:08.320 --> 57:09.320
He forgot the story.

57:09.320 --> 57:10.320
He forgot the story.

57:10.320 --> 57:11.320
He forgot the story.

57:11.320 --> 57:12.320
He completely forgot the story.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.000
Not sure what I'm supposed to talk about, just in case you were wondering, turmeric.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
Yeah.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Okay, bye.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.720
I forgot the story, so I'm going to do a plug.

57:18.720 --> 57:19.720
Oh boy.

57:19.720 --> 57:20.720
Yep.

57:20.720 --> 57:25.000
So we get a little visit here at the end of the 26th from an old friend who declared it

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
over for humanity.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Sure.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
A year ago.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Sure.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
There's only going to be lone survivors.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.400
And that has been borne out.

57:31.400 --> 57:33.280
And now he has a new story to tell.

57:33.280 --> 57:34.280
Sure.

57:34.280 --> 57:38.920
And then also he's got a new story out that's at naturalnews.com.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.860
It's also on infowars.com.

57:40.860 --> 57:49.880
Health Ranger posts new microscope photos of COVID slobs, COVID masks, mysterious red

57:49.880 --> 57:51.200
and blue fibers.

57:51.200 --> 57:57.940
And others have scanned them and found similar weird things that appear to be, well not appear,

57:57.940 --> 57:58.940
they are moving.

57:58.940 --> 58:05.240
And then there's also German researchers have tested what's in the Pfizer shot and it appears

58:05.240 --> 58:07.760
to have things moving around in it.

58:07.760 --> 58:11.680
And so we're going to get ahold of some samples and work with some labs like Mike Adams to

58:11.680 --> 58:12.880
test this themselves.

58:12.880 --> 58:19.840
But clearly this is getting weirder and weirder and stranger and stranger.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.760
So I don't know what this has to do with vaccines.

58:21.760 --> 58:26.760
This is just Mike took some pictures of masks and swabs and stuff.

58:26.760 --> 58:32.760
And in reference to like the moving stuff and that in the swabs.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.480
That's not from studies.

58:34.480 --> 58:38.280
That was from a TikTok video that came out in January.

58:38.280 --> 58:41.660
It's been pretty debunked by scientists, but the underlying claim of that video is that

58:41.660 --> 58:46.140
people were being intentionally given more Jelen's disease with the COVID swabs.

58:46.140 --> 58:49.900
The conspiracy was so dumb and evidence was so laughable that this one didn't really stick,

58:49.900 --> 58:51.680
but it did get a lot of viral attention.

58:51.680 --> 58:55.800
So it kind of makes sense for someone like Alex or Mike to try and, you know, wander

58:55.800 --> 58:59.960
it a little bit, see if you can whitewash it a tiny bit, put a respectable face on,

58:59.960 --> 59:03.300
see if you can make some money off this fake TikTok video.

59:03.300 --> 59:04.300
It's hard.

59:04.300 --> 59:08.320
Look, I'm not trying to get all delusions of grandeur a la Alex.

59:08.320 --> 59:13.000
However, it does seem like these guys wake up every morning and they're like, what could

59:13.000 --> 59:17.140
I do today that makes Jordan fantasize about owning a flamethrower?

59:17.140 --> 59:18.440
What could I do today?

59:18.440 --> 59:22.560
How do we bring Jordan and Elon Musk closer?

59:22.560 --> 59:26.000
Let's see what it really is going to take for Jordan to buy a flamethrower.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.240
So if you go and look at the natural news article that this is about, you can tell that

59:29.240 --> 59:32.040
Mike is even a little self-conscious about this.

59:32.040 --> 59:36.560
In a caption for the microscope image supposedly of a fiber in some mask he was looking at,

59:36.560 --> 59:41.000
he adds, quote, we do not know why these fibers are there and we are not claiming them to

59:41.000 --> 59:42.520
be more Jelen's fibers.

59:42.520 --> 59:43.520
Okay.

59:43.520 --> 59:44.520
All right.

59:44.520 --> 59:48.200
I applaud that attempt to be taken seriously, although I think it's difficult when the,

59:48.200 --> 59:52.640
you know, one of the other captions for an image of a mask says, quote, some areas of

59:52.640 --> 59:58.160
the carbon fiber strands appear to surround exact looking objects, but they might simply

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.920
be bump textures in the white fiber layer.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.920
Oh man.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.180
Oh, might they?

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:07.280
That's like saying this, okay, we don't know what this screenshot is from.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.320
We think it is absolutely an alien spacecraft.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.660
However, it could be from a video game.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.660
That's also possible.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.880
Are you talking about Eddie Page?

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.920
Yes, I am talking about Eddie Page.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.720
So over the weekend, Mike released a series of completely meaningless microscope images

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.320
of things that he's speculating are suspicious.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.400
One of them was that picture of fiber strands in a mask, which may be an egg sac or may

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.840
be bumps in texture.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Sure.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.160
By Monday, he published a blog post on his website about these images, and the exact

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.780
same image now has this text along with it, quote, what is this egg sac-like structure

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.320
in this first photo of a carbon fiber mask?

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.080
Gone is the very sensible suggestion that it might just be bump textures.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.400
And now the goal is to push this egg sac idea as being the primary in the listeners and

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.400
readers minds.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.040
This is the same shit though.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.100
Like I don't understand how it is that you can have Eddie Page be a fucking moron and

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.000
everybody's like, nah, nah, nah.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Look at that idiot.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.240
He's talking about space.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.120
But then you let Mike Adams talk about microbes.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.120
Fuck my, it's just, it's a difference of big versus small, it's the macro versus the micro.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.120
It's stupid.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.120
Fine.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120
It's the same shit.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120
You're not wrong.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.080
This is essentially what I would call self-driven narrative escalation that Mike is engaging

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.080
in.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.880
In the first instance, you implant the idea that something might be really suspicious

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.880
or there might be a totally normal explanation for it.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.060
When you touch back on the idea, the normal explanation is gone and the speculation entirely

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.600
revolves around the suspicious possibility where the burden of the conversation becomes

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.340
disproving that this is an egg sac instead of the responsibility of being on Mike to

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.680
prove that it's not a bump.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.520
That's basically the propagandist magic trick that they're playing, where the burden of

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.200
proof is ignored and made your problem instead of theirs.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.200
Yeah.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.140
Without using this rhetorical trick and ones like it, people like Alex and Mike's game

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.440
would collapse immediately because they can't defend anything that they say to any kind

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.920
of reasonable standard of proof.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.200
The pope was arrested a year ago, it's a fake pope.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.200
Prove me wrong.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.200
Sure.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:08.080
Now, you'll recall that it was over for humanity and there would only be lone survivors.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.680
I do recall that.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.760
I feel like we are some of the few people who recall that and many people just ignore

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.760
it.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.280
You might also recall that Mike Adams was absent from Infowars for months because he

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.960
and Alex disagreed on whether or not COVID was real.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960
It does.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.780
It did seem that there was a disagreement there.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.040
And also I think he was advocating that people take veterinary products.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.040
Well, there's an issue.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.000
But anyway, here's Mike's new thing.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.140
Fish penicillin's regular penicillin, man.

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.140
Here's Mike's new bullshit.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.340
I want to say something really important here.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:45.380
If they had done nothing, no vaccines, no masks, no lockdowns, no social distancing,

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:49.820
this thing would have already been over because natural innate immunity would have already

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.080
conquered this.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080
Okay.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.080
All right.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.080
Great.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.600
6.30, about to start my day.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.040
What could I say to Alex Jones that would make Jordan want to buy a flamethrower?

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.900
I'll write something out.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.040
Maybe I'll just improv it.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.400
Maybe I'll just come off the top, right off the dome.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.400
Guess what?

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.400
Here's what it is.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.120
Everything I've ever said is a lie, and I believe the opposite now.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
So it was over for humanity.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
There would only be lone survivors.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
And he knew that.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.560
But now if we'd done nothing, then everything would be fine now.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.560
Yep.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.560
Cool.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560
That really is something that should-

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.560
That's frustrating.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.800
That really is something that should get you...

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.320
That should be more against the law than yelling fire in a movie theater.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.320
You can't do that.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320
You just can't.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.160
I just think everybody should boo Mike Adams everywhere.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.800
He should be booed all the time.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.160
But that's why he lives on a ranch, so we can't boo him.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.840
There is a reason that rich people avoid poor people, yes.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840
Too much booing.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840
Yeah.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:50.000
So I think that Mike, his progression from the initial article where he posted these

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.840
pictures to the Monday blog post that overhyped and escalated things, I thought that was pretty

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.840
irresponsible.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840
Sure.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.800
And now if you listen to this, his appearance on Alex's show is going to be taking things

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.920
even a step further.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.120
It's mind-blowing, Alex.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:12.520
There are little hooks, there are little gripper fibers, red and blue fibers in these masks

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.280
and in the nasal swabs.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.920
I did ultraviolet photography, I did iodine staining on some of them to show the contrast.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.920
It is mind-blowing what's in these masks, and this is all getting inhaled into your

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.140
lungs and the little hooks are grabbing onto your lung tissue.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:33.520
These things are designed to cause harm, not to help, and they do not block virus transmission.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.940
So that's kind of the summary of where we are, Alex, right now.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.680
So in the original post with the pictures, the game was asking questions.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.920
It even ends with a declaration that, quote, we don't know all the answers.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.200
It's all about making you worried about microscopic images and speculating about what they could

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.680
be while hiding behind a very clear statement that we don't know what these things are.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.700
Then, by Monday, Mike's tone had changed.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.240
Gone was the declaration that the answers are still unclear, and in its place was this

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:05.080
declaration, quote, it's clear that the masks and swabs are transferring materials to the

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.760
body, not merely sampling materials or filtering materials.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.080
In other words, masks and swabs are themselves medical interventions with unknown health

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.880
consequences.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.240
It seems like, with no new information and no real explanation at all, Mike had gone

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.440
from questioning to definitively stating things.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.000
And now, here he is on Alex's show escalating these definitive statements that he can't

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.800
back up at all.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.000
This is how the game is played for these people.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.800
They're liars, and their lies escalate, because that's how you continue to profit off them.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:39.200
It's a well-established game that they've played many, many times, and we've watched.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Oh boy.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200
I...

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200
Flammethrower?

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:51.800
I just want to find them in a restaurant and scream at them.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.440
Like I really don't know how loud I could honestly...

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.920
That's why it's a priority for right-wing propagandists to learn how to cook.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.480
It's one of those things, Dan, where everybody knows I'm very loud.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.760
But because I'm very loud, I have no idea what the ceiling is.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.760
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.760
I really don't know.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.760
You don't know your fastball.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.760
Yeah.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.840
If I could really let loose, I would like to know how loud I could be.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:18.180
And if I saw one of these people in a restaurant, I think we might discover it.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.080
It's like in Mortal Kombat, being pushed to your limit to find your superpower.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080
Exactly.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.080
Yeah, I have to find my superpower.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.680
I have to grow mechanical arms.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.680
You'll turn into Banshee.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.680
That's what I gotta do.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.800
So, you know, we got people getting vaccinated.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.740
Mike says, don't do it.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.740
Don't do it.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.740
Don't.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.740
Sure.

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.740
Sure.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:40.040
Because apparently there's going to be a dying off of vaccinated people in the fall

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040
or something.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
Fine.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.160
It's over for humanity who got vaccinated.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.160
There will only be non-vaccinated people.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.160
Fine.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160
Yep.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160
That's kind of it now.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160
Yeah.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.400
Alex, you're going to see the hospitals in the fall or the winter probably filled with

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.840
people who are dying from this antibody dependent enhancement side effect of the vaccine.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.520
And they're going to say it's a new COVID variant and not even point out that it's not

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.520
vaccinated.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.520
You nailed it.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.540
They're going to blame the unvaccinated for that wave.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:09.980
But if you check, it's only going to be people who have been vaccinated that are in the hospitals

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:10.980
at that time.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.700
And they're going to be dying in waves.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.160
It's not a good situation.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.440
This is part of the depopulation agenda.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.960
This is going to play out over the next two to three years.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.760
And people who have already been vaccinated, there is no undo, sadly.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760
There's no undo.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.840
Listeners, let me just tell you this.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.720
My spirit, my instinct, my intellect says, get to the country.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720
Get dug in now.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.720
I've waited too long.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.720
I've been so busy on air.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720
I haven't done it.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.260
Go away some in the next few months because I have to get ready.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.120
I mean, it's a miracle if it doesn't go to the next stage.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.800
Bill Gates and the UN have set things in motion now that I don't think they can turn off,

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800
Mike.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800
Yeah.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.400
You can't turn this back.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.400
Okay.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.160
I guess when you're wrong, this'll be over for humanity.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:58.520
I just get, I get so frustrated with this bunker and whether or not it's set up because

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.200
it keeps changing.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.760
It's either set up or I haven't finished it yet.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:07.560
I've been prepared for five years or yeah, it's full of survival food for me and my family

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.560
are going to be great.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.560
We'll be fine now.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.360
Also, sometimes things are just so bad that I've got to take off the work to build a bunker.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360
Of course.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.040
I think he's fucking with people.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040
It's insane.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.520
Also, if he's taking off time in the near future, I would suspect that it's not because

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.040
of bunker preparation.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040
It's lawyers.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.040
I would think maybe that's more likely.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:33.100
It's fun how it's almost like a glitch in humanity where we never really think about

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:39.440
how much we rely on shame just to like live in a society to the point where if you have

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:42.400
no shame, it's almost like a glitch in the matrix.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.560
Like you can just get away with anything because people just assume that a human being, if

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.960
they said it's over for humanity, there will only be lone survivors and then was so wrong,

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.120
they didn't get to go back on the show for a while for them to come back and make a similar

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.040
claim in the opposite direction.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.000
A human being would feel shame over this.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.360
You would think that somebody would be able to regulate themselves to the point of like,

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.680
I should just stop.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.800
Listen, I've been too wrong.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.480
It's just too much.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.600
Yeah, because I think that if you were that wrong, the correct response would be to reflect

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.760
on it and to be like, why was I that wrong?

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.760
What is it about my method of finding information and discerning truth?

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.260
What is it about that that was so wrong?

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.800
Is it that I don't have a process?

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800
Yeah.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.800
Oh no.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800
That's a problem.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800
Yeah.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.960
You know what happens when you're making one of those papers for a school, or let's go

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:47.120
with earlier, the Stanford situation, they felt shame having their name attached to it.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.280
They were like, we can't be a part of this and we can't let it happen.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280
Right.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.280
Because they weren't.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.280
Because they weren't.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280
Yeah.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.000
So for no reason, Mike gets pretty shitty here.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Sure.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Well, right.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.680
I believe the rapper DMX did die from the COVID vaccine that was then diagnosed as a

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.680
heart attack, right?

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:10.120
This would be an appropriate time for you to bark.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120
Yeah.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.120
Go fuck yourself, man.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.000
Get his name out of your mouth.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Yeah.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.480
Get his name out of your mouth.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.520
This is something that went around on social media, but there's no evidence that DMX got

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.800
the COVID vaccine.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.080
And even if he did, which they don't even know, there's no way you could prove that

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.280
it contributed or caused his death.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280
This is just disgraceful.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.800
Anyway, we have one last clip of Mike and he can fuck himself and I hope he's gone for

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800
long times.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.360
Just to kind of wrap up my appearance on your show today, this is an extermination agenda.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.840
They will come for you sooner or later if they haven't already.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.800
You need to get out of the blue cities, get out of the blue states, get to someplace where

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.880
you can have some self-reliance.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.200
You need to get real assets because an economic collapse is coming.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.880
They're going to confiscate all the dollars in bank accounts.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.720
Oh, that was my next point.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720
Get scared of everything.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.840
Get out of the cities.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.640
Get all the money is gone.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640
Go fuck yourself.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640
Wow.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.960
So this episode started with Alex saying that he was going to switch it up.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960
Sure, sure.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960
Did not.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:13.960
No.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.960
Didn't take any calls.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.960
Nope.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.040
Talked to a dumb idiot named Mike Adams.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040
Yep.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.640
Complained very racistly about the Oscars.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640
You got it.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.880
And lied about human tragedy in a foreign country for his own profit.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.320
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.280
That's a real, that's a real, what would you call that?

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.280
Triple crown?

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.240
I would say, would you say he hit for the cycle on that one?

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240
No.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240
No.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.240
So we get to the 27th and Alex starts up and a totally different man, totally different

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.240
vibe.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.240
This is going to be an incredibly jam-packed historic transmission.

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.280
I know how to defeat the globalist.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.000
I've done deep research and I've had major epiphanies in the last 24 hours.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.320
I'm going to do my best to lay it all out today.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.440
Major epiphanies in the last 24 hours.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.440
You know, you can't go from opening your show with Unabomber to then being like, the next

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.920
day, I've had some major epiphanies.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.280
Because that makes me feel like you've just escalated your Unabomber plan and you're feeling

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.280
better about it.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.120
Well, it makes me wonder if like, what's the epiphany?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.880
Because he keeps doing this.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.040
Blow up universities and airports?

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.280
He keeps doing this.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.920
It's nonsense.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.480
So many shows begin with, I had a vision last night and then it never comes.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.560
Spoiler alert, there is no epiphany.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:40.200
You know, something that really should be more annoying is that how often he says that

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.000
he's transcended things and that he's above it or all of that stuff.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.320
It's like, you realize that by any definition of transcending, you would not be doing your

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.320
show.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.320
Right.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.320
You would have stopped.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.320
Because you're above it.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.320
Yes.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320
That's the point.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.320
That's how it works.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.480
You're like so bothered by petty little things.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.000
So bothered by Regina King at the Oscars giving a speech.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.480
I've transcended everything except for white identity fear and victimhood.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:16.780
Like Gautama wasn't sitting underneath a goddamn tree being like, oh man, Derek at the office

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.220
is a real fucking dick.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.220
That's where you're wrong.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.220
He was.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:21.220
Okay, well that's fair.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.220
Nevermind.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.220
So anyway, we have big news, man.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.560
That's why this is such a big show.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560
Sure.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.560
So here we are.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:33.840
I'm going to be very calm here because this is so important and so huge and so illegal

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:41.360
and so over the top that if we just put this information out there, it'll become normalized.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.780
We must soak the sin.

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.120
We must cogitate on it.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.960
We must mold around psychologically, spiritually.

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:54.320
We should pray about this because this is all now revealing itself.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.320
It's coming out in the open.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.520
I want to beat up whoever taught him the word cogitate.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.520
It's really annoying.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520
Yeah.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520
Yeah.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.360
So anyway, we got big news and when I was listening to this, I was like, all right,

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.360
hit me.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.360
I'm ready.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.360
Totally.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360
Come at me.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360
Come at me.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:19.360
Just in one stack, one stack of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:32.000
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, one inch tall stack of 24 stacks.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:41.520
This is just today's news is so mind blowing, so key, so important that I shutter at even

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.320
trying to properly document it.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:51.840
So I, I will just direct you in this segment to what the big stories are in my view, and

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.960
then I will humbly try to cover it as best I can.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.120
And then we got big guests coming up as well.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.120
Oh boy.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.520
Oh boy.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.740
That's really become his like tonight show.

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.120
We've got a great show for you tonight.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.180
We're the big shoe.

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.840
They all can't be great, man.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.240
They all can't be great.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.240
Okay.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.240
It's fine.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240
It's fine.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.240
We've got a good show for you tonight.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.240
That's fine.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.240
You're a night show.

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.320
I've noticed that I have this little tick where I say that things are interesting and

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.800
a part of that is because I do think a lot of this stuff is interesting, but I do realize

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.960
that at a certain point I'm saying everything is interesting and maybe, well, that's fair.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:29.040
Maybe that's not, but for Alex, it's, it's, I have news that will shake the foundations

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040
of reality.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.920
I mean, it seems almost easy to point this out, but if you weren't interested in it,

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.920
it wouldn't be in the show.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920
That's true.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.960
But it is still a little bit redundant.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.960
That's fair.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.120
So here's the first story that Alex gets to, because I was just like, all right, let's,

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.120
let's do this, man.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.320
You have 24 stacks of news, come on, rapid fire, baby.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.240
We go out and tell them, Hey, the mask are never coming off until you say no, that gives

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.700
you bacterial pneumonia.

01:15:54.700 --> 01:16:01.760
It psychologically screws up children and it doesn't protect you.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.560
And Carlson is now saying that you need to go out and just like you see somebody beating

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:13.560
their kid at Walmart need to say, Hey, you need to stop that by frankly, you're their

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.560
parent.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.560
The kid's out of control.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560
Maybe they need a good spat.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560
Maybe he's being too liberal there.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:23.600
The point is this is child abuse more like you see somebody breaking the skin at Walmart.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.600
Okay.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.560
Alex trying to equivocate about, uh, beating the kids at Walmart.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560
All right.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:34.360
It is so easy to see how quickly the party of personal responsibility turns into the

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.960
party of fascist Lee attack children because their parents can't take care of them.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.200
They're wearing a mask.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.200
Yeah.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.200
Stop them from wearing masks.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200
Yeah.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.200
Yeah.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.200
Yeah.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.200
Go into other people's lives.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.720
The party of personnel responsibility.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.720
Sure.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.720
Yeah.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720
Uh, yeah.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.200
So the first story is the Tucker is anti mask.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.200
Great.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.200
Okay.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.200
Here's the second story.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.200
Sure.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.880
Here's the big super Supreme enchilada.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:07.200
Is that two enchiladas medical doctors all over the world from Germany to Canada that

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:14.480
are being arrested by the police that's coming up German police ransacked the house of doctor

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.720
after he provides evidence in court, the children are endangered in their mental, physical and

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.800
spiritual wellbeing by the obligation to wear a face mask.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:30.640
This headline appears on a page on the website, daily general news.com whatever the fuck that

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.640
is.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.640
All right.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.920
I know that I need to go to the general to get some insurance or something.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.680
But also one of the problems is that this webpage is no longer there.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.580
It's a four Oh four page doesn't exist.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:44.580
That's a problem.

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.200
There's no snapshot of it in the way back machine.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.640
And I find all of this quite suspicious.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.640
Interestingly, I found an article on gateway pundit.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:56.580
That's clearly about the same story, but with a slightly different headline, quote German

01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:01.140
police ransack the home of judge after he agrees with evidence in court that children

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.800
are endangered in their mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing by the obligation to wear

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.800
face masks.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.800
Yeah.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.440
You notice the difference now longer physician.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:09.840
Now it's judge.

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:10.840
Yeah.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.400
That's no, I think police should raid.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400
Police should raid that.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400
Yeah.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.280
There are news sources on this that I actually find credible about the story, but the narrative

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.840
is presented on gateway pundit type outlets is that this judge named Christian Detmer

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:28.560
had his house rated as retaliation for ruling the COVID-19 related cautionary measures like

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.160
masks could not be enforced in schools.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.800
It is only related to two schools in this area.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.200
It does seem like this ruling did happen.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.680
I think I, I can be comfortable with some of the books that I've seen on that.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.120
Although the impact and the scope of its applicability, or if it would stand up to a hearing in a

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.960
higher court, that remains an open question.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.960
Sure.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960
Sure.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.400
I can't find any information about a possible raid that I feel comfortable believing someone

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.480
to suspend judgment on this until there's more details.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.360
That said, Alex is telling the wrong version of this story.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.320
He said it's a doctor who provided evidence when the story is that it's a judge who handed

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.840
down the opinion in the case, who ignored evidence.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.880
I suspect one of Alex's interns found the story on a site like daily general news before

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.200
it was spun correctly.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.240
So he's reporting the wrong version of the story here.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.480
That's that's kind of what I think.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.280
So that's the big supermassive enchilada.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.280
Great.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:26.580
Isn't that such like a small emblem of his worldview of just like, this is happening

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.840
all around the world from Canada to Germany.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840
Yeah.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Yeah.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:31.840
And you're like, okay.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:32.840
I cannot think of third country.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.840
All right, buddy.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:39.240
So, uh, here's the, what's another great, uh, this is the chilaquiles right here.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:43.360
Joe Biden announced yesterday, he's going to send aid to India.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.360
It's not vitamin C.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.180
It's not vitamin D.

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:47.980
It's not an end of the lockdown.

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.800
It's not zinc.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.080
It's not even oxygen bottles.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.860
When any medical doctor in the Indians aren't stupid, they are you talking about space balls

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:02.200
because the population is so huge that you can do inhaled steroid and a hundred percent

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.320
of the time helps you knocks it out.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.200
They're not telling them any of that.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:13.160
They're shipping them tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.000
That's even banned in the U S is not authorized in the U S Biden's going to dump Europe's

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.300
banned vaccine on the Indian total war crime.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.960
First things first, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine was actually developed by the serum

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.040
Institute of India and is produced there under the name COVID shield.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.880
That vaccine has always been approved for use in India and India.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.160
Wasn't one of the countries that suspended it.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:39.560
The reason we're sending a bunch to India is because in order to make sure the vaccines

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:44.120
could get made countries like the United States agreed to purchase a ton of them in advance

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.960
along the way, various countries got to decide which they would approve for use in their

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.160
country and it resulted in the situation we're in now where we have a ton of doses of the

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.020
AstraZeneca vaccine, but it's not approved for use in the United States.

01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:00.080
It is effective and India can use it and they've chosen it's one of their approved vaccine.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.120
So it makes sense to send it to them as opposed to letting it go to waste.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.600
This could do that fake laughing nonsense all he wants, but this is not the story.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:13.120
It's not what he's making it, but we have one more.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:18.640
Also it's just to be clear, it is not like they're putting them all in boxes right now

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.400
and they're like getting all these little vials and millions of vials and all these

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.760
big boxes they're going to put up on a ship that's yeah, these, it expires.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.880
They don't even exist yet, you know, like, okay, all right, man, come on.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:37.720
So if that was the chilaquiles, then what do we got a chile relleno another dish schools

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:43.720
around the world are banning people working there who've taken the experimental MRNA gene

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:48.900
therapy because it can cause the spread of real viruses.

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:53.820
That's even your precious wall street journal and NPR reporting that.

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:58.280
So it's a big, big, big deal, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.280
This isn't true.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.800
There was one school in Miami called the Centner Academy that's banned vaccinated teachers

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.680
from interacting with students.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.200
It's a private school that was opened in 2019 that appears to be run by nuts.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.960
So I'm not too surprised here, but it's pretty funny that Alex is exaggerating this

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.480
into a phenomenon where all over the world schools are banning vaccinated teachers.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.480
Ridiculous.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.480
Wow.

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.480
Yeah, man, you can just be a dumb dumb anywhere and Alex will find you.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:30.080
So we had, uh, our boy, the health ranger on the last episode and now we got another,

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080
how are we going to up the game?

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080
Oh, we got a ding dong.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.080
Okay.

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:40.840
Well, ladies and gentlemen, he has been banned off of the internet as we know it, except

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.640
for his own site, which is still very popular.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.880
It makes them mad.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.120
So he's not banned off the internet as we know it.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.120
Uh, yeah.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.400
I mean, he still has a verified account on Twitter.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.800
It seems like he's very not banned on the internet as we know it if his own page is

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.800
up.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.800
Yeah.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.800
So I checked that and it's still up there verified.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.800
Sure.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.080
And while I was confirming that I checked out his pin tweet, which was captioned video

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.440
proof that I'm on a no fly list.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.200
Uh, my experience of this is a little bit different.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.200
Okay.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:09.800
Here's a little clip that made me like, I don't know.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.440
And there's no way I could get on this plane.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.000
No, you cannot allow, they're not letting you fly with Southwest.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
With Southwest.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
But maybe Delta, maybe.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I'm not sure.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Okay.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I know that was a TSA number.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I'm not sure if you're blocking off just the no flight list.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Did they give you a reason?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
No.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
It's a no fly list you said?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I'm not sure.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Oh, okay.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.400
So that's from Nick's video.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.400
Proof!

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.400
Here's Alex's coverage.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400
Okay.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.400
So the truth gets out when you speak out and you take action.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:44.400
Here's the article from info awards.com breaking America first founder, Nick Fuentes put on

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.160
no fly list.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.320
And they told him why.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.920
You were at the Capitol, not even in the Capitol.

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.880
See now they've arrested 500 that went in now.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.680
So the video that Nick Fuentes posted of himself at the airport doesn't show them saying why

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.640
or even that he is on a no fly list.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640
Was that?

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640
Weird.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640
It's weird.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640
It's weird.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.960
The proof that is being presented doesn't seem to, it seems like it's bullshit.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.960
Wait.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.760
So the time that I saw all that trending nonsense about Fuentes is on a no fly list for sure.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:18.280
Is that what that's all based off of?

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280
What?

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.240
That, that, that he's on a no fly list.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.240
His own video?

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.240
Um, yeah.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.880
And I guess he, we'll, we'll talk about it a little bit more.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880
Okay.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.920
He was trying to go down to a DeSantis rally in Florida and he wasn't allowed to fly.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.400
And there are some better theories as to why.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.400
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.400
And we'll get to that once Nick's on the show.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400
Okay.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.400
Okay.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.740
But Alex has to spread some other bullshit first.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:43.720
They're intimidating going to witnesses in the Chauvin trial and throwing pig blood on

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.040
what they thinks their house at pig heads and going to the jurors houses.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.760
We now learned somebody had leaked it.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:53.520
That's why they voted and went along with the mob, intimidating him, whether you think

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.680
show almost guilty or not.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:55.680
He's got to go free.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.720
I don't care if he's black or white because of that.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.200
Alex has this story completely wrong.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:04.620
I've still seen no evidence of any jury intimidation in the Chauvin case, but Alex is specifically

01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:09.020
lying about one comment that was reported where someone referred to as a Chauvin juror

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:12.640
said, quote, I did not want to go through all the rioting and destruction again.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.960
I was concerned about people coming to my house.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.320
If they were not happy with the verdict, liars like Jack Pessobek started passing it along

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.320
on social media.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.120
And the story spread pretty far that way.

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.640
And it's almost certainly what Alex is covering as real news here.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:30.360
The problem is that this person wasn't a jury and the juror in the trial, she was an alternate

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.640
juror who played absolutely no role in the deciding of the case.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.100
And the comment was taken out of context.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.320
The full context of that quote is her response to a question posed by a local Minneapolis

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:46.260
news outlet about whether or not she wanted to be a juror, quote, I had mixed feelings.

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:50.020
There was a question on the questionnaire about that, and I didn't know because the

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:53.700
reason at that time was obviously I didn't know what the outcome was going to be.

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:57.240
So I felt like either way, the outcome was you're going to disappoint one group or the

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.240
other.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.640
So I didn't want to go through this whole rioting and destruction again.

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:04.480
And, you know, a little concerned about people outside my house if they weren't happy with

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.480
the verdict.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480
Sure.

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.120
She was just discussing the idea of whether or not she wanted to be a juror at the time.

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.800
And totally reasonable fears, too.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.760
Yeah, and this has been twisted by liars like Jack Pessobic and being misreported by Alex

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:22.080
in order to try and argue for getting Chauvin freed.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080
Of course.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080
Because of course.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.080
Yeah, naturally.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:30.280
So we get to Nick Fuentes, and I just do that because Alex likes to pronounce his name with

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.920
that hard U in there.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:32.920
Fuentes.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:33.920
Fuentes.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:39.240
And he's going to tell a story of what happened to him at the airport.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.060
And I will say that, I don't know, I don't know if this did happen.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:46.040
It's certainly not in the video labeled proof that I'm on a no fly list.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.360
If this is his proof, you'd think it would be in the video.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.640
Well, his story, it sounds like the story that someone like him would tell, but it certainly

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.840
doesn't match that video.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.840
Wow.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:59.000
Because she said, you know, is there anything that might be causing this?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Is it a mask thing?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.480
Did you have an incident on American before?

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.120
I said, no, nothing like that.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.640
Never any issues like that on American Airlines.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.600
And you know, I've been flying pretty recently.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.480
She said, OK, well, I'll give them another call.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.720
And they relayed the same message.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.040
I'm not able to fly.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.880
And I said, well, you know, honestly, it's political.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.280
I said, I'm a political guy.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.520
I said, I think it's political.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.680
And she goes, she goes, I'm not supposed to say this, but I think this woke stuff is out

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.680
of control.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.160
I don't think it's fired, but they're pushing this on the corporations.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.320
So, you know, she was even sympathetic.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.320
Yeah, sure.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.040
These people are psycho.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.040
These are absolute psychos.

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.600
This is that Jacob Wall at the coffee shop kind of nonsense.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:37.600
Absolute lunatics.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.600
Yeah.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.680
So this is not in the video, but this is the story.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.600
He goes, he talks to these people and they say, no, you cannot fly.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.080
So he goes, he goes to United.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.080
And guess what?

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.080
This isn't in the video either, because he was talking to someone from Southwest.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.520
Yeah, it does seem like he was talking to somebody from Southwest.

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.680
I went over to United.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.320
I went all the way over to the other terminal.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.760
I booked the same flight, you know, 1040 a.m. to Palm Beach from O'Hare.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.680
I went up to the counter and she told me the exact same thing.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.560
She was on the phone with the TSA for a half hour, said, nope, I'm sorry.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.800
And she goes, and you know what?

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.160
I just Googled you.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.560
And I think I know why that is.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.560
That's what she said.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:14.640
He goes, and I'm so sorry, but but there's nothing I could do.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.560
I said, OK, is there anyone I could talk to?

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.700
Can I go to the TSA?

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:20.040
She goes, nope, nobody could talk to.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040
That's it.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.920
So I'm on the no fly list.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:26.240
And and it has to do with the Capitol on January 6th.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.240
OK.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.240
I don't see any indication that any of this is real.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.400
This is all just being suggested.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.400
Nope.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.920
A bunch of nonsense.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.000
No, but I should get a text alert if I know he's in Chicago.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
He lives in Chicago.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I know.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.760
But like where I can find him, you know, like in public, you know what I'm saying?

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:51.000
Like I only because Amazon Prime is sending me something right now and you know what I'm

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
saying?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I'm not going to say what it is.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Amazon Prime.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I only agree with this.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.880
If the only use of that information is avoiding wherever exactly, I would absolutely avoid

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.560
it with the thing that I am going to like this kind of talk, man.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.560
Oh, come on.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.200
So Alex recaps Nick's story.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.840
And I will say there are two giant assumptions in here.

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:12.840
Recap.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.440
You've been put on a no fly list.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:18.600
They admitted it's because you weren't simply covering the Capitol.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.600
So no fly list and because you were covering the Capitol.

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.600
Right.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.600
Those are the assumptions.

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:24.600
Right.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.740
There's no reason to suspect that Nick is on a no fly list because of the events of

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:27.960
January 6th.

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:33.880
A lot of folks might have forgotten by now, but in December 2020, Nick made a big deal

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.540
online about getting kicked off a plane for not wearing his mask correctly and told the

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:42.000
guy on the plane, fuck you and eat shit.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.160
That might have something to do with it.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.160
Yeah.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.320
You remember in that first clip that Nick was talking, he's like, is this something

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.320
to do with masks?

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.320
Yeah.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.560
It's obviously because you got kicked off a plane six months ago.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.560
Obviously.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.160
I don't know if he's on a no fly list.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.880
I would assume he's not, since the simpler explanation is that he's a public figure who

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.660
made a big deal out of an altercation he initiated on a plane like six months ago.

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.660
As a stunt?

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:05.660
Yeah.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:07.360
So I would say that maybe airlines are like, nah.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.360
Hey, fuck you.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.360
Yeah.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.360
How about that?

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:15.440
Even if it wasn't on my airline, I would maybe not let him on based on that sort of public

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:16.440
incident.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.440
I don't want to deal with that.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.440
I don't know.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.120
You have the right to refuse service to an asshole.

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.000
So why would you want that?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Even the possibility of that happening again, especially if you know that he's a provocateur.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Yeah.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.120
And him trying to pretend that that didn't happen is really funny.

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.120
Yeah.

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.480
Him trying to be like, oh, is there a mask thing?

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.480
No.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.480
No.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.480
It must be the January capital six.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.480
It must be that right.

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480
Yeah.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.480
So anyway, fuck him.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.480
Fuck him.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.480
In this next clip, Alex channels Reagan in a very inspirational way.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.480
Sure.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:55.640
Ronald Reagan back in 1989, right as he was leaving office, said, Mr. Gorbachev, tear

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:57.440
down that wall.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:05.160
Well, I say, like he said in 88 was the year, not Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:10.880
I say, puppet Biden, tear off that mask off your dirty bandit face.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.680
Don't think that's going to resonate through time.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:18.120
No, just as inspiring, just as inspiring that is going to be one of those, you know, in

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.620
those montages where they do like, oh, the greatest generation kind of shit.

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:26.040
And they go through all of that and they go through the big moments of history that is

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:32.000
going 50 years from now, 50 years from now, that will be in the real show me your dirty

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
bandit face.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I could see it.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Things go wrong.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I could see it.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yeah.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.680
So Alex at this point talks to a Canadian preacher who's had the police show up a couple

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.080
times because he's not following COVID restrictions.

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.080
It's not the same Canadian church that we talked about before.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.080
It's another one.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.640
I'm going to skip this because it's, it's, who cares?

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:58.760
It's another, if you're a preacher that goes on Infowars, you're a piece of shit.

01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:59.760
It's a bad sign.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.760
Yeah.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:01.760
You're a piece of shit.

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:06.200
So, uh, we, we have, uh, also Alex just getting into this weird thing where he's complaining

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:09.760
about the left and they're all, they're all demons now.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.600
I'll just go ahead and play it.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.600
Why not?

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:16.400
When I see the trendies with their mask and I see them with their hatred and their pedophilia

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.600
and I mean, cause they've converted a lot of the low level left into evil.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.100
Now, I mean, there used to be kind of high level of super evil than kind of mid level.

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:28.800
Now the average leftist is for all intents and purposes, a devil worshiping ghoul.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:33.380
I don't, I don't know what's happened to them, but they're gone folks.

01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:37.360
They're programmed by big tech, they're programmed by media and they're a small minority of people,

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.440
but they infest all the main cities.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:44.880
They command black lives matter, uh, and they command the Antifa and they're just gone.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:45.880
Yeah.

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.280
So, you know, even the low level, this is just trickling down.

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.960
It used to just be like the top level was, no, now we're all demons.

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.440
Every single one of us.

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.440
We're gone.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.640
There's nothing that can be done for us.

01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.080
There's nothing that can be done for us, Dan.

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.800
I don't know if you know what kind of language that might, you know.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.880
Boy, it doesn't, it's not reminiscent.

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:06.880
Nope.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.320
So, uh, at the beginning of this episode though, like Alex had such promise.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.320
He had an epiphany.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.280
He had 24 stacks of paper.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.280
Yeah.

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.920
I haven't gotten through one stack today of all I've got here.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.920
Shame.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.560
I mean, it's that much news.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.560
Who's hosting the fourth hour?

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.520
I may have to take it over.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.560
Oh, Paul Joseph Watson, I'll let him host.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:33.000
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this is genocide going on in front of everybody.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.880
By the way, if we don't fund ourselves, we won't be here.

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.120
So it's a win, win, win.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.120
Please support us at m4.com.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.120
We've got a lot of new, great t-shirts.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.760
Wonder why you didn't get through those 24 stacks.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.040
You know, at a certain point, I think you would recognize that like, all right, I'd

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.120
never get through the first stack.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:51.600
Only two stacks is the maximum.

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.520
Why do you have the other 22?

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.480
I mean, you know, everybody needs a little set deck.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.200
You're delusional if you think you're ever going to...

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:01.200
Let's go back to late night.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.320
Why do so many of them have that mic on the desk?

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:04.880
You know they're wearing lapel mics.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880
It's just set deck.

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.560
But it's like, okay, so you prepare a meal for yourself, right?

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.000
And every night you make 10 servings and you get through like three quarters of one and

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.580
then you're full and you throw away all that food.

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:20.240
And then the next day you're like, oh, I got all this food here.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.360
This is going to be great.

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.460
I got all this food.

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.720
You get through maybe half of a serving this time because maybe you're not as hungry that

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.720
night.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:33.600
Dan, there is a paper mill in Oregon that relies on Alex exclusively.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.920
That brings me to my next point.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.600
He better be fucking recycling.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.600
I doubt he is.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.600
Yeah, probably not.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.600
I doubt he is.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.960
So we have another guest here and it's another champion weirdo.

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.400
This guy, God damn, what a weirdo.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.480
I am Alex Jones, your host and the great Steve Quayle, best selling author, filmmaker, one

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:56.920
of the first big survivalists, one of the top survivalists.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.920
Top survivalists.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.840
And I would read his books 25 years ago, 20 years ago and say quite entertaining.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:07.040
And I knew a lot of it was true, but I thought some of the, some of the conclusions he came

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.880
to were a little extreme.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.920
Well now it looks like he's been dead on.

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.440
Oh, what are those extreme conclusions?

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440
Alex?

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.440
You want to talk about them?

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.440
Maybe they're giants.

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.440
You know what?

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.440
Here's my new pitch.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.440
Here's my new pitch, Dan.

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.440
All right.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:25.440
Before these assholes get to say a God damn word about being a survivalist, you have to

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.440
go on Naked and Afraid and win.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.640
You have to.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.640
That is it.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:34.120
If you call yourself a top survivalist and you have not been on Naked and Afraid, fuck

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.120
off.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.120
Get out of here.

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.120
I don't think Steve would make it.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.120
No, of course not.

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:43.480
So I love that Steve was on because I had been wanting to play this clip for you.

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.480
Sure.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.360
So Steve Quayle was recently on the Jim Bakker show and for just this clip, I was going to

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.360
make an episode out of it.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.600
You were going to do the whole thing?

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.120
Because it, but it's so boring.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.120
I couldn't do that.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:00.320
So thankfully, I listened to the whole episode and I didn't want to go back and find it.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:06.640
But thankfully Right Wing Watch had cut out this particular clip where, dude, get ready.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.580
Thank you Steve Quayle for giving us an excuse.

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:14.520
Mike down to have your mind blown by Jim Bakker and Steve Quayle.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:21.360
Zombies that are on the earth are a disease like any other disease that affects people

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.680
and they become like zombies.

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.120
Is that right?

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.400
Forgive me, but that's only part of the story.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:35.640
Zombies, zombies also have the evil spiritual entity known as demon possession, okay?

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.640
Because there is no rationale with a zombie.

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:46.040
The best way to explain zombies' bloodlust is this, the appetite of demons expressed

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.040
through humans.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.760
It should be astonishing to people that the richest people in the world, not all of them,

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:59.400
but some of them, are into occult ceremonies where they have to drink, you know, blood

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.000
that's extracted from a tortured child.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:08.400
Now that's sick, but that's the appetite of demons expressed through humans.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:16.080
The ancient world dealt with monsters, mythological and real, and this is something that is really

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.680
important to get through.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:25.800
The disease will basically destroy the human defenses.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.240
God gave us defenses as humans to resist the devil and he will flee.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:38.400
But when you're inviting, or what's the word I want, embracing abject demon possession,

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:46.760
giving yourself over to be inhabitant, to be inhabited by the demons who then become

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.360
your inhabitants, it's a twofold.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:55.160
What I'm saying, Jim, is they can induce zombieism, at least the appetite for human flesh.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:59.800
But at the end of the thing, it's both hands, right hand and left hand.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:07.160
And the left hand simply is the evil spiritual possession of that zombie.

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.600
So yeah, Steve Coyle just this month was on Jim Bakker's show talking about zombies.

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600
Wow.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600
Yeah.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:20.720
I do appreciate how much of Christianity does seem to get their idea of the world from like

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.720
the Hellblazer comics.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.520
Like John Constantine is also a factor in Jim Bakker's reality.

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.320
I would love that conversation taking place outside of a televangelist's studio.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.280
Yeah, that'd be fun.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.960
Discussing, what does make a zombie a zombie?

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.600
Like me and my friends could maybe have that conversation.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.040
That would be, I mean, yeah, you'd have to argue.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.920
What are the essential elements of a zombie?

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.720
I don't want Jim Bakker and Steve Coyle having that conversation.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:52.560
It'd be like a game of Scattergories, you'd have to argue your position on that, yeah.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.320
God, what a fucking weirdo.

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.800
But you're going to come, ugh.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.800
Zombies are among us, man.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.200
You're going to really come out and say, see, but you, shouldn't Christians all uniformly

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:10.560
be like, we can't be associated with this because if we really do allow zombies, people

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.080
are going to put that together with the rest of the bullshit we believe and they're going

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.240
to be like, maybe Christianity's stupid.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.680
Or that classical meme that Jesus is a zombie.

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:20.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:26.640
It's like, okay, if you start adding too many mythical elements into it, especially ones

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:29.840
that are referenced in Night of the Living Fucking Dead.

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:36.240
I would say that what your best order of business is, if you're a religion, don't incorporate

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.800
any universal monsters.

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.640
Uh-uh, no, no, no, no.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:40.640
No mummies.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.080
At no point in time should Jesus say, we're coming to get you, Barbara.

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.200
No Dracula.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.760
That's not going to happen.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760
Yeah.

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.560
So anyway, I don't respect Steve Coyle at all.

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.560
No.

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:56.040
Um, and so we just have a series of him saying things and talking to Alex that I have no

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.080
interest in treating as real.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.100
No, no even consideration.

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:03.680
You think zombies are real.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.680
The end.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.560
So anyway, the vaccine is part of a depopulation agenda.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.360
This is what's really important.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.800
Ladies and gentlemen, this is all about one thing.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:18.000
It's about the depopulation of the world from 7.9 billion to 500 million and that's where

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.600
we're at right now.

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.080
That's a reference to the Georgia Guidestones, which apparently, uh, Steve Coyle believes

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.600
are real and the globalists are, yep.

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:33.520
I do love how the globalists love a round number that's easy for ridiculous idiots to

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.520
understand.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:40.720
It's so convenient how ridiculous idiots are always given nice round numbers, you know?

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.720
It's great.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:42.720
It's great.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.480
So, uh, you know, Alex Jones likes to talk about interviews that he did years in the

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.920
past that no one can ever find.

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:47.920
Of course.

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:48.920
And certainly prove a lot of stuff.

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:49.920
Yep.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:50.920
Steve does too.

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.280
And actually I got the sense from listening to this that Alex's whole story about him

01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:00.320
seeing fish people with sad human eyes is a story he cribbed from Steve Coyle.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.880
You think he's stealing that story?

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.880
Oh no.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.960
Alex, I interviewed one of the Intel world's most famous assassins.

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.280
He died 15 years ago and he said, Steve, I've been in a laboratory, some of the most secret

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:21.040
places in the deep underwater, uh, in the jungles, uh, in, uh, Borneo, uh, the Island

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.040
of dr.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.040
Morello.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.920
And he said, I've seen, I've seen things in cages, half human, half lion, by the way,

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.340
the lion men of Moab is literally in the old Testament.

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.560
But he said, these creatures were calling out to me in a human voice, help me, help

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:36.560
me.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:37.560
I'm human.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.680
And he started to weep.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:39.680
This is a CIA guy.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:40.680
And he started to weep.

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:45.180
He says, Steve, they weren't human, but there was a human component that was begging me

01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.180
to help.

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:47.840
And there was no help for them.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.920
That stuff makes a stick in my spirit.

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:51.920
Okay.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920
Okay.

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.800
So your story that you're telling me one of the best assassins, one of the best assassins

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.280
for the CIA, someone who's the best at killing people.

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.280
Yes.

01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.280
And especially for the CIA.

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:09.680
So, you know, there's no morality within this person that cannot be, I wouldn't assume.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.280
So if the other details of the story are correct.

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:19.800
But his breaking point, or I don't, their breaking point was half man, half man, half

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.800
lion.

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:28.480
And by the way, no reason, no reason whatsoever, none to add in the lion men of Moab, because

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.880
these are genetically created now, not the lion men of Moab.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:38.080
They didn't like reconstitute the goddamn lion men from the Old Testament.

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.720
That might be part of his argument.

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.720
Okay.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720
I'm sorry.

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.720
So they discovered old lion man blood.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:50.960
I think that Steve's argument is that in biblical times before the flood, they were making human

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:51.960
animal hybrids.

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.320
See, that's kind of what I was thinking.

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.320
Yep.

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.320
And that history is repeating itself now.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.320
Right.

01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:58.320
Yep.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.320
That's where we're at.

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.320
Yeah.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.320
Yep.

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.320
So anyway.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320
You got to cop to this.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320
If you're a Christian, you got to cop to the lion men.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.440
You believe that lion men are real.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.440
The end.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.440
Cop to it.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.440
Okay.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:16.920
So look, there's some similarities between zombies and lion men already in Steve Quayles.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:17.920
Okay.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.920
And giants.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.920
Those are always in the background.

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.560
Well, giants were always in play.

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:27.600
So there are some similarities between what Steve believes and let's say ancient aliens.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.600
Sure.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.600
Could be.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.480
He thinks that there's a few differences.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.920
The difference between, let's say my position, the ancient aliens position is my position

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:42.320
is the fallen angels, a third of them basically had sex with earth women.

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:47.360
This is before Noah's flood and corrupt the entire gene pool on the planet.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.880
Now we are seeing in the book of Enoch that people used to say, was it true?

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.920
And then they try to suppress the Dead Sea Scrolls, but it got leaked out.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.360
I've talked to some of the folks that are involved and it's all in there.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.960
So they got 2000 year old scrolls saying that, wait, you talk to some people who are involved

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.760
in the leaking of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.760
What?

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.760
Oh boy.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:09.760
Okay.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.760
Yeah.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.760
So anyway, yes.

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.080
Where Steve breaks off from ancient aliens.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:21.720
I do love the combination of defensiveness and confidence in his position while saying

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:24.840
something so abjectly ridiculous.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:29.200
If you are trying to be taken seriously and you need to clarify your position against

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.480
the ancient aliens position, you're underwater, man.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.480
You're screwed.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.680
Look, these ancient aliens people are crazy.

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:41.480
They believe that before the flood, aliens came down and built the pyramids.

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.480
That's stupid.

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.480
See, what happened is before the flood, interdimensional angels came down and built the pyramids.

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:48.800
It's completely different.

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.400
I'm obviously right.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400
Sure.

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.400
Okay.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.760
So this fiddling around with human and animal hybrids and what have you, creating supermen

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:59.480
and sad human eyes, even assassins.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.440
So that was going on in olden times.

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.520
And it's going on again.

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:07.520
I'll just let this play.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:08.520
Okay.

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.520
Let's hear it.

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.520
Let's hear them out.

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.520
Let's hear them out.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:16.640
The Human Genome Project was to identify the DNA of the fallen angels.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.760
When they had sex with earth women, they produced a hybrid.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:25.320
Those hybrid became the mighty men of renown, the gods the ancient worlds worship.

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:30.780
And obviously now we're coming to that point where we're messing with genetics.

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:32.960
So I see you scribbling notes.

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:39.000
I just wanted to make sure that forever throughout all of history, written down in this notebook

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.440
is the Human Genome Project was about angels.

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.360
That's just what I wanted to be very clear and find the Nephilim DNA or whatever.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.720
I'm going to underline it.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.660
I'm going to make sure that no matter what happens, that's what it was all about, man.

01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:59.020
The Human Genome Project was trying to find Thor, it was trying to find Zeus, it's trying

01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:01.140
to find Heracles.

01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:02.360
It makes sense.

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:12.920
I really, really, like honestly, and I mean this with all none respect, this is sad even

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.520
for Alex to listen to.

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.520
Yeah.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.520
This is bad.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.520
It really is.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.520
Yeah.

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.260
Because it goes against his interdimensional theories.

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:25.160
I think that all of it's so nonspecific that you'd have a really hard time.

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160
You can fit it in somewhere.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.160
Yeah.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.160
I get you.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.160
I understand why you think it doesn't fit.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.080
I think that's a good, I think you should keep that in your back pocket.

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.040
I understand that because you work from sort of a grounded place of reality where things

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.040
mean things.

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.440
Or at least narrative consistency.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:42.440
Yeah.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.460
I think that they could make this work just because nothing matters.

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.460
That's fair.

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.160
When you have no shame, it's like a glitch in humanity.

01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:50.360
You can figure it out.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.360
Yep.

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.360
Yep.

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:56.280
So Steve is this guy who like, I really think that, I mean we've listened to him a little

01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:02.720
bit in the past and he has a worse version of thinking he's a prophet than Alex.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:03.720
Yeah.

01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:07.200
Like he legitimately is just like, I know all God.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:11.200
His whole story is that God gave him a vision of everything, but told him that he would

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.400
lock these things up until he needed to know them.

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.400
Yeah.

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:19.880
And this just is like, this clip I think is just a guy doing an impression of a prophet.

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:20.880
Wow.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:27.160
The day will come, mark my words, when even vitamins will be made illegal.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.080
Possession of vitamins, capital offense.

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.240
Possession of a Bible, capital offense.

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.600
Speaking the name of Jesus, capital offense.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600
You know, everything is going to be a capital offense.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.600
I'd be fucked.

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.600
Here's what it boils down to, Alex.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.040
Anybody but them are scheduled to be terminated.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.040
Terninated.

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:44.040
Terninated!

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.880
I would like to mark his words about possession of vitamins becoming a capital offense.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:49.880
B12!

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.360
Get it out of here!

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360
Kill him!

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360
Summary execution.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.360
Kill him!

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.360
If you have riboflavin.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.800
What about vitamins and just food?

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.240
No, you can't have it.

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.240
No.

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:03.120
Are you talking about regulations for the supplement industry?

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.280
I think that's what you're talking about, and I think that's something that terrifies

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.120
you more than anything in the world.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:10.200
It's a little bit different.

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.200
Yeah.

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.380
So anyway, this was a nonsensical interview with a lunatic who has a bunch of really stupid

01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:16.680
ideas about dumb shit.

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.960
The Human Genome Project, Dan, was about angels.

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.960
Great.

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:21.960
Also, zombies.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.900
A group of scientists got together and they were like, listen, we can't not know about

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:31.060
these angels who fucked women in the past to create Thor.

01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:32.720
We just can't not know.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.240
So these zombies are also in play.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:36.240
Sure, of course.

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:37.240
And all this is great.

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.240
Yeah.

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:41.640
But I think there might be ulterior motives to this interview.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:42.640
Oh yeah?

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:48.040
When I heard this clip, mic down for this, because when I heard this, I took off my headphones

01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.040
and walked out of the room.

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.380
I was just like, go fuck yourself.

01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.040
So Steve Quayle, I know you want to talk about the Infowars phone here briefly.

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.120
I just want to thank you.

01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:58.640
You knew that we were having trouble funding ourselves.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.840
You said, listen, this is one of the best deals that the sponsors have had for many

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:02.840
years.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.640
You tried to get me to give them as a sponsor years ago.

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:05.640
We did it.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640
The listeners love it.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:07.640
I didn't realize it's one of the best deals out there.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.920
Just let me tell people about it briefly.

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:10.920
It's not why you're here.

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.800
I just mentioned a new function that you were excited about.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.800
Oh sure, sure.

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.000
Sure, that's not why you're here?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.560
You got me a satellite phone sponsor, that's not why you're here, talking about your

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.600
dumbass ideas about the genome project.

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.600
Wow.

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:29.080
Wow, Alex, you're really willing to let him go that long just so he can sell a satellite

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:30.080
phone for you.

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.080
Yep.

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.080
Ooh, that's not good.

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.080
Yep.

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:36.600
I don't know what the deal is here with this phone exactly, but there's the website

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:43.040
infowarsphone.com and it redirects to a website satellite phone store.

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.240
I don't know if they have an Infowars promotion going on, but if they do, they're keeping

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.360
Infowars and Alex's name the fuck off it.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:49.360
Yeah, that would make sense.

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.360
I would do that too.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.360
Yeah.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.360
I don't know what's going on.

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:56.040
I guess Steve Quayle got him a sponsor and now, yeah.

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:59.760
That must have been a really rough marketing meeting for that company whenever they're

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:05.280
getting together, having like, okay.

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:11.440
I have, I got Alex on the hook for about 5K.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.480
Alex Jones from Infowars.

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.200
Are we there yet?

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200
Are we that far down?

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:18.200
Revenue is negative 10 billion.

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:19.200
Yes.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200
We'll take anything.

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.200
Yeah.

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.200
That's the only explanation.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.200
Yeah, it's outrageous.

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:28.280
Although, I do think that there's a certain delicious humor of the trajectory of that

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.280
interview.

01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.280
That's true.

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.920
Just saying these stupidest shit, the one where even you are feeling bad for Alex sitting

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:35.920
through this.

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.920
That is really sad.

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.600
And then the payoff, of course, is you got me a sponsor.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.800
Oh, I really, really feel bad.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.800
Yep.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.880
I wonder if you got Jim Bakery that satellite phone sponsor.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.880
That would make sense.

01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.880
Man.

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:48.920
That would explain his recent air time.

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:49.920
He's a middle man.

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:50.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:51.920
Yeah.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:52.920
Hey, I get you this.

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:53.920
You get me some air time.

01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.920
You let me talk shit.

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:55.920
Yep.

01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.320
Anyway, Jordan, this has been our exploration of the beginning of the week on Alex's show.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:05.840
I'm excited to see the response to the Giuliani raid, and I apologize that we don't have that

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:11.640
on this episode, but it was just too much with this bulk of bullshit that Alex was doing.

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:15.640
No, we're either going to have to focus a lot on the Giuliani raid, or it's going to

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.760
be one of those things where he mentions it, says that it's unfair, and then does not speak

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.760
of it anymore.

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.920
He might say that it's the end of the world, and he might not talk about it at all.

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.920
Entirely.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.920
The range is infinite.

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:27.920
Who knows?

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:28.920
Yeah.

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:29.920
But we will find out soon enough.

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:30.920
Until then, we have a website.

01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:31.920
We do have a website.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:32.920
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:33.920
We're also on Twitter.
