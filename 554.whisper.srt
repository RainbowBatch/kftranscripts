00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,960
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,960
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,960
I have great respect for knowledgefight

knowledgefight

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
you guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
I need, I need money

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,960
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Stop it, Andy and Kan, Andy and Kansas

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Andy and, Andy, it's time to pray

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Hello Alex, I'm a victim, calling in with your Japan

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
I love your world

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
knowledgefight

knowledgefight.com

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
I love you

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm Jordan

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around and drink novelty beverages

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,960
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Oh indeed we are, Dan

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Jordan

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Oh wait, sorry, we worship at the cult of the altar of Selene

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Yes, that's what we do, we worship at the altar

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Yeah, there we go

30
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Dan

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Yes

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Dan

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Jordan

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Quick question

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
What's your bright spot today?

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
My bright spot, why don't you go first?

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Why don't I go first?

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
I might need to kick it around a little bit

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Okay

40
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Because I was about to say granola again

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Oh, you can't say granola twice

42
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Deep into granola

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
You can't say granola twice

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Yeah, I know

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
My bright spot, Dan, is around this time of year

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Every year my cousin and I get together and we go to a ball game

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I don't know if you know this or not, Dan, but

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
I know you love the stick

49
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
I appreciate the game of baseballs

50
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
True, you love the steals

51
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,960
And we didn't get to do that last year and this year we just got the tickets and we're going to a game

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Oh, that's great

53
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,960
It feels so amazing, it feels so amazing

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm like shivering with excitement, I can't wait to go

55
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
That's great

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
It'll be amazing

57
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Who are they playing? Who are the Cobes playing?

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Who cares?

59
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Oh, wow, okay

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Also, it's the Pirates, so who cares?

61
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,960
But again, the Cubs are terrible this year, so again, who cares?

62
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Alright

63
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
They're probably going to lose

64
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Alright, let's see, what do I got?

65
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,960
I guess, I don't know, it's tough, this is sort of a hypothetical bright spot

66
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Alright, I'm listening

67
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,960
I think I feel comfortable enough to maybe try to check out a gym again

68
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Ooh

69
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
You know, like, we're vaccinated

70
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,960
That's good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that is a bright spot

71
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,960
I think even wearing a mask, I think we're at a point where I could feel comfortable

72
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Whereas, you know, like before, certainly there was no ability to exist in that kind of space

73
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Oh, for sure

74
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Well, I mean, your last visit to the gym was

75
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Pretty bad

76
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Nightmare-ish, hellish, yeah

77
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,960
It was a little, scary to see that level of

78
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,960
It was passive manslaughter, is that one way of putting it?

79
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I think it might have worked out better than passive manslaughter

80
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Sure

81
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
But it certainly was not for lack of trying

82
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
No, no

83
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
There was a lot of irresponsibility going on

84
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Yeah

85
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Did not care for it

86
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Yeah

87
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
But I feel like it's about time

88
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
That's great

89
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
I feel pretty good about that

90
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Yeah

91
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
I always enjoy going to the gym

92
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Spring

93
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Yep

94
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Time to go out, hit the beach of Lake Shore

95
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Sure

96
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Take your shirt off and really just, ugh

97
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Sure

98
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
You know

99
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
I was down by the lake the other day

100
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
What were you doing?

101
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
On rocks

102
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
What were you doing wandering around on rocks?

103
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Considering jumping in

104
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Were you?

105
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
No

106
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Were you doing

107
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Just enjoying the lake, it was a nice day

108
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Were you doing an Abilify commercial?

109
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
I was

110
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Was that what was happening right there?

111
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Staring off into the middle distance?

112
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
It was a nice day

113
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,960
So, Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over

114
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
We're going to be talking about April 30th, 2021

115
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Blackpink!

116
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
I was going to say I'm banned

117
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
I didn't even

118
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
You almost said I'm dead

119
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Shit

120
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
2021, I'm glad I'm dead

121
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
This is Unforced Error on my part

122
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Yeah, well, I said Black Deck?

123
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I think so

124
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
I don't think either of us succeeded

125
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Yeah, this is a terrible idea

126
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,960
So, yeah, I said on our last episode that we were going to be covering the end of the

127
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
week

128
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Yes

129
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
You know, because Rudy Giuliani's

130
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Of course

131
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Got raided and what have you

132
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Yeah, we gotta figure out what's going on there

133
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,960
I couldn't waste time with that because on Thursday, news broke about Roger Stone's involvement

134
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
in the Matt Gaetz affair

135
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I don't recall anything beyond somebody thinking, here's what I'm going to do

136
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm going to give Roger Stone

137
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Mm-hmm

138
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Roger, I have a tattoo of Richard Nixon on my back stone

139
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Yes

140
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Incriminating evidence

141
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm going to write a confession letter and give it to sneaky Roger Stone

142
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I am going to give this crucial piece of evidence to the single worst person to ever

143
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,960
And I will keep snapshots of offers of bribes to get a pardon

144
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Yeah, there was a Daily Beast article that was pretty bad looking

145
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Pretty damning

146
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,960
I mean, look, anything could be fake

147
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,960
No, no, here's why it's so believable

148
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Uh-huh

149
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Because

150
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
The players involved act like themselves

151
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Exactly, and everybody's so stupid

152
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Nobody's doing anything like, even a half-assed attempt at Googling how to not get arrested

153
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,960
for these specific crimes would be like, don't give it to Roger Stone

154
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Well, and the part of it that makes it even more believable on a personal level for me

155
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,960
is that they had their texting app set to delete the messages

156
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Yes

157
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
And Roger followed through with that

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Of course

159
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Whereas Joel Greenberg did not

160
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Ah, now that's where we're in

161
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
That strikes me as genuine

162
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
That's good stuff

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Yeah

164
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,960
So that came out, I was like, well, the 30th is gonna be fucked up

165
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Friday's gotta be fucked up

166
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Of course

167
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,960
His buddy is like on the hook here in this Daily Beast article

168
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,960
talking with this guy who's admitting to having sex with a 17-year-old for money

169
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
There's a problem

170
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Trying to get Roger, Alex's buddy

171
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
To get him a pardon

172
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,960
To get a pardon from Trump, and it appears through the texts

173
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Sounds damning

174
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
That Roger is like, that's a thing that's done

175
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
250K, yeah, no big deal

176
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Wow

177
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,960
So big news day for Alex

178
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,960
I am gonna put $250,000 worth of Bitcoin on Roger Stone not calling in on Friday

179
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
He does not show up

180
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
That is not a surprise

181
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
I will spoil that

182
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I will take my 250,000 please

183
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,960
I didn't agree to that, but Roger is, he is not to be found

184
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Not to be seen

185
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
My lawyers have told me to pray more

186
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
We do get a lawyer show up

187
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Oh yeah, that's not surprising

188
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Yup, so Jordan, we'll get into this and see what Alex's response is

189
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
But before we do, I gotta take a little moment and say thank you

190
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
And welcome in some wonks

191
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
So first

192
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
That's a great idea

193
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Someone tried to catfish my mom with a picture of Alex Jones

194
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
And now I'm here

195
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk

196
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960

Thank you very much

198
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
I assume the path that everyone took to our show

199
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Sure

200
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960

203
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Aww, thanks buddy, hail Satan

204
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Next, human cat Rymera

205
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

206
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I'm a policy wonk

207
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Oh, thank you very much, human cat Rymera

208
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Thank you

209
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Next, Fruitsie Collins

210
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk

211
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm a policy wonk

212
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Thank you very much, Fruitsie Collins

213
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Thank you

214
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
And, Bianca Donk

215
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

216
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I'm a policy wonk

217
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Thank you very much, Bianca Donk

218
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Every time I read their name I cannot think

219
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Honky-tonk

220
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Bianca Donk

221
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Remember that song, Honky-Tonk but Donkey-Donk?

222
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I do, remember Honky-Tonk but Donkey-Donk

223
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,840
It's man. What a great time in culture. You know what's weird every time you remember something I get sadder. I

224
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,240
Don't know why I need to retain the memory

225
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,880
No, there's so many things you know that song is one of the main reasons I hate the doors

226
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,800
All right end the episode we have to end after that that was perfect you won you won you won you won

227
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Podcast well, I'd like to take that win and transition it over into wishing happy birthday to Ying out there

228
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,560
I don't know when Ying's birthday is but it's in May from what I understand. Somewhere around yes

229
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,360
And I also don't know the name of the person who wished them a happy birthday

230
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Why would you? That's not important. The screen name is Dan didn't say my joke name. See there you go

231
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,680
Sometime in May

232
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,920
Looks like you've been had. Sometime in May there is a person out there named Ying

233
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,120
Who has a birthday and also an anniversary with a person whose screen name is Dan didn't say my joke name

234
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,280
So it's vague. Here's here's what I love about us what?

235
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,520
Shows wouldn't do this what we're doing right now sure but two shows that did do this would do follow-up stuff

236
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,280
But that's why you come to us you come to us for us to

237
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,320
Vaguely know a little bit enough to be like you're great like to suggest

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,400
Yeah, yeah, so Jordan, let's get into it April 30th. All right Friday. Let's do it

239
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
Alex's show started with some troubling news

240
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:10,080
That comes was it that Matt Gates? No, no, it's troubling news that comes in the form of the voiceover

241
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Coming to you live from the infowars.com

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:27,280
studios in the recaptured state of Texas I'm glad you responded that way because I couldn't tell if we've talked about that before

243
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,040
What did they recapture it from oh, I don't know it was occupied text. Yes, very entire career

244
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,000
It's been occupied but then we deliver it it was FEMA region sick, but then he was liberated for a while wasn't it?

245
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,640
I don't think so. I think what there was a time was it was like a state currently turning blue

246
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Yeah, I guess it's been recaptured

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,920
Yeah, maybe that's meant to be like recaptured by democratic

248
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I don't know. I mean the more

249
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,720
Latinx people are allowed to vote in Texas the more it is being recaptured from from the colonialists. So that's nice

250
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah, I thought I was strange and I think I might have heard that before in the past

251
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,040
But it struck me as very new and I don't know what it's in reference to. It struck me

252
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Yeah struck me. Um, so I recaptured who got it Alex. Oh, okay and and Joe Rogan good for them

253
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah, good for them. So Alex starts the show off with some Lana Del Rey and it is also rude

254
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,280
No, it's it's it's more aggressive. Okay, some of the more

255
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,480
more

256
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,280
Symphonic moody or Lana Del Rey songs, but it's too loud and they did not mix this. Well, I am your host Alex Jones

257
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm extremely honored

258
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
And blessed to be here

259
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,040
I want to lay out a great truth to you

260
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
the car up front

261
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,360
And then I'm gonna give you more evidences of it. You're a very small planet

262
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,240
Hurdling through space orbiting a standard yellow star two-thirds of the way out of the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy

263
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,340
Get up, there are seven and a half plus million people on this planet

264
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:17,080
The globalists see themselves as guardians of the earth guardians of the galaxy what and that they are doing almost our disease stunning

265
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,800
Poisoning dumbing down and then culling of the human population

266
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,880
Sure

267
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,600
And when you see their approach to animals you see their same approach to us

268
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,200
The EU has laws have been placed for more than a decade now that you don't take a sheep into a slaughterhouse

269
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
And hit it in the head with a hammer

270
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,760
That's too crude. You know, it kills it pretty much right away or knocks it out

271
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,720
Everybody was selling parties for money. What do you got to finish and then you butcher it?

272
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,960
And so that's what they're doing is poisoning us dumbing us down with drugs and electro magnetic radiation

273
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
in all systems

274
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,320
And psychologically confusing is taking God away from us separating us from God sure

275
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,760
So we don't have any North Star sure and then we'll be so stunned

276
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,440
so diseased

277
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,000
So much in a mesmerized sleep state, right, but they'll be able to then go ahead and gut us

278
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Chop us up nicely and in the species as we know it. So these super predators can play God, right?

279
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,400
We're not I think I just heard that Matt Gates was going to jail

280
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,480
I don't know what you heard. All I heard is just stuff you can just say no

281
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,840
No, I don't know what humane practices at slaughterhouses have to do with those. That's

282
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,200
Cuz you got it in the slaughterhouse no country for old men. That was a book and a movie

283
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,720
I just I just hear Alex saying things that I just just reject. Yeah

284
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,940
No, that's that's a that's one of those things where somebody's still in time. Yeah, and after a while you just go

285
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,280
Screw you don't care or exactly what you were doing is like isn't there something you should be talking?

286
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,640
Yeah, yeah, it's good. Hey, aren't there crimes? Didn't you go? Didn't y'all?

287
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Seems like you would be talking about all of them crimes. Yeah, Alex gets you know, we just just just talking through it

288
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,920
Just got to get through it. They need to bankrupt us and put us in to a

289
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,920
Position of total control and that's what all of this is about

290
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
But here are the really huge

291
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
gigantic

292
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,480
issues

293
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
everybody needs to be made aware of

294
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
and that is

295
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Many of us

296
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Into a post

297
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,040
Human world. Oh man, a special report just starts playing somebody

298
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,080
Somebody in there is I'm telling you dad. Somebody won. The music was too loud. Yeah, we've seen too many

299
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,040
Appropriate song choices. I think it's real

300
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,760
Also, I don't know if I have a clip of it, but Alex played Tarzan boy on this

301
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,280
Which he hasn't played in a really long time. I'm telling you there's a secret patriot inside the Infowars studio

302
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,040
Here's the sending messages. Here's the problem

303
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,840
It's that like the line between fucking with Alex and incompetence is indiscernible. Oh, no, it's impossible to know

304
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,560
There's nothing better than that noise. He made I know

305
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,480
It's just that moment of real resignation, yeah, just like this is how it is

306
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,560
He's too tired to even get mad. This is how it's going to be

307
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,560
This is how it was. This is how it's gonna be for the future. I love it

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,320
So Alex has a special report that he wants to play and it might have been that one that started

309
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
Accidentally, I'm not entirely sure here. He sets that up

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,240
But let me get these part of a report Gregory strongly puts out three to five minute reports. They're all excellent. I

311
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,280
Called him up at six o'clock last night

312
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,760
and I said Greg will you stay late tonight and tomorrow morning and get out a report on this because

313
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,640
Joe Rogan had the courage to have this guest on who's a big investigative journalist the Washington Post

314
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,280
And that was two days ago last night three days ago today, and it didn't get any coverage because they know it's true

315
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,240
They don't want to attack Joe Rogan for oh, yeah

316
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,320
The Washington Post reporter on about Fauci being on lab and the leak and covering it up

317
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,760
Which is true and which is huge but to have this come out and Joe Rogan cover it is massive

318
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
If we can force this story out

319
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
This this this could really

320
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,200
Devastate the New World Order their whole operation. So recently Rogan had an episode where he talked to a guy named Josh Rogan

321
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,240
Rogin sure not really. No. No, I understand this Joe and Josh Rogan

322
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,320
I got this guy's a reporter who worked for the Washington Post

323
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,320
I watched the relevant part of the interview and I don't find it to be super convincing

324
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,560
That said Josh was explaining to Rogan why the theory that the virus

325
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,520
Started in that Wuhan lab is not necessarily completely crazy

326
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,360
He doesn't prove or even claim definitively that he has information that Fauci or the lab is responsible for the outbreak

327
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,920
He's just reiterating information that's been widely publicly discussed over the entire last year

328
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,760
There's some circumstantial evidence that makes people think that it got loose from a lab

329
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,680
There's some circumstantial evidence that makes it look like the virus was naturally occurring

330
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,400
That's not even a new or controversial thing to say. Yeah, it's just that

331
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,600
Generally experts who have looked at it feel that the natural explanation is far more likely. Yeah

332
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,200
No, there was like it two weeks ago

333
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,920
There was another story where it's like DoD can't rule out a possibility and you're like, well, yeah, of course not

334
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,340
They're a bunch of yeah proving a negative is really really hard and unless it's a binary possibility

335
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,320
Right and you prove the affirmative right like it's very difficult. And so obviously

336
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,340
Obviously people who are talking about this seriously deal with it

337
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,120
Only unserious people would be like there is no possible way I declare upon

338
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,040
Yeah, yeah, like and people like Alex will create that of their opposition

339
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,760
They will create that straw man of their opposition cuz that's easier to argue again

340
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,240
Yeah

341
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,920
so Josh kind of seems like a little bit of a dick only because I don't believe that he's unaware of what he's doing like

342
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,180
He's not some guy on his first press appearance. He's a guy with a career in media

343
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,680
He knows that what he's doing is lending the credibility of his mainstream media credentials to be used exactly how Alex is using this clip

344
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,040
on his show now

345
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,440
Unless Josh had some actual evidence of anything the behavior he displayed in that interview is at best irresponsible

346
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,460
This next clip from Alex's show which is complete bullshit is the direct result of that kind of irresponsibility

347
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:49,500
Bombshell Friday live Washington Post investigation says Fauci behind Wuhan leaks and he's the main suspect

348
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,600
So now it's turned into a Washington Post

349
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,280
Investigation that Fauci is the main suspect in getting rid of the getting that COVID out there. Well, so yeah

350
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I mean all you've done is

351
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,140
Create like because what what's proven by the conversation that he has with Rogan nothing

352
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,060
What what what what extra do they bring to the table other than sort of name Washington Post reporter?

353
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:18,500
That's what they bring to it. They bring legitimacy. Yeah from the Washington Post and it's Rogan gets to call it a win

354
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,440
Yeah, it's not introducing a new idea that like

355
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:28,900
There's a slight possibility that there was there's a lab origin. It's not that that's not new

356
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,600
It's normalizing the conclusion right that it was

357
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,740
From a lab. No, it's just irresponsible

358
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,420
And I just don't believe that somebody who could have the level of career that he does

359
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:46,120
Would be able to go on Rogan and not recognize that your behavior would be interpreted by listeners that way, right?

360
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,400
Well, I mean in that situation

361
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,220
there's two things going on one if you have any

362
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,860
Credibility that you've built up through being a reporter of any kind of quality or something and you go on info wars or Rogan or whatever

363
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,720
They're there to steal your credibility

364
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,400
They don't give a fuck about you your credibility is what they're stealing so they can do that and you're there

365
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
to get

366
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,240
Attention, right? That's the deal. Maybe sell something you're selling exactly

367
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,800
So if you're so like when you're a reporter for the Washington Post

368
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,400
If you don't know that you're there to sell something and they're there to steal your credibility

369
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,160
You're stupid like that's beyond the pale. Yeah, because that's the only reason you would go

370
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,240
Not because Joe's fun no, no because Joe's such a good Jamie is a cool, dude

371
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,980
I don't actually know anything about him never heard. I heard he googles. Yeah

372
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,500
Yeah, so Alex has a little friend from across the pond who pays a visit on this episode

373
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:55,000
Paul Joseph Watson sure boy. This is really just all about anti-muslim agitation. There we go

374
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I was wondering oh boy

375
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,920
People say oh well the French they capitulated Hitler. So so what the French are people folks

376
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,200
they've just been controlled by tyrants like we are and

377
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,400
And we're all French tomorrow. London is London Stan. Look at our borders are wide open. Okay, so

378
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,160
France is the gateway to the UK and to the rest of Europe and the world

379
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,220
So we need to stand with the French people. They're good people. So the whole thing is essentially that this is a

380
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
extreme instance of anti-muslim

381
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:34,800
Yeah, programming. It's pretty it's pretty ridiculous. Yeah, just geographically. Mm-hmm. How could France be the gateway the channel?

382
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,480
Isn't the channel from France? No, I understand that the channel is for France to England

383
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,960
But I mean, you know gateway like for Europe like France is like if you're looking at a map of Europe

384
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,240
Right, right and you got the whole Europe thing. There are some friends being here

385
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,280
Yeah, then all this other stuff being in the way. Mm-hmm for the gate part. Yeah

386
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,960
I mean you make an interesting geographical that's fair. That's what does it feel?

387
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,280
That's true. It doesn't feel as real and does that argument scare you?

388
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:13,160
Because if not throw it away, there's 15 countries between them and the gateway to London and channel

389
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:21,440
So yeah, what's going on here is that there was an open letter that got published in France that was about

390
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
the fear of Muslims

391
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,880
We'll talk about it here in a little bit. Here's Paul discussing it

392
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
Well, this is an open letter sent to the government of France Alex

393
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,000
And we've heard noises from these military personnel before both active duty and retired by the way many of them retired generals

394
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,240
Warning about the situation on the edges of the suburbs of major cities in France and this mirrors across

395
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,320
Many major European capitals as well as other French cities such as Lyon

396
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,740
That you have this parallel society

397
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,600
whereby it's completely undermined the French government and their monopoly of power

398
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,440
Which is essentially what government is

399
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,920
First of all Alex's entire libertarian identity is based on the rejection of the state having monopoly on power

400
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,600
the entire reason that the Second Amendment so important is that if the populace can be armed and the state can't attain a

401
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,540
Complete monopoly of force. It's so weird to hear Paul be concerned about threats to the monopoly of power of the French government. Yeah

402
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,400
Wonder why that is. That's so strange

403
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah

404
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Anyway, this open letter that Paul is talking about was an insane letter that was published in a far-right magazine called Valor's actual

405
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
in France last week

406
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,760
Interestingly it was published on the exact 60th anniversary of a failed coup attempt against Charles de Gaulle

407
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:47,580
Back in 1961 the idea of allowing Algeria to enjoy self-determination was put to a vote and Algerian independence won the day

408
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
overwhelmingly

409
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,600
naturally many former generals

410
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,440
Particularly those in Algeria didn't like this and they decided to form a junta and tried to take over major cities in Algeria

411
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,500
I was running things and then democracy boo

412
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,980
Oh, yeah, ultimately this didn't work out for these generals

413
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,300
But it did lead to many of them forming a group known as the organization army secret

414
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,420
Which was a terrorist group aimed at destabilizing the situation out Algeria in order to maintain French colonial rule

415
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:22,420
Because what needs to so you want the government of Algeria to not have a monopoly on power

416
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Yeah, makes sense. It makes sense. Yeah, so it seems like this may be more than a coincidence that this letter warning of an insurrection

417
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,020
Was published on the anniversary of a failed insurrection aimed at maintaining an archaic and offensive status quo

418
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:43,860
Particularly when you read that one of their stated complaints about various anti-racism groups is that they want to tear down statues of famous French

419
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,260
colonialists

420
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,880
It's just it's a little bit. It's a little bit agro

421
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,520
Mmm, yeah that that does sound a little bit like

422
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,880
Memorializing the day Mishma tried to overthrow Japan like with a nice little letter like Emperor Hirohito was pretty great

423
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I don't know if you guys remember that guy. He's pretty great

424
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,340
Naturally noted fascist Marine Le Pen has voiced support for the letter and its signers

425
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,440
Which is what very clearly a part of her push towards running again in next year's election against Macron so

426
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,560
Good. Hey, hey, you know

427
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,440
Yep, this is just anti-muslim agitation, okay

428
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,520
Well, we know is the UN admits a doubling ten years ago of Christian persecution now a tripling worldwide

429
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,040
So if you're a Christian anywhere in the world, the Muslims are killing you including Africa

430
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,400
We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson about what's coming next. Stay with us. There are very legitimate issues about

431
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,400
Christian persecution around the world and it would be wrong to not

432
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,720
recognize

433
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,680
that or to

434
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,000
To deny that or minimize it but the answer is not

435
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,160
Oppressing Muslims. No, it's not it's not

436
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,920
Turning it around

437
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,180
Okay, okay

438
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,280
Now I see what you're saying Dan and when you say that you think what we're gonna do is we're gonna break the cycle of violence

439
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,640
Mm-hmm. Now have you considered though that on the other side of that cycle? We're the ones committing violence

440
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,280
So like as long as we die before the cycle turns around again, I will we're golden

441
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,800
I will say that the depending on which side you're on it feels very different, but it's still bad does seem different. Yes

442
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,280
So one of the things that I think that is kind of becoming a thesis of mine

443
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,240
Over time as I see this behavior just repeated by over and over and over again by people

444
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,960
in the info war sphere is that I think one of the

445
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,360
characterizing

446
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:48,240
Elements of what makes these people in this world is an inability or an unwillingness to recognize the difference between fiction and reality

447
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,040
Right, right. I really think that it's just

448
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
something is

449
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,280
And I think it's more unwillingness. Yeah inability

450
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,600
Yeah

451
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I I think that that's the or maybe maybe not unwillingness so much as all of the incentives

452
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,000
Push towards why deal with reality the incentives are towards believing in false reality

453
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,600
So why would you go back to real reality?

454
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:21,080
You'd have to get like a regular job and yeah, no Alex isn't gonna just like bag groceries, but it's not just Alex

455
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,200
I mean, it's Paul to sure Charlie

456
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,720
Michelle Welbeck famed French author and intellectual published the book so he'd already written

457
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,480
It was published on the day of the Charlie Hebdo massacre and he predicted that there would be so much

458
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,200
Discord and violence because of these Muslim communities that have not been integrated and that hate France

459
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,920
Allied with the left-wing protest movement, by the way

460
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Isis literally puts out in their manifesto that they can make an alliance with the left wing

461
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,440
Because they also hate France and the West to bring it down

462
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,320
so he puts out a book on the day of Charlie Hebdo warning the

463
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,920
The contrived solution to all this would be in a Muslim government in a coalition with a left-wing government

464
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,680
That takes power and promises to get it all under control

465
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:12,080
So this book by Michelle hula back is not a prediction. It's not even a nonfiction book

466
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,000
It's a novel that presents a fictional future where there's socialists and a Muslim Brotherhood

467
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,000
Political party that banned together to resist the rising power from the extreme right-wing national front, right?

468
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,080
That's the plot one of the driving forces of the plot of this fiction novel. Sure. Sure in the fiction novel

469
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,800
There's a right-wing

470
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,160
Government oppressing everybody the type that somebody like Paul Joseph Watson would appreciate

471
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,040
Mmm, and then they banned together the Muslim Brotherhood and the leftists

472
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,080
And so Paul is taking that as an attack on the real world right-wing. Well, I don't look

473
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
I some people have found the book itself to be like fairly Islamophobic and it

474
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,040
Traffics in some troubling tropes, but I'm not really entirely sure because I haven't read it

475
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,660
I just read a description of the plot

476
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,360
I do know though unlike Paul Joseph Watson that this is a novel

477
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:08,200
Not a prediction of things to come like this dude looked into God's eye like Alex claims to okay has found this

478
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,280
This this vision of the future. No, no, no, I understand but that kind of it

479
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,120
So you're telling me that it's a novel right Paul says it's a prediction

480
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,240
Okay, but if you're right that means that all those Dragonlance novels I read when I was younger aren't gonna come true

481
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Oh, no, Jordan

482
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
No

483
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Jordan those happened in the past

484
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,120
That's not the future that's history, oh no, I flat times a flat circle. It'll be it'll come back around

485
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,600
Yeah, so Paul is just a real real piece of garbage

486
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,800
the French government literally came out before the first coronavirus lockdown the Ministry of the interior and said that it shouldn't be

487
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,020
enforced in these migrant ghetto areas so again

488
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,320
literally creating a separate law where the

489
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Enforcement the lockdown the oppression imposed on us is not imposed on them because they're especially protected class

490
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,240
You can hear Paul's angle on this story

491
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,980
which is that poor migrant communities are being exempted from the draconian and

492
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:19,860
Fascistic rules that the white men of Europe are being subjected to because immigrants are a separate higher class of people to the globalists

493
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:26,120
Interestingly there's another side to this story and that is the one based in reality where the governments of Europe particularly in France

494
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,960
Didn't allocate funds to provide assistance to poor migrant communities

495
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:37,860
Non-governmental organizations were working to advocate for the establishment of mobile clinics near areas where migrants camped but their appeals generally went unheard

496
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:44,000
The accommodation of people experiencing homelessness was tragic at the beginning of the pandemic and there's still serious issues now

497
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,420
But you can see how Paul is rewriting governmental negligence towards a vulnerable population and to actually secretly being them getting favorable treatment

498
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,980
That sucks

499
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,700
Also, how do you how do you enforce a whole stay-at-home order to people who are experiencing homelessness?

500
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,540
Like what are you even talking about? I don't know if there's anything more right-wing than

501
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,660
Having white people ignore

502
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,520
immigrants and then blaming

503
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,420
Them. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. That's the right wing. That's about all Paul's up to

504
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,860
Boy it's a bad appearance now Alex dropped something that I thought was really really interesting and confused me a lot

505
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,240
What is it a hot potato? It's now official. They're parroting from the BBC to CNN to ABC Australia

506
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,420
that

507
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:41,740
You will get your freedom when you have your vaccine the moment of freedom for you is when you get your vaccine

508
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:47,020
These are the quotes everywhere and it gets even crazier top scientist epidemiologist

509
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,780
You named her coming out saying Yale medical doctors that the majority people in the hospitals now are from the vaccine

510
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,740
And they're telling people that they have kovat

511
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,340
Wow

512
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,780
We predicted that here it is ladies and gentlemen

513
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,780
It's that thing about like your freedom comes when you get the vaccine

514
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,980
there was just somebody on a talking head show that was

515
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,840
Discussing how some people are not motivated by the idea that you can protect other people by getting vaccinated

516
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,400
So maybe appeal to people's selfishness

517
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,960
As a means of getting people to recognize the importance of getting a vaccine and I understand what this person saying

518
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,840
I also think it's a misguided

519
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,440
Perspective. Yeah, I don't think that taking the advice of one person on CNBC

520
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
as if it's the

521
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,080
Like the global position of enemy faction. I don't think that's a smart thing to do

522
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,600
But that seems to be what Alex is up to

523
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:40,800
No

524
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:47,360
I think a lot of people should take the things that I say and extrapolate them and put them upon every single person

525
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,000
Who disagrees with them? It's a great idea. It's a little it's a little silly and Alex plays this clip with this person over and over

526
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,120
Again, it's just it doesn't prove any point

527
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,320
Yeah

528
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,840
that's annoying but I have no idea or Alex was getting that statistic that a majority of people who are

529
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,920
Hospitalized now are there due to the vaccine not from kovat and because he's not providing a source

530
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,320
There's nothing I can do with that

531
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,300
I would I would argue that if that were true that would be the biggest news in the history of ever I can

532
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,400
Jordan tell you this though

533
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,060
newly published CDC study found that among people 65 and older the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were

534
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,300
94 percent effective at preventing hospitalization, which is huge

535
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,520
Yeah, if Alex can produce this data, I'd be happy to look at it

536
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,840
But at this point all available information points the exact opposite direction

537
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,960
Yeah, especially considering how sensationalized it is whenever things don't work where it's like you just said

538
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,080
Oh, it's 94 percent effective at stopping hospitalizations

539
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,840
But how many times have we read an article that says that but all but instead of saying 94 percent effective

540
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,720
They're like six thousand people in the hospital now because of vaccines and then you're like out of how many Oh 100,000

541
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
You know, like it's oh

542
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,800
You guys suck at this if that were true

543
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,000
Imagine how the sensationalized news would report that shit. Mmm

544
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
everyone dying

545
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,240
People would sound like Alex but worse

546
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,560
So terrifying Alex is taking this news very well

547
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,920
So Alex has another guest on and it's that preacher from Calgary

548
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,160
I was on Arthur paulowski. Uh-huh. He's the guy who yelled at

549
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,920
I mentioned this he's the dick preacher. Yeah, we didn't talk about this

550
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,960
But we we mentioned it that he was on he's the other preacher. There's the girl. He's the other dick

551
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,360
There's the Grace Life Church, which is the one that where Alex was trying to get everyone to go, right?

552
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,000
Right, and this is another guy right who has a has a church and he wouldn't let people in to

553
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,080
Like he'd they'd gotten a bunch of complaints about them having services and not following kovat right guidelines

554
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,160
And so he just yell there's a video. I'm just yelling out out

555
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:08,960
And the people are like we just want to talk to you, but see now that's that's what you become a preacher for

556
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,240
It's freaking people out of a church. He's got to be a all-time good feeling

557
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:25,120
yeah, so he's on and I'm gonna go ahead and we'll talk about we'll talk about this a little bit this time, but I wanted to get

558
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:33,320
Arthur paulowski or art paulowski the great preacher that feeds over a thousand homeless people a week and who has his little church

559
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,900
It's been rated a bunch by the provincial police and others and now it was SWAT team to give us an update street church

560
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,340
Dot-ca was on Monday. Their services are coming up this weekend

561
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,420
They may try to lock the church up like they've done many others

562
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,980
He's saying he's gonna go to one of the places like Walmart or wherever. He's gonna announce it via email to his flock

563
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,140
And so they'll have it where they do allow it. So I thought that was kind of interesting

564
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,540
I'm not sure based on this interview if he's saying that he's gonna do this like go preach at a wall

565
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,540
Yeah, yeah, but on April 27th the last time he was on here's what Alex said you've got

566
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,780
to

567
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,180
Walmarts filled with people shoulder to shoulder, but I cannot have my parents for coffee in my house. That's against the law

568
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,820
I cannot have a church because that's against the law

569
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:24,380
But they can go with my church with my friends with my family members to IKEA and have a coffee over there

570
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,980
Why don't you guys go to Walmart say you're going go in and then hold a church service there

571
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,180
You'll be allowed to of course then they'll throw you out. That'd be a great time. That would be a great stunt

572
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:40,660
Oh, yeah, so I don't know if the reality is that this preacher has taken Alex's advice for a stunt

573
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,260
But that's clearly something that Alex came up with from the two of them. We're talking a couple days prior

574
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:52,820
Yeah, I remember my favorite parts of the Bible where we're when Jesus got ideas from the devil and the devil's like man

575
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,660
You should really try that out. That's a great stunt. Uh-huh. Give it a shot make all them low

576
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,300
I remember there was a couple chapters that really stuck out to me when I was a kid in Bible study

577
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,940
They were about God making dank memes totally totally

578
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,580
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, so this preacher man, I

579
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,620
I don't I don't care for the way this guy thinks and the health inspectors receive a

580
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:23,880
Permission from a judge to use any force necessary and the judge's name

581
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,100
That's even more fascinating in this story is no David Gates out of seven billion names

582
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,640
They have found a judge that is a family of Bill Gates

583
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,880
I don't know David Gates the judge here in Calgary. What what?

584
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,040
Seven billion names. What are you talking about? Grow up grow up, sir

585
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Grow up

586
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,520
There are not seven billion names Dan we have had to reuse a few

587
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,520
Six billion nine hundred ninety nine million nine hundred ninety eight thousand

588
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,720
Yeah, man, so the health department got a warrant to enter his church. Sure

589
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,240
And the person who signed it was Gates. What?

590
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,400
What are the odds? I man probably zero coincidence

591
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,840
I just you know

592
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:18,280
Like if I was in it at church and I heard him just go like and it's the same last name as Bill Gates

593
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,920
What does that tell you? I'd be like, oh no, I guess religion is fake shit. You

594
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,560
Personally are so stupid. I don't believe in God

595
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,400
You've shaken my faith. Yes. Yeah, you're too dumb. Oh, no

596
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,920
My whole life needs to be reevaluated. You're suggesting that all people named Gates are related

597
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,520
That's not good. Even if it's just for fun. That's still crazy

598
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,760
You're a dumb dumb. So Alex and this dude are talking and they they get to

599
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,880
Discussing how the left right the left. Oh, it's us. Mm-hmm

600
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:57,680
What they're doing is they're using the budget. Okay or something sure in order to get the police to attack Christians

601
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
That's what's going on. Interesting

602
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,480
Why are the police so happy in your area and in other areas?

603
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,880
With other churches to put fences up around them and to behave like something out of Soviet Russia

604
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,320
Because the mayor and the homosexual Muslim mayor night named she threatened to defund the police

605
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,840
He took 20 million dollars out of the police budget and then after a backlash. She gave them back to 20 million

606
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,880
Well, that's what it is exactly. The left everywhere is holding the police hostage by the purse strings

607
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,960
They don't get rid of the police. They want the police shutting down churches not stopping carjackers

608
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,920
That's exactly what is happening right now. Oh boy. If that is on the table

609
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,960
I will absolutely hold the police hostage if that is on the table. Somebody let me hold the police hostage

610
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,680
I will do it right fucking now. Yeah, this guy's worrying me a little bit. I did not know that was on the table

611
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,400
well, you know the you know, you got these this

612
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:58,780
This guy is worried about don't don't repeat what he said about that. I wasn't going to I was gonna say he's worried about the

613
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:05,440
Cops. Yeah. Yeah, we're all manipulated by the budgetary concerns. Don't worry to destroy churches

614
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,040
It's a that's my biggest fear and at a certain point you want to ask yourself a question and that is

615
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,920
When are you gonna rise up? Oh, I mean when is going to be enough when you know, where are you going to rise up?

616
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,440
Well, we noticed the master never going away. I told people they're they're never gonna end this until people say no

617
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,960
That's right. We will never say what we know about bullies that bullies

618
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:34,220
They will never stop bullying until you stop the bullying and that's what it needs to happen three words. No get out

619
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,040
No get out

620
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,640
Well, even the New York Times and Homeland Security saying it's a crisis that Christians won't take the vaccine

621
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,200
It's not it is a vaccine. You're all done a

622
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:51,060
Franken genetic re-engineering program see what I'm saying you prove that's exactly what it is and it's killing now more people

623
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,400
Than the so-called virus it. Oh boy

624
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,240
What are we gonna have to do? I don't know. What are we gonna have? I don't know. It's why it's a very interesting

625
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,200
Perspective to see like and what actually I think the only thing that I really find interesting about this is how how much it?

626
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,920
Makes sense like Alex started this sort of they're closing down all these churches. Yeah with the grace life Church

627
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,120
Yeah, they had that he had that reporter on from rebel news and she wouldn't go along with his like everyone needs to come

628
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,280
Right, right. All right, and I don't think that was fun for Alex. No, so now he's found Arthur

629
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:34,720
Pawlowski. Yeah, who is like everybody's got to rise up. Hey. Hey, look, I don't need any of your rebel media reporting bullshit

630
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,520
I want a stochastic terrorist. I think that this guy is exactly what Alex would have wanted out of the other

631
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,380
He would still be talking about the grace life church if he was willing to call for an uprising. Yes

632
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,940
Yeah, this guy is exactly what Alex wants. Oh, yeah, so

633
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,400
apparently Alex gets a lot of emails about big medical news that

634
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,840
It never never really makes it to the show. And actually I think that's good because they would just be anecdotal stories

635
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,140
That's true. It would be meaningless. It'd be chain emails

636
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,320
Our email is full of doctors and lawyers and teachers and nurses and we call them

637
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,600
They send us the evidence where they are giving people shots and people are dropping dead at the vaccination centers

638
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,640
And it's not just from the coven shot. Suddenly the flu shots are killing a bunch of people something's going on here

639
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,880
Yes. Yes. We knew that we knew the gates announced a few years ago that he wants to eliminate six and a half billion people

640
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Now I got the judge gates that is issuing illegal orders against the Constitution the chapter rights of freedoms

641
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,560
We know something is going on and Christians have has always been in opposition to genocide and evil. So I think

642
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,800
Have you see I guess I mean like Alex if he's getting these emails

643
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,600
They're just be anecdotal stories, but they send all the proof. Yeah, just sort of never also buddy. Come on

644
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Come on. Oh

645
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,120
Also that killing 6.5 billion people is the Georgia Guidestones. He's just referencing rocks in Georgia. Yeah, man

646
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,600
I really don't think that I would like my

647
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,320
Christian preacher adding a little Georgia Guidestone in there every now and again, you know

648
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,640
You know what people add in and making another reference to how the judges name is. Yeah, that's not good. No, it's not good

649
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
No, I got this judge name

650
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,760
So Polowski is the kind of guy though, who's not gonna be deterred by this the state cracking down on him sure

651
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,840
It doesn't seem like it. Well, what's the Bible verse pastor? I forget that the gates of hell shall not prevail against Christ Church

652
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,060
That's exactly that's why tomorrow. I'm opening the church tomorrow. I'm going to be preaching

653
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,480
Let the whole world see what is happening in the city of Calgary in this beautiful country of ours, Canada

654
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,560
And at least let there be thousands of people witness

655
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,100
Saturday Sabbath services tell us what time and where people can go to the website as well

656
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,080
Interestingly our tour did have his services the next day on this Saturday. How'd it go? Things didn't go well. Oh, what happened?

657
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,740
I'll just read to you here from an article in the Calgary Herald quote community members living on

658
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,000
living near Street Church say preacher Artur Polowski and his followers have threatened neighbors with violence after speaking out against the

659
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,960
Congregations disregard for public health measures and their hateful rhetoric Christians have always been against violence

660
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,240
Yeah, no, no, not their style from this article quote

661
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,240
Our neighbors here have been threatened for at least seven weeks by these anti-maskers who are violating health

662
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,360
Regulations and spreading messages of hate said Michelle Robinson who lives in the neighborhood

663
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:43,640
This is a very similar thing to what happened after the big uproar surrounding that Grace Life Church where Alex implored everyone to show up

664
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:50,280
people did show up there and you know, who knows if it was because of the rebel news reporting or just some blog or Alex who

665
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,040
knows exactly but

666
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,840
Elizabeth Simmons the deputy director of the Canadian anti hate Network told CTV this after quote monitoring the crowd

667
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,520
Quote it would be accurate to say that the event attracted far-right and right-wing conspiracy minded individuals for sure would be

668
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,280
This is important to understand

669
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,560
There's a reason why Alex is trying to ramp up and heighten the tension surrounding churches that refuse to cooperate with public health measures

670
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,440
This is an intentional strategy meant to create a standoff that will lead to a galvanizing moment for the extreme

671
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,920
Right, this is a super dangerous situation

672
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,560
And even if it doesn't escalate any further the neighbors of this church are having to deal with an incredibly unfair circumstance

673
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,080
Where this narcissist and preachers clothing is creating a powder keg in their front lawns like it's just inappropriate

674
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:41,900
and it we need to need to understand that this is an intentional thing whether or not Alex is sitting there with a whiteboard

675
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,360
Trying to draw out how to create a martyr. Yeah or to create a conflagration of some sort

676
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,680
No, he might as well put a billy. I'm putting a million dollar bounty on whoever can start a holy war

677
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,680
It's it's he's trying to ramp up the tensions that would lead in that direction and hoping for the worst

678
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,200
Yeah, well, I mean whiteness didn't work in America. So let's try religion in Canada

679
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,600
I think is what he's trying to do. It's it's it's pretty upsetting and I I hope for

680
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,720
You know all these these situations to be navigated

681
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,760
Delicately. Yeah, good luck

682
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,920
So Alex gets done with this dude and he gets back to the news and he's got a fucking bombshell

683
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
There's a huge report that's gonna be posted

684
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,960
In the next 20 minutes the band on video that we worked on for a while. There's so many examples of it

685
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,080
I only wanted a few minutes of it, but it's nine minutes of it and it's gonna be titled proof. Joe Biden has dementia

686
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,280
May 2021, but that's a good way to put her

687
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,920
Spring 2021, uh, just people know this is a new update

688
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,440
Or just breaking total proof Joe Biden has dementia and it's being completely handled

689
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,400
He has permission for everything. It's just it's just insane and he admits while he has to mention that he stole the election

690
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,760
It's it's just unbelievable. So I have so many guests. I'm not gonna have time to air this on the show today. Really?

691
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
You have proof

692
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:19,200
Tell me that you have a nine-minute video that proves Joe Biden both has dementia and stole the election

693
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,520
Uh-huh, but you don't have time today. Yeah, no time. Just I'm sorry

694
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,040
We have proof of Joe Biden confessing that he stole the election

695
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:35,080
We have perhaps the most important piece of proof of the 21st century. Yeah. Yeah

696
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:40,040
So the game that's being played here is he's trying to drive traffic to his website. Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely true

697
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,040
And you know that this is not worth his time on the actual show, you know

698
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:50,960
I I what one thing that people haven't really gotten me with yet is why I should care if Joe Biden has dementia

699
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,880
You know, like I I kind of don't care if they're weakened at burn easing him

700
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,560
Right, like so far. It's it's like I don't want a monarch. I

701
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,440
Don't want a president who's?

702
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,120
Doing all of that stuff. I'm fine if he's dead

703
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,720
I'm fine if he's dead and they've got him enough like a scarecrow stick figure thing behind him

704
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,420
They're just wheeling him out and deep faking his speeches. I'm fine with that

705
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,440
I feel like you speak for at least a segment of the population

706
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,800
I think we should get some polling on that. I think everybody would be fine

707
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,420
If you're just weekend at burn is it I don't know what the temperature of the country is

708
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
We would be fine with a weekend

709
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,060
All be fine with the dead president

710
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:42,400
Let's put it put it out on Twitter. All right, what happens? Yeah, so anyway back to statistics. Sorry. Sorry, but

711
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,080
Do you know about statistics?

712
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,120
bombshell 60% of new COVID patients are

713
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,480
Vaccinated dr. Harvey Reich

714
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:58,240
Very respected Yale medical doctor on new patients diagnosed with the corona virus more than half have been

715
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,080
Vaccinated and they're having autoimmune diseases

716
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,440
They're having allergic responses and the hospitals are being told call it COVID and of course

717
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,920
They test positive for it because the PCR test is set up just like Theranos did

718
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,420
So now that Alex has dropped a little bit of a specific piece of information

719
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,320
I can tell you what he's talking about

720
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,960
He almost certainly just saw this in a meme that was going around on social media

721
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,920
Alex has no idea who Harvey Reisch is or where that quote comes from

722
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,480
Yeah

723
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,060
It turns out that it was from an interview that Reich did on Steve Bannon's

724
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,540
Podcast where he said quote what clinicians are telling me is more than half of the new COVID cases

725
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,080
They're seeing to treat is people who've been vaccinated

726
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,200
They've estimated 60% of new patients. They've been treating have been people who have been vaccinated

727
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:49,100
So this is at best second-hand estimations based presumably on anecdotal information being thrown around on Steve

728
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,320
Bannon's podcast. Yeah, that sounds more trustworthy than data

729
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,840
According to the CDC as of April 20th, there were seven thousand one hundred fifty seven reported cases of people who were vaccinated

730
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,180
Who still contracted COVID that's out of 87 million people who have been vaccinated

731
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,880
So that is not really that surprising of a number

732
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,040
Everyone's dying. Yeah a CNN article from earlier in April had the figure at approximately

733
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,400
5,800 breakthrough cases of which only

734
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:22,080
396 of those required hospitalization, so it seems hard to believe that these numbers could be accurate

735
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:28,380
It's it's tough whenever you're working on numbers that are such a huge scale because what we should be saying is wait

736
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:35,120
396 only 396 needed hospitalization. We have miracles. We make miracles now

737
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:40,560
We create miracles and all this God bullshit. They keep talking about is insane because only

738
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:46,880
376 people had to be hospitalized from vaccine. We created it under a year. We need the ICP to make a song about this

739
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:57,220
So, yeah, like I said, the numbers do not match up and unless there's more than a second-hand story being told on Bannon's podcast

740
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,680
I'm just gonna ignore this

741
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:05,040
But it's important to recognize that this is the level of backing that a claim needs to have for Alex to take it as gospel

742
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,360
As long as it lines up with the narratives that he's currently profiting off of. Yeah

743
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,800
It's the only thing that really matters at all

744
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,680
I think what's fun about Steve Bannon's podcast is regardless of whether or not he

745
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,680
Previously was a very respected Yale medical doctor the moment you go on Steve Bannon's podcast

746
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:30,960
Very and respected are removed from my vab vocabulary. Yeah, Yale also published something a few number of months back

747
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,800
In August that was like critiquing and denouncing his yeah

748
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:45,240
Fervent support for hydroxychloroquine as a kovat cure. Yeah, Yale put out a look at this fucking asshole. Sorry. Whoops. He's got tenure

749
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,040
Yeah, what did we know? So Alex believes that vaccines are gonna be mandatory and man?

750
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,040
He says something that I think is really weird and it's going to be forced folks

751
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:59,540
Once they get a majority to do it there, they're gonna say oh things would open but you wouldn't do it

752
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,000
so there's still COVID-19 which they set a computer to clarify everybody has and

753
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,320
Then when you die the other viruses and things are actually releasing or people are dying from the vaccines

754
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,120
They're not just gonna die six months from now or two years from now like the ferrets died in a couple months

755
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,560
That's for humans a couple years out because ferrets don't live as long

756
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,720
So they do animal studies is they they'll die quicker, but it's usually the same

757
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,760
So, you know if a dog dies in a week humans will probably die in six months

758
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,300
If a ferret dies in a month humans will die in a year. That's math

759
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,360
Transitive property of ferrets. If a rat dies in a week a human dies in six months a year. I hate you

760
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:46,720
I hate you so much. They know what they're doing. I hate you so much. I hate you so much Dan for playing that clip. Dog ears man. Dog ears.

761
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,720
I hate you. I hate you

762
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,480
You yeah, Alex can say that you are supposed to keep me away from that shit

763
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,380
No, because it's important to recognize that he thinks dog ears are literal. I'm supposed to be protected from this

764
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,920
That's the kind of stuff that takes your breath away. Yeah, that's that's rough Wow

765
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,040
Yeah, if a dog dies in a way, so he thinks that when we talk about dog ears

766
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:16,760
We're not just talking about relative time that spans for life. He thinks that we literally mean that's the only way I can make that

767
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,360
Make sense. Yeah, he has to try to approach this from a number of different directions because I don't know if he knows this

768
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,440
But different animals have different biology. Nope. Nope, not true. Nope, everybody

769
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:34,080
Some things that are toxic to, some animals are not toxic to others. Nope, all things one. Some we are all God's creatures. Some responses that

770
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,080
All maybe God's image.

771
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,200
Okay, it's just timing based. Yep. I

772
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:47,040
Want to I I just I just can't. It's amazing. I just can't. It's real good. It's it is. It's good stuff

773
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:54,320
There's something admirable about a man who can so consistently say something that floors me

774
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,160
Yeah

775
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:00,920
And confidently and with it he repeated multiple examples of how animals have different lifespans

776
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:07,840
Multiple examples of the same wrong example that makes no sense whatsoever. It's good stuff. Damn

777
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,080
So just damn. So

778
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,380
Biden had given his his remarks before Congress

779
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:20,140
Mm-hmm, and he had mentioned something to the effect of white supremacy is terrorism and yeah, Alex is not happy about this

780
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,980
No, I wouldn't be surprised. This just went up on info wars calm. I told you this was coming yesterday

781
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,100
Nobody else was talking about it. I wish everybody was Tucker Carlson got it and covered it last night course

782
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,780
He said they're coming after you they told you being white inherently is bad

783
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,780
DOJ actively considering domestic terrorism law to target white supremacists

784
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:45,300
That's why they tell you Antifa doesn't exist. But white supremism is just an epidemic. That's why everybody's a white supremacist to be clear

785
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,020
I don't think I would support any new laws

786
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,660
for domestic terrorism

787
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:57,380
But I do think that the idea of taking white supremacy seriously as a terroristic threat

788
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:04,940
Yeah is something that is long overdue and it's also not surprising why Tucker and Alex are the people on the vanguard

789
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,940
Oh

790
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:12,420
Their entire, you know, their money is made by white victim hood. Yeah. Yeah

791
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,540
So yeah, your your best bet there for them is like it's a slippery slope argument

792
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,460
But even then you're arguing for white supremacy

793
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,340
Like the end that's what you guys are doing

794
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:30,100
You're not because at no point are they like well what we should do is focus on the extreme elements of white supremacy

795
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:35,820
Nope, none of that. So none of that just blanket you're talking about white people. I will kill you

796
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:41,540
It's really interesting that you say that because I think it even becomes more clear as Alex talks about some other political figures

797
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,540
Sure speaking on the issue

798
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:50,460
Hours earlier House Intelligence Committee representative Adam Schiff and the rest of the Chinese spies on his committee. Why as well the sinner

799
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:56,060
stage for the narrative by telling MSNBC's and no Wallace that the

800
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,740
The predominant part of the domestic threat is white

801
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,780
Nationalist. Ah, you know, we're not globalist

802
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:08,660
We can't ignore that because of a politically sensitivity that some of the folks are part of the Trump base

803
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:15,000
We have to stop there really quick because I think that Alex just tried to define white nationalist as just not global

804
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,300
Not globalist. Yep, that's not good. No, no

805
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:24,380
I don't believe that he doesn't know that that is a compound noun that has a specific meaning. It's a problem

806
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:31,180
I know that there are some people like coach Dave was one of them sure who I actually believe doesn't know what white nationalism means

807
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:37,460
He thinks he is a nationalist who happens to be white. Yeah, and that makes is like I am a white nurse

808
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,460
Yeah, I don't think he understands

809
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,800
Alex does yeah, I do not cuz he's I've heard him discuss some of the ideas

810
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,780
So him him couching that there is the opposite of globalist. Yeah, that's a problem

811
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:57,280
Yeah, yeah, that is interesting because Dave is astonishingly stupid. Yes, but Alex is stupid

812
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,980
Astonishingly, yeah, you know, yeah, let's finish this clip in there

813
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:07,420
And they go on to say the FBI the CIA the intelligence agencies are gonna disrupt us

814
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:13,780
That's when you send the Green Berets in to kill people. What that's what that means is it so it's all here

815
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,920
It's all being announced. It's all being done. It is the twilight of our Republic. It is a dictatorship

816
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,120
So no, that's not that's not necessarily what that means

817
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:28,000
But to be clear what's going on is that Alex is defending white supremacy and white nationalism because he knows that it's a part of

818
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,360
His power block. Yeah, he doesn't like that

819
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:37,120
People are discussing how these things are a problem and he's unwilling to separate himself from white nationalism because it's his bread and butter

820
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,220
People keep saying that I'm a white nationalist and that's way wrong now

821
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,360
I would just like my supporters to continue sending me Nazi coin

822
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:52,040
And that's the new official branded bit of cryptocurrency of it for worse. I only accept

823
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:03,320
I just want people to call me apartheid Dan. Yeah, I also think that Alex actually thinks that Swalwell's name is swallows. Well

824
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,320
That was something that was the name that Roger gave to him when a couple years back when Roger was mad at Adam Schiff

825
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,760
Yeah, yeah there they had that blow up and yeah, Roger would call him that

826
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,200
I think that Alex just doesn't realize that that's not his real name

827
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:23,040
He doesn't say it like as a joke. Can we live in a dictatorship?

828
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:30,400
when the man who is telling me we are living in a dictatorship just told me that he has proof that the dictator of said

829
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,200
dictatorship is

830
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,200
has dementia and

831
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:40,680
Admitted that yeah stole the election. Yeah, that wouldn't really be a dictatorship now would it be a weird one?

832
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,760
It would be a strange one. So speaking of weird ones

833
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:49,260
We shouldn't be seduced into thinking that because we're white we ain't right and you don't win an argument by

834
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,720
Manipulating definitions. Do you agree norm that you're a racist? Well, no

835
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,520
Well, that's because you're a racist. So Norm Pattis is back to be a really sensitive white dude Wow

836
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,500
Yeah, so that was a great joke though, I guess

837
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,160
Just to remind people in case look I'm not noted stand-up comedian

838
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:13,280
I'm not saying that norm is racist because he says he's not racist. I say he's racist because he

839
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:21,460
Nom, this was two weeks ago. I tried my debut at stand-up comedy the other night at a small club in Connecticut

840
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,200
And I ended my riff with the following

841
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,360
Hey, you know, I tried to buy woke insurance the other day that the crowd looked at me. What's woke insurance?

842
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,800
well

843
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:35,080
Woke insurance is what you need if you're a white man because I'm reading the paper and everything that's wrong with this country is my

844
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,200
Fault, how am I gonna pay for all of this?

845
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,760
I need well insurance and we're at a point where you know that sort of humor

846
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:47,600
It isn't necessarily farcical any longer it is I think that you know in comedy

847
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:53,280
There's some things that are evergreen like I could probably hear some Mitch Hedberg one-liners, right?

848
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,640
They've heard a hundred times. Well, it's still my insurance bit

849
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:03,400
This guy tried to give me my insurance for a donut I said, I don't need insurance for a donut

850
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,880
I used to be racist still am but I used to do

851
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,920
Boy racist Mitch Hedberg is a new character norm

852
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,920
Norm Hedberg

853
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,360
Don't let him tell you

854
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,080
All right, I'm gonna die so

855
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:40,140
Norm is a is a real sensitive gentleman love a racist escalator

856
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,560
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm gonna get lost to that for a while

857
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,080
Yeah, we can't do that too long if you if something if you get inspired, please feel free. I would know

858
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,680
Racist Mitch Hedberg is gonna live in my brain forever

859
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,760
So Alex wants to pair up Francis Boyle, yeah the guy who

860
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,760
Directed 28 days later

861
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,080
Danny Boyle, okay

862
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,480
Francis Boyle is the guy who Alex has on to talk about the Wuhan lab

863
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:16,640
All right, all these people are Nazi scientists and what-have-you. He wants to get Francis Boyle and norm together to

864
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,200
Have a lawsuit against me or sure do it. Yeah, let's get it done

865
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,360
So that's pretty funny

866
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:30,680
But then Mike down for this because Alex explains to Norm that the vaccines are dangerous and Norm's response is

867
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,080
Hilarious, okay

868
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,380
I've got to get him with norm pass these other lawyers so that we can go with this

869
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:42,620
It is great to file and say religious exemption First Amendment Trump's your BS totally reasonable

870
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,140
I believe that Norm's right to sue on that but we need other suits because this is new what's happening of them

871
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:52,220
shoehorning a genetic engineering totally different system in

872
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:58,020
I mean if I injected with cyanide and called it a vaccine would I get liability protection if I injected you with one?

873
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:03,260
This is a mutinogenic system. So I didn't get you on to preach at you norm. I'm just really pissed about this

874
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,260
You're taking action. You're a man of action. We salute you. I gotta get you a doctor

875
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,300
Boyle who's on with us tomorrow. We're gonna tape to air and layer at four o'clock tomorrow. I'm gonna send it to you

876
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,620
I'm gonna get you his number because I think you guys teaming up is gonna be huge. I'm gonna stop ranting

877
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,700
But give me your take on what I just said. I

878
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,540
Don't know enough about it to have an intelligent take what what you're telling me is that

879
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:30,580
significant portions of what has been sold in the name of public health is actually a pretext for something else and has

880
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:37,180
Implicit dangers that we're not being warned about if that is in fact true. That's an outrageous violation of trust

881
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:45,260
Look, well, we have laws in the United States that says a person is free to refuse medical treatment unless and and and and

882
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:52,040
In order to accept it. They must give informed consent. Now. I took the vaccine. I got double shots of Pfizer

883
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,940
Nobody warned me about any gene therapy or anything like that

884
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:01,460
So as far as I knew I was taking a vaccine that was tested under exigent circumstances

885
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:07,820
To meet an emergency. I've you know, I think I'm alright, you know, I'm like, maybe I'll be here tomorrow

886
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:13,140
Maybe I won't but what you're telling me is is that is basically pay better attention to what's going on

887
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:17,780
And I'm ashamed to say I haven't you know, let's be clear. You're a marathon runner. I saw you in the salad during the

888
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,220
Fuck I saw you eating a salad

889
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,300
I saw you eating a salad. I love the

890
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,500
Saw you eating a salad

891
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:31,460
I love the idea that Alex is sitting there and he's telling him like all this scary stuff and Norm's like I

892
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,820
Got the vaccine. Oh, no

893
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:41,340
It's funny when people take Alex seriously and try to restate the things back to him that he said

894
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:48,460
And try and act like they give a shit about kidding. Oh, I took the vaccine and now I'm worried. Oh

895
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,700
I was so scared

896
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:56,480
I had no idea that the guy who show I have been on a

897
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,320
Consistently for the past several years

898
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:07,860
Said that vaccines had something inside them that could kill you. This is breaking information to me the guy who I

899
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:14,860
Weirdly am on his show a whole bunch. Mm-hmm has been for a year saying don't get this vaccine

900
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:19,820
I got both of them. I got him immediately. I'm not as soon as I could now. I'm scared

901
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:27,100
I'm so worried that I'm gonna be oh, oh Alex. I could drop dead at any moment couldn't I?

902
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,540
I will say that he has the acting chops of most comedians that I've met. That's fair

903
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,480
You might fit in sensitive way, too

904
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:40,700
Right in there. Oh, yeah, so Alex has another guest after after Norm bails

905
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:46,200
Because he's so worried. He's got to get this vaccine out of him. He's got he's going out there. No

906
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,780
I'll give ball if I donate enough blood. I won't have any more vaccine in me

907
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:57,760
I imagine that's what he figured that does sound right. So he has Alex now has another person on and woohoo Nelly

908
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:02,320
So doctor, thank you. Dr. Carrie my day for joining us

909
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,760
I'm not gonna go over your whole bio

910
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,120
But here is a shot of it for TV viewers all the different places you've worked universities and hospitals and clinics

911
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,120
So Carrie my day is not a prestigious doctor

912
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,360
Who's been right about all this vaccine stuff the way Alex is gonna try to present her

913
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,320
She's a QAnon lunatic who's committed a series of public

914
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,440
Embarrassments that the audience that people like her and Alex have cultivated they're trained to ignore

915
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:29,000
Right an article in Vice pointed out a particularly sad instance of Carrie just believing whatever bullshit

916
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,520
She saw online quote this past summer

917
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,400
She was convinced that a long debunked website advertising the cannibal club restaurant in Los Angeles

918
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:43,080
Was in fact a real eatery serving human flesh. We taste like pork. She tweeted dear God

919
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:49,460
Help us change the world for the better. Oh boy. Carrie is an osteopath which on its own isn't necessarily a bad sign

920
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:56,420
However being an osteopath on Alex's show who also believes QAnon shit means to me that this is just a person pretending to be

921
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,560
A doctor. Yeah. Yeah

922
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:03,020
I was really I was really fascinated when she was like see what happens is if you eat a ferret

923
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,680
But then go to the cannibal club. It takes a year to digest the ferret true

924
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:12,480
But if you eat a person it only takes a week see it's reverse dog years situations at the animal club

925
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,480
It makes perfect sense

926
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:19,840
And also, I don't know if you remember this person because she has popped up on the show before but her big decline

927
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,400
Her big claim to fame wasn't saying that like kovat vaccines are gonna kill people

928
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,080
Her initial rise to prominence was based around a very not true claim that mr

929
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:34,200
Na would alter people's DNA. This in turn would change their DNA into something that would be patented in advance

930
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,080
So now your DNA was someone else's intellectual property

931
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,640
Bad

932
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:47,440
Conspiracy. Yeah, it's real dumb. But that's what she that's what she wrote. That's the wave she wrote in on

933
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:53,240
I it really bums me out. It really bums me out that these people don't understand

934
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,920
There are way cheaper ways

935
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,720
for corporations to steal money from all of us and they do it cheaply

936
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,200
This is so absurdly complex go if they're stealing your money at a regular low

937
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,840
Boring level. Yeah, they don't need conspiracies. No, as long as things like check cashing places

938
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,040
Or at least exist unregulated

939
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,800
That kind of stuff like why would anyone ever need to create oh

940
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:28,560
My yeah. Oh Jesus so stupid. Yeah, I mean you're you're evil Bill Gates

941
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:33,160
Who's the most evil man in the world who hates everybody who's creating this vaccine to kill?

942
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:39,640
Everybody is against fucking making a generic version of the vaccine that can be sent out around the world

943
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:47,160
He's actually doing the things that they say he's doing by not doing the thing that they say he's doing. Yeah, it's complicated

944
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Yeah, sorry

945
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,960
Carrie is on and she has some bad news about periods

946
01:06:53,600 --> 01:07:00,620
In one day I asked my members I said does anyone have any problems with their menstrual cycle infertility, etc

947
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,240
since

948
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:07,040
Being around someone who's been vaccinated and I had over 700

949
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,480
Responses within six to twelve hours. It's unbelievable

950
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,760
This is anecdotal and I do not trust the reporting of weirdo Carrie Maday followers online

951
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:21,400
Hmm, this is just one of the new trendy things that anti-vaxxers anti-vaxxers are pushing

952
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,120
It's the idea that people who've been vaccinated or shedding diseases that are affecting people around them

953
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,360
Yeah

954
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:32,560
This is why Mike Adams insists people stay away from vaccinated people and why that dumb school in Florida banned teachers who had been

955
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,760
Vaccinated a recent article in the New York Times deals with this in no uncertain terms quote

956
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:42,080
Vaccinated people can't shed anything because there's nothing to be shedding said. Dr

957
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:49,000
Celine Gounder a infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and a member of President Biden's transitionary

958
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,360
Advisory team on the corona virus quote to the people who shed virus are people who have COVID

959
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,020
So if you want to prevent yourself or others from shedding virus

960
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:01,260
The best way to do that is to get vaccinated so you don't get COVID very interesting

961
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:07,920
Very interesting take from her if Carrie wants to make this conspiracy stick. She's basically gonna need to create a new theory of medicine

962
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
Yes, which would be interesting

963
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,800
Uh, Dan, I've got a new theory of medicine for you. Uh-huh. The Lord's will

964
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,780
Okay. So what about what does God think about nanotech loves it?

965
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:24,640
Another top five things for God is a very interesting possibility is because we're using nanotechnology

966
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,480
Because they have the ability to be like antennas or uses biosensors

967
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:36,200
What if they actually are emitting some kind of frequency out there? This is I know it sounds sci-fi

968
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,480
But it's a possibility not just sounds dumb

969
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:45,680
Um, what if what if these shots are putting nanotech into us? What is Dan? Yep. What if

970
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,920
What if Dan? Mm-hmm? What if all right now hear me out on this none of our left feet are real

971
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,000
Whoa, none of them shit all of this

972
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:02,020
Everybody has one foot right foot only the left foot all nanobots

973
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,600
Created by the devil. What if Dan?

974
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:12,700
How does this what does this have to do with the Human Genome Project being made to get Nephilim DNA?

975
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,320
Well, that's where they got the Nephilim DNA. They removed all of our feet

976
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:26,400
Hurting me with your bullshit. Yeah, I mean like we just had Steve quail on the other day. Yeah, like what are we doing?

977
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:31,480
I'm struggling with all of the bullshit. You guys are expecting me to handle. Yeah, it's a lot

978
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,160
It's a lot but these are really serious concerns and it does turn out

979
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:41,060
I was kind of surprised to learn the carry is still worried about people having patented DNA

980
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:41,440
Sure

981
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:47,760
And everybody needs to know this that if any of these synthetic genes which the spike protein has

982
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:53,320
Synthetic genes in them if the synthetic gene gets integrated into our genome

983
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:58,040
Which can happen because we have enzymes in our body that can do that

984
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,020
If that happens then you can be owned by

985
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,900
Whoever owns that patent overnight

986
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:11,700
The Supreme Court Justice has ruled that a human being can be owned if they have a synthetic gene or genome

987
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:18,980
Inside of them. What's that court decision interesting interesting decision for Justice John Roberts to wait

988
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:22,880
Are you mmm-hmm? What's that court decision? I would like to know

989
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,000
Like that one. I fucking don't know the Supreme Court. So

990
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,560
Um, look, I don't find this person all that interesting. Oh, no

991
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:37,000
I think that she's a QAnon weirdo who has a bunch of really dumb ideas that aren't based on anything

992
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,280
But

993
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,280
This interview devolves

994
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:42,920
Okay

995
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:49,400
And it turns into a story of her getting inducted into the globalist cult or something

996
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,440
unclear

997
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:59,160
All right. Now you're selling me. Here we go. Okay describe that meeting where this whole scientific dictatorship tried to recruit you

998
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,200
Yes, this was actually a business owners meeting and we had to be bust into the

999
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,640
Location our cell phones were jammed. This is around 2014 and

1000
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:16,520
We were locked in the building until the meeting was done. And this was a lot of big tech people CNN, etc, etc

1001
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,880
I was a small fish and in there they talked about how they were going to change and modify

1002
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,700
the behavior of the people of Georgia

1003
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:31,520
with using their smart device a health app on there and with somehow getting they didn't tell us how a

1004
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,880
Substance inside of their body that would be used as biosensors

1005
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:40,120
The idea is they felt people here are too racist and they're not amenable to different cultures

1006
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,760
so they took it upon themselves to change people and

1007
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:50,080
They talked this is how I know about all these substances inside these injections because this is how I learned about them

1008
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,240
they said these

1009
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:58,740
Substances would analyze your data your thoughts your emotions. They knew if you're lying by a voice inflection app

1010
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,160
Also, they knew if you're lying by a polygraph test with your sweat glands

1011
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:09,160
They can do that also your blood sugar level your electrolytes test your breathing also

1012
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:14,680
You know if you're having sex say you're interested in that if you're drinking alcohol if you're taking drugs

1013
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:18,200
They know everything about you literally they said they could do it

1014
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:23,160
So there's going to analyze this data and then they had an algorithm that a computer would

1015
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,560
be in charge of and every time you lied even a little white lie about where you were the

1016
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,800
This smartphone would know it immediately by these parameters and give you an instant repercussion

1017
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,640
and then also over let's say one to three months all the lies would be added up and then you would be

1018
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,720
Considered either a good human or a bad human

1019
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,360
Computer would allow you the social credit system or cryptocurrency

1020
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,960
You said this on my show this meeting happened man. Oh

1021
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,480
boy, yeah, we

1022
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:03,360
We are bringing together this meeting of the miracle on 34th Street friends to determine whether everyone has been good or bad

1023
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,120
I wonder like I if I were in the position that she is in

1024
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:14,240
One of the ways that I might make myself seem a little bit more credible. How's that provide details you think what's the name?

1025
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:19,360
Is organization who else was there? It's CNN. What why was CNN there? You see?

1026
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,960
No, see, you know

1027
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:28,880
Okay, it was there. Okay. Wait, so the goal is to make people less racist. Yeah, that's why they have CNN

1028
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,920
So that's why they have truth

1029
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,000
What is it what do you raise we can't go to MSNBC

1030
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:42,320
Shouldn't the story be that every time you're racist you lose points for your credit score. Isn't that only when you lie?

1031
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,560
What the fuck is going on? So if you're lying about being racist, you will be shocked

1032
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,960
Well, no, no, you're racist because you're sweet

1033
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,960
You won't be right. I

1034
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:01,680
Love I love the confidence and the worry with which she tells a story of people

1035
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,880
Really just

1036
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:11,200
Figuring out how magic works and using it in any and every possible way because all of that she just said is magic

1037
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,360
Yeah, I would assume that what she went to was like some kind of a get-rich-quick

1038
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,560
Motivational seminar or something like that. It's just completely changed

1039
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,520
Like one time I went to a Cutco meeting. Ooh accidentally you'll learn a life

1040
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,880
One way or another you'll learn how to cut a penny

1041
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,240
And that was the same kind of thing I was like you can't leave

1042
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:42,380
Maybe that's I don't know this this all just she probably bought a timeshare because that's basically when you're getting a timeshare presentation

1043
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:46,320
Eventually, you're going to think they're trying to kill everyone. Yeah. Oh

1044
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,840
No, they're gonna try and make and I bet that she was saying something racist

1045
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,760
Trying to make people less racist

1046
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,580
Okay, all right

1047
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:06,240
So anyway, Alex is super into this story because of course, of course, he was his dad was they tried to get a dentist

1048
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,080
Yeah, and when he was the smartest boy in Texas, they tried to get

1049
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:15,800
Into the globalist depopulation Texas, so Alex reveals something else here that I was unaware of

1050
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,520
Go back to how they recruited you to this because they do this to a lot of groups

1051
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,720
They go you'll be part of a special thinker group. These are over the best people, but this is proprietary information

1052
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,720
We can't let this out because this company only wants to give you this secret

1053
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:33,280
Did they have you sign a form agreeing to non disclose or what was it like to get put obviously not?

1054
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,480
And be taken there because they did this on 9-eleven at an Air Force Base

1055
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,640
They asked all these CEOs to come the day before said it was a national security emergency

1056
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:48,720
They put them all at 6 a.m. In there. They had jumbotron TVs the towers being blown up

1057
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:54,040
We don't they told him this day. They followed orders, but but that's and that even came out

1058
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:59,640
They did that by the way, you know that something secret happened on 9-eleven inside that that that hanger

1059
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, was this the day before or was it on 9-eleven? What were they shown?

1060
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:08,760
And well, they got talking they got brought there the day before right and they had a nice evening

1061
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,820
They had I like a little mixer sure right and then the next morning they get up

1062
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:19,720
They're all in line for the continental breakfast and they bring them and they're like, hey, hold on one second 9-elevens happening now

1063
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,320
Let's talk follow orders. Yeah, it seems like that's that's the story that I heard boy

1064
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,400
I know I don't know this is even like I've seen loose change

1065
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:36,520
Strange how many different things happened in the intervening time period between when they did and did not happen very weird

1066
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,260
Mm-hmm. So she talks a little bit more about this this meeting

1067
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,960
This is so stupid

1068
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:49,200
Well, I didn't really know what I was getting into. I thought this is just you know more for political reasons

1069
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:55,640
This is a good idea to join. I did it for a year. I had three different people and courage me and finally I went to

1070
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:02,320
The first meeting which I just described which I was completely taken aback. No one prepared me for that

1071
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:07,600
I tried to leave the building and they laughed at me and they said go ahead when they unlock the doors

1072
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,680
My cell phone still didn't work and I I didn't know where my car was obvious

1073
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,720
It was best in so I was stuck there and there was a non-disclosure in general that was signed but not for that particular meeting

1074
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
but

1075
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,680
It's a group so for a year they vetted you attested you watched you and then decided to try to bring in real first-level Wow

1076
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:37,440
Yes, and yeah, I don't care if I had a non-disclosure in the general sense because these are crimes against humanity

1077
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,680
Yeah, no shit. That's why there wouldn't be one. Yeah, that was just a regular old pyramids game. Yeah, that was a pyramids

1078
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:48,440
Yeah, that was a pyramid scheme. Non-disclosure agreements do not cover criminal activity. Everyone fucking knows that

1079
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:55,400
Yeah, how would you ever if you were running a secret taken over the world trying to control people with an anti-racism?

1080
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:02,800
App that will monitor their sweat and dock their pay if they do I was I I was going to turn the person in

1081
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:09,040
But then before I could testify against him, he married me. So it was against the law for me to testify against him

1082
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:14,840
We've all seen movies. Yeah. Yeah, it's like okay. I was gonna blow the whistle on Hitler, but I'd signed an NDA

1083
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:18,760
Yeah, you know you win some you lose. I went to the court and I told him all

1084
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,000
And they said you're not allowed to look this is an NDA. Yeah. Sorry ironclad

1085
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:31,720
Yeah, that that's the part of these supervillain fuck stories that are just so so much contract law. Yeah so much

1086
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:39,000
Inviolable contract law. Yeah, despite dealing with the literal devil himself known for deception

1087
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,840
somehow contract law

1088
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,120
inviolable I'm

1089
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:48,920
Almost certain. This was a pyramid scheme. Yeah, no, that's absolutely a pyramid. Yes

1090
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:55,340
No, I've heard that story way too many times to not know that's a pyramid scheme. This is the Nigerian JT

1091
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:05,120
Absolutely, yeah, so here's what we do everything makes sense like there's a year yeah of like people being like

1092
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,120
Hey, you should come to this Tupperware party

1093
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:14,200
Yeah, yeah boy is really cool not look. Okay. It's not you're not selling anything. What you're doing is you just get a

1094
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:20,600
Discount whenever you purchase something and then if other people use your numbers, they'll get a discount too

1095
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:25,640
But you'll get a little bead of that. It's it's the globalists are coming to kill you

1096
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:33,760
And they're like busing in to like a convention center or whatever. Yeah. Oh god

1097
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,080
and the laughing if you want to leave makes sense too because I want to bully people to

1098
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,460
Or make it seem like they're giving up something. They're foolish to leave right?

1099
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,920
Everything is just a bucket

1100
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,400
That is exactly how it works

1101
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:54,120
God what a fun but but I love how Alex gets so excited about it as opposed to dealing with this critically like

1102
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,440
There's no fucking way

1103
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,920
This happened. Like you said it. No, absolutely not

1104
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,320
Um, see anyway, that's the only thing I think is really fun about her

1105
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,840
now we come to the end of this and

1106
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,280
That gates was not mentioned once that does not surprise me Dan that does not surprise me

1107
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:21,360
How important it was to defend back gates initially and so important that you had to insert your own

1108
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,560
Personal story and Roger came on and Roger

1109
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:32,320
Was there to defend him? It seems like now in his hour of need dad in the most crucial juncture

1110
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,560
I've seen 48 hours 48 hours after the crime now Joel Greenberg has done him dirty done him dirty

1111
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:47,240
They gave him they knew I know he's lying they took I took a polygraph test with his sweat I know he's lying

1112
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:54,520
Oh, yeah, shocking shocking. That story was not cover so strange. So weird. So weird. It seems like that would be fair

1113
01:20:54,520 --> 01:21:00,880
There was a lot to cover like Alex and Paul Joseph Watson's anger at Muslims. Yes in norm Pat by the way

1114
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:06,460
Sensitivity about whiteness or well, they know what you went on doctor. Yeah

1115
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:13,080
there's people with DNA getting IP and now everybody's gonna die because of

1116
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:16,560
of globalists and yeah, they steal blood

1117
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:22,840
It's just one of the things too that I've started to recognize and notice about these older episodes that I've listened to like these

1118
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,560
2003 ones one of the real changes in

1119
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:32,820
That I've seen is like there are so fewer guests back then and I think it's because Alex doesn't have to do shit

1120
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,760
like he can eat a sandwich or he can let these

1121
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:43,440
dumb dumbs talk and like it's just so easy for him to have five guests on a show as opposed to

1122
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,040
Like covering anything. Yeah, his heart's not in the game. No

1123
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,520
This is a guy with senioritis. Yeah, I mean in his defense

1124
01:21:52,800 --> 01:22:00,080
Yeah, it sucks. Your show sucks the people you work with suck and you suck. Of course, it sucks

1125
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,440
Yeah, you should be having a bad time

1126
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,880
Anyway, Jordan, you've come to the end of this and man just embarrassing

1127
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,320
What

1128
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,160
What about this episode was embarrassing

1129
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:21,000
It's just like anybody who was looking at this from the outside would be aware that news had broken that's super relevant

1130
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,480
You would force yeah, and it's news in a story that they have dealt with

1131
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:31,360
Already vis-a-vis saying that Matt Gaetz just likes to party. Yeah, he loves to party

1132
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:36,560
It seems like the kind of thing might want to follow up on especially considering

1133
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,520
one of your

1134
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,760
on again off again employees

1135
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,440
Is in the mix well, and here's the here's the funniest part and not the funniest part. It's not funny

1136
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,360
It's a really fucked up situation sure

1137
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,840
But what's funny about Alex and them being so insistent on hey

1138
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,880
This is a guy who just likes to party is the the more details you find out the more you're like

1139
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,080
He didn't know she was 17 at the time. Mm-hmm. He didn't find out till later

1140
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:08,480
Oh, you know where that kind of shit happens if you're a guy that likes to party all the time

1141
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
Maybe you don't ask questions first

1142
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:17,800
Mmm, it sure seems to be a reasonable situation instead of one where you're making it so ridiculous that this guy could be

1143
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,400
Guilty of this crime sure, you know

1144
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,600
like you built the story that it fits it and to the extent that like

1145
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,120
sex workers shouldn't be

1146
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:34,400
Stigmatized absolutely as long as they're of age and everybody's consenting and everything. That's that's not like anything. I would

1147
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:41,280
Shame anybody about absolutely now, I'm more interested in the selling of pardons

1148
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,520
See now here's the fun thing about that one

1149
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,920
I almost and like I saw that and I was like, oh that's totally a crime and

1150
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,320
No one's going to follow up on that part

1151
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:59,480
They're gonna be like gates get him get him not the everyone knew that Trump was selling pardons for money. So

1152
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,160
everybody knew that so clearly

1153
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:09,800
You could text about it or you didn't have to go into like a parking lot somewhere or people in Trump's orbit

1154
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,600
We're selling influence. Yeah to persuade pardons, which yeah

1155
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:21,600
You know do one or the other is it appears to be what a lot of that conversation was about. Yeah, it's fucked up man

1156
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,040
Yeah, that's one of those things where Trump would be like

1157
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,860
Yeah, if you weren't trying to sell stuff off of my abilities, I would be disappointed in you

1158
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:33,020
You're not doing the job on you. I am I'm stealing. Yeah, you should be stealing too. I

1159
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:37,700
You know what? I'm confident Alex is gonna cover this on Monday. You think so

1160
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,960
You are way too confident. You are way too confident. I'm not gonna talk about a

1161
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,220
Tell Roger maybe gets arrested again

1162
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:53,980
And then he insists he's innocent. He's being framed. Who's Roger texting for? Hey, I got 250 K Bitcoin

1163
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:57,180
I could use a pardon right about now. Let me rephrase that who's Roger

1164
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:03,980
Never met the guy never heard of him. Yeah, we'll be back Jordan, but tell them we have a website

1165
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:06,860
We do have a website. It's knowledge right calm. We're also on Twitter
