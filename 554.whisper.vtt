Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

00:17.960 --> 00:20.960

00:20.960 --> 00:23.960
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:23.960 --> 00:24.960
knowledgefight

00:24.960 --> 00:26.960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:26.960 --> 00:29.960
you guys saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight

00:29.960 --> 00:31.960
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:31.960 --> 00:33.960
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

00:33.960 --> 00:36.960
I need, I need money

00:36.960 --> 00:38.960
Rattle her, rattle her, rattle her

00:38.960 --> 00:41.960
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:41.960 --> 00:44.960
Stop it, Andy and Kan, Andy and Kansas

00:44.960 --> 00:46.960
Andy and, Andy, it's time to pray

00:46.960 --> 00:48.960
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:48.960 --> 00:51.960
Hello Alex, I'm a victim, calling in with your Japan

00:51.960 --> 00:52.960
I love your world

00:52.960 --> 00:53.960
knowledgefight

00:53.960 --> 00:56.960
knowledgefight.com

00:56.960 --> 00:58.960
I love you

00:58.960 --> 01:00.960
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
I'm Jordan

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around and drink novelty beverages

01:03.960 --> 01:05.960
and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:05.960 --> 01:06.960
Oh indeed we are, Dan

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
Jordan

01:07.960 --> 01:10.960
Oh wait, sorry, we worship at the cult of the altar of Selene

01:10.960 --> 01:12.960
Yes, that's what we do, we worship at the altar

01:12.960 --> 01:13.960
Yeah, there we go

01:13.960 --> 01:14.960
Dan

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
Yes

01:15.960 --> 01:16.960
Dan

01:16.960 --> 01:17.960
Jordan

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
Quick question

01:18.960 --> 01:19.960
What's your bright spot today?

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
My bright spot, why don't you go first?

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
Why don't I go first?

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
I might need to kick it around a little bit

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
Okay

01:23.960 --> 01:24.960
Because I was about to say granola again

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
Oh, you can't say granola twice

01:25.960 --> 01:26.960
Deep into granola

01:26.960 --> 01:27.960
You can't say granola twice

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
Yeah, I know

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
My bright spot, Dan, is around this time of year

01:30.960 --> 01:34.960
Every year my cousin and I get together and we go to a ball game

01:34.960 --> 01:36.960
I don't know if you know this or not, Dan, but

01:36.960 --> 01:37.960
I know you love the stick

01:37.960 --> 01:39.960
I appreciate the game of baseballs

01:39.960 --> 01:41.960
True, you love the steals

01:41.960 --> 01:46.960
And we didn't get to do that last year and this year we just got the tickets and we're going to a game

01:46.960 --> 01:47.960
Oh, that's great

01:47.960 --> 01:50.960
It feels so amazing, it feels so amazing

01:50.960 --> 01:53.960
I'm like shivering with excitement, I can't wait to go

01:53.960 --> 01:54.960
That's great

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
It'll be amazing

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
Who are they playing? Who are the Cobes playing?

01:56.960 --> 01:57.960
Who cares?

01:57.960 --> 01:58.960
Oh, wow, okay

01:58.960 --> 01:59.960
Also, it's the Pirates, so who cares?

01:59.960 --> 02:03.960
But again, the Cubs are terrible this year, so again, who cares?

02:03.960 --> 02:04.960
Alright

02:04.960 --> 02:05.960
They're probably going to lose

02:05.960 --> 02:07.960
Alright, let's see, what do I got?

02:07.960 --> 02:11.960
I guess, I don't know, it's tough, this is sort of a hypothetical bright spot

02:11.960 --> 02:12.960
Alright, I'm listening

02:12.960 --> 02:18.960
I think I feel comfortable enough to maybe try to check out a gym again

02:18.960 --> 02:19.960
Ooh

02:19.960 --> 02:20.960
You know, like, we're vaccinated

02:20.960 --> 02:23.960
That's good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that is a bright spot

02:23.960 --> 02:27.960
I think even wearing a mask, I think we're at a point where I could feel comfortable

02:27.960 --> 02:31.960
Whereas, you know, like before, certainly there was no ability to exist in that kind of space

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
Oh, for sure

02:32.960 --> 02:34.960
Well, I mean, your last visit to the gym was

02:34.960 --> 02:35.960
Pretty bad

02:35.960 --> 02:37.960
Nightmare-ish, hellish, yeah

02:37.960 --> 02:41.960
It was a little, scary to see that level of

02:41.960 --> 02:45.960
It was passive manslaughter, is that one way of putting it?

02:45.960 --> 02:49.960
I think it might have worked out better than passive manslaughter

02:49.960 --> 02:50.960
Sure

02:50.960 --> 02:51.960
But it certainly was not for lack of trying

02:51.960 --> 02:52.960
No, no

02:52.960 --> 02:53.960
There was a lot of irresponsibility going on

02:53.960 --> 02:54.960
Yeah

02:54.960 --> 02:55.960
Did not care for it

02:55.960 --> 02:56.960
Yeah

02:56.960 --> 02:57.960
But I feel like it's about time

02:57.960 --> 02:58.960
That's great

02:58.960 --> 02:59.960
I feel pretty good about that

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
Yeah

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
I always enjoy going to the gym

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
Spring

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
Yep

03:03.960 --> 03:06.960
Time to go out, hit the beach of Lake Shore

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
Sure

03:07.960 --> 03:09.960
Take your shirt off and really just, ugh

03:09.960 --> 03:10.960
Sure

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
You know

03:11.960 --> 03:13.960
I was down by the lake the other day

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
What were you doing?

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
On rocks

03:15.960 --> 03:17.960
What were you doing wandering around on rocks?

03:17.960 --> 03:18.960
Considering jumping in

03:18.960 --> 03:19.960
Were you?

03:19.960 --> 03:20.960
No

03:20.960 --> 03:21.960
Were you doing

03:21.960 --> 03:22.960
Just enjoying the lake, it was a nice day

03:22.960 --> 03:23.960
Were you doing an Abilify commercial?

03:23.960 --> 03:24.960
I was

03:24.960 --> 03:25.960
Was that what was happening right there?

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
Staring off into the middle distance?

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
It was a nice day

03:27.960 --> 03:30.960
So, Jordan, today we have an interesting episode to go over

03:30.960 --> 03:32.960
We're going to be talking about April 30th, 2021

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
Blackpink!

03:33.960 --> 03:34.960
I was going to say I'm banned

03:34.960 --> 03:35.960
I didn't even

03:35.960 --> 03:37.960
You almost said I'm dead

03:37.960 --> 03:38.960
Shit

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
2021, I'm glad I'm dead

03:40.960 --> 03:42.960
This is Unforced Error on my part

03:42.960 --> 03:44.960
Yeah, well, I said Black Deck?

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
I think so

03:45.960 --> 03:47.960
I don't think either of us succeeded

03:47.960 --> 03:49.960
Yeah, this is a terrible idea

03:49.960 --> 03:53.960
So, yeah, I said on our last episode that we were going to be covering the end of the

03:53.960 --> 03:54.960
week

03:54.960 --> 03:55.960
Yes

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
You know, because Rudy Giuliani's

03:56.960 --> 03:57.960
Of course

03:57.960 --> 03:58.960
Got raided and what have you

03:58.960 --> 03:59.960
Yeah, we gotta figure out what's going on there

03:59.960 --> 04:07.960
I couldn't waste time with that because on Thursday, news broke about Roger Stone's involvement

04:07.960 --> 04:08.960
in the Matt Gaetz affair

04:08.960 --> 04:14.960
I don't recall anything beyond somebody thinking, here's what I'm going to do

04:14.960 --> 04:16.960
I'm going to give Roger Stone

04:16.960 --> 04:17.960
Mm-hmm

04:17.960 --> 04:21.960
Roger, I have a tattoo of Richard Nixon on my back stone

04:21.960 --> 04:22.960
Yes

04:22.960 --> 04:23.960
Incriminating evidence

04:23.960 --> 04:28.960
I'm going to write a confession letter and give it to sneaky Roger Stone

04:28.960 --> 04:36.960
I am going to give this crucial piece of evidence to the single worst person to ever

04:36.960 --> 04:41.960
And I will keep snapshots of offers of bribes to get a pardon

04:41.960 --> 04:47.960
Yeah, there was a Daily Beast article that was pretty bad looking

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
Pretty damning

04:48.960 --> 04:52.960
I mean, look, anything could be fake

04:52.960 --> 04:57.960
No, no, here's why it's so believable

04:57.960 --> 04:58.960
Uh-huh

04:58.960 --> 04:59.960
Because

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
The players involved act like themselves

05:00.960 --> 05:03.960
Exactly, and everybody's so stupid

05:03.960 --> 05:09.960
Nobody's doing anything like, even a half-assed attempt at Googling how to not get arrested

05:09.960 --> 05:12.960
for these specific crimes would be like, don't give it to Roger Stone

05:12.960 --> 05:18.960
Well, and the part of it that makes it even more believable on a personal level for me

05:18.960 --> 05:23.960
is that they had their texting app set to delete the messages

05:23.960 --> 05:24.960
Yes

05:24.960 --> 05:26.960
And Roger followed through with that

05:26.960 --> 05:27.960
Of course

05:27.960 --> 05:28.960
Whereas Joel Greenberg did not

05:28.960 --> 05:29.960
Ah, now that's where we're in

05:29.960 --> 05:31.960
That strikes me as genuine

05:31.960 --> 05:32.960
That's good stuff

05:32.960 --> 05:33.960
Yeah

05:33.960 --> 05:36.960
So that came out, I was like, well, the 30th is gonna be fucked up

05:36.960 --> 05:38.960
Friday's gotta be fucked up

05:38.960 --> 05:39.960
Of course

05:39.960 --> 05:43.960
His buddy is like on the hook here in this Daily Beast article

05:43.960 --> 05:48.960
talking with this guy who's admitting to having sex with a 17-year-old for money

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
There's a problem

05:49.960 --> 05:51.960
Trying to get Roger, Alex's buddy

05:51.960 --> 05:52.960
To get him a pardon

05:52.960 --> 05:55.960
To get a pardon from Trump, and it appears through the texts

05:55.960 --> 05:56.960
Sounds damning

05:56.960 --> 05:57.960
That Roger is like, that's a thing that's done

05:57.960 --> 06:00.960
250K, yeah, no big deal

06:00.960 --> 06:01.960
Wow

06:01.960 --> 06:04.960
So big news day for Alex

06:04.960 --> 06:10.960
I am gonna put $250,000 worth of Bitcoin on Roger Stone not calling in on Friday

06:10.960 --> 06:12.960
He does not show up

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
That is not a surprise

06:13.960 --> 06:15.960
I will spoil that

06:15.960 --> 06:17.960
I will take my 250,000 please

06:17.960 --> 06:23.960
I didn't agree to that, but Roger is, he is not to be found

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
Not to be seen

06:24.960 --> 06:26.960
My lawyers have told me to pray more

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
We do get a lawyer show up

06:28.960 --> 06:29.960
Oh yeah, that's not surprising

06:29.960 --> 06:34.960
Yup, so Jordan, we'll get into this and see what Alex's response is

06:34.960 --> 06:36.960
But before we do, I gotta take a little moment and say thank you

06:36.960 --> 06:38.960
And welcome in some wonks

06:38.960 --> 06:39.960
So first

06:39.960 --> 06:40.960
That's a great idea

06:40.960 --> 06:42.960
Someone tried to catfish my mom with a picture of Alex Jones

06:42.960 --> 06:43.960
And now I'm here

06:43.960 --> 06:44.960
Thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk

06:44.960 --> 06:45.960
I'm a policy wonk

06:45.960 --> 06:46.960
Thank you very much

06:46.960 --> 06:49.960
I assume the path that everyone took to our show

06:49.960 --> 06:50.960
Sure

06:50.960 --> 06:52.960
Next, actual biblical Satan

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
Thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk

06:53.960 --> 06:54.960
I'm a policy wonk

06:54.960 --> 06:56.960
Aww, thanks buddy, hail Satan

06:56.960 --> 06:58.960
Next, human cat Rymera

06:58.960 --> 07:00.960
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

07:00.960 --> 07:01.960
I'm a policy wonk

07:01.960 --> 07:04.960
Oh, thank you very much, human cat Rymera

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
Thank you

07:05.960 --> 07:06.960
Next, Fruitsie Collins

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
Thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk

07:08.960 --> 07:09.960
I'm a policy wonk

07:09.960 --> 07:11.960
Thank you very much, Fruitsie Collins

07:11.960 --> 07:12.960
Thank you

07:12.960 --> 07:13.960
And, Bianca Donk

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
I'm a policy wonk

07:16.960 --> 07:18.960
Thank you very much, Bianca Donk

07:18.960 --> 07:20.960
Every time I read their name I cannot think

07:20.960 --> 07:21.960
Honky-tonk

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
Bianca Donk

07:23.960 --> 07:25.960
Remember that song, Honky-Tonk but Donkey-Donk?

07:25.960 --> 07:27.960
I do, remember Honky-Tonk but Donkey-Donk

07:27.960 --> 07:34.840
It's man. What a great time in culture. You know what's weird every time you remember something I get sadder. I

07:36.960 --> 07:39.240
Don't know why I need to retain the memory

07:42.920 --> 07:46.880
No, there's so many things you know that song is one of the main reasons I hate the doors

07:51.160 --> 07:56.800
All right end the episode we have to end after that that was perfect you won you won you won you won

07:56.800 --> 08:04.000
Podcast well, I'd like to take that win and transition it over into wishing happy birthday to Ying out there

08:04.000 --> 08:08.560
I don't know when Ying's birthday is but it's in May from what I understand. Somewhere around yes

08:08.560 --> 08:12.360
And I also don't know the name of the person who wished them a happy birthday

08:12.360 --> 08:16.920
Why would you? That's not important. The screen name is Dan didn't say my joke name. See there you go

08:19.000 --> 08:20.680
Sometime in May

08:20.680 --> 08:25.920
Looks like you've been had. Sometime in May there is a person out there named Ying

08:25.920 --> 08:32.120
Who has a birthday and also an anniversary with a person whose screen name is Dan didn't say my joke name

08:33.080 --> 08:36.280
So it's vague. Here's here's what I love about us what?

08:36.800 --> 08:43.520
Shows wouldn't do this what we're doing right now sure but two shows that did do this would do follow-up stuff

08:43.960 --> 08:47.280
But that's why you come to us you come to us for us to

08:47.720 --> 08:52.320
Vaguely know a little bit enough to be like you're great like to suggest

08:52.320 --> 08:59.400
Yeah, yeah, so Jordan, let's get into it April 30th. All right Friday. Let's do it

09:00.240 --> 09:02.320
Alex's show started with some troubling news

09:03.160 --> 09:10.080
That comes was it that Matt Gates? No, no, it's troubling news that comes in the form of the voiceover

09:11.080 --> 09:14.080
Coming to you live from the infowars.com

09:14.080 --> 09:27.280
studios in the recaptured state of Texas I'm glad you responded that way because I couldn't tell if we've talked about that before

09:30.960 --> 09:37.040
What did they recapture it from oh, I don't know it was occupied text. Yes, very entire career

09:37.040 --> 09:43.000
It's been occupied but then we deliver it it was FEMA region sick, but then he was liberated for a while wasn't it?

09:43.560 --> 09:48.640
I don't think so. I think what there was a time was it was like a state currently turning blue

09:50.600 --> 09:52.600
Yeah, I guess it's been recaptured

09:54.320 --> 09:57.920
Yeah, maybe that's meant to be like recaptured by democratic

09:58.440 --> 10:00.440
I don't know. I mean the more

10:00.440 --> 10:07.720
Latinx people are allowed to vote in Texas the more it is being recaptured from from the colonialists. So that's nice

10:07.720 --> 10:12.400
Yeah, I thought I was strange and I think I might have heard that before in the past

10:12.400 --> 10:17.040
But it struck me as very new and I don't know what it's in reference to. It struck me

10:17.040 --> 10:24.040
Yeah struck me. Um, so I recaptured who got it Alex. Oh, okay and and Joe Rogan good for them

10:24.040 --> 10:30.720
Yeah, good for them. So Alex starts the show off with some Lana Del Rey and it is also rude

10:30.880 --> 10:34.280
No, it's it's it's more aggressive. Okay, some of the more

10:35.080 --> 10:36.480
more

10:36.480 --> 10:44.280
Symphonic moody or Lana Del Rey songs, but it's too loud and they did not mix this. Well, I am your host Alex Jones

10:44.640 --> 10:46.640
I'm extremely honored

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
And blessed to be here

10:49.360 --> 10:52.040
I want to lay out a great truth to you

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
the car up front

10:54.480 --> 10:58.360
And then I'm gonna give you more evidences of it. You're a very small planet

10:59.400 --> 11:05.240
Hurdling through space orbiting a standard yellow star two-thirds of the way out of the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy

11:05.880 --> 11:09.340
Get up, there are seven and a half plus million people on this planet

11:09.860 --> 11:17.080
The globalists see themselves as guardians of the earth guardians of the galaxy what and that they are doing almost our disease stunning

11:17.080 --> 11:22.800
Poisoning dumbing down and then culling of the human population

11:23.360 --> 11:23.880
Sure

11:23.880 --> 11:26.600
And when you see their approach to animals you see their same approach to us

11:26.800 --> 11:31.200
The EU has laws have been placed for more than a decade now that you don't take a sheep into a slaughterhouse

11:32.080 --> 11:34.080
And hit it in the head with a hammer

11:34.680 --> 11:37.760
That's too crude. You know, it kills it pretty much right away or knocks it out

11:38.400 --> 11:42.720
Everybody was selling parties for money. What do you got to finish and then you butcher it?

11:42.720 --> 11:48.960
And so that's what they're doing is poisoning us dumbing us down with drugs and electro magnetic radiation

11:49.920 --> 11:51.920
in all systems

11:52.280 --> 11:57.320
And psychologically confusing is taking God away from us separating us from God sure

11:57.320 --> 12:00.760
So we don't have any North Star sure and then we'll be so stunned

12:01.800 --> 12:03.440
so diseased

12:03.440 --> 12:09.000
So much in a mesmerized sleep state, right, but they'll be able to then go ahead and gut us

12:09.000 --> 12:15.960
Chop us up nicely and in the species as we know it. So these super predators can play God, right?

12:15.960 --> 12:19.400
We're not I think I just heard that Matt Gates was going to jail

12:19.400 --> 12:23.480
I don't know what you heard. All I heard is just stuff you can just say no

12:24.080 --> 12:29.840
No, I don't know what humane practices at slaughterhouses have to do with those. That's

12:31.040 --> 12:36.200
Cuz you got it in the slaughterhouse no country for old men. That was a book and a movie

12:36.200 --> 12:40.720
I just I just hear Alex saying things that I just just reject. Yeah

12:41.600 --> 12:46.940
No, that's that's a that's one of those things where somebody's still in time. Yeah, and after a while you just go

12:49.200 --> 12:53.280
Screw you don't care or exactly what you were doing is like isn't there something you should be talking?

12:53.280 --> 12:58.640
Yeah, yeah, it's good. Hey, aren't there crimes? Didn't you go? Didn't y'all?

13:01.080 --> 13:07.280
Seems like you would be talking about all of them crimes. Yeah, Alex gets you know, we just just just talking through it

13:07.280 --> 13:11.920
Just got to get through it. They need to bankrupt us and put us in to a

13:12.520 --> 13:16.920
Position of total control and that's what all of this is about

13:18.360 --> 13:20.360
But here are the really huge

13:20.360 --> 13:22.360
gigantic

13:22.600 --> 13:24.480
issues

13:24.480 --> 13:26.480
everybody needs to be made aware of

13:27.440 --> 13:29.440
and that is

13:30.160 --> 13:32.160
Many of us

13:38.520 --> 13:40.520
Into a post

13:40.680 --> 13:46.040
Human world. Oh man, a special report just starts playing somebody

13:46.040 --> 13:52.080
Somebody in there is I'm telling you dad. Somebody won. The music was too loud. Yeah, we've seen too many

13:52.880 --> 13:56.040
Appropriate song choices. I think it's real

13:56.040 --> 13:59.760
Also, I don't know if I have a clip of it, but Alex played Tarzan boy on this

14:00.080 --> 14:06.280
Which he hasn't played in a really long time. I'm telling you there's a secret patriot inside the Infowars studio

14:06.280 --> 14:09.040
Here's the sending messages. Here's the problem

14:09.040 --> 14:15.840
It's that like the line between fucking with Alex and incompetence is indiscernible. Oh, no, it's impossible to know

14:17.120 --> 14:19.560
There's nothing better than that noise. He made I know

14:24.280 --> 14:30.480
It's just that moment of real resignation, yeah, just like this is how it is

14:30.480 --> 14:33.560
He's too tired to even get mad. This is how it's going to be

14:33.560 --> 14:38.560
This is how it was. This is how it's gonna be for the future. I love it

14:41.000 --> 14:45.320
So Alex has a special report that he wants to play and it might have been that one that started

14:46.240 --> 14:49.120
Accidentally, I'm not entirely sure here. He sets that up

14:50.000 --> 14:55.240
But let me get these part of a report Gregory strongly puts out three to five minute reports. They're all excellent. I

14:56.160 --> 14:58.280
Called him up at six o'clock last night

14:58.280 --> 15:03.760
and I said Greg will you stay late tonight and tomorrow morning and get out a report on this because

15:03.880 --> 15:08.640
Joe Rogan had the courage to have this guest on who's a big investigative journalist the Washington Post

15:08.640 --> 15:15.280
And that was two days ago last night three days ago today, and it didn't get any coverage because they know it's true

15:15.280 --> 15:17.240
They don't want to attack Joe Rogan for oh, yeah

15:17.240 --> 15:23.320
The Washington Post reporter on about Fauci being on lab and the leak and covering it up

15:23.320 --> 15:27.760
Which is true and which is huge but to have this come out and Joe Rogan cover it is massive

15:27.760 --> 15:29.760
If we can force this story out

15:30.480 --> 15:32.480
This this this could really

15:33.480 --> 15:39.200
Devastate the New World Order their whole operation. So recently Rogan had an episode where he talked to a guy named Josh Rogan

15:39.880 --> 15:44.240
Rogin sure not really. No. No, I understand this Joe and Josh Rogan

15:44.240 --> 15:47.320
I got this guy's a reporter who worked for the Washington Post

15:47.320 --> 15:51.320
I watched the relevant part of the interview and I don't find it to be super convincing

15:51.480 --> 15:55.560
That said Josh was explaining to Rogan why the theory that the virus

15:55.560 --> 15:59.520
Started in that Wuhan lab is not necessarily completely crazy

15:59.760 --> 16:05.360
He doesn't prove or even claim definitively that he has information that Fauci or the lab is responsible for the outbreak

16:05.360 --> 16:10.920
He's just reiterating information that's been widely publicly discussed over the entire last year

16:11.080 --> 16:14.760
There's some circumstantial evidence that makes people think that it got loose from a lab

16:14.760 --> 16:18.680
There's some circumstantial evidence that makes it look like the virus was naturally occurring

16:18.920 --> 16:23.400
That's not even a new or controversial thing to say. Yeah, it's just that

16:23.400 --> 16:29.600
Generally experts who have looked at it feel that the natural explanation is far more likely. Yeah

16:29.600 --> 16:31.200
No, there was like it two weeks ago

16:31.200 --> 16:37.920
There was another story where it's like DoD can't rule out a possibility and you're like, well, yeah, of course not

16:37.920 --> 16:43.340
They're a bunch of yeah proving a negative is really really hard and unless it's a binary possibility

16:43.340 --> 16:48.320
Right and you prove the affirmative right like it's very difficult. And so obviously

16:48.320 --> 16:53.340
Obviously people who are talking about this seriously deal with it

16:54.560 --> 17:00.120
Only unserious people would be like there is no possible way I declare upon

17:00.600 --> 17:06.040
Yeah, yeah, like and people like Alex will create that of their opposition

17:06.040 --> 17:09.760
They will create that straw man of their opposition cuz that's easier to argue again

17:09.760 --> 17:10.240
Yeah

17:10.240 --> 17:16.920
so Josh kind of seems like a little bit of a dick only because I don't believe that he's unaware of what he's doing like

17:16.920 --> 17:21.180
He's not some guy on his first press appearance. He's a guy with a career in media

17:21.280 --> 17:27.680
He knows that what he's doing is lending the credibility of his mainstream media credentials to be used exactly how Alex is using this clip

17:27.680 --> 17:29.040
on his show now

17:29.040 --> 17:35.440
Unless Josh had some actual evidence of anything the behavior he displayed in that interview is at best irresponsible

17:35.520 --> 17:42.460
This next clip from Alex's show which is complete bullshit is the direct result of that kind of irresponsibility

17:42.460 --> 17:49.500
Bombshell Friday live Washington Post investigation says Fauci behind Wuhan leaks and he's the main suspect

17:49.500 --> 17:51.600
So now it's turned into a Washington Post

17:52.140 --> 17:58.280
Investigation that Fauci is the main suspect in getting rid of the getting that COVID out there. Well, so yeah

17:58.280 --> 18:00.280
I mean all you've done is

18:00.660 --> 18:06.140
Create like because what what's proven by the conversation that he has with Rogan nothing

18:06.140 --> 18:12.060
What what what what extra do they bring to the table other than sort of name Washington Post reporter?

18:12.060 --> 18:18.500
That's what they bring to it. They bring legitimacy. Yeah from the Washington Post and it's Rogan gets to call it a win

18:18.500 --> 18:21.440
Yeah, it's not introducing a new idea that like

18:22.060 --> 18:28.900
There's a slight possibility that there was there's a lab origin. It's not that that's not new

18:28.900 --> 18:32.600
It's normalizing the conclusion right that it was

18:33.140 --> 18:35.740
From a lab. No, it's just irresponsible

18:35.740 --> 18:40.420
And I just don't believe that somebody who could have the level of career that he does

18:40.420 --> 18:46.120
Would be able to go on Rogan and not recognize that your behavior would be interpreted by listeners that way, right?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.400
Well, I mean in that situation

18:48.520 --> 18:52.220
there's two things going on one if you have any

18:52.440 --> 18:59.860
Credibility that you've built up through being a reporter of any kind of quality or something and you go on info wars or Rogan or whatever

19:00.340 --> 19:02.720
They're there to steal your credibility

19:02.840 --> 19:09.400
They don't give a fuck about you your credibility is what they're stealing so they can do that and you're there

19:09.400 --> 19:11.400
to get

19:11.980 --> 19:16.240
Attention, right? That's the deal. Maybe sell something you're selling exactly

19:16.240 --> 19:20.800
So if you're so like when you're a reporter for the Washington Post

19:20.800 --> 19:25.400
If you don't know that you're there to sell something and they're there to steal your credibility

19:25.900 --> 19:31.160
You're stupid like that's beyond the pale. Yeah, because that's the only reason you would go

19:33.200 --> 19:38.240
Not because Joe's fun no, no because Joe's such a good Jamie is a cool, dude

19:38.240 --> 19:41.980
I don't actually know anything about him never heard. I heard he googles. Yeah

19:41.980 --> 19:47.500
Yeah, so Alex has a little friend from across the pond who pays a visit on this episode

19:47.900 --> 19:55.000
Paul Joseph Watson sure boy. This is really just all about anti-muslim agitation. There we go

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I was wondering oh boy

19:57.040 --> 20:01.920
People say oh well the French they capitulated Hitler. So so what the French are people folks

20:01.920 --> 20:04.200
they've just been controlled by tyrants like we are and

20:04.200 --> 20:10.400
And we're all French tomorrow. London is London Stan. Look at our borders are wide open. Okay, so

20:11.120 --> 20:16.160
France is the gateway to the UK and to the rest of Europe and the world

20:16.240 --> 20:23.220
So we need to stand with the French people. They're good people. So the whole thing is essentially that this is a

20:23.880 --> 20:25.880
extreme instance of anti-muslim

20:25.880 --> 20:34.800
Yeah, programming. It's pretty it's pretty ridiculous. Yeah, just geographically. Mm-hmm. How could France be the gateway the channel?

20:36.400 --> 20:41.480
Isn't the channel from France? No, I understand that the channel is for France to England

20:41.480 --> 20:47.960
But I mean, you know gateway like for Europe like France is like if you're looking at a map of Europe

20:47.960 --> 20:52.240
Right, right and you got the whole Europe thing. There are some friends being here

20:52.240 --> 20:57.280
Yeah, then all this other stuff being in the way. Mm-hmm for the gate part. Yeah

20:57.280 --> 21:00.960
I mean you make an interesting geographical that's fair. That's what does it feel?

21:01.640 --> 21:06.280
That's true. It doesn't feel as real and does that argument scare you?

21:06.760 --> 21:13.160
Because if not throw it away, there's 15 countries between them and the gateway to London and channel

21:13.160 --> 21:21.440
So yeah, what's going on here is that there was an open letter that got published in France that was about

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
the fear of Muslims

21:25.280 --> 21:27.880
We'll talk about it here in a little bit. Here's Paul discussing it

21:28.320 --> 21:32.240
Well, this is an open letter sent to the government of France Alex

21:32.240 --> 21:39.000
And we've heard noises from these military personnel before both active duty and retired by the way many of them retired generals

21:39.000 --> 21:46.240
Warning about the situation on the edges of the suburbs of major cities in France and this mirrors across

21:46.840 --> 21:51.320
Many major European capitals as well as other French cities such as Lyon

21:51.840 --> 21:54.740
That you have this parallel society

21:55.280 --> 22:00.600
whereby it's completely undermined the French government and their monopoly of power

22:00.600 --> 22:02.440
Which is essentially what government is

22:02.440 --> 22:07.920
First of all Alex's entire libertarian identity is based on the rejection of the state having monopoly on power

22:07.920 --> 22:13.600
the entire reason that the Second Amendment so important is that if the populace can be armed and the state can't attain a

22:13.680 --> 22:20.540
Complete monopoly of force. It's so weird to hear Paul be concerned about threats to the monopoly of power of the French government. Yeah

22:21.640 --> 22:24.400
Wonder why that is. That's so strange

22:24.400 --> 22:25.000
Yeah

22:25.000 --> 22:31.680
Anyway, this open letter that Paul is talking about was an insane letter that was published in a far-right magazine called Valor's actual

22:32.160 --> 22:34.160
in France last week

22:34.160 --> 22:39.760
Interestingly it was published on the exact 60th anniversary of a failed coup attempt against Charles de Gaulle

22:40.140 --> 22:47.580
Back in 1961 the idea of allowing Algeria to enjoy self-determination was put to a vote and Algerian independence won the day

22:47.800 --> 22:48.840
overwhelmingly

22:48.840 --> 22:50.600
naturally many former generals

22:50.600 --> 22:56.440
Particularly those in Algeria didn't like this and they decided to form a junta and tried to take over major cities in Algeria

22:57.440 --> 23:00.500
I was running things and then democracy boo

23:00.500 --> 23:03.980
Oh, yeah, ultimately this didn't work out for these generals

23:03.980 --> 23:09.300
But it did lead to many of them forming a group known as the organization army secret

23:09.300 --> 23:15.420
Which was a terrorist group aimed at destabilizing the situation out Algeria in order to maintain French colonial rule

23:15.740 --> 23:22.420
Because what needs to so you want the government of Algeria to not have a monopoly on power

23:22.420 --> 23:30.420
Yeah, makes sense. It makes sense. Yeah, so it seems like this may be more than a coincidence that this letter warning of an insurrection

23:30.500 --> 23:36.020
Was published on the anniversary of a failed insurrection aimed at maintaining an archaic and offensive status quo

23:36.500 --> 23:43.860
Particularly when you read that one of their stated complaints about various anti-racism groups is that they want to tear down statues of famous French

23:44.260 --> 23:45.260
colonialists

23:45.260 --> 23:48.880
It's just it's a little bit. It's a little bit agro

23:48.880 --> 23:52.520
Mmm, yeah that that does sound a little bit like

23:53.320 --> 23:59.880
Memorializing the day Mishma tried to overthrow Japan like with a nice little letter like Emperor Hirohito was pretty great

23:59.880 --> 24:01.880
I don't know if you guys remember that guy. He's pretty great

24:02.200 --> 24:07.340
Naturally noted fascist Marine Le Pen has voiced support for the letter and its signers

24:09.040 --> 24:15.440
Which is what very clearly a part of her push towards running again in next year's election against Macron so

24:15.440 --> 24:18.560
Good. Hey, hey, you know

24:21.160 --> 24:24.440
Yep, this is just anti-muslim agitation, okay

24:24.600 --> 24:30.520
Well, we know is the UN admits a doubling ten years ago of Christian persecution now a tripling worldwide

24:30.560 --> 24:34.040
So if you're a Christian anywhere in the world, the Muslims are killing you including Africa

24:34.040 --> 24:39.400
We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson about what's coming next. Stay with us. There are very legitimate issues about

24:40.220 --> 24:44.400
Christian persecution around the world and it would be wrong to not

24:44.400 --> 24:45.720
recognize

24:45.720 --> 24:47.680
that or to

24:47.680 --> 24:51.000
To deny that or minimize it but the answer is not

24:52.600 --> 24:55.160
Oppressing Muslims. No, it's not it's not

24:56.680 --> 24:57.920
Turning it around

24:57.920 --> 24:59.180
Okay, okay

24:59.180 --> 25:05.280
Now I see what you're saying Dan and when you say that you think what we're gonna do is we're gonna break the cycle of violence

25:05.520 --> 25:11.640
Mm-hmm. Now have you considered though that on the other side of that cycle? We're the ones committing violence

25:11.640 --> 25:16.280
So like as long as we die before the cycle turns around again, I will we're golden

25:16.280 --> 25:22.800
I will say that the depending on which side you're on it feels very different, but it's still bad does seem different. Yes

25:23.280 --> 25:28.280
So one of the things that I think that is kind of becoming a thesis of mine

25:29.480 --> 25:35.240
Over time as I see this behavior just repeated by over and over and over again by people

25:35.560 --> 25:37.960
in the info war sphere is that I think one of the

25:38.560 --> 25:40.360
characterizing

25:40.360 --> 25:48.240
Elements of what makes these people in this world is an inability or an unwillingness to recognize the difference between fiction and reality

25:48.240 --> 25:51.040
Right, right. I really think that it's just

25:51.760 --> 25:53.760
something is

25:53.800 --> 25:57.280
And I think it's more unwillingness. Yeah inability

25:57.280 --> 25:57.600
Yeah

25:57.600 --> 26:04.600
I I think that that's the or maybe maybe not unwillingness so much as all of the incentives

26:04.600 --> 26:11.000
Push towards why deal with reality the incentives are towards believing in false reality

26:11.080 --> 26:13.600
So why would you go back to real reality?

26:13.600 --> 26:21.080
You'd have to get like a regular job and yeah, no Alex isn't gonna just like bag groceries, but it's not just Alex

26:21.080 --> 26:23.200
I mean, it's Paul to sure Charlie

26:24.040 --> 26:28.720
Michelle Welbeck famed French author and intellectual published the book so he'd already written

26:28.720 --> 26:33.480
It was published on the day of the Charlie Hebdo massacre and he predicted that there would be so much

26:33.480 --> 26:39.200
Discord and violence because of these Muslim communities that have not been integrated and that hate France

26:39.640 --> 26:42.920
Allied with the left-wing protest movement, by the way

26:43.360 --> 26:48.360
Isis literally puts out in their manifesto that they can make an alliance with the left wing

26:48.480 --> 26:51.440
Because they also hate France and the West to bring it down

26:51.680 --> 26:55.320
so he puts out a book on the day of Charlie Hebdo warning the

26:55.840 --> 27:00.920
The contrived solution to all this would be in a Muslim government in a coalition with a left-wing government

27:00.920 --> 27:04.680
That takes power and promises to get it all under control

27:05.080 --> 27:12.080
So this book by Michelle hula back is not a prediction. It's not even a nonfiction book

27:12.080 --> 27:17.000
It's a novel that presents a fictional future where there's socialists and a Muslim Brotherhood

27:17.480 --> 27:24.000
Political party that banned together to resist the rising power from the extreme right-wing national front, right?

27:24.000 --> 27:30.080
That's the plot one of the driving forces of the plot of this fiction novel. Sure. Sure in the fiction novel

27:30.080 --> 27:31.800
There's a right-wing

27:31.800 --> 27:36.160
Government oppressing everybody the type that somebody like Paul Joseph Watson would appreciate

27:36.400 --> 27:40.040
Mmm, and then they banned together the Muslim Brotherhood and the leftists

27:40.040 --> 27:46.080
And so Paul is taking that as an attack on the real world right-wing. Well, I don't look

27:46.080 --> 27:50.080
I some people have found the book itself to be like fairly Islamophobic and it

27:50.880 --> 27:55.040
Traffics in some troubling tropes, but I'm not really entirely sure because I haven't read it

27:55.040 --> 27:56.660
I just read a description of the plot

27:56.660 --> 28:00.360
I do know though unlike Paul Joseph Watson that this is a novel

28:00.680 --> 28:08.200
Not a prediction of things to come like this dude looked into God's eye like Alex claims to okay has found this

28:08.320 --> 28:14.280
This this vision of the future. No, no, no, I understand but that kind of it

28:14.280 --> 28:18.120
So you're telling me that it's a novel right Paul says it's a prediction

28:18.120 --> 28:25.240
Okay, but if you're right that means that all those Dragonlance novels I read when I was younger aren't gonna come true

28:25.240 --> 28:27.240
Oh, no, Jordan

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
No

28:31.800 --> 28:33.800
Jordan those happened in the past

28:35.960 --> 28:41.120
That's not the future that's history, oh no, I flat times a flat circle. It'll be it'll come back around

28:41.120 --> 28:44.600
Yeah, so Paul is just a real real piece of garbage

28:45.120 --> 28:52.800
the French government literally came out before the first coronavirus lockdown the Ministry of the interior and said that it shouldn't be

28:52.800 --> 28:57.020
enforced in these migrant ghetto areas so again

28:58.040 --> 29:00.320
literally creating a separate law where the

29:00.920 --> 29:07.200
Enforcement the lockdown the oppression imposed on us is not imposed on them because they're especially protected class

29:07.320 --> 29:09.240
You can hear Paul's angle on this story

29:09.240 --> 29:12.980
which is that poor migrant communities are being exempted from the draconian and

29:13.060 --> 29:19.860
Fascistic rules that the white men of Europe are being subjected to because immigrants are a separate higher class of people to the globalists

29:19.860 --> 29:26.120
Interestingly there's another side to this story and that is the one based in reality where the governments of Europe particularly in France

29:26.300 --> 29:29.960
Didn't allocate funds to provide assistance to poor migrant communities

29:30.820 --> 29:37.860
Non-governmental organizations were working to advocate for the establishment of mobile clinics near areas where migrants camped but their appeals generally went unheard

29:38.420 --> 29:44.000
The accommodation of people experiencing homelessness was tragic at the beginning of the pandemic and there's still serious issues now

29:44.000 --> 29:51.420
But you can see how Paul is rewriting governmental negligence towards a vulnerable population and to actually secretly being them getting favorable treatment

29:51.980 --> 29:53.980
That sucks

29:54.740 --> 30:00.700
Also, how do you how do you enforce a whole stay-at-home order to people who are experiencing homelessness?

30:01.420 --> 30:06.540
Like what are you even talking about? I don't know if there's anything more right-wing than

30:07.500 --> 30:09.660
Having white people ignore

30:10.420 --> 30:12.520
immigrants and then blaming

30:12.520 --> 30:18.420
Them. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. That's the right wing. That's about all Paul's up to

30:20.200 --> 30:27.860
Boy it's a bad appearance now Alex dropped something that I thought was really really interesting and confused me a lot

30:27.860 --> 30:33.240
What is it a hot potato? It's now official. They're parroting from the BBC to CNN to ABC Australia

30:34.020 --> 30:35.420
that

30:35.420 --> 30:41.740
You will get your freedom when you have your vaccine the moment of freedom for you is when you get your vaccine

30:41.740 --> 30:47.020
These are the quotes everywhere and it gets even crazier top scientist epidemiologist

30:47.020 --> 30:52.780
You named her coming out saying Yale medical doctors that the majority people in the hospitals now are from the vaccine

30:52.780 --> 30:55.740
And they're telling people that they have kovat

30:56.340 --> 30:57.340
Wow

30:57.340 --> 31:01.780
We predicted that here it is ladies and gentlemen

31:01.780 --> 31:04.780
It's that thing about like your freedom comes when you get the vaccine

31:04.980 --> 31:08.980
there was just somebody on a talking head show that was

31:08.980 --> 31:14.840
Discussing how some people are not motivated by the idea that you can protect other people by getting vaccinated

31:15.280 --> 31:17.400
So maybe appeal to people's selfishness

31:17.760 --> 31:23.960
As a means of getting people to recognize the importance of getting a vaccine and I understand what this person saying

31:23.960 --> 31:25.840
I also think it's a misguided

31:25.840 --> 31:31.440
Perspective. Yeah, I don't think that taking the advice of one person on CNBC

31:31.960 --> 31:33.960
as if it's the

31:33.960 --> 31:39.080
Like the global position of enemy faction. I don't think that's a smart thing to do

31:39.080 --> 31:40.600
But that seems to be what Alex is up to

31:40.600 --> 31:40.800
No

31:40.800 --> 31:47.360
I think a lot of people should take the things that I say and extrapolate them and put them upon every single person

31:48.120 --> 31:54.000
Who disagrees with them? It's a great idea. It's a little it's a little silly and Alex plays this clip with this person over and over

31:54.000 --> 31:56.120
Again, it's just it doesn't prove any point

31:56.120 --> 31:56.320
Yeah

31:56.320 --> 32:00.840
that's annoying but I have no idea or Alex was getting that statistic that a majority of people who are

32:00.840 --> 32:05.920
Hospitalized now are there due to the vaccine not from kovat and because he's not providing a source

32:05.920 --> 32:07.320
There's nothing I can do with that

32:07.320 --> 32:14.300
I would I would argue that if that were true that would be the biggest news in the history of ever I can

32:14.520 --> 32:16.400
Jordan tell you this though

32:16.400 --> 32:22.060
newly published CDC study found that among people 65 and older the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were

32:22.280 --> 32:26.300
94 percent effective at preventing hospitalization, which is huge

32:26.600 --> 32:29.520
Yeah, if Alex can produce this data, I'd be happy to look at it

32:29.520 --> 32:33.840
But at this point all available information points the exact opposite direction

32:34.120 --> 32:40.960
Yeah, especially considering how sensationalized it is whenever things don't work where it's like you just said

32:40.960 --> 32:45.080
Oh, it's 94 percent effective at stopping hospitalizations

32:45.080 --> 32:50.840
But how many times have we read an article that says that but all but instead of saying 94 percent effective

32:50.840 --> 32:57.720
They're like six thousand people in the hospital now because of vaccines and then you're like out of how many Oh 100,000

32:57.720 --> 32:59.720
You know, like it's oh

32:59.760 --> 33:02.800
You guys suck at this if that were true

33:03.440 --> 33:07.000
Imagine how the sensationalized news would report that shit. Mmm

33:07.640 --> 33:09.640
everyone dying

33:12.160 --> 33:14.240
People would sound like Alex but worse

33:15.480 --> 33:19.560
So terrifying Alex is taking this news very well

33:20.880 --> 33:24.920
So Alex has another guest on and it's that preacher from Calgary

33:24.920 --> 33:30.160
I was on Arthur paulowski. Uh-huh. He's the guy who yelled at

33:30.680 --> 33:34.920
I mentioned this he's the dick preacher. Yeah, we didn't talk about this

33:35.080 --> 33:40.960
But we we mentioned it that he was on he's the other preacher. There's the girl. He's the other dick

33:40.960 --> 33:45.360
There's the Grace Life Church, which is the one that where Alex was trying to get everyone to go, right?

33:45.360 --> 33:50.000
Right, and this is another guy right who has a has a church and he wouldn't let people in to

33:50.000 --> 33:57.080
Like he'd they'd gotten a bunch of complaints about them having services and not following kovat right guidelines

33:57.080 --> 34:01.160
And so he just yell there's a video. I'm just yelling out out

34:02.040 --> 34:08.960
And the people are like we just want to talk to you, but see now that's that's what you become a preacher for

34:08.960 --> 34:13.240
It's freaking people out of a church. He's got to be a all-time good feeling

34:13.240 --> 34:25.120
yeah, so he's on and I'm gonna go ahead and we'll talk about we'll talk about this a little bit this time, but I wanted to get

34:26.040 --> 34:33.320
Arthur paulowski or art paulowski the great preacher that feeds over a thousand homeless people a week and who has his little church

34:33.320 --> 34:39.900
It's been rated a bunch by the provincial police and others and now it was SWAT team to give us an update street church

34:39.900 --> 34:44.340
Dot-ca was on Monday. Their services are coming up this weekend

34:44.460 --> 34:47.420
They may try to lock the church up like they've done many others

34:47.580 --> 34:52.980
He's saying he's gonna go to one of the places like Walmart or wherever. He's gonna announce it via email to his flock

34:52.980 --> 34:57.140
And so they'll have it where they do allow it. So I thought that was kind of interesting

34:57.140 --> 35:02.540
I'm not sure based on this interview if he's saying that he's gonna do this like go preach at a wall

35:02.540 --> 35:08.540
Yeah, yeah, but on April 27th the last time he was on here's what Alex said you've got

35:08.540 --> 35:09.780
to

35:09.780 --> 35:16.180
Walmarts filled with people shoulder to shoulder, but I cannot have my parents for coffee in my house. That's against the law

35:16.180 --> 35:18.820
I cannot have a church because that's against the law

35:18.820 --> 35:24.380
But they can go with my church with my friends with my family members to IKEA and have a coffee over there

35:25.380 --> 35:29.980
Why don't you guys go to Walmart say you're going go in and then hold a church service there

35:29.980 --> 35:34.180
You'll be allowed to of course then they'll throw you out. That'd be a great time. That would be a great stunt

35:34.180 --> 35:40.660
Oh, yeah, so I don't know if the reality is that this preacher has taken Alex's advice for a stunt

35:40.660 --> 35:45.260
But that's clearly something that Alex came up with from the two of them. We're talking a couple days prior

35:45.780 --> 35:52.820
Yeah, I remember my favorite parts of the Bible where we're when Jesus got ideas from the devil and the devil's like man

35:52.820 --> 35:56.660
You should really try that out. That's a great stunt. Uh-huh. Give it a shot make all them low

35:56.660 --> 36:01.300
I remember there was a couple chapters that really stuck out to me when I was a kid in Bible study

36:01.300 --> 36:04.940
They were about God making dank memes totally totally

36:05.660 --> 36:09.580
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, so this preacher man, I

36:11.700 --> 36:17.620
I don't I don't care for the way this guy thinks and the health inspectors receive a

36:18.220 --> 36:23.880
Permission from a judge to use any force necessary and the judge's name

36:23.880 --> 36:30.100
That's even more fascinating in this story is no David Gates out of seven billion names

36:30.100 --> 36:34.640
They have found a judge that is a family of Bill Gates

36:34.640 --> 36:38.880
I don't know David Gates the judge here in Calgary. What what?

36:39.520 --> 36:43.040
Seven billion names. What are you talking about? Grow up grow up, sir

36:44.080 --> 36:46.080
Grow up

36:46.720 --> 36:50.520
There are not seven billion names Dan we have had to reuse a few

36:52.360 --> 36:56.520
Six billion nine hundred ninety nine million nine hundred ninety eight thousand

36:56.520 --> 37:01.720
Yeah, man, so the health department got a warrant to enter his church. Sure

37:02.240 --> 37:05.240
And the person who signed it was Gates. What?

37:05.960 --> 37:10.400
What are the odds? I man probably zero coincidence

37:10.400 --> 37:11.840
I just you know

37:11.840 --> 37:18.280
Like if I was in it at church and I heard him just go like and it's the same last name as Bill Gates

37:18.400 --> 37:22.920
What does that tell you? I'd be like, oh no, I guess religion is fake shit. You

37:22.920 --> 37:27.560
Personally are so stupid. I don't believe in God

37:27.560 --> 37:31.400
You've shaken my faith. Yes. Yeah, you're too dumb. Oh, no

37:32.080 --> 37:36.920
My whole life needs to be reevaluated. You're suggesting that all people named Gates are related

37:36.920 --> 37:40.520
That's not good. Even if it's just for fun. That's still crazy

37:41.200 --> 37:45.760
You're a dumb dumb. So Alex and this dude are talking and they they get to

37:46.360 --> 37:49.880
Discussing how the left right the left. Oh, it's us. Mm-hmm

37:49.880 --> 37:57.680
What they're doing is they're using the budget. Okay or something sure in order to get the police to attack Christians

37:57.880 --> 37:59.880
That's what's going on. Interesting

37:59.960 --> 38:03.480
Why are the police so happy in your area and in other areas?

38:03.880 --> 38:08.880
With other churches to put fences up around them and to behave like something out of Soviet Russia

38:10.200 --> 38:16.320
Because the mayor and the homosexual Muslim mayor night named she threatened to defund the police

38:16.320 --> 38:22.840
He took 20 million dollars out of the police budget and then after a backlash. She gave them back to 20 million

38:22.840 --> 38:26.880
Well, that's what it is exactly. The left everywhere is holding the police hostage by the purse strings

38:26.880 --> 38:31.960
They don't get rid of the police. They want the police shutting down churches not stopping carjackers

38:32.680 --> 38:36.920
That's exactly what is happening right now. Oh boy. If that is on the table

38:36.920 --> 38:42.960
I will absolutely hold the police hostage if that is on the table. Somebody let me hold the police hostage

38:42.960 --> 38:47.680
I will do it right fucking now. Yeah, this guy's worrying me a little bit. I did not know that was on the table

38:48.080 --> 38:51.400
well, you know the you know, you got these this

38:52.120 --> 38:58.780
This guy is worried about don't don't repeat what he said about that. I wasn't going to I was gonna say he's worried about the

38:58.780 --> 39:05.440
Cops. Yeah. Yeah, we're all manipulated by the budgetary concerns. Don't worry to destroy churches

39:05.440 --> 39:10.040
It's a that's my biggest fear and at a certain point you want to ask yourself a question and that is

39:10.040 --> 39:15.920
When are you gonna rise up? Oh, I mean when is going to be enough when you know, where are you going to rise up?

39:15.920 --> 39:22.440
Well, we noticed the master never going away. I told people they're they're never gonna end this until people say no

39:23.200 --> 39:26.960
That's right. We will never say what we know about bullies that bullies

39:27.140 --> 39:34.220
They will never stop bullying until you stop the bullying and that's what it needs to happen three words. No get out

39:34.340 --> 39:36.040
No get out

39:36.040 --> 39:41.640
Well, even the New York Times and Homeland Security saying it's a crisis that Christians won't take the vaccine

39:41.640 --> 39:44.200
It's not it is a vaccine. You're all done a

39:44.680 --> 39:51.060
Franken genetic re-engineering program see what I'm saying you prove that's exactly what it is and it's killing now more people

39:51.320 --> 39:54.400
Than the so-called virus it. Oh boy

39:55.000 --> 40:01.240
What are we gonna have to do? I don't know. What are we gonna have? I don't know. It's why it's a very interesting

40:01.240 --> 40:08.200
Perspective to see like and what actually I think the only thing that I really find interesting about this is how how much it?

40:08.200 --> 40:14.920
Makes sense like Alex started this sort of they're closing down all these churches. Yeah with the grace life Church

40:14.920 --> 40:21.120
Yeah, they had that he had that reporter on from rebel news and she wouldn't go along with his like everyone needs to come

40:21.120 --> 40:26.280
Right, right. All right, and I don't think that was fun for Alex. No, so now he's found Arthur

40:26.280 --> 40:34.720
Pawlowski. Yeah, who is like everybody's got to rise up. Hey. Hey, look, I don't need any of your rebel media reporting bullshit

40:34.720 --> 40:40.520
I want a stochastic terrorist. I think that this guy is exactly what Alex would have wanted out of the other

40:40.520 --> 40:45.380
He would still be talking about the grace life church if he was willing to call for an uprising. Yes

40:46.400 --> 40:49.940
Yeah, this guy is exactly what Alex wants. Oh, yeah, so

40:50.580 --> 40:55.400
apparently Alex gets a lot of emails about big medical news that

40:55.400 --> 41:01.840
It never never really makes it to the show. And actually I think that's good because they would just be anecdotal stories

41:01.840 --> 41:04.140
That's true. It would be meaningless. It'd be chain emails

41:04.760 --> 41:10.320
Our email is full of doctors and lawyers and teachers and nurses and we call them

41:10.320 --> 41:16.600
They send us the evidence where they are giving people shots and people are dropping dead at the vaccination centers

41:16.600 --> 41:22.640
And it's not just from the coven shot. Suddenly the flu shots are killing a bunch of people something's going on here

41:22.640 --> 41:29.880
Yes. Yes. We knew that we knew the gates announced a few years ago that he wants to eliminate six and a half billion people

41:30.200 --> 41:37.200
Now I got the judge gates that is issuing illegal orders against the Constitution the chapter rights of freedoms

41:37.200 --> 41:43.560
We know something is going on and Christians have has always been in opposition to genocide and evil. So I think

41:47.080 --> 41:50.800
Have you see I guess I mean like Alex if he's getting these emails

41:50.800 --> 41:56.600
They're just be anecdotal stories, but they send all the proof. Yeah, just sort of never also buddy. Come on

41:57.120 --> 41:59.120
Come on. Oh

41:59.480 --> 42:06.120
Also that killing 6.5 billion people is the Georgia Guidestones. He's just referencing rocks in Georgia. Yeah, man

42:06.120 --> 42:08.600
I really don't think that I would like my

42:09.080 --> 42:13.320
Christian preacher adding a little Georgia Guidestone in there every now and again, you know

42:13.320 --> 42:19.640
You know what people add in and making another reference to how the judges name is. Yeah, that's not good. No, it's not good

42:19.640 --> 42:21.640
No, I got this judge name

42:22.920 --> 42:29.760
So Polowski is the kind of guy though, who's not gonna be deterred by this the state cracking down on him sure

42:29.760 --> 42:35.840
It doesn't seem like it. Well, what's the Bible verse pastor? I forget that the gates of hell shall not prevail against Christ Church

42:36.640 --> 42:41.060
That's exactly that's why tomorrow. I'm opening the church tomorrow. I'm going to be preaching

42:42.480 --> 42:48.480
Let the whole world see what is happening in the city of Calgary in this beautiful country of ours, Canada

42:48.480 --> 42:51.560
And at least let there be thousands of people witness

42:52.680 --> 42:58.100
Saturday Sabbath services tell us what time and where people can go to the website as well

42:58.680 --> 43:05.080
Interestingly our tour did have his services the next day on this Saturday. How'd it go? Things didn't go well. Oh, what happened?

43:05.080 --> 43:09.740
I'll just read to you here from an article in the Calgary Herald quote community members living on

43:10.240 --> 43:17.000
living near Street Church say preacher Artur Polowski and his followers have threatened neighbors with violence after speaking out against the

43:17.000 --> 43:22.960
Congregations disregard for public health measures and their hateful rhetoric Christians have always been against violence

43:23.760 --> 43:27.240
Yeah, no, no, not their style from this article quote

43:27.240 --> 43:32.240
Our neighbors here have been threatened for at least seven weeks by these anti-maskers who are violating health

43:32.320 --> 43:36.360
Regulations and spreading messages of hate said Michelle Robinson who lives in the neighborhood

43:36.600 --> 43:43.640
This is a very similar thing to what happened after the big uproar surrounding that Grace Life Church where Alex implored everyone to show up

43:43.640 --> 43:50.280
people did show up there and you know, who knows if it was because of the rebel news reporting or just some blog or Alex who

43:50.280 --> 43:52.040
knows exactly but

43:52.040 --> 43:58.840
Elizabeth Simmons the deputy director of the Canadian anti hate Network told CTV this after quote monitoring the crowd

43:59.200 --> 44:06.520
Quote it would be accurate to say that the event attracted far-right and right-wing conspiracy minded individuals for sure would be

44:06.640 --> 44:08.280
This is important to understand

44:08.280 --> 44:14.560
There's a reason why Alex is trying to ramp up and heighten the tension surrounding churches that refuse to cooperate with public health measures

44:14.760 --> 44:20.440
This is an intentional strategy meant to create a standoff that will lead to a galvanizing moment for the extreme

44:20.440 --> 44:22.920
Right, this is a super dangerous situation

44:22.920 --> 44:28.560
And even if it doesn't escalate any further the neighbors of this church are having to deal with an incredibly unfair circumstance

44:28.880 --> 44:35.080
Where this narcissist and preachers clothing is creating a powder keg in their front lawns like it's just inappropriate

44:35.080 --> 44:41.900
and it we need to need to understand that this is an intentional thing whether or not Alex is sitting there with a whiteboard

44:42.240 --> 44:48.360
Trying to draw out how to create a martyr. Yeah or to create a conflagration of some sort

44:48.360 --> 44:53.680
No, he might as well put a billy. I'm putting a million dollar bounty on whoever can start a holy war

44:53.680 --> 44:59.680
It's it's he's trying to ramp up the tensions that would lead in that direction and hoping for the worst

44:59.680 --> 45:04.200
Yeah, well, I mean whiteness didn't work in America. So let's try religion in Canada

45:04.200 --> 45:09.600
I think is what he's trying to do. It's it's it's pretty upsetting and I I hope for

45:10.680 --> 45:13.720
You know all these these situations to be navigated

45:14.760 --> 45:16.760
Delicately. Yeah, good luck

45:16.880 --> 45:22.920
So Alex gets done with this dude and he gets back to the news and he's got a fucking bombshell

45:26.400 --> 45:28.400
There's a huge report that's gonna be posted

45:28.400 --> 45:33.960
In the next 20 minutes the band on video that we worked on for a while. There's so many examples of it

45:33.960 --> 45:40.080
I only wanted a few minutes of it, but it's nine minutes of it and it's gonna be titled proof. Joe Biden has dementia

45:42.080 --> 45:45.280
May 2021, but that's a good way to put her

45:46.560 --> 45:49.920
Spring 2021, uh, just people know this is a new update

45:51.640 --> 45:56.440
Or just breaking total proof Joe Biden has dementia and it's being completely handled

45:56.440 --> 46:02.400
He has permission for everything. It's just it's just insane and he admits while he has to mention that he stole the election

46:03.160 --> 46:08.760
It's it's just unbelievable. So I have so many guests. I'm not gonna have time to air this on the show today. Really?

46:09.400 --> 46:11.400
You have proof

46:12.920 --> 46:19.200
Tell me that you have a nine-minute video that proves Joe Biden both has dementia and stole the election

46:19.200 --> 46:23.520
Uh-huh, but you don't have time today. Yeah, no time. Just I'm sorry

46:23.520 --> 46:28.040
We have proof of Joe Biden confessing that he stole the election

46:28.520 --> 46:35.080
We have perhaps the most important piece of proof of the 21st century. Yeah. Yeah

46:35.080 --> 46:40.040
So the game that's being played here is he's trying to drive traffic to his website. Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely true

46:40.040 --> 46:44.040
And you know that this is not worth his time on the actual show, you know

46:44.040 --> 46:50.960
I I what one thing that people haven't really gotten me with yet is why I should care if Joe Biden has dementia

46:50.960 --> 46:56.880
You know, like I I kind of don't care if they're weakened at burn easing him

46:57.400 --> 47:01.560
Right, like so far. It's it's like I don't want a monarch. I

47:02.440 --> 47:04.440
Don't want a president who's?

47:05.200 --> 47:08.120
Doing all of that stuff. I'm fine if he's dead

47:08.520 --> 47:13.720
I'm fine if he's dead and they've got him enough like a scarecrow stick figure thing behind him

47:13.720 --> 47:17.420
They're just wheeling him out and deep faking his speeches. I'm fine with that

47:17.420 --> 47:21.440
I feel like you speak for at least a segment of the population

47:21.440 --> 47:24.800
I think we should get some polling on that. I think everybody would be fine

47:24.800 --> 47:28.420
If you're just weekend at burn is it I don't know what the temperature of the country is

47:28.680 --> 47:30.680
We would be fine with a weekend

47:30.960 --> 47:33.060
All be fine with the dead president

47:34.840 --> 47:42.400
Let's put it put it out on Twitter. All right, what happens? Yeah, so anyway back to statistics. Sorry. Sorry, but

47:43.340 --> 47:45.080
Do you know about statistics?

47:45.080 --> 47:48.120
bombshell 60% of new COVID patients are

47:49.480 --> 47:51.480
Vaccinated dr. Harvey Reich

47:52.200 --> 47:58.240
Very respected Yale medical doctor on new patients diagnosed with the corona virus more than half have been

47:58.680 --> 48:01.080
Vaccinated and they're having autoimmune diseases

48:01.080 --> 48:05.440
They're having allergic responses and the hospitals are being told call it COVID and of course

48:05.440 --> 48:10.920
They test positive for it because the PCR test is set up just like Theranos did

48:11.000 --> 48:14.420
So now that Alex has dropped a little bit of a specific piece of information

48:14.420 --> 48:16.320
I can tell you what he's talking about

48:16.320 --> 48:19.960
He almost certainly just saw this in a meme that was going around on social media

48:20.300 --> 48:23.920
Alex has no idea who Harvey Reisch is or where that quote comes from

48:23.920 --> 48:24.480
Yeah

48:24.480 --> 48:28.060
It turns out that it was from an interview that Reich did on Steve Bannon's

48:28.200 --> 48:33.540
Podcast where he said quote what clinicians are telling me is more than half of the new COVID cases

48:33.540 --> 48:36.080
They're seeing to treat is people who've been vaccinated

48:36.500 --> 48:41.200
They've estimated 60% of new patients. They've been treating have been people who have been vaccinated

48:41.200 --> 48:49.100
So this is at best second-hand estimations based presumably on anecdotal information being thrown around on Steve

48:49.100 --> 48:52.320
Bannon's podcast. Yeah, that sounds more trustworthy than data

48:52.920 --> 48:58.840
According to the CDC as of April 20th, there were seven thousand one hundred fifty seven reported cases of people who were vaccinated

48:59.120 --> 49:04.180
Who still contracted COVID that's out of 87 million people who have been vaccinated

49:04.180 --> 49:06.880
So that is not really that surprising of a number

49:06.880 --> 49:12.040
Everyone's dying. Yeah a CNN article from earlier in April had the figure at approximately

49:12.920 --> 49:15.400
5,800 breakthrough cases of which only

49:16.360 --> 49:22.080
396 of those required hospitalization, so it seems hard to believe that these numbers could be accurate

49:22.080 --> 49:28.380
It's it's tough whenever you're working on numbers that are such a huge scale because what we should be saying is wait

49:29.240 --> 49:35.120
396 only 396 needed hospitalization. We have miracles. We make miracles now

49:35.120 --> 49:40.560
We create miracles and all this God bullshit. They keep talking about is insane because only

49:41.120 --> 49:46.880
376 people had to be hospitalized from vaccine. We created it under a year. We need the ICP to make a song about this

49:50.200 --> 49:57.220
So, yeah, like I said, the numbers do not match up and unless there's more than a second-hand story being told on Bannon's podcast

49:57.220 --> 49:58.680
I'm just gonna ignore this

49:58.680 --> 50:05.040
But it's important to recognize that this is the level of backing that a claim needs to have for Alex to take it as gospel

50:05.040 --> 50:09.360
As long as it lines up with the narratives that he's currently profiting off of. Yeah

50:09.360 --> 50:11.800
It's the only thing that really matters at all

50:11.800 --> 50:16.680
I think what's fun about Steve Bannon's podcast is regardless of whether or not he

50:17.200 --> 50:23.680
Previously was a very respected Yale medical doctor the moment you go on Steve Bannon's podcast

50:23.880 --> 50:30.960
Very and respected are removed from my vab vocabulary. Yeah, Yale also published something a few number of months back

50:30.960 --> 50:36.800
In August that was like critiquing and denouncing his yeah

50:38.120 --> 50:45.240
Fervent support for hydroxychloroquine as a kovat cure. Yeah, Yale put out a look at this fucking asshole. Sorry. Whoops. He's got tenure

50:45.240 --> 50:50.040
Yeah, what did we know? So Alex believes that vaccines are gonna be mandatory and man?

50:50.040 --> 50:54.040
He says something that I think is really weird and it's going to be forced folks

50:54.040 --> 50:59.540
Once they get a majority to do it there, they're gonna say oh things would open but you wouldn't do it

50:59.540 --> 51:04.000
so there's still COVID-19 which they set a computer to clarify everybody has and

51:04.760 --> 51:09.320
Then when you die the other viruses and things are actually releasing or people are dying from the vaccines

51:10.120 --> 51:15.120
They're not just gonna die six months from now or two years from now like the ferrets died in a couple months

51:15.120 --> 51:18.560
That's for humans a couple years out because ferrets don't live as long

51:19.840 --> 51:22.720
So they do animal studies is they they'll die quicker, but it's usually the same

51:23.600 --> 51:27.760
So, you know if a dog dies in a week humans will probably die in six months

51:27.760 --> 51:33.300
If a ferret dies in a month humans will die in a year. That's math

51:34.360 --> 51:39.360
Transitive property of ferrets. If a rat dies in a week a human dies in six months a year. I hate you

51:39.360 --> 51:46.720
I hate you so much. They know what they're doing. I hate you so much. I hate you so much Dan for playing that clip. Dog ears man. Dog ears.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.720
I hate you. I hate you

51:49.480 --> 51:54.480
You yeah, Alex can say that you are supposed to keep me away from that shit

51:54.480 --> 52:00.380
No, because it's important to recognize that he thinks dog ears are literal. I'm supposed to be protected from this

52:00.800 --> 52:04.920
That's the kind of stuff that takes your breath away. Yeah, that's that's rough Wow

52:05.320 --> 52:10.040
Yeah, if a dog dies in a way, so he thinks that when we talk about dog ears

52:10.040 --> 52:16.760
We're not just talking about relative time that spans for life. He thinks that we literally mean that's the only way I can make that

52:16.760 --> 52:22.360
Make sense. Yeah, he has to try to approach this from a number of different directions because I don't know if he knows this

52:22.360 --> 52:26.440
But different animals have different biology. Nope. Nope, not true. Nope, everybody

52:26.440 --> 52:34.080
Some things that are toxic to, some animals are not toxic to others. Nope, all things one. Some we are all God's creatures. Some responses that

52:34.080 --> 52:36.080
All maybe God's image.

52:36.080 --> 52:39.200
Okay, it's just timing based. Yep. I

52:40.080 --> 52:47.040
Want to I I just I just can't. It's amazing. I just can't. It's real good. It's it is. It's good stuff

52:47.040 --> 52:54.320
There's something admirable about a man who can so consistently say something that floors me

52:54.680 --> 52:55.160
Yeah

52:55.160 --> 53:00.920
And confidently and with it he repeated multiple examples of how animals have different lifespans

53:01.300 --> 53:07.840
Multiple examples of the same wrong example that makes no sense whatsoever. It's good stuff. Damn

53:08.080 --> 53:10.080
So just damn. So

53:10.500 --> 53:13.380
Biden had given his his remarks before Congress

53:13.380 --> 53:20.140
Mm-hmm, and he had mentioned something to the effect of white supremacy is terrorism and yeah, Alex is not happy about this

53:20.140 --> 53:24.980
No, I wouldn't be surprised. This just went up on info wars calm. I told you this was coming yesterday

53:24.980 --> 53:29.100
Nobody else was talking about it. I wish everybody was Tucker Carlson got it and covered it last night course

53:29.100 --> 53:32.780
He said they're coming after you they told you being white inherently is bad

53:33.780 --> 53:37.780
DOJ actively considering domestic terrorism law to target white supremacists

53:37.780 --> 53:45.300
That's why they tell you Antifa doesn't exist. But white supremism is just an epidemic. That's why everybody's a white supremacist to be clear

53:45.300 --> 53:48.020
I don't think I would support any new laws

53:48.660 --> 53:50.660
for domestic terrorism

53:51.020 --> 53:57.380
But I do think that the idea of taking white supremacy seriously as a terroristic threat

53:57.380 --> 54:04.940
Yeah is something that is long overdue and it's also not surprising why Tucker and Alex are the people on the vanguard

54:04.940 --> 54:06.940
Oh

54:06.940 --> 54:12.420
Their entire, you know, their money is made by white victim hood. Yeah. Yeah

54:12.900 --> 54:17.540
So yeah, your your best bet there for them is like it's a slippery slope argument

54:17.540 --> 54:20.460
But even then you're arguing for white supremacy

54:21.300 --> 54:24.340
Like the end that's what you guys are doing

54:24.340 --> 54:30.100
You're not because at no point are they like well what we should do is focus on the extreme elements of white supremacy

54:30.100 --> 54:35.820
Nope, none of that. So none of that just blanket you're talking about white people. I will kill you

54:35.820 --> 54:41.540
It's really interesting that you say that because I think it even becomes more clear as Alex talks about some other political figures

54:41.540 --> 54:43.540
Sure speaking on the issue

54:43.620 --> 54:50.460
Hours earlier House Intelligence Committee representative Adam Schiff and the rest of the Chinese spies on his committee. Why as well the sinner

54:51.340 --> 54:56.060
stage for the narrative by telling MSNBC's and no Wallace that the

54:56.060 --> 54:59.740
The predominant part of the domestic threat is white

55:00.380 --> 55:02.780
Nationalist. Ah, you know, we're not globalist

55:02.780 --> 55:08.660
We can't ignore that because of a politically sensitivity that some of the folks are part of the Trump base

55:08.660 --> 55:15.000
We have to stop there really quick because I think that Alex just tried to define white nationalist as just not global

55:15.000 --> 55:18.300
Not globalist. Yep, that's not good. No, no

55:18.300 --> 55:24.380
I don't believe that he doesn't know that that is a compound noun that has a specific meaning. It's a problem

55:24.380 --> 55:31.180
I know that there are some people like coach Dave was one of them sure who I actually believe doesn't know what white nationalism means

55:32.180 --> 55:37.460
He thinks he is a nationalist who happens to be white. Yeah, and that makes is like I am a white nurse

55:37.460 --> 55:39.460
Yeah, I don't think he understands

55:39.500 --> 55:44.800
Alex does yeah, I do not cuz he's I've heard him discuss some of the ideas

55:45.220 --> 55:50.780
So him him couching that there is the opposite of globalist. Yeah, that's a problem

55:50.780 --> 55:57.280
Yeah, yeah, that is interesting because Dave is astonishingly stupid. Yes, but Alex is stupid

55:58.140 --> 56:00.980
Astonishingly, yeah, you know, yeah, let's finish this clip in there

56:01.900 --> 56:07.420
And they go on to say the FBI the CIA the intelligence agencies are gonna disrupt us

56:07.940 --> 56:13.780
That's when you send the Green Berets in to kill people. What that's what that means is it so it's all here

56:13.780 --> 56:18.920
It's all being announced. It's all being done. It is the twilight of our Republic. It is a dictatorship

56:18.920 --> 56:22.120
So no, that's not that's not necessarily what that means

56:22.120 --> 56:28.000
But to be clear what's going on is that Alex is defending white supremacy and white nationalism because he knows that it's a part of

56:28.000 --> 56:30.360
His power block. Yeah, he doesn't like that

56:30.360 --> 56:37.120
People are discussing how these things are a problem and he's unwilling to separate himself from white nationalism because it's his bread and butter

56:37.400 --> 56:42.220
People keep saying that I'm a white nationalist and that's way wrong now

56:42.220 --> 56:45.360
I would just like my supporters to continue sending me Nazi coin

56:45.360 --> 56:52.040
And that's the new official branded bit of cryptocurrency of it for worse. I only accept

56:54.960 --> 57:03.320
I just want people to call me apartheid Dan. Yeah, I also think that Alex actually thinks that Swalwell's name is swallows. Well

57:05.280 --> 57:11.320
That was something that was the name that Roger gave to him when a couple years back when Roger was mad at Adam Schiff

57:11.320 --> 57:15.760
Yeah, yeah there they had that blow up and yeah, Roger would call him that

57:15.760 --> 57:18.200
I think that Alex just doesn't realize that that's not his real name

57:18.200 --> 57:23.040
He doesn't say it like as a joke. Can we live in a dictatorship?

57:23.720 --> 57:30.400
when the man who is telling me we are living in a dictatorship just told me that he has proof that the dictator of said

57:30.560 --> 57:32.200
dictatorship is

57:32.200 --> 57:34.200
has dementia and

57:34.680 --> 57:40.680
Admitted that yeah stole the election. Yeah, that wouldn't really be a dictatorship now would it be a weird one?

57:40.680 --> 57:42.760
It would be a strange one. So speaking of weird ones

57:43.480 --> 57:49.260
We shouldn't be seduced into thinking that because we're white we ain't right and you don't win an argument by

57:50.120 --> 57:53.720
Manipulating definitions. Do you agree norm that you're a racist? Well, no

57:53.760 --> 57:58.520
Well, that's because you're a racist. So Norm Pattis is back to be a really sensitive white dude Wow

57:58.640 --> 58:01.500
Yeah, so that was a great joke though, I guess

58:02.600 --> 58:07.160
Just to remind people in case look I'm not noted stand-up comedian

58:07.160 --> 58:13.280
I'm not saying that norm is racist because he says he's not racist. I say he's racist because he

58:14.400 --> 58:21.460
Nom, this was two weeks ago. I tried my debut at stand-up comedy the other night at a small club in Connecticut

58:21.460 --> 58:24.200
And I ended my riff with the following

58:24.200 --> 58:29.360
Hey, you know, I tried to buy woke insurance the other day that the crowd looked at me. What's woke insurance?

58:29.360 --> 58:29.800
well

58:29.800 --> 58:35.080
Woke insurance is what you need if you're a white man because I'm reading the paper and everything that's wrong with this country is my

58:35.080 --> 58:37.200
Fault, how am I gonna pay for all of this?

58:37.200 --> 58:41.760
I need well insurance and we're at a point where you know that sort of humor

58:41.960 --> 58:47.600
It isn't necessarily farcical any longer it is I think that you know in comedy

58:47.600 --> 58:53.280
There's some things that are evergreen like I could probably hear some Mitch Hedberg one-liners, right?

58:53.640 --> 58:56.640
They've heard a hundred times. Well, it's still my insurance bit

58:56.640 --> 59:03.400
This guy tried to give me my insurance for a donut I said, I don't need insurance for a donut

59:03.400 --> 59:06.880
I used to be racist still am but I used to do

59:15.960 --> 59:19.920
Boy racist Mitch Hedberg is a new character norm

59:19.920 --> 59:21.920
Norm Hedberg

59:25.360 --> 59:27.360
Don't let him tell you

59:31.080 --> 59:33.080
All right, I'm gonna die so

59:34.440 --> 59:40.140
Norm is a is a real sensitive gentleman love a racist escalator

59:43.040 --> 59:45.560
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm gonna get lost to that for a while

59:45.560 --> 59:50.080
Yeah, we can't do that too long if you if something if you get inspired, please feel free. I would know

59:50.200 --> 59:52.680
Racist Mitch Hedberg is gonna live in my brain forever

59:54.200 --> 59:59.760
So Alex wants to pair up Francis Boyle, yeah the guy who

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.760
Directed 28 days later

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.080
Danny Boyle, okay

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.480
Francis Boyle is the guy who Alex has on to talk about the Wuhan lab

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:16.640
All right, all these people are Nazi scientists and what-have-you. He wants to get Francis Boyle and norm together to

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.200
Have a lawsuit against me or sure do it. Yeah, let's get it done

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.360
So that's pretty funny

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:30.680
But then Mike down for this because Alex explains to Norm that the vaccines are dangerous and Norm's response is

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.080
Hilarious, okay

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.380
I've got to get him with norm pass these other lawyers so that we can go with this

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:42.620
It is great to file and say religious exemption First Amendment Trump's your BS totally reasonable

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:48.140
I believe that Norm's right to sue on that but we need other suits because this is new what's happening of them

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.220
shoehorning a genetic engineering totally different system in

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:58.020
I mean if I injected with cyanide and called it a vaccine would I get liability protection if I injected you with one?

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:03.260
This is a mutinogenic system. So I didn't get you on to preach at you norm. I'm just really pissed about this

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:07.260
You're taking action. You're a man of action. We salute you. I gotta get you a doctor

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:12.300
Boyle who's on with us tomorrow. We're gonna tape to air and layer at four o'clock tomorrow. I'm gonna send it to you

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:16.620
I'm gonna get you his number because I think you guys teaming up is gonna be huge. I'm gonna stop ranting

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.700
But give me your take on what I just said. I

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.540
Don't know enough about it to have an intelligent take what what you're telling me is that

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:30.580
significant portions of what has been sold in the name of public health is actually a pretext for something else and has

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:37.180
Implicit dangers that we're not being warned about if that is in fact true. That's an outrageous violation of trust

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:45.260
Look, well, we have laws in the United States that says a person is free to refuse medical treatment unless and and and and

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:52.040
In order to accept it. They must give informed consent. Now. I took the vaccine. I got double shots of Pfizer

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.940
Nobody warned me about any gene therapy or anything like that

01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:01.460
So as far as I knew I was taking a vaccine that was tested under exigent circumstances

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:07.820
To meet an emergency. I've you know, I think I'm alright, you know, I'm like, maybe I'll be here tomorrow

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:13.140
Maybe I won't but what you're telling me is is that is basically pay better attention to what's going on

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:17.780
And I'm ashamed to say I haven't you know, let's be clear. You're a marathon runner. I saw you in the salad during the

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.220
Fuck I saw you eating a salad

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.300
I saw you eating a salad. I love the

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:26.500
Saw you eating a salad

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:31.460
I love the idea that Alex is sitting there and he's telling him like all this scary stuff and Norm's like I

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.820
Got the vaccine. Oh, no

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:41.340
It's funny when people take Alex seriously and try to restate the things back to him that he said

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:48.460
And try and act like they give a shit about kidding. Oh, I took the vaccine and now I'm worried. Oh

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.700
I was so scared

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:56.480
I had no idea that the guy who show I have been on a

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.320
Consistently for the past several years

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:07.860
Said that vaccines had something inside them that could kill you. This is breaking information to me the guy who I

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:14.860
Weirdly am on his show a whole bunch. Mm-hmm has been for a year saying don't get this vaccine

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:19.820
I got both of them. I got him immediately. I'm not as soon as I could now. I'm scared

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:27.100
I'm so worried that I'm gonna be oh, oh Alex. I could drop dead at any moment couldn't I?

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.540
I will say that he has the acting chops of most comedians that I've met. That's fair

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.480
You might fit in sensitive way, too

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:40.700
Right in there. Oh, yeah, so Alex has another guest after after Norm bails

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:46.200
Because he's so worried. He's got to get this vaccine out of him. He's got he's going out there. No

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.780
I'll give ball if I donate enough blood. I won't have any more vaccine in me

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:57.760
I imagine that's what he figured that does sound right. So he has Alex now has another person on and woohoo Nelly

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.320
So doctor, thank you. Dr. Carrie my day for joining us

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.760
I'm not gonna go over your whole bio

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.120
But here is a shot of it for TV viewers all the different places you've worked universities and hospitals and clinics

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.120
So Carrie my day is not a prestigious doctor

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.360
Who's been right about all this vaccine stuff the way Alex is gonna try to present her

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.320
She's a QAnon lunatic who's committed a series of public

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.440
Embarrassments that the audience that people like her and Alex have cultivated they're trained to ignore

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.000
Right an article in Vice pointed out a particularly sad instance of Carrie just believing whatever bullshit

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.520
She saw online quote this past summer

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.400
She was convinced that a long debunked website advertising the cannibal club restaurant in Los Angeles

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:43.080
Was in fact a real eatery serving human flesh. We taste like pork. She tweeted dear God

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:49.460
Help us change the world for the better. Oh boy. Carrie is an osteopath which on its own isn't necessarily a bad sign

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:56.420
However being an osteopath on Alex's show who also believes QAnon shit means to me that this is just a person pretending to be

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:57.560
A doctor. Yeah. Yeah

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.020
I was really I was really fascinated when she was like see what happens is if you eat a ferret

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:06.680
But then go to the cannibal club. It takes a year to digest the ferret true

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:12.480
But if you eat a person it only takes a week see it's reverse dog years situations at the animal club

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.480
It makes perfect sense

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:19.840
And also, I don't know if you remember this person because she has popped up on the show before but her big decline

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.400
Her big claim to fame wasn't saying that like kovat vaccines are gonna kill people

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.080
Her initial rise to prominence was based around a very not true claim that mr

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:34.200
Na would alter people's DNA. This in turn would change their DNA into something that would be patented in advance

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.080
So now your DNA was someone else's intellectual property

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.640
Bad

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:47.440
Conspiracy. Yeah, it's real dumb. But that's what she that's what she wrote. That's the wave she wrote in on

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:53.240
I it really bums me out. It really bums me out that these people don't understand

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.920
There are way cheaper ways

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.720
for corporations to steal money from all of us and they do it cheaply

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:07.200
This is so absurdly complex go if they're stealing your money at a regular low

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:13.840
Boring level. Yeah, they don't need conspiracies. No, as long as things like check cashing places

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.040
Or at least exist unregulated

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.800
That kind of stuff like why would anyone ever need to create oh

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:28.560
My yeah. Oh Jesus so stupid. Yeah, I mean you're you're evil Bill Gates

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:33.160
Who's the most evil man in the world who hates everybody who's creating this vaccine to kill?

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:39.640
Everybody is against fucking making a generic version of the vaccine that can be sent out around the world

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:47.160
He's actually doing the things that they say he's doing by not doing the thing that they say he's doing. Yeah, it's complicated

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.200
Yeah, sorry

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.960
Carrie is on and she has some bad news about periods

01:06:53.600 --> 01:07:00.620
In one day I asked my members I said does anyone have any problems with their menstrual cycle infertility, etc

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.240
since

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.040
Being around someone who's been vaccinated and I had over 700

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.480
Responses within six to twelve hours. It's unbelievable

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:16.760
This is anecdotal and I do not trust the reporting of weirdo Carrie Maday followers online

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.400
Hmm, this is just one of the new trendy things that anti-vaxxers anti-vaxxers are pushing

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.120
It's the idea that people who've been vaccinated or shedding diseases that are affecting people around them

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:26.360
Yeah

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.560
This is why Mike Adams insists people stay away from vaccinated people and why that dumb school in Florida banned teachers who had been

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:37.760
Vaccinated a recent article in the New York Times deals with this in no uncertain terms quote

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:42.080
Vaccinated people can't shed anything because there's nothing to be shedding said. Dr

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:49.000
Celine Gounder a infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and a member of President Biden's transitionary

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.360
Advisory team on the corona virus quote to the people who shed virus are people who have COVID

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.020
So if you want to prevent yourself or others from shedding virus

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:01.260
The best way to do that is to get vaccinated so you don't get COVID very interesting

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:07.920
Very interesting take from her if Carrie wants to make this conspiracy stick. She's basically gonna need to create a new theory of medicine

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.920
Yes, which would be interesting

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.800
Uh, Dan, I've got a new theory of medicine for you. Uh-huh. The Lord's will

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.780
Okay. So what about what does God think about nanotech loves it?

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:24.640
Another top five things for God is a very interesting possibility is because we're using nanotechnology

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.480
Because they have the ability to be like antennas or uses biosensors

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:36.200
What if they actually are emitting some kind of frequency out there? This is I know it sounds sci-fi

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.480
But it's a possibility not just sounds dumb

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:45.680
Um, what if what if these shots are putting nanotech into us? What is Dan? Yep. What if

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.920
What if Dan? Mm-hmm? What if all right now hear me out on this none of our left feet are real

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.000
Whoa, none of them shit all of this

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:02.020
Everybody has one foot right foot only the left foot all nanobots

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.600
Created by the devil. What if Dan?

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:12.700
How does this what does this have to do with the Human Genome Project being made to get Nephilim DNA?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.320
Well, that's where they got the Nephilim DNA. They removed all of our feet

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:26.400
Hurting me with your bullshit. Yeah, I mean like we just had Steve quail on the other day. Yeah, like what are we doing?

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.480
I'm struggling with all of the bullshit. You guys are expecting me to handle. Yeah, it's a lot

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.160
It's a lot but these are really serious concerns and it does turn out

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:41.060
I was kind of surprised to learn the carry is still worried about people having patented DNA

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:41.440
Sure

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.760
And everybody needs to know this that if any of these synthetic genes which the spike protein has

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:53.320
Synthetic genes in them if the synthetic gene gets integrated into our genome

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:58.040
Which can happen because we have enzymes in our body that can do that

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.020
If that happens then you can be owned by

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.900
Whoever owns that patent overnight

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:11.700
The Supreme Court Justice has ruled that a human being can be owned if they have a synthetic gene or genome

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:18.980
Inside of them. What's that court decision interesting interesting decision for Justice John Roberts to wait

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.880
Are you mmm-hmm? What's that court decision? I would like to know

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.000
Like that one. I fucking don't know the Supreme Court. So

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.560
Um, look, I don't find this person all that interesting. Oh, no

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:37.000
I think that she's a QAnon weirdo who has a bunch of really dumb ideas that aren't based on anything

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.280
But

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.280
This interview devolves

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:42.920
Okay

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:49.400
And it turns into a story of her getting inducted into the globalist cult or something

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.440
unclear

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:59.160
All right. Now you're selling me. Here we go. Okay describe that meeting where this whole scientific dictatorship tried to recruit you

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.200
Yes, this was actually a business owners meeting and we had to be bust into the

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.640
Location our cell phones were jammed. This is around 2014 and

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:16.520
We were locked in the building until the meeting was done. And this was a lot of big tech people CNN, etc, etc

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.880
I was a small fish and in there they talked about how they were going to change and modify

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.700
the behavior of the people of Georgia

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:31.520
with using their smart device a health app on there and with somehow getting they didn't tell us how a

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.880
Substance inside of their body that would be used as biosensors

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:40.120
The idea is they felt people here are too racist and they're not amenable to different cultures

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.760
so they took it upon themselves to change people and

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:50.080
They talked this is how I know about all these substances inside these injections because this is how I learned about them

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.240
they said these

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:58.740
Substances would analyze your data your thoughts your emotions. They knew if you're lying by a voice inflection app

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.160
Also, they knew if you're lying by a polygraph test with your sweat glands

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.160
They can do that also your blood sugar level your electrolytes test your breathing also

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:14.680
You know if you're having sex say you're interested in that if you're drinking alcohol if you're taking drugs

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.200
They know everything about you literally they said they could do it

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:23.160
So there's going to analyze this data and then they had an algorithm that a computer would

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.560
be in charge of and every time you lied even a little white lie about where you were the

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.800
This smartphone would know it immediately by these parameters and give you an instant repercussion

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:39.640
and then also over let's say one to three months all the lies would be added up and then you would be

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.720
Considered either a good human or a bad human

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.360
Computer would allow you the social credit system or cryptocurrency

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.960
You said this on my show this meeting happened man. Oh

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.480
boy, yeah, we

01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:03.360
We are bringing together this meeting of the miracle on 34th Street friends to determine whether everyone has been good or bad

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.120
I wonder like I if I were in the position that she is in

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:14.240
One of the ways that I might make myself seem a little bit more credible. How's that provide details you think what's the name?

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.360
Is organization who else was there? It's CNN. What why was CNN there? You see?

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960
No, see, you know

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:28.880
Okay, it was there. Okay. Wait, so the goal is to make people less racist. Yeah, that's why they have CNN

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.920
So that's why they have truth

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.000
What is it what do you raise we can't go to MSNBC

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:42.320
Shouldn't the story be that every time you're racist you lose points for your credit score. Isn't that only when you lie?

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.560
What the fuck is going on? So if you're lying about being racist, you will be shocked

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.960
Well, no, no, you're racist because you're sweet

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.960
You won't be right. I

01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:01.680
Love I love the confidence and the worry with which she tells a story of people

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.880
Really just

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:11.200
Figuring out how magic works and using it in any and every possible way because all of that she just said is magic

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.360
Yeah, I would assume that what she went to was like some kind of a get-rich-quick

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.560
Motivational seminar or something like that. It's just completely changed

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.520
Like one time I went to a Cutco meeting. Ooh accidentally you'll learn a life

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.880
One way or another you'll learn how to cut a penny

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.240
And that was the same kind of thing I was like you can't leave

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:42.380
Maybe that's I don't know this this all just she probably bought a timeshare because that's basically when you're getting a timeshare presentation

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.320
Eventually, you're going to think they're trying to kill everyone. Yeah. Oh

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.840
No, they're gonna try and make and I bet that she was saying something racist

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.760
Trying to make people less racist

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.580
Okay, all right

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:06.240
So anyway, Alex is super into this story because of course, of course, he was his dad was they tried to get a dentist

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.080
Yeah, and when he was the smartest boy in Texas, they tried to get

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:15.800
Into the globalist depopulation Texas, so Alex reveals something else here that I was unaware of

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.520
Go back to how they recruited you to this because they do this to a lot of groups

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.720
They go you'll be part of a special thinker group. These are over the best people, but this is proprietary information

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.720
We can't let this out because this company only wants to give you this secret

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.280
Did they have you sign a form agreeing to non disclose or what was it like to get put obviously not?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.480
And be taken there because they did this on 9-eleven at an Air Force Base

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.640
They asked all these CEOs to come the day before said it was a national security emergency

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:48.720
They put them all at 6 a.m. In there. They had jumbotron TVs the towers being blown up

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:54.040
We don't they told him this day. They followed orders, but but that's and that even came out

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:59.640
They did that by the way, you know that something secret happened on 9-eleven inside that that that hanger

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, was this the day before or was it on 9-eleven? What were they shown?

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:08.760
And well, they got talking they got brought there the day before right and they had a nice evening

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.820
They had I like a little mixer sure right and then the next morning they get up

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:19.720
They're all in line for the continental breakfast and they bring them and they're like, hey, hold on one second 9-elevens happening now

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.320
Let's talk follow orders. Yeah, it seems like that's that's the story that I heard boy

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.400
I know I don't know this is even like I've seen loose change

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:36.520
Strange how many different things happened in the intervening time period between when they did and did not happen very weird

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.260
Mm-hmm. So she talks a little bit more about this this meeting

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.960
This is so stupid

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.200
Well, I didn't really know what I was getting into. I thought this is just you know more for political reasons

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.640
This is a good idea to join. I did it for a year. I had three different people and courage me and finally I went to

01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:02.320
The first meeting which I just described which I was completely taken aback. No one prepared me for that

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.600
I tried to leave the building and they laughed at me and they said go ahead when they unlock the doors

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.680
My cell phone still didn't work and I I didn't know where my car was obvious

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:18.720
It was best in so I was stuck there and there was a non-disclosure in general that was signed but not for that particular meeting

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
but

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:28.680
It's a group so for a year they vetted you attested you watched you and then decided to try to bring in real first-level Wow

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:37.440
Yes, and yeah, I don't care if I had a non-disclosure in the general sense because these are crimes against humanity

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.680
Yeah, no shit. That's why there wouldn't be one. Yeah, that was just a regular old pyramids game. Yeah, that was a pyramids

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:48.440
Yeah, that was a pyramid scheme. Non-disclosure agreements do not cover criminal activity. Everyone fucking knows that

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:55.400
Yeah, how would you ever if you were running a secret taken over the world trying to control people with an anti-racism?

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:02.800
App that will monitor their sweat and dock their pay if they do I was I I was going to turn the person in

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:09.040
But then before I could testify against him, he married me. So it was against the law for me to testify against him

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.840
We've all seen movies. Yeah. Yeah, it's like okay. I was gonna blow the whistle on Hitler, but I'd signed an NDA

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.760
Yeah, you know you win some you lose. I went to the court and I told him all

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.000
And they said you're not allowed to look this is an NDA. Yeah. Sorry ironclad

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:31.720
Yeah, that that's the part of these supervillain fuck stories that are just so so much contract law. Yeah so much

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:39.000
Inviolable contract law. Yeah, despite dealing with the literal devil himself known for deception

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840
somehow contract law

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.120
inviolable I'm

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.920
Almost certain. This was a pyramid scheme. Yeah, no, that's absolutely a pyramid. Yes

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:55.340
No, I've heard that story way too many times to not know that's a pyramid scheme. This is the Nigerian JT

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:05.120
Absolutely, yeah, so here's what we do everything makes sense like there's a year yeah of like people being like

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.120
Hey, you should come to this Tupperware party

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:14.200
Yeah, yeah boy is really cool not look. Okay. It's not you're not selling anything. What you're doing is you just get a

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:20.600
Discount whenever you purchase something and then if other people use your numbers, they'll get a discount too

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:25.640
But you'll get a little bead of that. It's it's the globalists are coming to kill you

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:33.760
And they're like busing in to like a convention center or whatever. Yeah. Oh god

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.080
and the laughing if you want to leave makes sense too because I want to bully people to

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.460
Or make it seem like they're giving up something. They're foolish to leave right?

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.920
Everything is just a bucket

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.400
That is exactly how it works

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:54.120
God what a fun but but I love how Alex gets so excited about it as opposed to dealing with this critically like

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.440
There's no fucking way

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.920
This happened. Like you said it. No, absolutely not

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.320
Um, see anyway, that's the only thing I think is really fun about her

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.840
now we come to the end of this and

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:12.280
That gates was not mentioned once that does not surprise me Dan that does not surprise me

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:21.360
How important it was to defend back gates initially and so important that you had to insert your own

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.560
Personal story and Roger came on and Roger

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:32.320
Was there to defend him? It seems like now in his hour of need dad in the most crucial juncture

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:38.560
I've seen 48 hours 48 hours after the crime now Joel Greenberg has done him dirty done him dirty

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:47.240
They gave him they knew I know he's lying they took I took a polygraph test with his sweat I know he's lying

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:54.520
Oh, yeah, shocking shocking. That story was not cover so strange. So weird. So weird. It seems like that would be fair

01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:00.880
There was a lot to cover like Alex and Paul Joseph Watson's anger at Muslims. Yes in norm Pat by the way

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:06.460
Sensitivity about whiteness or well, they know what you went on doctor. Yeah

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:13.080
there's people with DNA getting IP and now everybody's gonna die because of

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:16.560
of globalists and yeah, they steal blood

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.840
It's just one of the things too that I've started to recognize and notice about these older episodes that I've listened to like these

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.560
2003 ones one of the real changes in

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:32.820
That I've seen is like there are so fewer guests back then and I think it's because Alex doesn't have to do shit

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:35.760
like he can eat a sandwich or he can let these

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:43.440
dumb dumbs talk and like it's just so easy for him to have five guests on a show as opposed to

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.040
Like covering anything. Yeah, his heart's not in the game. No

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.520
This is a guy with senioritis. Yeah, I mean in his defense

01:21:52.800 --> 01:22:00.080
Yeah, it sucks. Your show sucks the people you work with suck and you suck. Of course, it sucks

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.440
Yeah, you should be having a bad time

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.880
Anyway, Jordan, you've come to the end of this and man just embarrassing

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320
What

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.160
What about this episode was embarrassing

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:21.000
It's just like anybody who was looking at this from the outside would be aware that news had broken that's super relevant

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.480
You would force yeah, and it's news in a story that they have dealt with

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:31.360
Already vis-a-vis saying that Matt Gaetz just likes to party. Yeah, he loves to party

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.560
It seems like the kind of thing might want to follow up on especially considering

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.520
one of your

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.760
on again off again employees

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:47.440
Is in the mix well, and here's the here's the funniest part and not the funniest part. It's not funny

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.360
It's a really fucked up situation sure

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.840
But what's funny about Alex and them being so insistent on hey

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.880
This is a guy who just likes to party is the the more details you find out the more you're like

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.080
He didn't know she was 17 at the time. Mm-hmm. He didn't find out till later

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.480
Oh, you know where that kind of shit happens if you're a guy that likes to party all the time

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.800
Maybe you don't ask questions first

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:17.800
Mmm, it sure seems to be a reasonable situation instead of one where you're making it so ridiculous that this guy could be

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.400
Guilty of this crime sure, you know

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.600
like you built the story that it fits it and to the extent that like

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.120
sex workers shouldn't be

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:34.400
Stigmatized absolutely as long as they're of age and everybody's consenting and everything. That's that's not like anything. I would

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:41.280
Shame anybody about absolutely now, I'm more interested in the selling of pardons

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.520
See now here's the fun thing about that one

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.920
I almost and like I saw that and I was like, oh that's totally a crime and

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.320
No one's going to follow up on that part

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:59.480
They're gonna be like gates get him get him not the everyone knew that Trump was selling pardons for money. So
