2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dan and Jordan.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Knowledgefight.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Riddle her.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Riddle her.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Riddle her.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I need money.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Riddle her.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Riddle her.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Riddle her.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Andy and Kansas.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Andy and Kansas.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Stop it.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Andy and Kansas.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Andy and Kansas.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's time to pray.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thanks for holding us.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello, Alex.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm a first-time caller.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm a huge fan.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I love your work.

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Knowledgefight.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I love you.

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I love you.

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I love you.

34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I love you.

35
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I love you.

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love you.

37
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I love you.

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I love you.

39
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I love you.

40
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hey, everybody.

41
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,640
Welcome back to Knowledgefight, a little show where my friend and I like to get together,

42
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,200
drink novelty beverages, worship at the altar of Selene.

43
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Yes.

44
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
We're still getting the smooth intro.

45
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,640
That one's gonna take a little while to kind of integrate in.

46
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,920
We worship at the altar of Selene and talk about Alex Jones.

47
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Yes.

48
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
How are you?

49
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Jordan.

50
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Dan.

51
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Nice to meet you.

52
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
It's a pleasure.

53
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
It's a pleasure.

54
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,440
It's wonderful to meet you, Dan.

55
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Ah, boy.

56
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,920
Now, since we've officially introduced ourselves, I have a quick question.

57
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
What's your bright spot today, Dan?

58
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Why don't you go first?

59
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,960
Because I have a hunch what yours might be.

60
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,280
Oh, well, mine is obviously the release of my super-secret project.

61
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,200
Policy Wonk John sent us a-

62
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
You believe it's John.

63
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,960
Wait, well, I know it's John, probably.

64
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,080
The handwriting might be an issue.

65
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
The handwriting leads us to believe it's John.

66
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,680
I think it'll be easier just to say, if you are someone with bad handwriting who sent

67
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,160
us Pathfinder rule books, this one goes out to you, buddy.

68
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,920
Pathfinder rule books and all sorts of other figurine things.

69
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
So cool.

70
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,880
Not like a Warhammer figurine, but like a book of standee things you can play with.

71
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,040
Pre-written campaigns, all this really cool stuff.

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
And Space Finder, too.

74
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Yes, yeah, yeah.

75
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
The outer space version.

76
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,560
We'll have to figure that one out eventually.

77
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Yeah.

78
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,400
But when that package came in, just to give a little behind the scenes intel, I got overwhelmed

79
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,800
by the number of books and I said, Jordan, this is on you.

80
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
This is, yes.

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I believe you-

82
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
You need to read these.

83
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,960
Your words were somewhere along the lines of, you need to finally do some work.

84
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Yes.

85
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
This is your job now.

86
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Figure out what to do with this.

87
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Yes.

88
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Get a job.

89
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Essentially.

90
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Yeah.

91
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,920
I couldn't handle the idea of even cracking one of those books and then getting lost in

92
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
it.

93
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Yeah.

94
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
No one needs that.

95
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Oh, yeah.

96
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Yeah.

97
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I read them.

98
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
It was very hard to do.

99
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,560
So we decided to do as close to a Pathfinder campaign as possible.

100
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
As inspired by this.

101
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Yes.

102
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

103
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,000
So we've got you, Dan.

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,360
We've got our brilliant friends, Marty and Sarah from Marty and Sarah Love Wrestling.

105
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Yeah.

106
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,520
And then we have the lovely and talented Liz Anderson, who is absolutely fantastic.

107
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,080
And we are all playing a campaign that I wrote.

108
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Yeah.

109
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
And we're all just...

110
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,760
I mean, we're not really playing the goon so much with the...

111
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
We're playing your game.

112
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Yeah, exactly.

113
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,440
Yeah, and the first episode of it is on our Patreon right now.

114
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
Yes.

115
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
Yeah.

116
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
But it's not like behind a paywall or anything.

117
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

118
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
It's just posted there.

119
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,800
Just a reminder, everything on our Patreon is not behind a paywall.

120
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,440
And if you enjoy that, you should check out Marty and Sarah and Liz Anderson's projects

121
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
and support them.

122
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Yes, absolutely.

123
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Yep.

124
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,600
But I don't know how to embed things places.

125
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I don't know.

126
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah, if you...

127
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
So it's there.

128
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,040
If you know, embed it, we won't bother you.

129
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,640
So actually, this kind of dovetails into my bright spot.

130
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Yes!

131
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
First of all, I mean, semi-bright spot.

132
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,800
I really did enjoy doing that.

133
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,840
I know.

134
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
It's great.

135
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,640
It's certainly outside of the realm of what I normally am comfortable with in terms of,

136
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,960
I don't know, playing characters or whatever.

137
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,520
But everyone's character is so fun and silly.

138
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,940
It's great to get together a bunch of middle-aged people who have never played any kind of role-playing

139
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,040
game before, and we're all stand-ups and improvisers and podcasters, so it's basically just a

140
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
free-for-all.

141
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Yeah.

142
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
And I'm excited to see where it goes.

143
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,480
But also, in relation to these Pathfinder books and everything that came in, I realized

144
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,160
that we need to catch up a little bit on Z...

145
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Ooh, the mailbag!

146
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
...some of the mailbag.

147
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
Yeah.

148
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,960
Because we were going to do some more bonus episodes we haven't really been able to, and

149
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,000
then now this secret project has been unveiled.

150
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,260
And then it begins.

151
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
That's kind of...

152
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
Yeah.

153
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,600
We have the D&D kind of thing where we also zip the mailbag.

154
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,040
Yeah, that's not gonna happen!

155
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
That's weird.

156
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
We're not gonna make a...

157
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,720
My character is running away from a bar at the same time.

158
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Oh, what's this?

159
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,380
We're not gonna make Thomas the devilish Catholic come after anybody.

160
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,880
So Jordan, one thing, we missed this one a little ways back, but I wanted to say thank

161
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,920
you to Matt, who sent in that little poster of Chicago venues that we have.

162
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Oh yeah!

163
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Yeah, that's so cool.

164
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,640
Yeah, that was a really awesome little art piece, and we've missed that when we were

165
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
at ZFN in the past.

166
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Oh man, that's super cool.

167
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,120
Yeah, and so thank you to Matt.

168
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,360
Another person here, Sarah M., very excited about this thing that came in a little while

169
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
back.

170
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,840
It was some honeys that they were...

171
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
They're like...

172
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Metal honey is the name of the company.

173
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Yes!

174
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
It's spicy honey and like a really...

176
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,880
Like a flowery elixir one.

177
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
They were fantastic.

178
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,200
And so I wanted to say thank you to Sarah for those, and also the hot sauce of the month

179
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
has continued to roll in.

180
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Absolutely delightful, or have we had a kind of dud yet?

181
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
I don't think we've had a dud.

182
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,760
Some have not been as good as others, but I gotta say, this one, the Marie Sharps, the

183
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,960
habanero one from Belize that came in, that has been pretty...

184
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,160
Those ones are pretty in my wheelhouse in terms of like an everyday sauce.

185
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,040
Those have been pretty heavy in the rotation.

186
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,640
I feel like there was actually one in the hot sauce of the month that was kind of disappointing,

187
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,320
but I don't remember what it was.

188
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,280
There was one called Illuminati, like naughty, like bad.

189
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,560
Naughty, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

190
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,180
I don't think I liked that one much.

191
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,360
Maybe it was just bitter about the pun though.

192
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
That does sound like...

193
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,800
I mean, unless you were in the Illuminati, unless you were like Jay-Z or Beyonce, I

194
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,760
don't think it should be that offensive to you.

195
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,000
No, but I also should say this came with some Mexican candies, the honeys, which is a cool

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,440
thing that apparently is a signature of the Metal Honey brand.

197
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Nice.

198
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Send some candies along.

199
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
I like it.

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
Which, of course, I certainly need more candies.

201
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,880
Repeat customers, that's what they're going for.

202
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, so I appreciate that, and also I'm way overdue checking the mailbox, so there will

203
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,640
probably be some more coming up in the near future.

204
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,280
So Jordan, today we got an episode.

205
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Do we?

206
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Yeah, we do.

207
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,580
I think it was difficult to decide what to do, and I want to walk you through my thinking.

208
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,400
So the first thing I thought of was, I don't care about Alex's take on Bill Gates getting

209
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
a divorce.

210
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,240
I don't care about anything to do with Bill Gates getting a divorce.

211
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,000
I think it might be interesting to see him try and weave that into somehow it's part

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,940
of the globalist's plan.

213
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,840
I don't know, I don't care.

214
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,640
I think it's also a little bit like, I don't know, no matter what, it'll be disappointing.

215
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
I don't care for it much.

216
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,200
And I also started to realize that our show right now is becoming too much just Alex being

217
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,760
a goddamn anti-vaxxer.

218
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:55,420
It's so one note to a certain extent that I just, I get just burdened by it.

219
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,040
At the same time, we've been looking at 2003, and I had a realization.

220
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,200
You know where we are in 2003?

221
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
May?

222
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah, May 7th, which is the day this episode comes out.

223
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,640
This is a rare opportunity.

224
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,440
If we go back to 2003 today, we can cover something 18 years ago to the day.

225
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay.

226
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Well, now we have to.

227
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
I felt like I had to.

228
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
There's nothing we can do but that.

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Yeah.

231
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,920
So today we're going over May 7th, 2003.

232
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm Dan.

233
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,400
This is 2003.

234
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,560
Welcome to the wonderful world of 2003.

235
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,040
The music was revolutionary.

236
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Shit was happening.

237
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,000
People were having meaningful conversations on the street.

238
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,080
2003, just a heavy time in America.

239
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,600
Was 2003 Stankonia or The Love Below?

240
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I want to say that was around then.

241
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,520
I want to say that was around then.

242
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
But I could be wrong.

243
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Yeah.

244
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,640
I measured time by OutKast albums, in case you were wondering.

245
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
I think it might have been A Quemini.

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
No.

247
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Okay.

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,960
When was Bombs Over Baghdad?

249
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,280
What album was that on?

250
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,560
That was, or that was...

251
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
What album was that?

252
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm going to sleep.

253
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
I'm going to sleep.

254
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Oh no.

255
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
No.

256
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Bombs Over Baghdad, that was Stankonia.

257
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Okay.

258
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Well then that was probably around 2003.

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Yeah.

260
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
It was around 2003.

261
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I would assume.

262
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm more of a...

263
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,400
The time in my life that I would consider the salad days are the Southern Playlist of

264
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,600
Cadillac music days.

265
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
That's really where I live.

266
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Yeah.

267
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Fair enough.

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
And Italians.

269
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Fair enough.

270
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Yeah.

271
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Anyway.

272
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Yes.

273
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Jordan, let's list some more OutKast albums.

274
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Okay.

275
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,480
Before we get down to business on our trip to the past, let's take a little moment, Jordan,

276
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,920
to say what up to some new wonks.

277
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Ooh.

278
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,720
So first, Rick and Hannah, this is for you.

279
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,120
You're now a policy wonk.

280
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm a policy wonk.

281
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Thank you, Rick and Hannah.

282
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
This is for you.

283
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Thank you.

284
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Next, The Goddamn Pac-Man.

285
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,240
Also included in this is a shout out to you, Jordan, because of baseball season, and The

286
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,340
Goddamn Pac-Man wanted me to let you know, go Padres.

287
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,440
You're now a policy wonk.

288
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm a policy wonk.

289
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,880
Thank you very much, Goddamn Pac-Man.

290
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,080
Do you have any animosity towards the Padres?

291
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
No.

292
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,400
The Padres are fantastic.

293
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,880
Fernando Tatis is one of the most exciting, probably maybe the best player, and they stole

294
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,280
you Darv- Well, when I say stole you Darvish from the Cubs, what I mean more is the Ricketts

295
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,560
family threw you Darvish into the ocean and was like, San Diego, you can have him for

296
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
peanuts, Dan.

297
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Peanuts!

298
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
All right.

299
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Sorry.

300
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,200
Next, I'm Laura Taylor, and I'm definitely a witch.

301
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,520
You are now a policy wonk.

302
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
I'm a policy wonk.

303
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Thanks, Laura.

304
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,120
Next, Mike The Parrot Head.

305
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Thank you so much.

306
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
You are now a policy wonk.

307
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
I'm a policy wonk.

308
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Thank you, Mike.

309
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,440
I did this shout out mostly because Mike has a secret agenda, and that is to see what kind

310
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,880
of overlap there is between our podcast fans and Jimmy Buffett fans, and I'd rather not

311
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
know.

312
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
We'll never know.

313
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I hope not to.

314
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Nope.

315
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Next, Danny in Mexico.

316
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Thank you so much.

317
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
You are now a policy wonk.

318
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm a policy wonk.

319
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Thanks, Danny.

320
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Thank you.

321
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Next, let's get some technocrats.

322
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Okay.

323
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
All right.

324
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
First, we got William P. Thank you so much.

325
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
You are now a technocrat.

326
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,520
Also, The Baby Blaze, let's spell B-L-A-I-S-E.

327
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Okay.

328
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
The Baby Blaze.

329
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
The Baby Blaze.

330
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Who is a punk.

331
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
You are now a technocrat.

332
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm a policy wonk.

333
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Crikey, mate.

334
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
That's fantastic.

335
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Have yourself a brew.

336
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
How's your 401k doing, bro?

337
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
All right.

338
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,520
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

339
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's just get down to business.

340
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,080
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

341
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,000
Why you pimps so good?

342
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,640
My neck is freakishly large.

343
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,400
I declare info war on you.

344
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,640
Thank you, William, and thank you to The Baby Blaze.

345
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Yes.

346
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Thank you very much.

347
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
I don't know why I've lost my mind.

348
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I just had to double check it.

349
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Yeah.

350
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
Of course it's not on Stankonia.

351
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,160
It's on Bob.

352
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,360
It's on Bob's Over Bed.

353
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
That's the name of the album?

354
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Yes.

355
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Of course it is.

356
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
What am I?

357
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Stupid?

358
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

359
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Yep.

360
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Okay.

361
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Clearly.

362
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Yeah.

363
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
So, Jordan, we start here at the beginning of the day, the show, as Alex does.

364
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
He starts at the beginning.

365
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Of course.

366
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,900
And I have got this thesis that I'm working on that continues to seem more and more accurate,

367
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,960
and that is that Joe Rogan stole the word powerful from Alex.

368
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Another powerful broadcast lined up for you.

369
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,840
It is the 7th of May, 2003.

370
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,360
I'm Alex Jones.

371
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,040
If you were born on the day that this episode was recorded, you can vote.

372
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,360
Yes, of course you can.

373
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,740
Of course you can.

374
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,740
That's powerful.

375
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,080
That is powerful.

376
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,000
I've never done a, what's 18th anniversary?

377
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What would that be?

378
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
An eel?

379
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, I don't know.

380
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You speak Greek.

381
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What do you mean?

382
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, I mean, if it's a millennium is a thousand, that's kind of Greek.

383
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know if there's a word for an 18 eel.

384
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why not?

385
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Wow, these Greek.

386
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,200
These Greek people without their 18s.

387
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,320
I thought you meant like, you know how like it's a paper anniversary or like a gold?

388
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Oh, sure, sure.

389
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
What's the 18th?

390
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Well, what's that one?

391
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Ink?

392
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
I don't know.

393
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Papyrus, actually.

394
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,600
There's some weird ones in that list.

395
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Papyrus spatula year.

396
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
I mean, I could look, I could check.

397
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I don't care.

398
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
I don't think it's important.

399
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
No, we don't have the time to waste.

400
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,540
More importantly, Alex has undoubtedly got a claim.

401
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,240
He could take Joe Rogan to small claims court for stealing the intro of his show being,

402
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,880
this is a powerful transmission.

403
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,120
You know, I think they've gotten a lot from each other out of this situation.

404
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,440
I don't think Alex can be mad at Joe for what he's contributed in response for getting powerful.

405
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,440
But what I would like to say is that this furthers Alex's argument that I hate to say

406
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,880
I kind of agree with, that Joe is a sneaky snake.

407
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,320
Joe is a sneaky snake.

408
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
That's true.

409
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Yeah.

410
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
That's true.

411
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Powerful sneaky snake.

412
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Maybe that's what Alex said.

413
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Maybe that's what it's always been.

414
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,440
That's why Joe can't get rid of Alex.

415
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,160
Alex has powerful over him.

416
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Could be.

417
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,960
He's got too many skeletons in the closet.

418
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
This might be-

419
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,640
We've blown the whole thing open.

420
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,000
This was not what I was looking to discover, but I think we might've figured it out.

421
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We got it.

422
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

423
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We did it.

424
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The corruption is-

425
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The corruption.

426
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's the word powerful.

427
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's blackmail.

428
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,600
This is why there's an intellectual dark web.

429
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,360
The whole thing goes back to Joe stealing the word powerful.

430
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,040
I knew it would happen.

431
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Oh, well.

432
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,840
Now that we've solved that, let's get into something a little more meaty.

433
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Okay.

434
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,280
I now admit that the Private Lynch thing really wasn't a rescue.

435
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,440
It was totally staged.

436
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,880
The Iraqis had been gone for two days.

437
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,160
The doctors had walked down the road and told them days before to come get her.

438
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,480
The special forces hours before the raid had been across the street.

439
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,040
They knew the area was deserted.

440
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,880
Turns out it was theater, Hollywood.

441
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,360
So for the last few days here in 2003, Alex has been touching on this story of the alleged

442
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,360
rescue of Private Lynch, and I've been waiting for him to dig into it with some real depth

443
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,320
so I can get a better sense of his exact position, but it doesn't seem like there's much here

444
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,640
past what he said in that clip.

445
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,800
His position is that the rescue is all just Hollywood theatrics and nothing more.

446
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,160
The story of Private Lynch is actually a fantastic example of the precise problem with what Alex

447
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,840
Jones does for a living and how easy it is to get seduced into his way of thinking.

448
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:06,880
For some background, on March 23, 2003, Lynch's convoy was ambushed outside Nasirah in Iraq

449
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,680
and she was taken hostage.

450
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,960
Eleven of the other members of her group were killed in the ambush and Lynch was taken to

451
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
nearby Saddam Hospital.

452
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,800
There she was treated and on the evening of April 1st, she was rescued by US forces.

453
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,900
From this point forward, the story is one of complete malpractice by the media where

454
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,720
sensationalism led coverage of the story.

455
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Unnamed sources claimed that she'd been shot or stabbed, but conflicting reports came out

456
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,700
from her doctors who said that she had no such wounds.

457
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,960
Even as media outlets ran with a sensationalized version of the story, other outlets were digging

458
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,700
in to sort out what was and was not the truth.

459
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,500
By April 15th, outlets like the Washington Post were beginning to critically examine

460
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,680
their own initial coverage and question whether their account was accurate.

461
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,480
Washington Post headline, whoops, really should have done a better job on that one, our bad.

462
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,720
More or less, yeah, it's interesting.

463
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,360
And gradually, things fell apart and the truth of the matter came forward.

464
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,840
When Lynch was taken to Saddam Hospital, she was given appropriate medical treatment and

465
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,040
when US forces arrived to rescue her, there weren't any Iraqi forces there and much of

466
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,000
the characterization of her as a Rambo-type was based on overdramatization and misstatements.

467
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,320
Now, it's absolutely true that much of the media completely fucked this story up and

468
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,920
they may have had forces that were pretty excited that they were fucking it up.

469
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,400
The war in Iraq at that point was not full of good news like the Bush administration

470
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,520
would have wanted it to be and the idea that they would try to take this story and use

471
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,620
it for their purposes definitely seems like what they did.

472
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,000
If you read the House report that investigated the flow of information about the rescue titled

473
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,880
House Report 110-858, you can definitely see instances of members of the Department of

474
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,240
Defense giving inaccurate information about the rescue, which fed into the heroic drama

475
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,200
that was being sold by the media.

476
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Are you telling me that war-mongering politicians and their, oh, okay, you're doing this wild.

477
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,640
I'm not telling you that entirely.

478
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,360
I'm not saying that definitively.

479
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Sure.

480
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
And I think that's important.

481
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Yes.

482
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,720
Well, there's one instance.

483
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,960
On April 2nd, Brigadier General Vincent Brooks, a spokesperson for CENTCOM, told a press briefing,

484
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,680
quote, there was not a firefight outside the building, I will tell you, but there were

485
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,360
firefights outside of the building getting in and getting out.

486
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,020
That was not true, unless you take a very broad view of what getting in and getting

487
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
out means.

488
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,480
Well, we started the war a couple of months ago, so there were firefights for us to get

489
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,960
there, and then whenever she left, the war was still going on, so there were firefights

490
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
when we were leaving.

491
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
See?

492
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,320
On April 3rd, Navy Captain Frank Thorpe was quoted in the Military Times as saying that

493
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,560
Lynch, quote, waged quite a battle prior to her capture.

494
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,060
We do have very strong indications that Jessica Lynch was not captured very easily.

495
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,320
Reports are that she fired her M-16 rifle until she had no more ammunition.

496
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,760
None of that information is accurate, but it feeds into the creation of a story out

497
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,000
of the movies for the public to enjoy.

498
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,520
Yeah, like what they did with Lynch.

499
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Pat Tillman?

500
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Yeah.

501
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Tillman, that's right.

502
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,400
Yeah, that was another thing that was in that House investigation, the flow of misinformation

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,160
surrounding that circumstance.

504
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,400
Now, the thing is, those people and their statements, the Brigadier General Brooks and

505
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Navy Captain Thorpe, are not necessarily the people who gave the statements unnamed to

506
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
the Washington Post.

507
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Sure, true.

508
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,000
It's not like these people's statements, as inaccurate as they may be, are what fueled

509
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,120
directly the media sensationalism.

510
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,300
And it would be impossible to prove this definitively, but you'd also have to be kind of naive to

511
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,640
think that it's impossible that someone within the Department of Defense wouldn't have seen

512
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,160
the potential to spin this story for some much needed good press for the war.

513
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
You could have that suspicion, and you could point fingers at the media for bungling the

514
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,300
story, but if you do that, you have to be careful about where you're pointing.

515
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,060
If you damn the media for their mishandling this story, you also have to credit the media

516
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,940
for doubling back and questioning their own coverage when new information came to light.

517
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,860
This doesn't necessarily excuse the sensationalism that characterized the initial coverage, but

518
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,120
without actual journalists continuing to pursue the story, even if it meant embarrassing themselves,

519
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,120
this thread would have been much harder to untangle.

520
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,760
Second, if you believe that the DoD was definitely trying to pull propaganda games here and pushing

521
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,560
a false story, you have to ask how good they are at that.

522
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,240
This was a relatively easy propaganda story to pull off, and it fell apart in a matter

523
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,460
of weeks.

524
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,200
If you believe that this was all government spin, then I would suggest that this story

525
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,560
serves as a terrible argument that the government's always lying to us, and in fact it kind of

526
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,600
more firmly sports the idea that when the government tries to lie on a scale like this,

527
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
it doesn't work.

528
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,440
I mean, you know, at the time they had just lied their way into a war, so I bet they weren't

529
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,640
really caring too much about whether or not everybody caught them lying.

530
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,200
I mean, and then as far as the competence with which they do things go, they had just

531
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,580
incompetently lied their way into a war that they were fighting incompetently that were

532
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,440
still fighting incompetently, so it would make sense to me that the government, as it was

533
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,560
at the time, would very much try and push the story so incompetently that it would backfire

534
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
on them.

535
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Interesting.

536
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Yeah.

537
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,680
So I think the most important thing about this, and the most important aspect to really

538
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,360
delve into, is where one thinks the conspiracy exists.

539
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,020
I don't fault people for thinking that the Bush administration would have a vested interest

540
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,860
in the sensational version of the story being reported, and that possibly unnamed US officials

541
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,880
fed the flames of the story to the media, so you can suspect, you know, that they maybe

542
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
wanted the media to get this wrong in this way.

543
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,220
That's a different thing than the narrative that Alex is selling.

544
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,000
The story that Alex is telling is that the entire rescue operation itself was a contrived

545
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,880
theatrical affair, which is completely unsupported by the facts.

546
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,500
The DOD Office of the Inspector General conducted an investigation due to the insistence of

547
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,000
Rahm Emanuel, of all people, into the allegations that the rescue was, quote, premeditated fabrication.

548
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,920
From the report, quote, based on the results of the preliminary inquiry conducted by the

549
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,160
Inspector General, United States Central Command, we concluded that the allegations were not

550
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,600
substantiated and that no further investigation was warranted.

551
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,680
During the inquiry, the Inspector General, US CENTCOM, reviewed numerous classified operational

552
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,800
documents that were not available to the media, and interviewed over 30 witnesses, many of

553
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,480
whom had firsthand knowledge of the events at issue.

554
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,880
In addition to this, Vernon Loeb, one of the writers of the first Washington Post story,

555
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,460
the actual first one that shed off the sensationalized coverage, he was interviewed on NPR's Fresh

556
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,740
Air in December 2003.

557
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,400
In that interview, he clarifies that the information he was getting that the story was based on

558
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,520
was wrong, but it ultimately traced back to bad intelligence from the field.

559
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,880
Inaccurate information was conveyed, collected from intercepts and misrepresented and misinterpreted

560
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,680
details, and then that story was reported.

561
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,080
Which kind of puts a little bit of a hole in the theory that is all an elaborate hoax.

562
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,260
It's more mishandling, and if you want to get a conspiracy about like, hey, it works

564
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,080
in certain people's best interests that there was this mishandling.

565
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
That's not crazy.

566
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,520
Yeah, no, I mean, it seems almost impossible to think of it as anything other than opportunistic

567
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,400
idiots bungling a martyr story, you know, or a war hero story.

568
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,920
And I think if you want to keep it in that sort of territory, you're on more, like, not

569
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,400
totally unreasonable ground.

570
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Yeah, that seems reasonable.

571
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm doing it the way Alex is doing it, and this idea that it's like, ah, they had premeditated

572
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,600
intentions of creating this fake rescue in order to trick people into supporting the

573
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,220
war or whatever.

574
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,920
That is where it's like, okay, this is a conclusion that is unearned, unsubstantiated, you can't

575
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,000
back this up, and it's nonsense.

576
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,260
And this is the point that I'm trying to make.

577
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,960
When you have this suspicion and this like, I don't know, I don't trust these people pushing

578
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:11,020
a fucking war, and this story, it was mishandled on some level.

579
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,200
Inaccurate statements were made, whether it was because of bad information being conveyed

580
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,700
to the people making the statements or some kind of a, eh, mishandling, who knows.

581
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,000
That suspicion is not that bizarre.

582
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,800
It's not unnatural to have that healthy distrust, but that healthy distrust gets transmuted

583
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,600
by someone like Alex into confident assertions of a conclusion that isn't based in reality.

584
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,860
And that's where the danger is, even with this 2003 Alex that's a far different Alex

585
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,200
than the present in terms of some of his methodologies.

586
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
That is true.

587
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:57,760
I mean, but it's just so easy, it's just so easy, especially at the time, because they

588
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,340
literally lied us into a war that's never going to end.

589
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,960
Like that's a conspiracy on the level of something that is so huge.

590
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,040
I mean, an actual war, an invasion of another country, and it was a conspiracy, and it was

591
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,040
a lie that it's hard to imagine anything's beyond those people, you know?

592
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:26,120
Like why would, do you really think it's beyond the people who lied us into a forever war

593
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,900
to fabricate one small thing?

594
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,560
You know, like that seems like a reasonable overreaction at the time.

595
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
If that makes sense.

596
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Do you know what I'm saying?

597
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Right.

598
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,760
But what you're describing is essentially Alex Jones's sort of indoctrination process.

599
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Exactly.

600
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
Yeah.

601
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,060
I mean, yes, it is compelling and it certainly could be persuasive to say, they did X, why

602
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,460
wouldn't they do something else?

603
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
And that's fine.

604
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,940
But then, all right, any argument is gone.

605
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,440
Why wouldn't they do, you could just use that to justify 100 conspiracies that you want

606
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
to believe in.

607
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Oh, totally.

608
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Totally.

609
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
And it's just, it doesn't work.

610
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Yeah.

611
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
No, I don't think there's any way-

612
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,240
If you prove that someone is morally capable of an act, it doesn't prove that they did

613
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
it.

614
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Right.

615
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Right, right, right, right.

616
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
No, totally.

617
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
I absolutely agree.

618
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,200
But that hijack is what Alex uses.

619
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Right.

620
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,320
If they are morally capable of this, then they must have done it.

621
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Right.

622
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Right, right, right.

623
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
And that's just not reality.

624
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Yeah.

625
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,800
It's hard not to think that history is going to look at the Bush administration as infinitely

626
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,680
worse than anything Trump ever did.

627
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:43,120
It's hard to think that history won't look at Bush as one of the single worst genociders

628
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
there's ever been.

629
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,600
Feels like Trump has some time left, though.

630
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
That's true.

631
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
That's true.

632
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,960
He can still catch up.

633
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,040
So Alex has some interesting predictions that he makes in this episode that seem very

634
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,440
reminiscent of the present day.

635
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,320
The New World Order is here.

636
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,440
It's in our face.

637
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,520
It's with us right now.

638
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,680
And they're preparing a national draft.

639
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,280
Even if you don't serve overseas, you'll serve here in- Yes, we've looked at the programs.

640
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:23,000
Paddle tail squads, anti-gun programs, environmental cult groups locally, literally what they are.

641
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,320
Under George W. Bush, who's the testular head of things right now, they put a Republican

642
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,520
in for this final destruction of America so conservatives would hesitate just long enough

643
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,200
so they could get the job done.

644
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,320
So we've been in the New World Order for 20 years now.

645
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,100
No, it just occurred to me that when he says all of these things and then they don't happen

647
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:52,840
and he's like, see, we stopped it, like, yeah, but now you've been foiling the same plot

648
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
for 20 years.

649
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Yeah.

650
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,880
This is like, we're reading Batman serialized comics.

651
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,680
Bush was going to put in the draft and that was going to have tattle tail squads and then

652
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,640
Obama was going to have a draft and it was going to have the Obama youth or whatever.

653
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

654
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,040
And then, you know, and he puts the Joker back in Arkham Asylum and then a week later

655
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,840
Joker breaks out with the same plan again and he foils it again.

656
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,120
And there's a whole lot of immediacy every time.

657
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Every single time.

658
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,560
The only difference I would say is that within the world of DC Comics, the Batman and Joker

659
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
do exist.

660
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
Yeah, that is true.

661
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,560
That is true.

662
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,040
It would be like if Batman was making up Joker schemes in order to foil them over and over

663
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
again.

664
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Oh shit.

665
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,320
And did not possess the creativity to come up with new plans.

666
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,800
I think you have got a new take on the Batman character.

667
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,240
It's a rich psychopath who is inventing super villains in order to play out this massive

668
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,040
fantasy that he has of being a superhero.

669
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,640
Oh my god, that sounds real!

670
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,480
I know a guy who could write that for you.

671
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Yeah.

672
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:03,160
So at this point in 2003 there were some beginnings of democratic processes being attempted within

673
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Iraq.

674
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Mm-hmm.

675
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,800
And Alex has some interesting takes on that.

676
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,880
They've been on the news and they're saying to everyone that, oh look, this will make

677
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,160
the detractors shut up.

678
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,440
They said it might be five years before there were elections in Iraq.

679
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,760
And look, already in Mosul, an election.

680
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,200
Well I went and actually read our own government's release of what they've done in Mosul.

681
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,440
They have, our government has chosen 200 people, former assets, still current assets, CIA,

682
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,800
current leaders, communists, others.

683
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,600
And just like they chose Saddam to be the dictator of Iraq back in the 70s, been their

684
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,720
hit man since 58.

685
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,240
Well now they're just choosing 200 strongmen and they quote, will elect, they will appoint

686
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,320
the governor of that northern district and the gubernatorial seat will be Mosul.

687
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,680
So I was able to find articles and outlets like the New York Times and LA Times about

688
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,480
the Mosul election from early May 2003 and the tone that they have is a lot more restrained

689
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,440
than Alex is presenting it.

690
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,760
The New York Times article starts like this, quote, Iraq took its first faltering step

691
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,200
toward democracy today when a large ethnically diverse group of local leaders held an election

692
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,520
to choose an interim government in this northern city, Iraq's third largest.

693
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,320
The reporting recognizes that this is a first step in a process, not necessarily the end

694
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,920
result itself, whereas I feel like Alex is trying to pretend that the media is saying

695
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,200
that this is a job that's finished.

696
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,600
The election that was held wasn't just agents selected by the CIA or whatever the fuck Alex

697
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,880
is saying, it was a group of 240 tribal leaders and local residents from nine ethnic groups

698
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,280
that make up the population of the area.

699
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,000
These 240 selected a group of 24 council members who then went on to choose a mayor.

700
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm not going to pretend that I know whether or not this was the best way to handle a preliminary

701
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,460
election for an interim government, but my point is that from everything I can tell,

702
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,800
Alex is misrepresenting what's going on.

703
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,800
It's great to be opposed to the war because you should be, but your opposition should

704
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,500
be based in reality and I don't feel like there's a lot of dealing with the war as it

705
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,640
exists on his part.

706
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,560
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,600
It seems like if you don't deal with such a massive thing going on and instead create

708
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,000
toxic conspiracy theories about it that push people towards the far right, I bet that's

709
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,800
going to have repercussions later on.

710
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,240
Yeah, I don't think it was the right way to express opposition.

711
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,100
Yeah, I think later on we're really going to find out that the results of those things

712
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,480
combining are really going to be bad for us.

713
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,120
I think my parents' friends who were hippies might have had a better handle on things.

714
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Yeah.

715
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,960
So, you know, on our last episode about 2003, I think, maybe it was two back, Alex discussed

716
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,720
how he was going to go to Missouri to do a radio event.

717
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Sure, sure, yes.

718
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Car dealership opening.

719
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

720
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,260
And this is so foreign from Alex's present-day mentality because I kind of believe he's telling

721
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
the truth here.

722
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Okay.

723
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,960
So the whole proceeds, 15 bucks, go to KCXL, they wanted to give me some of the money,

724
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,360
but I said, you know, I'm not like the Patriots for profit, I'll come up and sell my videos,

725
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,760
that's fine, but you just keep the money.

726
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,720
You've had us on for three years telling the truth, so I'll come and speak at your event

727
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,160
and this will certainly help you guys expand your operation and increase your power and

728
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
everything else.

729
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
So they're great folks.

730
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I hope a lot of you come.

731
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,960
I hear thousands are planning.

732
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,040
I kind of believe that he probably would turn down money to do a radio event back then.

733
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Yeah.

734
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,240
It doesn't feel insincere.

735
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
I don't like it.

736
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,440
I don't like it, Dan, but I do buy it.

737
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,480
I think I believe him here.

738
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,520
I don't know, though, I don't know the tone of his lies in 2003, Dan.

739
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,520
I also think that there's a possibility that he has a reason to believe that he could make

740
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,480
more money selling DVDs than he could for whatever his appearance rate would be.

741
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,560
Yeah, I imagine they didn't give him.

742
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,800
It's still a calculation, maybe.

743
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:06,320
Maybe the appearance fee was lowball enough that your pride would be better off denying

744
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,320
it than taking it.

745
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
That could be.

746
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,960
But yeah, apparently he was willing to go for free to a radio event in Missouri back

747
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
in 2003.

748
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Yeah!

749
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,160
Yeah, that's intense.

750
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:23,820
So at this point, Alex not only going to radio events for free, he is also doing the work.

751
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,720
He's doing a lot of work.

752
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,640
Another side note, I am running on three hour sleep and I've done this about four days straight.

753
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,200
I do this a couple times a year.

754
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Well more than that.

755
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,360
Maybe that's why I look more like Jabba the Hutt instead of James Bond like he used to

756
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
look.

757
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,720
But the point is, the point is, I have completed a new film.

758
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
It is done.

759
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,000
It is being mass produced as we speak.

760
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,680
So on the website we say that it ships in one week and that's accurate if you want your

761
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:14,080
order sent out first, you'll definitely want to go to Infowars.com or Infowars.net or PrisonPlanet.com

762
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,960
and click on the shopping cart to order Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

763
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,440
So I have decided that it's been too long since we've done a documentary and as we're

764
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,240
back in 2003, Alex just released this documentary.

765
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
I feel like it's perfect timing.

766
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,480
We've got to cover Police State 3.

767
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,120
We're going to cover Police State 3?

768
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
I think we might.

769
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Oh shit.

770
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Yeah.

771
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Oh boy.

772
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,720
I got this, you know, this energy.

773
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,440
Was that the one whenever Bobcat, his star was really starting to wane down after three?

774
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,840
Was that the one?

775
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,320
That was Mission to Moscow.

776
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,940
Okay, that was five.

777
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
Was he still at five?

778
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
I don't know.

779
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
Oh, Bobcat.

780
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,940
Matt Bobcat.

781
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Nicest guy in the world.

782
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,940
I'm sure.

783
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Love him.

784
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Yeah.

785
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,940
So Alex has got this new film.

786
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
Very exciting.

787
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Yeah.

788
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Good for you.

789
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
Yeah.

790
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Police State 3.

791
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Can't wait to watch that bullshit.

792
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Oh boy.

793
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Oh boy.

794
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,940
So that may be coming soon.

795
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Also, Jordan.

796
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
I don't know.

797
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,520
I don't know what's so egregious to me.

798
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:22,880
The idea of going online and putting a dramatic documentary title such as Police State 3 into

799
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,360
your order cart and you're just staring at Police State 3 clicking buy.

800
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,760
You got to feel like shit if you're not buying Police State 2 and 1 also.

801
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,240
There might be important information on those.

802
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Yeah.

803
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
Is it serialized?

804
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Are we going to miss out?

805
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,600
I don't know, but if we do cover it, I'm not doing the other ones.

806
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,480
No, you're going to have to watch them for background.

807
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,680
I don't know if I'm going to.

808
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,840
So at this point, Jordan, we know in the future, present day.

809
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,200
Who are Alex's enemies?

810
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,480
Oh boy.

811
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,600
The list is ongoing, but mainly S.T.E.L.T.E.R.

812
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,240
No, not individuals.

813
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,840
How would you describe them?

814
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Oh, literal demons.

815
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,120
Minions of the devil.

816
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Yes.

817
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,840
Interestingly, here is who the new world order is in 2003.

818
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
Okay.

819
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,680
I have poured my life's blood into these films.

820
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,280
My burning the candle at both ends in the defense of the Republic.

821
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,880
If this was the Alamo, they're coming over the wall in the defense of the Republic.

822
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,240
And we're defending against the new world order, the European bankers that own our government,

823
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,960
and we must educate people if we're ever going to have liberty.

824
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,040
So it's European bankers is the new world order.

825
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,880
It's not so much the devil, the literal Christian devil.

826
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Yeah.

827
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:50,520
I mean, it's nice that we haven't seen the enemy at our gates yet, so to speak.

828
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:58,480
I think it's interesting how there's this fast and looseness.

829
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Yeah.

830
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,920
What do you actually think?

831
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,260
I don't know.

832
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,800
I don't know.

833
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't know.

834
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't know.

835
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't either.

836
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't know.

837
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,040
That's what's so interesting about this, because we know in the future he will be fighting

838
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
the devil.

839
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

840
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,160
And there's some slight indications that we've seen from 2003 that he seems to think there's

841
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,560
something going on.

842
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Right, right, right, right.

843
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,440
But then, when he's talking about the new world order, he talks about it in terms of

844
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,760
international European bankers, which is exactly the sort of presentation that he wants people

845
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,340
to have at this point.

846
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,920
This is about the Federal Reserve.

847
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,240
This is about fiat currency.

848
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
I don't know.

849
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,960
I want to know if he actually thinks it's the devil back then.

850
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,360
I kind of think that... Here's what I think it is, all right?

851
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,760
Here's what I'm going to go with.

852
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,760
I'm going to go with its necessary escalation is what happened.

853
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,440
Like Iron Man came out around 2003.

854
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,960
It's just one dude fighting against his director, or whatever it is he's doing.

855
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,240
Real low stakes.

856
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,800
By the end of it, we've got to restart the universe.

857
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
He starts out.

858
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,640
He's like, oh, European bankers are out.

859
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,520
And then 20 years later, we're fighting the literal devil.

860
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
It makes sense.

861
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,360
Yeah, but look, dude, Iron Man-

862
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:20,440
If he's doing Batman, he's essentially doing the entire Marvel universe as we go along.

863
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:28,960
In Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. wasn't pretending that he wasn't fighting Thanos, right?

864
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,640
He didn't know he was fighting Thanos.

865
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,760
But Alex seems to have some awareness of the devil.

866
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,920
Well, there is that.

867
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
There is that.

868
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,160
But Thanos didn't hatch his plan for another 10 years, or whatever.

869
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,360
It's a line of awareness that I'm interested in.

870
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,720
I can't quite get my finger on it yet.

871
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,760
So Alex goes to calls, and he takes a caller who wants to talk about Dennis Miller.

872
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,120
Sure, great.

873
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,760
Mark in Minnesota, you're on the air.

874
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Go ahead.

875
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Hey, Alex.

876
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
How you doing, sir?

877
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
Oh, pretty good.

878
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,960
I seldom watch TV, but I just happened to be watching The Tonight Show last night.

879
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,680
And Dennis Miller was on there.

880
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
And I always seem to-

881
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,600
Yeah, so-called, ultra-socialist, anti-gun.

882
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Real quick, ultra-socialist Dennis Miller.

883
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,120
But one fun thing to point out is this is 2003, because Dennis Miller was on The Tonight

884
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Show.

885
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,320
Now, worshipping Bush, pro-war, anti-freedom.

886
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,120
Of course, this is a liberal sneak attack.

887
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,800
I mean, he's like just- I mean, nothing but praise and accolades for Bush.

888
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,680
I mean, Sig Hill, George Bush.

889
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,920
Let me tell you something, I have him on tape literally engaging in a 10-minute worship

890
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
session.

891
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Yes, you saw that then.

892
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,440
Well, no, I saw him months ago.

893
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,080
It's wall to wall, sir.

894
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Fair enough.

895
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Fair enough.

896
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
Yeah, I mean, hey, yeah, good.

897
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Dennis Miller sucks.

898
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,240
Was this back when he was on Monday Night Football?

899
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Oh, man.

900
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Jesus.

901
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,800
No, I think that might have been a few years earlier.

902
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Oh, okay.

903
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,200
But like this, yeah, this is- sure, yeah, Dennis Miller sucks.

904
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,880
And he was a guy who promoted the Iraq war in a shameless way.

905
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,440
Yeah, he went crazy.

906
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,940
But I think time has shown us that he stayed on that pretty conservative path and was pretty

907
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,940
in favor of Trump.

908
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,240
Yeah, he's a real piece of shit.

909
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,840
He followed a lot of the similar path that Alex walked out.

910
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Yeah, yeah.

911
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,400
And instead, Alex is saying this is a secret socialist ultra-left person trying to pretend

912
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,680
to be conservative in order to Trojan horse George Bush on us.

913
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,440
That explanation, it doesn't make sense in hindsight.

914
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,040
Just a fucking dick who lost his mind.

915
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,340
Yeah, yeah.

916
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,340
Real dick.

917
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,400
Real dick.

918
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,400
It's nice to know that no matter what era we live in, right-wing commentators will still

919
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,120
have very strong opinions about comics who don't matter.

920
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Yeah.

921
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Great.

922
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,120
And it's pretty universal in no one likes Dennis Miller.

923
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Yeah.

924
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
Fuck them.

925
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Except Bill O'Reilly.

926
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Fuck them too.

927
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,080
So in this next clip, Alex talks about an interaction that did not happen.

928
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,960
It's not globalists in a hot tub.

929
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,480
It seems to be a Nazi at a gas station, maybe.

930
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,760
Is that a classic joke?

931
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,740
I don't think this happened.

932
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:11,640
About two weeks ago, I was taking the family out and I was, my wife, my parents were in

933
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,040
the car, we're going out to eat and I run into the store, pay for the gas and I'm standing

934
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:22,800
there and a guy with iron cross tattoos, everything else is in there, Mr. Trendy, who's not trendy

935
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,280
at all, establishment brainwashed carbon copy cookie cutter creature, and he's buying this

936
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,680
proud to be an American decal at the front counter and he goes, man, I'll tell you, I

937
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
love it.

938
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,320
All this oil we're getting.

939
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,680
And I go, oh, oil.

940
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
And he's, yeah, it's great.

941
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,320
And I'm like, well, you don't think you're going to get that oil, do you?

942
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
I don't care.

943
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
We're tough.

944
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,920
And the guy behind the counter started, you know, laughing at him and he goes, Hey, how

945
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
you doing Alex?

946
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
The guy behind the counter knew who I was.

947
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,600
And I said, look, don't you know, they're killing people over there and you know, this

948
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
is a fraud.

949
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,840
They told us it wasn't about oil.

950
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,680
Now they admitted, ah, so what we needed, I said, sir, you're not part of the establishment.

951
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,560
They can't, they're like a poor North Korean who just loves Kim Jong Il, but you can't

952
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,040
help these people.

953
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,980
From at least 2010 onward, all the way to his running for president, Donald Trump was

954
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,960
completely preoccupied with the idea of taking oil from countries where we've been at war.

955
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,600
An editor's note in an article from the Brookings Institute called it quote, the most dangerous

956
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,440
and irresponsible of all the Republican nominees' policy proposals.

957
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,040
And Alex justified it when Trump had the exact same perspective he's shooting down as dumb

958
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,680
back here in 2003.

959
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
Yep.

960
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:41,080
Also, I think it's weird, um, that Alex is saying that being a Nazi is trendy in 2003.

961
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,120
I don't know what kind of company he's swinging with back then, but, um, honestly, for Alex,

962
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,720
that guy was ahead of the times.

963
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Really.

964
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,600
He was, he was out at the forefront of, of pop culture.

965
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
He was an early adopter.

966
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Absolutely.

967
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Of the right-wing eventual.

968
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,560
That guy's, that guy's basically the Jack Kerouac of the, of the Beat movement.

969
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,040
You know, he was there early.

970
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
That's tough.

971
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
Yeah.

972
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
Yeah.

973
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,280
I just don't like the idea of like looking at somebody with an Iron Cross tattoo and

974
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,840
be like, fucking trendy.

975
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,760
It's like my, like how I look at my friends who were too into Tiger King, and I'm like,

976
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,560
that's how Alex looks at a guy with a Nazi tattoo.

977
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Absolutely.

978
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Fuck.

979
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,360
Either that or he's just like, oh, look at you.

980
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,840
So many goddamn Nazis with their Iron Cross tattoos everywhere these days.

981
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Johnny come lately.

982
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,040
There used to be bell bottoms and now there's Iron Cross tattoos.

983
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Right.

984
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
What's the next fad?

985
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,320
So I think that one of the things that I keep getting a sense of in these 2003 episodes

986
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,400
is a lot of Alex's opposition to George Bush comes down to a complete feeling that Bush

987
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
is going to take all of his guns.

988
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,800
And I want to keep mentioning that not only is Bush going to reinstate the Clinton gun

989
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:03,180
ban and a magazine ban with pleasure, by the way, they are also going to bring forward

990
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,840
our Lady of Peace Act that registers all gun owners, shuts down gun shows.

991
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,020
Well, it's all the stuff in S-22.

992
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,640
Our Lady of Peace is one bill in S-22 and there's the shut down the gun show section,

993
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,120
national ballistics database, I mean, stuff that makes what Bill Clinton did look conservative.

994
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,320
Folks, mayday, we're losing everything here.

995
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,360
S-22, also known as the Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act of 2003 was introduced

996
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,720
by Tom Daschle on January 7th, 2003 and he promptly died before even receiving a vote.

997
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Yeah, I was going to say.

998
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,900
Clinton signed the federal assault weapons ban in 1994 and it was set to have a sunset

999
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,560
clause after 10 years.

1000
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,560
So it was a ban that only existed until 2004 when it would be reexamined and it expired

1001
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
in 2004 and Bush did not renew it.

1002
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Yeah.

1003
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,720
None of the stuff that Alex wants to make these listeners scared of happened, which

1004
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,560
is kind of the case always.

1005
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1006
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Mm-hmm.

1007
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,240
Well, it distracts from the stuff that is happening and that's, you know, you don't

1008
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,160
want to get in the way of real things.

1009
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
True.

1010
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
You could get hurt.

1011
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
True.

1012
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,760
That's why you don't make Shadowgate, Dan.

1013
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,560
You don't get in the way of the real stuff.

1014
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,560
Oh, yeah.

1015
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,560
You stay away from that.

1016
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,560
You stay away.

1017
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,560
Stay away from the gate of gates.

1018
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,320
Alex doesn't get into that deep spy stuff.

1019
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,480
And whatever you do, don't talk about Roger.

1020
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,680
Oh, yeah, you're gone.

1021
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:32,320
So Alex takes another call and this guy has a perspective of like, you know, we're over

1022
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,560
there and we're trying to bring democracy into the Middle East countries and what have

1023
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,760
you and I don't see anything happening here.

1024
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,760
I don't see anything happening in my life, whatever.

1025
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,080
Alex says something really fucked up after that.

1026
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,960
He said before, but the fact that he keeps saying it troubles me.

1027
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,880
You know, it's funny that you mentioned the thing about people sharing in the power.

1028
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,640
I was thinking about that same issue three days ago.

1029
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,440
It popped into my head and I said to myself, wait a minute.

1030
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,920
How is it benefiting the general population of this country?

1031
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:11,040
In other words, how are we sharing in any of the benefits of what's going on?

1032
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,760
I stopped and I looked around.

1033
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,560
Gas prices are still about as high as they ever were.

1034
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,160
Nothing has changed, at least as it relates to John Q.

1035
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
Publick.

1036
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
And we're losing our liberty and freedom.

1037
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:26,280
I mean, if we had some war emperor who was totally reaffirming all our rights, leaving

1038
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,800
us alone, really taking out the we're not being really giving up freedom, really trying

1039
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,240
to train with them, I'd say, well, this is this is a radical departure from what George

1040
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Washington said.

1041
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,360
But it's not that bad.

1042
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,440
It's not that bad.

1043
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,520
He has a very conditional idea about colonialism.

1044
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,520
Yeah.

1045
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Yeah.

1046
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,760
Does not seem to have a principled idea against regime change.

1047
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,760
No.

1048
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,880
Against nation building.

1049
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Yeah.

1050
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,400
Which is what he wants people to think he has.

1051
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Yeah.

1052
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,640
And it's not it's conditional.

1053
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,800
It's about whether or not the people who are going and taking over other countries leave

1054
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,120
him alone or not.

1055
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
Right.

1056
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
Right.

1057
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,120
Right.

1058
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,120
Right.

1059
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,120
No, no.

1060
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,120
You'd be totally fine with like King Leopold if he just didn't take away his gun.

1061
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,200
One hundred percent.

1062
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
It's fucked up.

1063
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
Yeah.

1064
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,040
No, he's against regime change, except for in the right conditions.

1065
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Yeah.

1066
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,400
Just like he's against the Capital Six riot because it wasn't the right time.

1067
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,800
It wasn't the right preparation.

1068
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,840
Yeah.

1069
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,840
That to me is really a real glaring hole.

1070
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,700
And like, I can't I can't I mean, I guess a lot of the times people who would be listening

1071
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:33,460
to this maybe back in 2003 or just listening to it on the radio wouldn't be listening to

1072
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,880
it as critically necessarily as I'm listening to it now.

1073
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,040
But that seems like something that should be a real problem for him and his listeners.

1074
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,280
The idea that he would be OK with a war emperor who goes around as long as they reaffirm our

1075
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,760
rights the same way that George Washington would have now obviously abolishing the Constitution.

1076
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,560
There would be a discussion.

1077
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,280
There's like all of his intros are like, you want to end tyranny?

1078
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Well, so does he.

1079
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
It's like this.

1080
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,720
You understand that this is exactly the way that, you know, people rationalized a lot

1081
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
of it.

1082
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,040
So you want to end dictatorships?

1083
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,000
How about a benevolent one?

1084
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Right.

1085
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Interesting.

1086
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah.

1087
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And then now in the present day, I guess recent past when Trump was in power, he wanted to

1088
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,200
colonize space.

1089
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,200
Yeah.

1090
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,200
Yeah.

1091
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,200
Take over Greenland.

1092
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,200
I don't know.

1093
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,540
Man, I heard that shit so much.

1094
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,680
Do those people who call in and they're like, what do we get out of this war?

1095
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,960
Do they not understand how psychopathic that sounds like?

1096
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,920
Hey, what do I look?

1097
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,960
I'm sure it's fine if we go, you know, slaughter a bunch of civilians, my bottom line, what

1098
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,120
my gas prices are going to stay the same.

1099
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Yeah.

1100
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,120
Yeah.

1101
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Fuck you.

1102
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,120
How about that?

1103
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
Gross.

1104
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,120
You fucking psycho.

1105
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,760
Also, I was just sitting here thinking about it and it's like, let's imagine like a president

1106
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,080
that we were supportive of.

1107
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,080
Sure.

1108
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,920
Just coming out being like, I think I'm going to buy Greenland.

1109
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:03,000
Just imagine, even if you agree with all of the other policies, imagine going along like,

1110
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
you know what?

1111
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
This is a good idea.

1112
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I'm telling you.

1113
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I can't imagine it.

1114
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Here's what should have happened.

1115
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,300
Here's what we would have gotten Carter a second term, all right?

1116
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,680
The gas crisis is going on and he's like, hey, you know where there's gas?

1117
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,360
Me neither, but let's buy Greenland.

1118
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,140
I'm going to take big swings, baby.

1119
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,140
It's ours.

1120
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,140
Yeah.

1121
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,360
So Alex has a guest, which is sort of a rarity.

1122
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,200
I think this is only the second guest I've seen so far in 2003 and here he comes.

1123
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,600
We're joined by an expert on the New World Order.

1124
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,680
I've read several of his books and for some reason we haven't hooked up over all these

1125
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,560
years, but it's good to have him on.

1126
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,960
Dennis Lawrence Cuddy, historian and political analyst, took a PhD from the University of

1127
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,720
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, major in American history, minor in political science.

1128
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,720
Dr. Cuddy has taught university level.

1129
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,880
He's been a political and economic risk analyst for international consulting firm.

1130
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,120
There's a few things that really concerned me about this intro that Alex is reading for

1131
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,320
Dennis Cuddy.

1132
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,480
This is the exact wording that you'll find for him on pretty much all other websites,

1133
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,560
but it just doesn't sound right.

1134
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,200
When someone has been employed as an actual professor, their bio probably wouldn't say

1135
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,720
that they've, quote, taught at the university level.

1136
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,000
It would almost always specify the school where they were a professor.

1137
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,440
Professor of blank at the University of blank.

1138
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,920
Honestly, I've given a few lectures at colleges, so I guess I could technically claim that

1139
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,560
I've taught at the university level, but it doesn't mean anything.

1140
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,560
Oh shit, Dan.

1141
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,360
You can get on Info Wars.

1142
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,040
The second issue that I have with his bio is that he specifies a major and a minor in

1143
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,320
terms of his PhD, which is a little bit bizarre.

1144
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,660
Typically that's the language that people use to discuss their undergraduate education.

1145
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45,520
Whereas if you reach the graduate level in a doctoral program, you'd be unlikely to have

1146
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,520
a minor.

1147
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,560
You'd probably discuss your area of emphasis as a way of discussing, you know, your credentials.

1148
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,360
This just seems really, really weird.

1149
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,560
It sounds like what you would describe if you didn't get a PhD.

1150
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,200
Well, I was worried about that because it does seem like that.

1151
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,120
Yeah, or if you purchased one from somewhere outside of the United States, perhaps.

1152
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,520
Well, I was concerned, but I was able to find his dissertation, which was published in a

1153
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:16,400
1978 issue of the Journal of American History titled, quote, American Immigration to Australia

1154
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,560
1945 to the Present.

1155
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,480
So it does appear that he did complete a PhD program, but I'm not sure what this area of

1156
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,400
study has to do with qualifying him to be an expert in the New World Order.

1157
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,300
If you check out his bibliography, it's shockingly all weird books about the New World Order

1158
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,800
and not so many books about Australian immigration.

1159
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,800
That sounds about right.

1160
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,320
Anyway, Dennis Cuddy is still active as a conspiracy weirdo to this day, and it appears

1161
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,800
that he's been pretty pro-Trump, which raises an interesting question about why he's not

1162
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,520
still a figure on Alex's show.

1163
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,160
I thought maybe they didn't hit it off, but they get along pretty well.

1164
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,160
Interesting.

1165
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,160
Yeah, I don't know.

1166
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,440
I don't know what happened, but he's not a name that I recognize from any of the present

1167
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,480
day sections that we've covered.

1168
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,000
Maybe he just got out of the game.

1169
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
No, he's still in the game.

1170
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,120
Maybe he got out of Alex's game.

1171
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,600
Maybe he got out of the heat, yeah.

1172
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,380
Maybe he's just like, Alex is an asshole.

1173
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,840
That's probably the case.

1174
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,720
Anyway, this guy's got an interesting strategy to convince people.

1175
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,840
I know you can't discriminate.

1176
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,480
If you're a university Ph.D. program, you can't discriminate based on religious beliefs

1177
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,840
or ideology, but could you be sneakily like, hey, what if you wanted to go on Infowars?

1178
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,080
Would you go on Infowars?

1179
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,120
And if the answer is yes, they're like, ha, caught you, no Ph.D.

1180
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,720
To be fair, it was 76 when he got his Ph.D. and Infowars did not exist at that point.

1181
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,640
Alex was two years old.

1182
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,680
Look, you can't litigate ex post facto.

1183
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,640
I've heard that from somewhere.

1184
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,840
So look, we want to give you this degree, but there's a two-year-old over in Dallas

1185
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,000
and he's going to do something real weird.

1186
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,760
Look, if the devil has been aware of Alex Jones from the beginning.

1187
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,760
So I don't know.

1188
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,280
Anyway, Dennis has got this interesting trick that he uses because he wants to cut through

1189
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,280
the bullshit.

1190
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Oh boy.

1191
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,240
Like, if people don't agree with him, here's how he cuts through the bullshit.

1192
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,240
This is sneaky.

1193
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Let's hear it.

1194
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,480
How do we stop the New World Order?

1195
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,600
How do we educate the left and the right that they're really just part of a phony system?

1196
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:18,120
Well, the first thing, you have to crack through their predisposition to think you're a nut

1197
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,880
if you talk about conspiracy theories.

1198
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,160
And the best way to do that is, the way I do it is I set them up by saying, suppose

1199
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,640
I told you there was a power somewhere so complete, so pervasive, so interlocked, so

1200
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,280
watchful, you better not speak above your breath if you speak in condemnation of it.

1201
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,760
After they get finished laughing in my face for a while, I say, well, I didn't say that

1202
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,680
one of your heroes, Woodrow Wilson, said that.

1203
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,560
Now you've got the retention.

1204
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,120
First of all, I can't imagine how little I'd care about having a Woodrow Wilson quote

1205
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,120
snuck up on me.

1206
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,960
Oh no, my hero, Woodrow Wilson.

1207
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,920
Yeah, I think I would be like, boo!

1208
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,040
So secondly, and more importantly, what this guy's doing is misusing a quote from Wilson's

1209
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,280
Platform 1913.

1210
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,180
The full quote he's going from is, quote, since I entered politics, I've chiefly had

1211
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,680
men's views confided to me privately.

1212
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,000
Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture,

1213
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,560
are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something.

1214
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,920
They know that there's a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked,

1215
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,800
so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak

1216
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,720
in condemnation of it.

1217
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,040
If you continue reading, it's super clear that what Wilson's talking about isn't a spooky

1218
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:29,480
cabal of globalists, but the completely unregulated nature of industry and how people who have

1219
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,160
already amassed a certain amount of power can use that to stomp out people who are just

1220
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,160
getting started.

1221
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,000
From a little later in the text, quote, and this is the country which has lifted to the

1222
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,580
admiration of the world its ideals of absolutely free opportunity, where no man is supposed

1223
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,720
to be under any limitation except the limitations of his character and his mind, where there's

1224
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,640
supposed to be no distinction of class, no distinction of blood, no distinction of social

1225
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,160
status, but where men win or lose by their merits.

1226
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,700
I lay it very close to my own conscience as a public man, whether we can any longer stand

1227
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:04,120
at our doors and welcome any newcomers upon these terms.

1228
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,040
American industry is not free, as once it was free.

1229
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,640
American enterprise is not free.

1230
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,020
The man with only a little capital is finding it harder to get into the field, more and

1231
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,840
more impossible to compete with the big fellow.

1232
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Why?

1233
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,360
Because the laws of this country did not prevent the strong from crushing the weak.

1234
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,040
Antitrust issues were a really big topic of politics in the 1910s, and that's why it was

1235
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,520
a plank in Wilson's agenda.

1236
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,480
He was clearly in favor of taking power away from monopolies and giving a better chance

1237
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,320
to smaller, up-and-coming businesses, and that's what this passage from his platform

1238
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,500
is all about.

1239
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,160
If you just take a look at the section that Cuddy is reading out of context, it could

1240
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,120
sound like they were saying there was a group of villains running the world or whatever,

1241
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,280
but if you take it within its proper context, you read something very different.

1242
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,080
He's just in favor of regulation.

1243
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
I...

1244
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,540
Oh, boy.

1245
00:54:51,540 --> 00:55:01,440
You know, a guy who says that, who also made the black servants in the White House hide

1246
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,960
it whenever he walked by because he didn't want to see them.

1247
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,960
Not cool.

1248
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,120
Maybe if you say that and do that, like, you gotta go back in time and kill this guy.

1249
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,000
Look, I'm not here to litigate Woodrow Wilson's career.

1250
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,680
I'm taking the text.

1251
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,760
No, no, no, totally.

1252
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,760
I just can't hear it in my head and know that at the same time without losing my mind.

1253
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
I understand it.

1254
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,880
That's why you're here, because that reaction is difficult to have.

1255
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,880
Yeah, it's very difficult.

1256
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,120
But the reason I'm here is to explain why this person is misusing a quote.

1257
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,120
I understand.

1258
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
We're a great team.

1259
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,120
Yes.

1260
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,960
And I don't know if I can accept that he doesn't understand that context.

1261
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,080
I find that difficult to believe.

1262
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,080
The Cuddy.

1263
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,080
Yes.

1264
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,080
Yeah.

1265
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,520
I find it difficult to believe that he would be able to read that quote, read further in

1266
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,720
the text, and not understand what this is about.

1267
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,640
Now, it's possible, and it's also possible that the depth of his research doesn't include

1268
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,040
the other paragraphs after this.

1269
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,040
Sure.

1270
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,920
I've seen this in some other text, in the same way that everybody in the right wing

1271
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,440
has not read Tragedy and Hope, they've only read stuff from like Skousen talking about

1272
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
Tragedy and Hope.

1273
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
Right, right, right, right.

1274
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,640
So it's possible that he has this second hand, this quote, and it sounds really good, and

1275
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,000
it's a way to freak normies out.

1276
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,440
Hey, check this out.

1277
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,000
But I don't know, I find it to be a problem for me to take him seriously.

1278
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,980
Anyway, they're talking, Alex and Cuddy, and one of the things I like is he's Dr. Cuddy,

1279
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,200
and that's Lisa Edelstein's character on House.

1280
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Oh, okay.

1281
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,200
Yeah.

1282
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
All right.

1283
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Mm-hmm.

1284
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Okay.

1285
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
She's great.

1286
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,200
All right.

1287
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,200
Okay.

1288
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,320
So they're talking, and they get to a conversation about Bohemian Grove, and Alex has some more

1289
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,520
details about how unheroic his breaking in was.

1290
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,520
Okay.

1291
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,520
Let me bring this forward.

1292
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,080
Are you aware that I snuck into Bohemian Grove?

1293
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,640
Yes, sir, I've seen the video, very good.

1294
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
Well, I mean, I frankly couldn't believe it.

1295
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,120
I saw the news articles, the British media got me a map in, some of the code words from

1296
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,160
the spies inside, and I frankly believe I was actually allowed to sneak in there now

1297
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,720
that I look at it as part of a larger throw-it-in-our-face move.

1298
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,720
Oh.

1299
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,720
Okay.

1300
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,480
That certainly fits with, you know, like Ronson saying you were just allowed to walk in.

1301
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,480
Yeah.

1302
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,480
Huh.

1303
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,480
The story seems a little more dashing when he tells it now.

1304
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
Yeah.

1305
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,360
It's a little more humble back at this point.

1306
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,360
Interesting.

1307
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
Yep.

1308
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,080
Let me bring this mic down for this clip, because this pissed me off.

1309
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,600
So Alex is talking about Bohemian Grove, and he wants to bring up the satanic element of

1310
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,600
this.

1311
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,600
Sure.

1312
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Right?

1313
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,280
You want to talk about their Satanists, and I'm like, hey, this is one of the big things

1314
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,840
I'm interested in 2003.

1315
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Are you fighting the devil?

1316
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,840
Of course.

1317
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
We got to know.

1318
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,920
This pissed me off.

1319
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:50,960
How does the satanic element behind all this operate, you know, talk about the Illuminati,

1320
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,960
the history of this.

1321
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,960
Who are we really dealing with?

1322
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,840
Well, first, did you see any people running around naked there?

1323
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,000
It goes on for 15 days.

1324
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,800
I was there at the kickoff.

1325
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,880
David Gergen in the Washington Times said that they do indeed do that.

1326
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
Yeah.

1327
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,080
Spy Magazine admits that they ship in the male prostitutes.

1328
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,360
I didn't see that.

1329
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,040
I saw some weird behavior.

1330
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,460
I didn't show any, you know, I'm not going to go up and show old men and bank chairman

1331
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,460
with their.

1332
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,460
Well, I'm not going to.

1333
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,660
I saw some things.

1334
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:25,800
I saw mainly a strange urination ritual where two men walk up, pull their pants partially

1335
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,840
down and and then start urinating in front of each other.

1336
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,320
I didn't put that in the video.

1337
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,160
I'm guessing they were just drunk and they like peed on a bush.

1338
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,960
Yeah, that sounds more weird urination ritual.

1339
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,880
Ah, interesting.

1340
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,480
You know, I've come out of many a Cubs game before and thought, I got to get this weird

1341
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,880
urination ritual done real quick.

1342
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,760
Yeah, I've been to bonfire parties.

1343
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,880
They were just full of weird urination rituals.

1344
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:55,000
Hey guys, real quick, I'm going to take a walk over here and do my urination ritual

1345
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
real quick.

1346
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah, that's weird.

1347
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,440
But the thing that, the reason I'm pissed off by this is they don't get back to the

1348
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,440
initial question.

1349
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,080
Hey, they just get sidetracked by talking about peeing.

1350
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,680
It's like, God damn it.

1351
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,720
I wanted to know about the satanic element.

1352
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,380
That's why I'm, that's why I'm listening.

1353
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:13,140
It doesn't seem like it's that big of a deal if you're just going to get distracted with

1354
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,140
urination rituals.

1355
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,720
It's certainly not important enough to come back to immediately.

1356
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:24,080
So, um, this guy, Cuddy, um, prediction, uh, guy, he's a guy who knows things, he's read

1357
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,600
these documents and uh, boy, this, this, this, uh, take did not age well.

1358
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:35,720
The uh, the current situation with Iraq, what I tried to do there was say, uh, okay, if

1359
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,880
this power lead is in control of things and if there is a war, uh, military conflict in

1360
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,880
Iraq, what will happen?

1361
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,880
And I said, there's two possibilities.

1362
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:50,640
I said, if it's a staged war, it'll be over relatively soon, uh, with relatively few casualties,

1363
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,640
even from chemical or biological weapons.

1364
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,760
And that's basically what happened.

1365
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,080
So it's a staged war because it's over quick.

1366
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,760
You know, that's really comforting to know because I was worried that it was going to

1367
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,720
blow up into a thing that destabilizes the entire world.

1368
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,720
Yeah.

1369
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,720
This is bad thinking.

1370
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,640
So his other possibility is thinking is what it is.

1371
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,540
His other possibility is that it's a real war and, but everything that's happened would

1372
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,240
have happened differently if it was a real, it's like, this is just terrible.

1373
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,240
Wow.

1374
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,240
Yeah.

1375
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,360
So that didn't like, it doesn't age well.

1376
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:30,480
Those who learn the past about Australian immigration are doomed to repeat the extra

1377
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,480
other past.

1378
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,480
Yup.

1379
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,480
Yeah.

1380
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,760
So, uh, one of Alex's big, uh, reasons to believe that 9-11 was an inside job, uh, is

1381
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,080
that they were running a drill.

1382
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,080
Sure.

1383
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,080
Yeah.

1384
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,080
Yeah.

1385
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
Yeah.

1386
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,080
Drills are very important to inside jobs.

1387
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,080
Yes.

1388
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,080
Man.

1389
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,600
This, this made me laugh really hard because Cuddy accidentally punctures a giant hole

1390
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,040
on that theory by trying to help Alex out.

1391
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,000
No one's asked any of these questions, have they?

1392
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,200
No one's asked why the AP reported that the CIA was doing a drill that morning of flying

1393
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,200
jets in the buildings in New York and DC quote their cover for why NORAD stood down.

1394
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,840
Uh, yeah, and that, uh, the same outfit, uh, had a similar drill the year before and nobody

1395
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,840
picked up on that either, but they had the drill that morning at that very time.

1396
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,640
That pause, that pause is great.

1397
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,240
That pause is staring daggers.

1398
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,640
That is a man who just got sliced to shreds with a glance.

1399
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:39,440
It's so important for the, uh, the theories surrounding the drills that they're not B

1400
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,320
drills regularly or similar drills that have happened in the past.

1401
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,640
And they do it every year and nobody picked up on it, Dan.

1402
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,640
Ugh.

1403
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,320
Oh, so bright and cheery, he's like, I'm so helpful.

1404
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:59,080
I love moments like that because I do think that as much as, you know, there's still a

1405
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:04,520
bunch of dumdums back then, there are people who are less on the same identical script.

1406
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,300
Like when you listen to these present day episodes, it'll be like Alex interviewing

1407
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,160
his fucking lawyers who are doing yes and games with him.

1408
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,440
It's basically just not only that, but Alex, everyone kind of knows to not like puncture

1409
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,460
anything or not to say anything that could be like, well, that's a reason why this doesn't

1410
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,460
make sense.

1411
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:26,240
And in this moment, that guy has just thought, thought that added to the conspiracy and in

1412
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,280
fact it actually blows it two shreds.

1413
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,280
Makes it look bad.

1414
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:35,760
He was like a retriever bringing you the paper after stepping in a pile of shit, walking

1415
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,760
through your door.

1416
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,760
And he's like, I'm so good.

1417
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,640
See, I brought you the paper and you're like, you, oh shit.

1418
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:48,120
So earlier Jordan, we learned that Dennis Miller is a big time socialist, huge socialist.

1419
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:53,260
But now it is time to play the game show that is taking the country by storm.

1420
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:57,760
Who is an ultra commie?

1421
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,760
Every episode.

1422
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,880
I mean, at this point it's almost like Dennis Hastert.

1423
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,880
I don't know.

1424
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
It could be anybody.

1425
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,840
Every episode so far in 2003, I think we've had Alex out somebody.

1426
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,040
There's a new ultra commie.

1427
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
That's true.

1428
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
That's true.

1429
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,040
So who's it going to be this time?

1430
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,040
They're dropping like flies.

1431
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,040
You think it's Hastert?

1432
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
No, I'm going to go with Condoleezza Rice.

1433
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,040
Interesting.

1434
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,160
Uh, you were starting out a little earlier with a, uh, development, a discussion on,

1435
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,160
um, Mr. Crystal.

1436
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,720
I don't know if you quite got to it.

1437
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,120
I'd like to hear the rest of what you were going to tell us about Mr. Crystal.

1438
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,120
Ultra commie.

1439
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,120
Don't tell me.

1440
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,120
Don't tell me.

1441
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,120
It's Billy Crystal.

1442
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,120
Ultra commie.

1443
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,120
All right.

1444
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,760
So yeah, we've got, uh, Michael Savage, Bill Crystal.

1445
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,400
That is what happens.

1446
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,240
That is what happens when you don't find Curly's gold.

1447
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,240
All right.

1448
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,760
You become an ultra commie because it's clear that the ruling class has taken the gold before

1449
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,760
you got there.

1450
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,760
Wrong.

1451
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,120
That's the rule.

1452
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:02,480
So earlier, um, we got distracted by, uh, urination rituals when Alex was about to talk

1453
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,280
about the satanic element.

1454
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,280
Sure.

1455
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,800
This is like a prank on me.

1456
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,600
I swear to God.

1457
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,820
If they can be industrialized as snow factories, people are going to accept being prison guards

1458
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,820
as their job.

1459
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,920
They're going to accept being tattletale squads.

1460
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,480
They're going to accept this.

1461
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:24,600
They say America is going to be a police state enslavement grid that produces propaganda

1462
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
for the world.

1463
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,920
They said that's what America will be.

1464
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:39,520
The armpit of Satan literally, uh, am I on, Oh my God.

1465
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,520
Okay.

1466
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,440
Uh, Alex's mic went off in the middle of him saying Satan literally.

1467
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,720
I know it is, it is a little bit of a tease.

1468
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,640
It's like, this isn't admissible.

1469
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,640
He could have said anything.

1470
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:57,160
He could have said anything, but you're like, he was going to say literally, literally.

1471
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,160
And you know what that means.

1472
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
I can't make this up.

1473
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
I'm going back into the past.

1474
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:09,480
I've been intrigued to see if he thinks that Satan is literal back then.

1475
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:16,800
His mic goes off in the middle of saying the word literal.

1476
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,760
Oh dude, you're a witch.

1477
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,760
It is.

1478
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
You're a witch.

1479
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,880
It's becoming troubling to me.

1480
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,600
The level of these coincidences.

1481
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,600
It is dangerous.

1482
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,600
Yeah.

1483
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,840
But it is also pretty funny that his mic just went off and his guest is like, what?

1484
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,840
What's going on?

1485
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:37,160
The only word that we needed to hear is the one word.

1486
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,400
And I needed him to expound on it more.

1487
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,400
You know?

1488
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,400
And then Mike's off.

1489
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,400
There we go.

1490
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,340
Anyway, this is a catastrophic problem that he's having.

1491
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,720
And economics and your job, and you're willing to have lower wages becomes more important

1492
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,760
to you than the old fashioned patriotism.

1493
01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:02,240
Thank you for joining us.

1494
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,240
Thanks for joining us, Dr. Cutty.

1495
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,760
We'll be right back, folks.

1496
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,760
Thank you.

1497
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,760
Stay with us.

1498
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,760
Who boy.

1499
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,760
Oh man.

1500
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,760
Oh man.

1501
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:16,760
Something's bad.

1502
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,760
Yeah, that's not good.

1503
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,760
Yeah.

1504
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,760
It is.

1505
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,440
I mean, this does screw up my conspiracy theory to know that this kind of thing happens every

1506
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,440
year.

1507
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,240
That does, it does bother.

1508
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,960
It makes me worry.

1509
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,960
I don't know.

1510
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,960
I can't imagine.

1511
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,040
I just have to assume that it's like, well, it's 2003, he had bad tech back then.

1512
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,040
Yeah.

1513
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,440
But he kind of understands that he has bad tech back then.

1514
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,440
Yeah.

1515
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,440
He doesn't expect anything else.

1516
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,440
Sure.

1517
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,360
So like one of the things that I think is pretty cool about 2003 is like, that's a big

1518
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,360
problem.

1519
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,360
Yeah.

1520
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:52,480
You're on the radio, your mics just go completely out, your guest is left to try and tread water

1521
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,960
on his own, and then you got to go out to break.

1522
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,960
Yeah.

1523
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,920
And Alex deals with it gracefully.

1524
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:04,360
I'm down here in Austin, Texas, and we're hooked up with the folks at Genesis, and rarely

1525
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,600
does my little stereo line cut out to them right there at the end.

1526
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:13,160
It was cutting basically bring us out of break and I barely got back on in time to take us

1527
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,680
out of that little segment there, but good job getting me hooked back up.

1528
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:21,200
A lot of weird electronic stuff on my end.

1529
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,000
We got a lot of callers and I want to go to your calls.

1530
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,320
There's no like the globalists are trying to take us off air because we're too dangerous.

1531
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,160
There's no freaking out and leaving.

1532
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,160
He's laughing.

1533
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,160
You know, it's like, I got a tech problem.

1534
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,160
Yeah.

1535
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,760
I'm not a normal person responding to difficulties that would be expected.

1536
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,880
That's true.

1537
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,880
That is true.

1538
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:47,360
Now, admittedly, I will say that there is, that would give me certain justification for

1539
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:55,720
a larger reaction if, uh, say I'm having the same problems after spending $60 billion on

1540
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,720
a studio.

1541
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,040
You know, like if you're still having those problems, you should be angrier than if you

1542
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,680
have shitty tech.

1543
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,680
Yeah.

1544
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:09,600
No, I mean, it does make sense because then you really can't blame it at all on the tech.

1545
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,120
No, but it is on you.

1546
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,520
It is definitely on you because you have not solved the problem for sure.

1547
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,760
That outbursts that we see in the present day.

1548
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,760
It still is.

1549
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:22,000
It should be directed inwards as opposed to screaming at the staff and the, uh, the, uh,

1550
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
the audience.

1551
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Yes, definitely.

1552
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,860
I just like, I just prefer to see this like, cause it's, it's not like a child lashing

1553
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,160
out, uh, uh, constantly.

1554
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,760
It's like, you have a huge problem that happens on your show and you're able to laugh and

1555
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,760
come back from break.

1556
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,760
Sure.

1557
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,640
Like, ah, good on him being able to take us out to break and handle it, you know, Hey,

1558
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,840
you know, sometimes Genesis feed goes down.

1559
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,840
What are you going to do?

1560
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,840
Sure.

1561
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,840
Let's go to the call.

1562
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,840
Sure.

1563
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,840
Yeah.

1564
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,720
I mean, everybody likes the VH1 part of behind the music where there are the, they're on

1565
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:57,160
their meteoric rise, but they're just beginning and they're playing their show at the dumb

1566
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:01,240
bar down the street and little did everybody know what he was going to do.

1567
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,640
So, uh, yeah, this is fun to see.

1568
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:09,960
So Alex gets to talk in a more about, uh, the democratization in Iraq and the government

1569
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
that is coming in.

1570
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,840
It's going to be a good one.

1571
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:18,920
Well, we know from history that, uh, again, very shortly after this episode, uh, de-bathification

1572
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,920
happened.

1573
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,920
It was a good idea.

1574
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:28,080
Iraq, US reconstructing bath units, the most vicious bath CIA torturers, those trained

1575
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,520
in the U S all of Saddam's top henchmen, except for a few titular head, uh, go sacrificial

1576
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,560
lambs, uh, are going to be put back in control.

1577
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,080
So wrong.

1578
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,080
He's wrong.

1579
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,080
Wrong about that.

1580
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,080
Oh boy.

1581
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,080
Quite wrong.

1582
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,080
Yeah.

1583
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,960
So, um, it's, it's just interesting that he's, he's consistently going down this road and

1584
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,480
it does set up an like a weird, I don't know what's going to happen as you know, like May

1585
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,480
comes to an end.

1586
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,480
May continues.

1587
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,480
Like, how's he going to navigate that territory?

1588
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:05,880
It is ironic even that it is almost his exact opinion of the bath that was echoed in American

1589
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:12,680
policy while he's criticizing them in the idea that they would do the opposite of what

1590
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,680
they believe.

1591
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,680
Yeah.

1592
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,680
Yeah.

1593
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:20,680
It is strange because the way he's presenting things, he doesn't really have a good leg

1594
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,440
to stand on to be opposed to de-bathification.

1595
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,440
Right.

1596
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:25,440
Right.

1597
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,440
Right.

1598
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,600
Once it comes along.

1599
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,600
Exactly.

1600
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,320
And I don't think he'll be willing to be strongly in favor.

1601
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,800
Certainly as things go along, I don't think he'll, he'll own the consequences.

1602
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,560
It didn't, it didn't go well.

1603
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,560
No.

1604
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,560
Yeah.

1605
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,460
So, uh, I would say that listening to this episode, there is very little, um, in terms

1606
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,460
of news stories.

1607
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,460
Sure.

1608
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:52,360
There is a little bit of like a couple of headlines thrown out here and there.

1609
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,960
He talks a lot about Richard Pearl, who he calls the Prince of Darkness.

1610
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,960
Sure.

1611
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,280
I think there's, he's obsessed with that dude because I've heard him talk about that dude

1612
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,520
in the present day.

1613
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,520
Really?

1614
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,520
Yes.

1615
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,520
Constantly.

1616
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,520
20 years.

1617
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,600
When he gets drunk on like a Rogan's show and stuff, he'll talk about Richard Pearl,

1618
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,600
the Prince of Darkness.

1619
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,240
He would go around, he'd go around at parties and tell women that like he kills people because

1620
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,360
he thinks it's hot.

1621
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,680
He thinks that that'll get him aroused and stuff.

1622
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
Okay.

1623
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,480
He won't be like, he brings up this dude a lot.

1624
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,480
All right.

1625
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,160
Anyway, it's, there's not a whole lot.

1626
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,920
I do like a lifelong grudge.

1627
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,920
That's admirable.

1628
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,920
Yeah.

1629
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
There's something almost noble about that.

1630
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,560
Do you think 15 years from now he's not going to be yelling about Stelter?

1631
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,560
Yeah.

1632
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,560
That's true.

1633
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:38,200
So, uh, Alex gets to the end of the show and he realizes, man, I didn't, I missed some

1634
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
stuff.

1635
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,320
Oh, there was so much news we didn't get to.

1636
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,800
More and more cities are passing pro bill of rights resolutions.

1637
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,400
A lot of conservative cities are doing it.

1638
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,000
I've got one on info wars.com.

1639
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,600
You ought to get to your city council or county commissioners and the man they pass it.

1640
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,640
So important to reaffirm the bill of rights.

1641
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,640
They can claim.

1642
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,640
We don't have any rights.

1643
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,640
They're still God given.

1644
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:06,920
We still have them in the Anton LaVey, Christian conservative, Neo con, the commie cons will

1645
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:12,800
be resisted, will be exposed with their little liberal buddies, totally staged.

1646
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,120
The people are waking up, millions of beginning to fight.

1647
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,680
You cannot stop us all.

1648
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,920
So have no fear.

1649
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,160
We shall prevail.

1650
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,800
Good God that was uninspired.

1651
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,800
Oh boy.

1652
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,800
That was boring.

1653
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,800
We shall prevail.

1654
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,800
Let's go on guys.

1655
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:32,680
This is before he started doing his Churchill impression.

1656
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,400
Hey, now we shall fight them on the sheet.

1657
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,080
We're going to, okay guys, we got to get up.

1658
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,080
Yeah.

1659
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,040
So Alex, Alex comes to the end of the show and realizes that he didn't cover most of

1660
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:48,060
the news as opposed to it happening an hour before the show ends.

1661
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,960
And then still no more news is covered.

1662
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:55,560
Um, but yeah, he has, he's got a minute and what he wants to really hit on is there are

1663
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:00,120
people reaffirming the bill of rights, which is very meaningful and important.

1664
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:05,520
It's not, this is just the same thing as in 2009, all the 10th amendment resolutions and

1665
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
stuff.

1666
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
It's like, yes.

1667
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,520
Okay.

1668
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,760
We have to have the state houses pass these things that say the same thing as the constitution.

1669
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:17,480
Like, I don't know, man, it's, it's.

1670
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:23,880
What, to what extent do they describe God given rights?

1671
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:31,920
You know, like, give me a biblical explanation of what rights God specifically gives us.

1672
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,960
Because I don't recall him writing the goddamn bill of rights.

1673
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:40,360
I don't know if it's derived directly from anything in the Bible, but this is, this is

1674
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,320
a pretty standard element of anti-communism.

1675
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,560
No, of course.

1676
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:52,440
They have this idea that communism seeks to outlaw religion and get rid of religion and

1677
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:59,520
in doing so you get rid of God and if you get rid of God, then there's no more justification

1678
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,280
for why people have rights because they're endowed by the creator.

1679
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,480
So therefore now you have no rights.

1680
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,480
Sure.

1681
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:12,280
Communism gets rid of God, which gets rid of rights, which makes you all slaves.

1682
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,720
That's where the important hinge is for the God given rights aspect.

1683
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,720
Right.

1684
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,720
No, no, I understand.

1685
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,440
I just, I just feel like if you want to win in the marketplace of ideas, you should kind

1686
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,760
of write down what rights you're peddling.

1687
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,760
Well, they did.

1688
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,440
And we'll compare them to the other thing.

1689
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,440
They did.

1690
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,160
It's in the Declaration of Independence, Constitution.

1691
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,560
It's those rights.

1692
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,440
Those aren't rights that are given by the Constitution, those are God given rights that

1693
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,040
are protected by the Constitution.

1694
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,000
Oh, oh, so it's even dumber than I thought it was.

1695
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Sort of.

1696
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Right.

1697
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,520
It's the same kind of, I don't know, it's an argument that you can run into a lot.

1698
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:51,920
It's the notion of like, does all morality stem from religion?

1699
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,920
Sure.

1700
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,920
Sure.

1701
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,920
Is ethics possible outside?

1702
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,920
Naturally.

1703
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,920
And I would argue that it is.

1704
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,920
Well, yeah, obviously.

1705
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,920
We have several thousand years.

1706
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,120
But there are those who think that no, morality and ethics are impossible outside of a religious

1707
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,120
framework.

1708
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,120
Right.

1709
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:10,120
And I don't know, I don't buy into that, but that seems to be kind of a kernel at the base

1710
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:14,120
of their idea, like Alex and a lot of his associates' conception of rights.

1711
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:18,360
No, I just didn't, I didn't quite understand what they were talking about.

1712
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:23,440
Because generally speaking, whenever people start talking about God, I appreciate it if

1713
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,920
they have some sort of biblical basis for it.

1714
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
It's just guns.

1715
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,800
Yeah, it does sound like it's just guns.

1716
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,100
Man, people love their guns.

1717
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,960
It was the 11th commandment.

1718
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:39,200
It's just, there's just, man, guns aren't, oh.

1719
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,440
The 11th commandment was, guns, baby!

1720
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,680
Guns, guns, guns, baby!

1721
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,680
Yep.

1722
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:52,720
And Jesus said to, at the last, one of you will betray me before the cock, with a fucking

1723
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,720
shotgun!

1724
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:59,240
So, we come to the end of this exploration of back in 18 years ago today.

1725
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,000
18 years ago today.

1726
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,360
What an interesting glimpse.

1727
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,100
This very night, 18 years ago.

1728
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,740
Such wrong ideas about what was gonna happen.

1729
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,800
Such misguided nonsense.

1730
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,020
Not good.

1731
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,860
A weirdo presented as an expert.

1732
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,860
That's pretty normal.

1733
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,860
Yeah, that's fair.

1734
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,920
And more evidence that Alex should sue Joe Rogan for using the word powerful.

1735
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,920
I think it's trademarked.

1736
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,320
Yeah, I don't know.

1737
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,200
I mean, I think you could get a, it'd be tough, though, to win a lawsuit whenever you've got

1738
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,260
that, oh, Alex just said, we're gonna play that clip of Alex saying he's gonna gut him

1739
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,360
like a pig, you know, like, how are you gonna win that kind of lawsuit?

1740
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Free speech, man.

1741
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,360
Ah, that's fair.

1742
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:45,760
I'm infuriated by the, going to urination talk and the mic's cutting out right around

1743
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,080
when Satan was coming up.

1744
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,800
It's gonna be the armpit of Satan.

1745
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,760
I take that personally, a little bit.

1746
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,760
It's very funny.

1747
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,800
But I'm excited to see if the next couple episodes have anything that'll help clarify

1748
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
positions.

1749
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,920
It'd be more funny if somebody actually cut off the mic whenever he was about to say,

1750
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,280
literally like, we can't have that out there, boom, red button.

1751
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,600
Fred Anderson dives on that.

1752
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,200
Red button, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1753
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,800
He's up in Minnesota listening to The Feed's comic.

1754
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,000
I've never seen anybody move that fast.

1755
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah.

1756
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
We'll find out more in the future, but until next time, Jordan, we have a website.

1757
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
We do have a website.

1758
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It's knowledgefight.com.

1759
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,600
Yes, we are also on Twitter.

1760
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,600
We are on Twitter.

1761
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
It's at knowledgefight.com.

1762
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,600
I go to bed.

1763
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,600
Jordan.

1764
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,600
We're also on Facebook.

1765
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,600
We are Facebook.

1766
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,320
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1767
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,320
doing God's work.

1768
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,320
Yep, we'll be back.

1769
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,240
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark.

1770
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,600
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1771
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,120
And now, here comes the sex robots.

1772
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,440
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

1773
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,440
Thanks for holding.

1774
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,440
Hello, Alex.

1775
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,440
I'm a first-time caller.

1776
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,440
I'm a huge fan.

1777
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,440
I love your work.

1778
01:17:45,440 --> 01:18:12,400
I love you.
