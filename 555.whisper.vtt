N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:18.320
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Knowledgefight.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Knowledgefight.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Riddle her.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Riddle her.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Riddle her.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
I need money.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Riddle her.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Riddle her.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Riddle her.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Stop it.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Andy and Kansas.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
It's time to pray.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Thanks for holding us.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Hello, Alex.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm a first-time caller.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm a huge fan.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I love your work.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Knowledgefight.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
N-N-N-N-Knowledgefight.com.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
I love you.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I love you.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I love you.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I love you.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I love you.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I love you.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I love you.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I love you.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I love you.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hey, everybody.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.640
Welcome back to Knowledgefight, a little show where my friend and I like to get together,

01:04.640 --> 01:08.200
drink novelty beverages, worship at the altar of Selene.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Yes.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.040
We're still getting the smooth intro.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.640
That one's gonna take a little while to kind of integrate in.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.920
We worship at the altar of Selene and talk about Alex Jones.

01:16.920 --> 01:17.920
Yes.

01:17.920 --> 01:18.920
How are you?

01:18.920 --> 01:19.920
Jordan.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.920
Dan.

01:20.920 --> 01:21.920
Nice to meet you.

01:21.920 --> 01:22.920
It's a pleasure.

01:22.920 --> 01:23.920
It's a pleasure.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.440
It's wonderful to meet you, Dan.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.440
Ah, boy.

01:26.440 --> 01:32.920
Now, since we've officially introduced ourselves, I have a quick question.

01:32.920 --> 01:33.920
What's your bright spot today, Dan?

01:33.920 --> 01:34.920
Why don't you go first?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.960
Because I have a hunch what yours might be.

01:36.960 --> 01:44.280
Oh, well, mine is obviously the release of my super-secret project.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.200
Policy Wonk John sent us a-

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
You believe it's John.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.960
Wait, well, I know it's John, probably.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.080
The handwriting might be an issue.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.080
The handwriting leads us to believe it's John.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.680
I think it'll be easier just to say, if you are someone with bad handwriting who sent

02:00.680 --> 02:04.160
us Pathfinder rule books, this one goes out to you, buddy.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.920
Pathfinder rule books and all sorts of other figurine things.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.920
So cool.

02:09.920 --> 02:15.880
Not like a Warhammer figurine, but like a book of standee things you can play with.

02:15.880 --> 02:16.880
Yeah, yeah.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.040
Pre-written campaigns, all this really cool stuff.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
And Space Finder, too.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.040
Yes, yeah, yeah.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
The outer space version.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.560
We'll have to figure that one out eventually.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.560
Yeah.

02:25.560 --> 02:31.400
But when that package came in, just to give a little behind the scenes intel, I got overwhelmed

02:31.400 --> 02:35.800
by the number of books and I said, Jordan, this is on you.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.800
This is, yes.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.800
I believe you-

02:37.800 --> 02:38.800
You need to read these.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.960
Your words were somewhere along the lines of, you need to finally do some work.

02:42.960 --> 02:43.960
Yes.

02:43.960 --> 02:44.960
This is your job now.

02:44.960 --> 02:45.960
Figure out what to do with this.

02:45.960 --> 02:46.960
Yes.

02:46.960 --> 02:47.960
Get a job.

02:47.960 --> 02:48.960
Essentially.

02:48.960 --> 02:49.960
Yeah.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.920
I couldn't handle the idea of even cracking one of those books and then getting lost in

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
it.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
Yeah.

02:54.920 --> 02:55.920
No one needs that.

02:55.920 --> 02:56.920
Oh, yeah.

02:56.920 --> 02:57.920
Yeah.

02:57.920 --> 02:58.920
I read them.

02:58.920 --> 02:59.920
It was very hard to do.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.560
So we decided to do as close to a Pathfinder campaign as possible.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.960
As inspired by this.

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
Yes.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.000
So we've got you, Dan.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.360
We've got our brilliant friends, Marty and Sarah from Marty and Sarah Love Wrestling.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.360
Yeah.

03:15.360 --> 03:20.520
And then we have the lovely and talented Liz Anderson, who is absolutely fantastic.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.080
And we are all playing a campaign that I wrote.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
Yeah.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
And we're all just...

03:26.080 --> 03:28.760
I mean, we're not really playing the goon so much with the...

03:28.760 --> 03:29.760
We're playing your game.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.760
Yeah, exactly.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.440
Yeah, and the first episode of it is on our Patreon right now.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.440
Yes.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.440
Yeah.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.440
But it's not like behind a paywall or anything.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
It's just posted there.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.800
Just a reminder, everything on our Patreon is not behind a paywall.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.440
And if you enjoy that, you should check out Marty and Sarah and Liz Anderson's projects

03:44.440 --> 03:45.440
and support them.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
Yes, absolutely.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
Yep.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.600
But I don't know how to embed things places.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.600
I don't know.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
Yeah, if you...

03:51.600 --> 03:52.600
So it's there.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.040
If you know, embed it, we won't bother you.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.640
So actually, this kind of dovetails into my bright spot.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
Yes!

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
First of all, I mean, semi-bright spot.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.800
I really did enjoy doing that.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.840
I know.

04:02.840 --> 04:03.840
It's great.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.640
It's certainly outside of the realm of what I normally am comfortable with in terms of,

04:07.640 --> 04:09.960
I don't know, playing characters or whatever.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.520
But everyone's character is so fun and silly.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.940
It's great to get together a bunch of middle-aged people who have never played any kind of role-playing

04:17.940 --> 04:24.040
game before, and we're all stand-ups and improvisers and podcasters, so it's basically just a

04:24.040 --> 04:25.040
free-for-all.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.040
Yeah.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.040
And I'm excited to see where it goes.

04:27.040 --> 04:32.480
But also, in relation to these Pathfinder books and everything that came in, I realized

04:32.480 --> 04:35.160
that we need to catch up a little bit on Z...

04:35.160 --> 04:36.160
Ooh, the mailbag!

04:36.160 --> 04:37.160
...some of the mailbag.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.160
Yeah.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.960
Because we were going to do some more bonus episodes we haven't really been able to, and

04:41.960 --> 04:44.000
then now this secret project has been unveiled.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.260
And then it begins.

04:45.260 --> 04:46.260
That's kind of...

04:46.260 --> 04:47.260
Yeah.

04:47.260 --> 04:50.600
We have the D&D kind of thing where we also zip the mailbag.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.040
Yeah, that's not gonna happen!

04:52.040 --> 04:53.040
That's weird.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.040
We're not gonna make a...

04:54.040 --> 04:57.720
My character is running away from a bar at the same time.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.720
Oh, what's this?

04:58.720 --> 05:05.380
We're not gonna make Thomas the devilish Catholic come after anybody.

05:05.380 --> 05:09.880
So Jordan, one thing, we missed this one a little ways back, but I wanted to say thank

05:09.880 --> 05:14.920
you to Matt, who sent in that little poster of Chicago venues that we have.

05:14.920 --> 05:15.920
Oh yeah!

05:15.920 --> 05:16.920
Yeah, that's so cool.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.640
Yeah, that was a really awesome little art piece, and we've missed that when we were

05:21.640 --> 05:22.640
at ZFN in the past.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.640
Oh man, that's super cool.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.120
Yeah, and so thank you to Matt.

05:26.120 --> 05:32.360
Another person here, Sarah M., very excited about this thing that came in a little while

05:32.360 --> 05:33.360
back.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.840
It was some honeys that they were...

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
They're like...

05:37.840 --> 05:38.840
Metal honey is the name of the company.

05:38.840 --> 05:39.840
Yes!

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:40.840 --> 05:41.840
It's spicy honey and like a really...

05:41.840 --> 05:43.880
Like a flowery elixir one.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
They were fantastic.

05:44.880 --> 05:50.200
And so I wanted to say thank you to Sarah for those, and also the hot sauce of the month

05:50.200 --> 05:51.800
has continued to roll in.

05:51.800 --> 05:56.800
Absolutely delightful, or have we had a kind of dud yet?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.240
I don't think we've had a dud.

05:58.240 --> 06:03.760
Some have not been as good as others, but I gotta say, this one, the Marie Sharps, the

06:03.760 --> 06:09.960
habanero one from Belize that came in, that has been pretty...

06:09.960 --> 06:14.160
Those ones are pretty in my wheelhouse in terms of like an everyday sauce.

06:14.160 --> 06:18.040
Those have been pretty heavy in the rotation.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.640
I feel like there was actually one in the hot sauce of the month that was kind of disappointing,

06:21.640 --> 06:23.320
but I don't remember what it was.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.280
There was one called Illuminati, like naughty, like bad.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.560
Naughty, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.180
I don't think I liked that one much.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.360
Maybe it was just bitter about the pun though.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.360
That does sound like...

06:33.360 --> 06:38.800
I mean, unless you were in the Illuminati, unless you were like Jay-Z or Beyonce, I

06:38.800 --> 06:40.760
don't think it should be that offensive to you.

06:40.760 --> 06:47.000
No, but I also should say this came with some Mexican candies, the honeys, which is a cool

06:47.000 --> 06:50.440
thing that apparently is a signature of the Metal Honey brand.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
Nice.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.440
Send some candies along.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.440
I like it.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.280
Which, of course, I certainly need more candies.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.880
Repeat customers, that's what they're going for.

06:57.880 --> 07:03.000
Yeah, so I appreciate that, and also I'm way overdue checking the mailbox, so there will

07:03.000 --> 07:05.640
probably be some more coming up in the near future.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.280
So Jordan, today we got an episode.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.280
Do we?

07:09.280 --> 07:10.280
Yeah, we do.

07:10.280 --> 07:15.580
I think it was difficult to decide what to do, and I want to walk you through my thinking.

07:15.580 --> 07:20.400
So the first thing I thought of was, I don't care about Alex's take on Bill Gates getting

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
a divorce.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.240
I don't care about anything to do with Bill Gates getting a divorce.

07:24.240 --> 07:28.000
I think it might be interesting to see him try and weave that into somehow it's part

07:28.000 --> 07:29.940
of the globalist's plan.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.840
I don't know, I don't care.

07:31.840 --> 07:37.640
I think it's also a little bit like, I don't know, no matter what, it'll be disappointing.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.640
I don't care for it much.

07:38.640 --> 07:45.200
And I also started to realize that our show right now is becoming too much just Alex being

07:45.200 --> 07:47.760
a goddamn anti-vaxxer.

07:47.760 --> 07:55.420
It's so one note to a certain extent that I just, I get just burdened by it.

07:55.420 --> 08:01.040
At the same time, we've been looking at 2003, and I had a realization.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.200
You know where we are in 2003?

08:03.200 --> 08:04.200
May?

08:04.200 --> 08:08.200
Yeah, May 7th, which is the day this episode comes out.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.640
This is a rare opportunity.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.440
If we go back to 2003 today, we can cover something 18 years ago to the day.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.440
Okay.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.440
Well, now we have to.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.440
I felt like I had to.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.440
There's nothing we can do but that.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.440
Yeah.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.920
So today we're going over May 7th, 2003.

08:21.920 --> 08:22.920
I'm Dan.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.400
This is 2003.

08:25.400 --> 08:30.560
Welcome to the wonderful world of 2003.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.040
The music was revolutionary.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.040
Shit was happening.

08:34.040 --> 08:37.000
People were having meaningful conversations on the street.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.080
2003, just a heavy time in America.

08:40.080 --> 08:44.600
Was 2003 Stankonia or The Love Below?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.800
I want to say that was around then.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.520
I want to say that was around then.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.520
But I could be wrong.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.520
Yeah.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.640
I measured time by OutKast albums, in case you were wondering.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.440
I think it might have been A Quemini.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.440
No.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.440
Okay.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.960
When was Bombs Over Baghdad?

08:59.960 --> 09:01.280
What album was that on?

09:01.280 --> 09:04.560
That was, or that was...

09:04.560 --> 09:05.560
What album was that?

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
I'm going to sleep.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
I'm going to sleep.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
Oh no.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
No.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.560
Bombs Over Baghdad, that was Stankonia.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.560
Okay.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.560
Well then that was probably around 2003.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.560
Yeah.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.560
It was around 2003.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.560
I would assume.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.560
I'm more of a...

09:16.560 --> 09:20.400
The time in my life that I would consider the salad days are the Southern Playlist of

09:20.400 --> 09:22.600
Cadillac music days.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
That's really where I live.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
Yeah.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
Fair enough.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.600
And Italians.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.600
Fair enough.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
Yeah.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
Anyway.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.600
Yes.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.600
Jordan, let's list some more OutKast albums.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
Okay.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.480
Before we get down to business on our trip to the past, let's take a little moment, Jordan,

09:34.480 --> 09:36.920
to say what up to some new wonks.

09:36.920 --> 09:37.920
Ooh.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.720
So first, Rick and Hannah, this is for you.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.120
You're now a policy wonk.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.480
I'm a policy wonk.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.480
Thank you, Rick and Hannah.

09:43.480 --> 09:44.480
This is for you.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.480
Thank you.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.480
Next, The Goddamn Pac-Man.

09:46.480 --> 09:50.240
Also included in this is a shout out to you, Jordan, because of baseball season, and The

09:50.240 --> 09:53.340
Goddamn Pac-Man wanted me to let you know, go Padres.

09:53.340 --> 09:54.440
You're now a policy wonk.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.720
I'm a policy wonk.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.880
Thank you very much, Goddamn Pac-Man.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.080
Do you have any animosity towards the Padres?

10:00.080 --> 10:01.080
No.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.400
The Padres are fantastic.

10:02.400 --> 10:06.880
Fernando Tatis is one of the most exciting, probably maybe the best player, and they stole

10:06.880 --> 10:11.280
you Darv- Well, when I say stole you Darvish from the Cubs, what I mean more is the Ricketts

10:11.280 --> 10:16.560
family threw you Darvish into the ocean and was like, San Diego, you can have him for

10:16.560 --> 10:17.560
peanuts, Dan.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
Peanuts!

10:18.560 --> 10:19.560
All right.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.560
Sorry.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.200
Next, I'm Laura Taylor, and I'm definitely a witch.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.520
You are now a policy wonk.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.520
I'm a policy wonk.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.520
Thanks, Laura.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.120
Next, Mike The Parrot Head.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.120
Thank you so much.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
You are now a policy wonk.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.120
I'm a policy wonk.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
Thank you, Mike.

10:31.120 --> 10:37.440
I did this shout out mostly because Mike has a secret agenda, and that is to see what kind

10:37.440 --> 10:42.880
of overlap there is between our podcast fans and Jimmy Buffett fans, and I'd rather not

10:42.880 --> 10:43.880
know.

10:43.880 --> 10:44.880
We'll never know.

10:44.880 --> 10:45.880
I hope not to.

10:45.880 --> 10:46.880
Nope.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.880
Next, Danny in Mexico.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.880
Thank you so much.

10:48.880 --> 10:49.880
You are now a policy wonk.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.880
I'm a policy wonk.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
Thanks, Danny.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
Thank you.

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
Next, let's get some technocrats.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.880
Okay.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.880
All right.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.880
First, we got William P. Thank you so much.

10:56.880 --> 10:57.880
You are now a technocrat.

10:57.880 --> 11:02.520
Also, The Baby Blaze, let's spell B-L-A-I-S-E.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.520
Okay.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.520
The Baby Blaze.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.520
The Baby Blaze.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
Who is a punk.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.520
You are now a technocrat.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.520
I'm a policy wonk.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.520
Crikey, mate.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.520
That's fantastic.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.520
Have yourself a brew.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.520
How's your 401k doing, bro?

11:12.520 --> 11:13.520
All right.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.520
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

11:15.520 --> 11:17.000
Let's just get down to business.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.080
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.000
Why you pimps so good?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.640
My neck is freakishly large.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.400
I declare info war on you.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.640
Thank you, William, and thank you to The Baby Blaze.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.640
Yes.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.640
Thank you very much.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.640
I don't know why I've lost my mind.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.640
I just had to double check it.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.640
Yeah.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.840
Of course it's not on Stankonia.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.160
It's on Bob.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.360
It's on Bob's Over Bed.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.360
That's the name of the album?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
Yes.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.360
Of course it is.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.360
What am I?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.360
Stupid?

11:42.360 --> 11:43.360
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.360
Yep.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.360
Okay.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.360
Clearly.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.360
Yeah.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
So, Jordan, we start here at the beginning of the day, the show, as Alex does.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.360
He starts at the beginning.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
Of course.

11:50.360 --> 11:55.900
And I have got this thesis that I'm working on that continues to seem more and more accurate,

11:55.900 --> 12:00.960
and that is that Joe Rogan stole the word powerful from Alex.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.960
Another powerful broadcast lined up for you.

12:03.960 --> 12:09.840
It is the 7th of May, 2003.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.360
I'm Alex Jones.

12:11.360 --> 12:15.040
If you were born on the day that this episode was recorded, you can vote.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.360
Yes, of course you can.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.740
Of course you can.

12:17.740 --> 12:18.740
That's powerful.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.080
That is powerful.

12:20.080 --> 12:25.000
I've never done a, what's 18th anniversary?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
What would that be?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
An eel?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Oh, I don't know.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
You speak Greek.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
What do you mean?

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Well, I mean, if it's a millennium is a thousand, that's kind of Greek.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't know if there's a word for an 18 eel.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Why not?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Wow, these Greek.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.200
These Greek people without their 18s.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.320
I thought you meant like, you know how like it's a paper anniversary or like a gold?

12:45.320 --> 12:46.320
Oh, sure, sure.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.320
What's the 18th?

12:47.320 --> 12:48.320
Well, what's that one?

12:48.320 --> 12:49.320
Ink?

12:49.320 --> 12:50.320
I don't know.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.320
Papyrus, actually.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.600
There's some weird ones in that list.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.600
Papyrus spatula year.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.800
I mean, I could look, I could check.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
I don't care.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
I don't think it's important.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
No, we don't have the time to waste.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.540
More importantly, Alex has undoubtedly got a claim.

13:05.540 --> 13:10.240
He could take Joe Rogan to small claims court for stealing the intro of his show being,

13:10.240 --> 13:11.880
this is a powerful transmission.

13:11.880 --> 13:16.120
You know, I think they've gotten a lot from each other out of this situation.

13:16.120 --> 13:22.440
I don't think Alex can be mad at Joe for what he's contributed in response for getting powerful.

13:22.440 --> 13:27.440
But what I would like to say is that this furthers Alex's argument that I hate to say

13:27.440 --> 13:29.880
I kind of agree with, that Joe is a sneaky snake.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.320
Joe is a sneaky snake.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.320
That's true.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.320
Yeah.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.320
That's true.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.320
Powerful sneaky snake.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.320
Maybe that's what Alex said.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.840
Maybe that's what it's always been.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.440
That's why Joe can't get rid of Alex.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.160
Alex has powerful over him.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.160
Could be.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.960
He's got too many skeletons in the closet.

13:45.960 --> 13:46.960
This might be-

13:46.960 --> 13:48.640
We've blown the whole thing open.

13:48.640 --> 13:52.000
This was not what I was looking to discover, but I think we might've figured it out.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
We got it.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
We did it.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
The corruption is-

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
The corruption.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
It's the word powerful.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
It's blackmail.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.600
This is why there's an intellectual dark web.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.360
The whole thing goes back to Joe stealing the word powerful.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.040
I knew it would happen.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
Oh, well.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.840
Now that we've solved that, let's get into something a little more meaty.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.840
Okay.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.280
I now admit that the Private Lynch thing really wasn't a rescue.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.440
It was totally staged.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.880
The Iraqis had been gone for two days.

14:17.880 --> 14:23.160
The doctors had walked down the road and told them days before to come get her.

14:23.160 --> 14:28.480
The special forces hours before the raid had been across the street.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.040
They knew the area was deserted.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.880
Turns out it was theater, Hollywood.

14:31.880 --> 14:36.360
So for the last few days here in 2003, Alex has been touching on this story of the alleged

14:36.360 --> 14:40.360
rescue of Private Lynch, and I've been waiting for him to dig into it with some real depth

14:40.360 --> 14:44.320
so I can get a better sense of his exact position, but it doesn't seem like there's much here

14:44.320 --> 14:46.640
past what he said in that clip.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.800
His position is that the rescue is all just Hollywood theatrics and nothing more.

14:50.800 --> 14:55.160
The story of Private Lynch is actually a fantastic example of the precise problem with what Alex

14:55.160 --> 14:59.840
Jones does for a living and how easy it is to get seduced into his way of thinking.

14:59.840 --> 15:06.880
For some background, on March 23, 2003, Lynch's convoy was ambushed outside Nasirah in Iraq

15:06.880 --> 15:08.680
and she was taken hostage.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.960
Eleven of the other members of her group were killed in the ambush and Lynch was taken to

15:11.960 --> 15:13.960
nearby Saddam Hospital.

15:13.960 --> 15:18.800
There she was treated and on the evening of April 1st, she was rescued by US forces.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.900
From this point forward, the story is one of complete malpractice by the media where

15:22.900 --> 15:25.720
sensationalism led coverage of the story.

15:25.720 --> 15:29.560
Unnamed sources claimed that she'd been shot or stabbed, but conflicting reports came out

15:29.560 --> 15:32.700
from her doctors who said that she had no such wounds.

15:32.700 --> 15:36.960
Even as media outlets ran with a sensationalized version of the story, other outlets were digging

15:36.960 --> 15:40.700
in to sort out what was and was not the truth.

15:40.700 --> 15:44.500
By April 15th, outlets like the Washington Post were beginning to critically examine

15:44.500 --> 15:48.680
their own initial coverage and question whether their account was accurate.

15:48.680 --> 15:53.480
Washington Post headline, whoops, really should have done a better job on that one, our bad.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.720
More or less, yeah, it's interesting.

15:55.720 --> 15:59.360
And gradually, things fell apart and the truth of the matter came forward.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.840
When Lynch was taken to Saddam Hospital, she was given appropriate medical treatment and

16:02.840 --> 16:07.040
when US forces arrived to rescue her, there weren't any Iraqi forces there and much of

16:07.040 --> 16:12.000
the characterization of her as a Rambo-type was based on overdramatization and misstatements.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.320
Now, it's absolutely true that much of the media completely fucked this story up and

16:17.320 --> 16:21.920
they may have had forces that were pretty excited that they were fucking it up.

16:21.920 --> 16:27.400
The war in Iraq at that point was not full of good news like the Bush administration

16:27.400 --> 16:31.520
would have wanted it to be and the idea that they would try to take this story and use

16:31.520 --> 16:35.620
it for their purposes definitely seems like what they did.

16:35.620 --> 16:40.000
If you read the House report that investigated the flow of information about the rescue titled

16:40.000 --> 16:45.880
House Report 110-858, you can definitely see instances of members of the Department of

16:45.880 --> 16:50.240
Defense giving inaccurate information about the rescue, which fed into the heroic drama

16:50.240 --> 16:52.200
that was being sold by the media.

16:52.200 --> 16:58.400
Are you telling me that war-mongering politicians and their, oh, okay, you're doing this wild.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.640
I'm not telling you that entirely.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.360
I'm not saying that definitively.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.360
Sure.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.360
And I think that's important.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.360
Yes.

17:05.360 --> 17:06.720
Well, there's one instance.

17:06.720 --> 17:12.960
On April 2nd, Brigadier General Vincent Brooks, a spokesperson for CENTCOM, told a press briefing,

17:12.960 --> 17:16.680
quote, there was not a firefight outside the building, I will tell you, but there were

17:16.680 --> 17:20.360
firefights outside of the building getting in and getting out.

17:20.360 --> 17:25.020
That was not true, unless you take a very broad view of what getting in and getting

17:25.020 --> 17:26.020
out means.

17:26.020 --> 17:31.480
Well, we started the war a couple of months ago, so there were firefights for us to get

17:31.480 --> 17:35.960
there, and then whenever she left, the war was still going on, so there were firefights

17:35.960 --> 17:36.960
when we were leaving.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.960
See?

17:37.960 --> 17:41.320
On April 3rd, Navy Captain Frank Thorpe was quoted in the Military Times as saying that

17:41.320 --> 17:44.560
Lynch, quote, waged quite a battle prior to her capture.

17:44.560 --> 17:49.060
We do have very strong indications that Jessica Lynch was not captured very easily.

17:49.060 --> 17:53.320
Reports are that she fired her M-16 rifle until she had no more ammunition.

17:53.320 --> 17:56.760
None of that information is accurate, but it feeds into the creation of a story out

17:56.760 --> 17:59.000
of the movies for the public to enjoy.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.520
Yeah, like what they did with Lynch.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.520
Pat Tillman?

18:02.520 --> 18:03.520
Yeah.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
Tillman, that's right.

18:04.520 --> 18:08.400
Yeah, that was another thing that was in that House investigation, the flow of misinformation

18:08.400 --> 18:10.160
surrounding that circumstance.

18:10.160 --> 18:16.400
Now, the thing is, those people and their statements, the Brigadier General Brooks and

18:16.400 --> 18:22.520
Navy Captain Thorpe, are not necessarily the people who gave the statements unnamed to

18:22.520 --> 18:23.520
the Washington Post.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.520
Sure, true.

18:24.520 --> 18:31.000
It's not like these people's statements, as inaccurate as they may be, are what fueled

18:31.000 --> 18:34.120
directly the media sensationalism.

18:34.120 --> 18:40.300
And it would be impossible to prove this definitively, but you'd also have to be kind of naive to

18:40.300 --> 18:43.640
think that it's impossible that someone within the Department of Defense wouldn't have seen

18:43.640 --> 18:48.160
the potential to spin this story for some much needed good press for the war.

18:48.160 --> 18:52.160
You could have that suspicion, and you could point fingers at the media for bungling the

18:52.160 --> 18:56.300
story, but if you do that, you have to be careful about where you're pointing.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.060
If you damn the media for their mishandling this story, you also have to credit the media

19:00.060 --> 19:04.940
for doubling back and questioning their own coverage when new information came to light.

19:04.940 --> 19:08.860
This doesn't necessarily excuse the sensationalism that characterized the initial coverage, but

19:08.860 --> 19:14.120
without actual journalists continuing to pursue the story, even if it meant embarrassing themselves,

19:14.120 --> 19:17.120
this thread would have been much harder to untangle.

19:17.120 --> 19:22.760
Second, if you believe that the DoD was definitely trying to pull propaganda games here and pushing

19:22.760 --> 19:26.560
a false story, you have to ask how good they are at that.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.240
This was a relatively easy propaganda story to pull off, and it fell apart in a matter

19:30.240 --> 19:31.460
of weeks.

19:31.460 --> 19:35.200
If you believe that this was all government spin, then I would suggest that this story

19:35.200 --> 19:39.560
serves as a terrible argument that the government's always lying to us, and in fact it kind of

19:39.560 --> 19:43.600
more firmly sports the idea that when the government tries to lie on a scale like this,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.600
it doesn't work.

19:45.600 --> 19:53.440
I mean, you know, at the time they had just lied their way into a war, so I bet they weren't

19:53.440 --> 19:58.640
really caring too much about whether or not everybody caught them lying.

19:58.640 --> 20:03.200
I mean, and then as far as the competence with which they do things go, they had just

20:03.200 --> 20:07.580
incompetently lied their way into a war that they were fighting incompetently that were

20:07.580 --> 20:13.440
still fighting incompetently, so it would make sense to me that the government, as it was

20:13.440 --> 20:18.560
at the time, would very much try and push the story so incompetently that it would backfire

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
on them.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.560
Interesting.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.560
Yeah.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.680
So I think the most important thing about this, and the most important aspect to really

20:25.680 --> 20:30.360
delve into, is where one thinks the conspiracy exists.

20:30.360 --> 20:34.020
I don't fault people for thinking that the Bush administration would have a vested interest

20:34.020 --> 20:38.860
in the sensational version of the story being reported, and that possibly unnamed US officials

20:38.860 --> 20:42.880
fed the flames of the story to the media, so you can suspect, you know, that they maybe

20:42.880 --> 20:46.320
wanted the media to get this wrong in this way.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.220
That's a different thing than the narrative that Alex is selling.

20:49.220 --> 20:53.000
The story that Alex is telling is that the entire rescue operation itself was a contrived

20:53.000 --> 20:56.880
theatrical affair, which is completely unsupported by the facts.

20:56.880 --> 21:01.500
The DOD Office of the Inspector General conducted an investigation due to the insistence of

21:01.500 --> 21:08.000
Rahm Emanuel, of all people, into the allegations that the rescue was, quote, premeditated fabrication.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.920
From the report, quote, based on the results of the preliminary inquiry conducted by the

21:11.920 --> 21:17.160
Inspector General, United States Central Command, we concluded that the allegations were not

21:17.160 --> 21:20.600
substantiated and that no further investigation was warranted.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.680
During the inquiry, the Inspector General, US CENTCOM, reviewed numerous classified operational

21:24.680 --> 21:28.800
documents that were not available to the media, and interviewed over 30 witnesses, many of

21:28.800 --> 21:32.480
whom had firsthand knowledge of the events at issue.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.880
In addition to this, Vernon Loeb, one of the writers of the first Washington Post story,

21:36.880 --> 21:41.460
the actual first one that shed off the sensationalized coverage, he was interviewed on NPR's Fresh

21:41.460 --> 21:43.740
Air in December 2003.

21:43.740 --> 21:47.400
In that interview, he clarifies that the information he was getting that the story was based on

21:47.400 --> 21:51.520
was wrong, but it ultimately traced back to bad intelligence from the field.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.880
Inaccurate information was conveyed, collected from intercepts and misrepresented and misinterpreted

21:55.880 --> 21:58.680
details, and then that story was reported.

21:58.680 --> 22:04.080
Which kind of puts a little bit of a hole in the theory that is all an elaborate hoax.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:05.080 --> 22:10.260
It's more mishandling, and if you want to get a conspiracy about like, hey, it works

22:10.260 --> 22:14.080
in certain people's best interests that there was this mishandling.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.080
That's not crazy.

22:15.080 --> 22:21.520
Yeah, no, I mean, it seems almost impossible to think of it as anything other than opportunistic

22:21.520 --> 22:28.400
idiots bungling a martyr story, you know, or a war hero story.

22:28.400 --> 22:34.920
And I think if you want to keep it in that sort of territory, you're on more, like, not

22:34.920 --> 22:36.400
totally unreasonable ground.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.400
Yeah, that seems reasonable.

22:37.400 --> 22:42.800
I'm doing it the way Alex is doing it, and this idea that it's like, ah, they had premeditated

22:42.800 --> 22:48.600
intentions of creating this fake rescue in order to trick people into supporting the

22:48.600 --> 22:50.220
war or whatever.

22:50.220 --> 22:54.920
That is where it's like, okay, this is a conclusion that is unearned, unsubstantiated, you can't

22:54.920 --> 22:57.000
back this up, and it's nonsense.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.260
And this is the point that I'm trying to make.

22:59.260 --> 23:03.960
When you have this suspicion and this like, I don't know, I don't trust these people pushing

23:03.960 --> 23:11.020
a fucking war, and this story, it was mishandled on some level.

23:11.020 --> 23:15.200
Inaccurate statements were made, whether it was because of bad information being conveyed

23:15.200 --> 23:22.700
to the people making the statements or some kind of a, eh, mishandling, who knows.

23:22.700 --> 23:27.000
That suspicion is not that bizarre.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.800
It's not unnatural to have that healthy distrust, but that healthy distrust gets transmuted

23:32.800 --> 23:39.600
by someone like Alex into confident assertions of a conclusion that isn't based in reality.

23:39.600 --> 23:44.860
And that's where the danger is, even with this 2003 Alex that's a far different Alex

23:44.860 --> 23:48.200
than the present in terms of some of his methodologies.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
That is true.

23:49.200 --> 23:57.760
I mean, but it's just so easy, it's just so easy, especially at the time, because they

23:57.760 --> 24:02.340
literally lied us into a war that's never going to end.

24:02.340 --> 24:08.960
Like that's a conspiracy on the level of something that is so huge.

24:08.960 --> 24:15.040
I mean, an actual war, an invasion of another country, and it was a conspiracy, and it was

24:15.040 --> 24:20.040
a lie that it's hard to imagine anything's beyond those people, you know?

24:20.040 --> 24:26.120
Like why would, do you really think it's beyond the people who lied us into a forever war

24:26.120 --> 24:28.900
to fabricate one small thing?

24:28.900 --> 24:33.560
You know, like that seems like a reasonable overreaction at the time.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.560
If that makes sense.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.560
Do you know what I'm saying?

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
Right.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.760
But what you're describing is essentially Alex Jones's sort of indoctrination process.

24:40.760 --> 24:41.760
Exactly.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
Yeah.

24:42.760 --> 24:49.060
I mean, yes, it is compelling and it certainly could be persuasive to say, they did X, why

24:49.060 --> 24:51.460
wouldn't they do something else?

24:51.460 --> 24:52.460
And that's fine.

24:52.460 --> 24:56.940
But then, all right, any argument is gone.

24:56.940 --> 25:02.440
Why wouldn't they do, you could just use that to justify 100 conspiracies that you want

25:02.440 --> 25:03.440
to believe in.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.440
Oh, totally.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.440
Totally.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.440
And it's just, it doesn't work.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.440
Yeah.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
No, I don't think there's any way-

25:08.440 --> 25:12.240
If you prove that someone is morally capable of an act, it doesn't prove that they did

25:12.240 --> 25:13.240
it.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.240
Right.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.240
Right, right, right, right.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.240
No, totally.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.240
I absolutely agree.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.200
But that hijack is what Alex uses.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.200
Right.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.320
If they are morally capable of this, then they must have done it.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.320
Right.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.320
Right, right, right.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.320
And that's just not reality.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.320
Yeah.

25:27.320 --> 25:33.800
It's hard not to think that history is going to look at the Bush administration as infinitely

25:33.800 --> 25:36.680
worse than anything Trump ever did.

25:36.680 --> 25:43.120
It's hard to think that history won't look at Bush as one of the single worst genociders

25:43.120 --> 25:44.640
there's ever been.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.600
Feels like Trump has some time left, though.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
That's true.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
That's true.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.960
He can still catch up.

25:49.960 --> 25:56.040
So Alex has some interesting predictions that he makes in this episode that seem very

25:56.040 --> 25:58.440
reminiscent of the present day.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.320
The New World Order is here.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.440
It's in our face.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.520
It's with us right now.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.680
And they're preparing a national draft.

26:08.680 --> 26:13.280
Even if you don't serve overseas, you'll serve here in- Yes, we've looked at the programs.

26:13.280 --> 26:23.000
Paddle tail squads, anti-gun programs, environmental cult groups locally, literally what they are.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.320
Under George W. Bush, who's the testular head of things right now, they put a Republican

26:27.320 --> 26:32.520
in for this final destruction of America so conservatives would hesitate just long enough

26:32.520 --> 26:34.200
so they could get the job done.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.320
So we've been in the New World Order for 20 years now.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.320
Yeah, yeah.

26:38.320 --> 26:45.100
No, it just occurred to me that when he says all of these things and then they don't happen

26:45.100 --> 26:52.840
and he's like, see, we stopped it, like, yeah, but now you've been foiling the same plot

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
for 20 years.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.840
Yeah.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.880
This is like, we're reading Batman serialized comics.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.680
Bush was going to put in the draft and that was going to have tattle tail squads and then

27:01.680 --> 27:06.640
Obama was going to have a draft and it was going to have the Obama youth or whatever.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:07.640 --> 27:13.040
And then, you know, and he puts the Joker back in Arkham Asylum and then a week later

27:13.040 --> 27:16.840
Joker breaks out with the same plan again and he foils it again.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.120
And there's a whole lot of immediacy every time.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.120
Every single time.

27:20.120 --> 27:24.560
The only difference I would say is that within the world of DC Comics, the Batman and Joker

27:24.560 --> 27:25.560
do exist.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.560
Yeah, that is true.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.560
That is true.

27:27.560 --> 27:32.040
It would be like if Batman was making up Joker schemes in order to foil them over and over

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
again.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
Oh shit.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.320
And did not possess the creativity to come up with new plans.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.800
I think you have got a new take on the Batman character.

27:39.800 --> 27:45.240
It's a rich psychopath who is inventing super villains in order to play out this massive

27:45.240 --> 27:48.040
fantasy that he has of being a superhero.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.640
Oh my god, that sounds real!

27:50.640 --> 27:53.480
I know a guy who could write that for you.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.480
Yeah.

27:54.480 --> 28:03.160
So at this point in 2003 there were some beginnings of democratic processes being attempted within

28:03.160 --> 28:04.160
Iraq.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.160
Mm-hmm.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.800
And Alex has some interesting takes on that.

28:06.800 --> 28:13.880
They've been on the news and they're saying to everyone that, oh look, this will make

28:13.880 --> 28:15.160
the detractors shut up.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.440
They said it might be five years before there were elections in Iraq.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.760
And look, already in Mosul, an election.

28:21.760 --> 28:27.200
Well I went and actually read our own government's release of what they've done in Mosul.

28:27.200 --> 28:34.440
They have, our government has chosen 200 people, former assets, still current assets, CIA,

28:34.440 --> 28:36.800
current leaders, communists, others.

28:36.800 --> 28:41.600
And just like they chose Saddam to be the dictator of Iraq back in the 70s, been their

28:41.600 --> 28:43.720
hit man since 58.

28:43.720 --> 28:51.240
Well now they're just choosing 200 strongmen and they quote, will elect, they will appoint

28:51.240 --> 28:58.320
the governor of that northern district and the gubernatorial seat will be Mosul.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.680
So I was able to find articles and outlets like the New York Times and LA Times about

29:01.680 --> 29:06.480
the Mosul election from early May 2003 and the tone that they have is a lot more restrained

29:06.480 --> 29:08.440
than Alex is presenting it.

29:08.440 --> 29:12.760
The New York Times article starts like this, quote, Iraq took its first faltering step

29:12.760 --> 29:17.200
toward democracy today when a large ethnically diverse group of local leaders held an election

29:17.200 --> 29:22.520
to choose an interim government in this northern city, Iraq's third largest.

29:22.520 --> 29:26.320
The reporting recognizes that this is a first step in a process, not necessarily the end

29:26.320 --> 29:29.920
result itself, whereas I feel like Alex is trying to pretend that the media is saying

29:29.920 --> 29:32.200
that this is a job that's finished.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.600
The election that was held wasn't just agents selected by the CIA or whatever the fuck Alex

29:36.600 --> 29:41.880
is saying, it was a group of 240 tribal leaders and local residents from nine ethnic groups

29:41.880 --> 29:44.280
that make up the population of the area.

29:44.280 --> 29:50.000
These 240 selected a group of 24 council members who then went on to choose a mayor.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.500
I'm not going to pretend that I know whether or not this was the best way to handle a preliminary

29:53.500 --> 29:57.460
election for an interim government, but my point is that from everything I can tell,

29:57.460 --> 29:59.800
Alex is misrepresenting what's going on.

29:59.800 --> 30:03.800
It's great to be opposed to the war because you should be, but your opposition should

30:03.800 --> 30:09.500
be based in reality and I don't feel like there's a lot of dealing with the war as it

30:09.500 --> 30:11.640
exists on his part.

30:11.640 --> 30:13.560
Yeah, yeah.

30:13.560 --> 30:18.600
It seems like if you don't deal with such a massive thing going on and instead create

30:18.600 --> 30:24.000
toxic conspiracy theories about it that push people towards the far right, I bet that's

30:24.000 --> 30:25.800
going to have repercussions later on.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.240
Yeah, I don't think it was the right way to express opposition.

30:29.240 --> 30:34.100
Yeah, I think later on we're really going to find out that the results of those things

30:34.100 --> 30:36.480
combining are really going to be bad for us.

30:36.480 --> 30:42.120
I think my parents' friends who were hippies might have had a better handle on things.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
Yeah.

30:43.120 --> 30:47.960
So, you know, on our last episode about 2003, I think, maybe it was two back, Alex discussed

30:47.960 --> 30:50.720
how he was going to go to Missouri to do a radio event.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.720
Sure, sure, yes.

30:51.720 --> 30:52.720
Car dealership opening.

30:52.720 --> 30:53.720
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

30:53.720 --> 30:59.260
And this is so foreign from Alex's present-day mentality because I kind of believe he's telling

30:59.260 --> 31:00.260
the truth here.

31:00.260 --> 31:01.260
Okay.

31:01.260 --> 31:06.960
So the whole proceeds, 15 bucks, go to KCXL, they wanted to give me some of the money,

31:06.960 --> 31:11.360
but I said, you know, I'm not like the Patriots for profit, I'll come up and sell my videos,

31:11.360 --> 31:13.760
that's fine, but you just keep the money.

31:13.760 --> 31:18.720
You've had us on for three years telling the truth, so I'll come and speak at your event

31:18.720 --> 31:24.160
and this will certainly help you guys expand your operation and increase your power and

31:24.160 --> 31:25.160
everything else.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.160
So they're great folks.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.160
I hope a lot of you come.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.960
I hear thousands are planning.

31:28.960 --> 31:35.040
I kind of believe that he probably would turn down money to do a radio event back then.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.040
Yeah.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.240
It doesn't feel insincere.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.240
I don't like it.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.440
I don't like it, Dan, but I do buy it.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.480
I think I believe him here.

31:43.480 --> 31:48.520
I don't know, though, I don't know the tone of his lies in 2003, Dan.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.520
I also think that there's a possibility that he has a reason to believe that he could make

31:51.520 --> 31:55.480
more money selling DVDs than he could for whatever his appearance rate would be.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.560
Yeah, I imagine they didn't give him.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.800
It's still a calculation, maybe.

31:59.800 --> 32:06.320
Maybe the appearance fee was lowball enough that your pride would be better off denying

32:06.320 --> 32:09.320
it than taking it.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.320
That could be.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.960
But yeah, apparently he was willing to go for free to a radio event in Missouri back

32:13.960 --> 32:14.960
in 2003.

32:14.960 --> 32:15.960
Yeah!

32:15.960 --> 32:17.160
Yeah, that's intense.

32:17.160 --> 32:23.820
So at this point, Alex not only going to radio events for free, he is also doing the work.

32:23.820 --> 32:26.720
He's doing a lot of work.

32:26.720 --> 32:34.640
Another side note, I am running on three hour sleep and I've done this about four days straight.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.200
I do this a couple times a year.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.200
Well more than that.

32:38.200 --> 32:42.360
Maybe that's why I look more like Jabba the Hutt instead of James Bond like he used to

32:42.360 --> 32:43.360
look.

32:43.360 --> 32:49.720
But the point is, the point is, I have completed a new film.

32:49.720 --> 32:50.720
It is done.

32:50.720 --> 32:56.000
It is being mass produced as we speak.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.680
So on the website we say that it ships in one week and that's accurate if you want your

33:01.680 --> 33:14.080
order sent out first, you'll definitely want to go to Infowars.com or Infowars.net or PrisonPlanet.com

33:14.080 --> 33:18.960
and click on the shopping cart to order Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

33:18.960 --> 33:24.440
So I have decided that it's been too long since we've done a documentary and as we're

33:24.440 --> 33:27.240
back in 2003, Alex just released this documentary.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.240
I feel like it's perfect timing.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.480
We've got to cover Police State 3.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.120
We're going to cover Police State 3?

33:33.120 --> 33:34.120
I think we might.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.120
Oh shit.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.120
Yeah.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.120
Oh boy.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.720
I got this, you know, this energy.

33:40.720 --> 33:46.440
Was that the one whenever Bobcat, his star was really starting to wane down after three?

33:46.440 --> 33:47.840
Was that the one?

33:47.840 --> 33:50.320
That was Mission to Moscow.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.940
Okay, that was five.

33:51.940 --> 33:52.940
Was he still at five?

33:52.940 --> 33:53.940
I don't know.

33:53.940 --> 33:54.940
Oh, Bobcat.

33:54.940 --> 33:55.940
Matt Bobcat.

33:55.940 --> 33:56.940
Nicest guy in the world.

33:56.940 --> 33:57.940
I'm sure.

33:57.940 --> 33:58.940
Love him.

33:58.940 --> 33:59.940
Yeah.

33:59.940 --> 34:00.940
So Alex has got this new film.

34:00.940 --> 34:01.940
Very exciting.

34:01.940 --> 34:02.940
Yeah.

34:02.940 --> 34:03.940
Good for you.

34:03.940 --> 34:04.940
Yeah.

34:04.940 --> 34:05.940
Police State 3.

34:05.940 --> 34:06.940
Can't wait to watch that bullshit.

34:06.940 --> 34:07.940
Oh boy.

34:07.940 --> 34:08.940
Oh boy.

34:08.940 --> 34:09.940
So that may be coming soon.

34:09.940 --> 34:10.940
Also, Jordan.

34:10.940 --> 34:11.940
I don't know.

34:11.940 --> 34:14.520
I don't know what's so egregious to me.

34:14.520 --> 34:22.880
The idea of going online and putting a dramatic documentary title such as Police State 3 into

34:22.880 --> 34:29.360
your order cart and you're just staring at Police State 3 clicking buy.

34:29.360 --> 34:34.760
You got to feel like shit if you're not buying Police State 2 and 1 also.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.240
There might be important information on those.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.240
Yeah.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.240
Is it serialized?

34:39.240 --> 34:40.240
Are we going to miss out?

34:40.240 --> 34:43.600
I don't know, but if we do cover it, I'm not doing the other ones.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.480
No, you're going to have to watch them for background.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.680
I don't know if I'm going to.

34:47.680 --> 34:52.840
So at this point, Jordan, we know in the future, present day.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.200
Who are Alex's enemies?

34:54.200 --> 34:56.480
Oh boy.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.600
The list is ongoing, but mainly S.T.E.L.T.E.R.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.240
No, not individuals.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.840
How would you describe them?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.840
Oh, literal demons.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.120
Minions of the devil.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.120
Yes.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.840
Interestingly, here is who the new world order is in 2003.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.840
Okay.

35:10.840 --> 35:16.680
I have poured my life's blood into these films.

35:16.680 --> 35:21.280
My burning the candle at both ends in the defense of the Republic.

35:21.280 --> 35:26.880
If this was the Alamo, they're coming over the wall in the defense of the Republic.

35:26.880 --> 35:31.240
And we're defending against the new world order, the European bankers that own our government,

35:31.240 --> 35:33.960
and we must educate people if we're ever going to have liberty.

35:33.960 --> 35:38.040
So it's European bankers is the new world order.

35:38.040 --> 35:42.880
It's not so much the devil, the literal Christian devil.

35:42.880 --> 35:43.880
Yeah.

35:43.880 --> 35:50.520
I mean, it's nice that we haven't seen the enemy at our gates yet, so to speak.

35:50.520 --> 35:58.480
I think it's interesting how there's this fast and looseness.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.480
Yeah.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.920
What do you actually think?

36:00.920 --> 36:02.260
I don't know.

36:02.260 --> 36:03.800
I don't know.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.000
I don't know.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
I don't know.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
I don't either.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
I don't know.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.040
That's what's so interesting about this, because we know in the future he will be fighting

36:11.040 --> 36:12.040
the devil.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.160
And there's some slight indications that we've seen from 2003 that he seems to think there's

36:16.160 --> 36:17.560
something going on.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.560
Right, right, right, right.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.440
But then, when he's talking about the new world order, he talks about it in terms of

36:21.440 --> 36:27.760
international European bankers, which is exactly the sort of presentation that he wants people

36:27.760 --> 36:29.340
to have at this point.

36:29.340 --> 36:30.920
This is about the Federal Reserve.

36:30.920 --> 36:35.240
This is about fiat currency.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.240
I don't know.

36:36.240 --> 36:39.960
I want to know if he actually thinks it's the devil back then.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.360
I kind of think that... Here's what I think it is, all right?

36:43.360 --> 36:44.760
Here's what I'm going to go with.

36:44.760 --> 36:48.760
I'm going to go with its necessary escalation is what happened.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.440
Like Iron Man came out around 2003.

36:52.440 --> 36:58.960
It's just one dude fighting against his director, or whatever it is he's doing.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.240
Real low stakes.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.800
By the end of it, we've got to restart the universe.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
He starts out.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.640
He's like, oh, European bankers are out.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.520
And then 20 years later, we're fighting the literal devil.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.520
It makes sense.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.360
Yeah, but look, dude, Iron Man-

37:13.360 --> 37:20.440
If he's doing Batman, he's essentially doing the entire Marvel universe as we go along.

37:20.440 --> 37:28.960
In Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. wasn't pretending that he wasn't fighting Thanos, right?

37:28.960 --> 37:31.640
He didn't know he was fighting Thanos.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.760
But Alex seems to have some awareness of the devil.

37:33.760 --> 37:34.920
Well, there is that.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
There is that.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.160
But Thanos didn't hatch his plan for another 10 years, or whatever.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.360
It's a line of awareness that I'm interested in.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.720
I can't quite get my finger on it yet.

37:43.720 --> 37:49.760
So Alex goes to calls, and he takes a caller who wants to talk about Dennis Miller.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.120
Sure, great.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.760
Mark in Minnesota, you're on the air.

37:52.760 --> 37:53.760
Go ahead.

37:53.760 --> 37:54.760
Hey, Alex.

37:54.760 --> 37:55.760
How you doing, sir?

37:55.760 --> 37:56.760
Oh, pretty good.

37:56.760 --> 38:01.960
I seldom watch TV, but I just happened to be watching The Tonight Show last night.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.680
And Dennis Miller was on there.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.680
And I always seem to-

38:05.680 --> 38:09.600
Yeah, so-called, ultra-socialist, anti-gun.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.600
Real quick, ultra-socialist Dennis Miller.

38:11.600 --> 38:16.120
But one fun thing to point out is this is 2003, because Dennis Miller was on The Tonight

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
Show.

38:17.120 --> 38:21.320
Now, worshipping Bush, pro-war, anti-freedom.

38:21.320 --> 38:25.120
Of course, this is a liberal sneak attack.

38:25.120 --> 38:29.800
I mean, he's like just- I mean, nothing but praise and accolades for Bush.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.680
I mean, Sig Hill, George Bush.

38:31.680 --> 38:35.920
Let me tell you something, I have him on tape literally engaging in a 10-minute worship

38:35.920 --> 38:36.920
session.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
Yes, you saw that then.

38:37.920 --> 38:39.440
Well, no, I saw him months ago.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.080
It's wall to wall, sir.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.080
Fair enough.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.080
Fair enough.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.080
Yeah, I mean, hey, yeah, good.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.080
Dennis Miller sucks.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.240
Was this back when he was on Monday Night Football?

38:47.240 --> 38:48.240
Oh, man.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.240
Jesus.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.800
No, I think that might have been a few years earlier.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.800
Oh, okay.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.200
But like this, yeah, this is- sure, yeah, Dennis Miller sucks.

38:55.200 --> 38:58.880
And he was a guy who promoted the Iraq war in a shameless way.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.440
Yeah, he went crazy.

39:00.440 --> 39:05.940
But I think time has shown us that he stayed on that pretty conservative path and was pretty

39:05.940 --> 39:06.940
in favor of Trump.

39:06.940 --> 39:08.240
Yeah, he's a real piece of shit.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.840
He followed a lot of the similar path that Alex walked out.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.840
Yeah, yeah.

39:11.840 --> 39:17.400
And instead, Alex is saying this is a secret socialist ultra-left person trying to pretend

39:17.400 --> 39:22.680
to be conservative in order to Trojan horse George Bush on us.

39:22.680 --> 39:25.440
That explanation, it doesn't make sense in hindsight.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.040
Just a fucking dick who lost his mind.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.340
Yeah, yeah.

39:29.340 --> 39:30.340
Real dick.

39:30.340 --> 39:31.400
Real dick.

39:31.400 --> 39:36.400
It's nice to know that no matter what era we live in, right-wing commentators will still

39:36.400 --> 39:41.120
have very strong opinions about comics who don't matter.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.120
Yeah.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.120
Great.

39:43.120 --> 39:46.120
And it's pretty universal in no one likes Dennis Miller.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.120
Yeah.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.120
Fuck them.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.120
Except Bill O'Reilly.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.120
Fuck them too.

39:50.120 --> 39:54.080
So in this next clip, Alex talks about an interaction that did not happen.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.960
It's not globalists in a hot tub.

39:55.960 --> 39:59.480
It seems to be a Nazi at a gas station, maybe.

39:59.480 --> 40:00.760
Is that a classic joke?

40:00.760 --> 40:02.740
I don't think this happened.

40:02.740 --> 40:11.640
About two weeks ago, I was taking the family out and I was, my wife, my parents were in

40:11.640 --> 40:16.040
the car, we're going out to eat and I run into the store, pay for the gas and I'm standing

40:16.040 --> 40:22.800
there and a guy with iron cross tattoos, everything else is in there, Mr. Trendy, who's not trendy

40:22.800 --> 40:29.280
at all, establishment brainwashed carbon copy cookie cutter creature, and he's buying this

40:29.280 --> 40:35.680
proud to be an American decal at the front counter and he goes, man, I'll tell you, I

40:35.680 --> 40:36.680
love it.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.320
All this oil we're getting.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.680
And I go, oh, oil.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.200
And he's, yeah, it's great.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.320
And I'm like, well, you don't think you're going to get that oil, do you?

40:44.320 --> 40:45.320
I don't care.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.320
We're tough.

40:46.320 --> 40:49.920
And the guy behind the counter started, you know, laughing at him and he goes, Hey, how

40:49.920 --> 40:50.920
you doing Alex?

40:50.920 --> 40:51.920
The guy behind the counter knew who I was.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.600
And I said, look, don't you know, they're killing people over there and you know, this

40:54.600 --> 40:55.600
is a fraud.

40:55.600 --> 40:56.840
They told us it wasn't about oil.

40:56.840 --> 41:01.680
Now they admitted, ah, so what we needed, I said, sir, you're not part of the establishment.

41:01.680 --> 41:07.560
They can't, they're like a poor North Korean who just loves Kim Jong Il, but you can't

41:07.560 --> 41:09.040
help these people.

41:09.040 --> 41:12.980
From at least 2010 onward, all the way to his running for president, Donald Trump was

41:12.980 --> 41:17.960
completely preoccupied with the idea of taking oil from countries where we've been at war.

41:17.960 --> 41:22.600
An editor's note in an article from the Brookings Institute called it quote, the most dangerous

41:22.600 --> 41:26.440
and irresponsible of all the Republican nominees' policy proposals.

41:26.440 --> 41:31.040
And Alex justified it when Trump had the exact same perspective he's shooting down as dumb

41:31.040 --> 41:32.680
back here in 2003.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.680
Yep.

41:33.680 --> 41:41.080
Also, I think it's weird, um, that Alex is saying that being a Nazi is trendy in 2003.

41:41.080 --> 41:47.120
I don't know what kind of company he's swinging with back then, but, um, honestly, for Alex,

41:47.120 --> 41:48.720
that guy was ahead of the times.

41:48.720 --> 41:49.720
Really.

41:49.720 --> 41:53.600
He was, he was out at the forefront of, of pop culture.

41:53.600 --> 41:54.600
He was an early adopter.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.600
Absolutely.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.600
Of the right-wing eventual.

41:56.600 --> 42:01.560
That guy's, that guy's basically the Jack Kerouac of the, of the Beat movement.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.040
You know, he was there early.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.040
That's tough.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.040
Yeah.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.040
Yeah.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.280
I just don't like the idea of like looking at somebody with an Iron Cross tattoo and

42:08.280 --> 42:10.840
be like, fucking trendy.

42:10.840 --> 42:15.760
It's like my, like how I look at my friends who were too into Tiger King, and I'm like,

42:15.760 --> 42:18.560
that's how Alex looks at a guy with a Nazi tattoo.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.560
Absolutely.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.560
Fuck.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.360
Either that or he's just like, oh, look at you.

42:23.360 --> 42:28.840
So many goddamn Nazis with their Iron Cross tattoos everywhere these days.

42:28.840 --> 42:29.840
Johnny come lately.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.040
There used to be bell bottoms and now there's Iron Cross tattoos.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.040
Right.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.040
What's the next fad?

42:35.040 --> 42:41.320
So I think that one of the things that I keep getting a sense of in these 2003 episodes

42:41.320 --> 42:47.400
is a lot of Alex's opposition to George Bush comes down to a complete feeling that Bush

42:47.400 --> 42:49.400
is going to take all of his guns.

42:49.400 --> 42:54.800
And I want to keep mentioning that not only is Bush going to reinstate the Clinton gun

42:54.800 --> 43:03.180
ban and a magazine ban with pleasure, by the way, they are also going to bring forward

43:03.180 --> 43:07.840
our Lady of Peace Act that registers all gun owners, shuts down gun shows.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.020
Well, it's all the stuff in S-22.

43:10.020 --> 43:15.640
Our Lady of Peace is one bill in S-22 and there's the shut down the gun show section,

43:15.640 --> 43:21.120
national ballistics database, I mean, stuff that makes what Bill Clinton did look conservative.

43:21.120 --> 43:25.320
Folks, mayday, we're losing everything here.

43:25.320 --> 43:30.360
S-22, also known as the Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act of 2003 was introduced

43:30.360 --> 43:35.720
by Tom Daschle on January 7th, 2003 and he promptly died before even receiving a vote.

43:35.720 --> 43:36.720
Yeah, I was going to say.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.900
Clinton signed the federal assault weapons ban in 1994 and it was set to have a sunset

43:40.900 --> 43:42.560
clause after 10 years.

43:42.560 --> 43:48.560
So it was a ban that only existed until 2004 when it would be reexamined and it expired

43:48.560 --> 43:50.560
in 2004 and Bush did not renew it.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.560
Yeah.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.720
None of the stuff that Alex wants to make these listeners scared of happened, which

43:53.720 --> 43:56.560
is kind of the case always.

43:56.560 --> 43:59.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.720
Mm-hmm.

44:00.720 --> 44:05.240
Well, it distracts from the stuff that is happening and that's, you know, you don't

44:05.240 --> 44:07.160
want to get in the way of real things.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.160
True.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.160
You could get hurt.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.160
True.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.760
That's why you don't make Shadowgate, Dan.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.560
You don't get in the way of the real stuff.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.560
Oh, yeah.

44:15.560 --> 44:16.560
You stay away from that.

44:16.560 --> 44:17.560
You stay away.

44:17.560 --> 44:18.560
Stay away from the gate of gates.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.320
Alex doesn't get into that deep spy stuff.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.480
And whatever you do, don't talk about Roger.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.680
Oh, yeah, you're gone.

44:25.680 --> 44:32.320
So Alex takes another call and this guy has a perspective of like, you know, we're over

44:32.320 --> 44:36.560
there and we're trying to bring democracy into the Middle East countries and what have

44:36.560 --> 44:38.760
you and I don't see anything happening here.

44:38.760 --> 44:42.760
I don't see anything happening in my life, whatever.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.080
Alex says something really fucked up after that.

44:45.080 --> 44:49.960
He said before, but the fact that he keeps saying it troubles me.

44:49.960 --> 44:53.880
You know, it's funny that you mentioned the thing about people sharing in the power.

44:53.880 --> 44:56.640
I was thinking about that same issue three days ago.

44:56.640 --> 45:01.440
It popped into my head and I said to myself, wait a minute.

45:01.440 --> 45:04.920
How is it benefiting the general population of this country?

45:04.920 --> 45:11.040
In other words, how are we sharing in any of the benefits of what's going on?

45:11.040 --> 45:13.760
I stopped and I looked around.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.560
Gas prices are still about as high as they ever were.

45:16.560 --> 45:19.160
Nothing has changed, at least as it relates to John Q.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.160
Publick.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.160
And we're losing our liberty and freedom.

45:21.160 --> 45:26.280
I mean, if we had some war emperor who was totally reaffirming all our rights, leaving

45:26.280 --> 45:30.800
us alone, really taking out the we're not being really giving up freedom, really trying

45:30.800 --> 45:35.240
to train with them, I'd say, well, this is this is a radical departure from what George

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
Washington said.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.360
But it's not that bad.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.440
It's not that bad.

45:39.440 --> 45:42.520
He has a very conditional idea about colonialism.

45:42.520 --> 45:43.520
Yeah.

45:43.520 --> 45:44.520
Yeah.

45:44.520 --> 45:47.760
Does not seem to have a principled idea against regime change.

45:47.760 --> 45:48.760
No.

45:48.760 --> 45:49.880
Against nation building.

45:49.880 --> 45:50.880
Yeah.

45:50.880 --> 45:52.400
Which is what he wants people to think he has.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.400
Yeah.

45:53.400 --> 45:54.640
And it's not it's conditional.

45:54.640 --> 45:59.800
It's about whether or not the people who are going and taking over other countries leave

45:59.800 --> 46:01.120
him alone or not.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
Right.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.120
Right.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.120
Right.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.120
Right.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.120
No, no.

46:06.120 --> 46:07.120
You'd be totally fine with like King Leopold if he just didn't take away his gun.

46:07.120 --> 46:08.200
One hundred percent.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.200
It's fucked up.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.200
Yeah.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.040
No, he's against regime change, except for in the right conditions.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.040
Yeah.

46:14.040 --> 46:18.400
Just like he's against the Capital Six riot because it wasn't the right time.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.800
It wasn't the right preparation.

46:19.800 --> 46:20.840
Yeah.

46:20.840 --> 46:23.840
That to me is really a real glaring hole.

46:23.840 --> 46:29.700
And like, I can't I can't I mean, I guess a lot of the times people who would be listening

46:29.700 --> 46:33.460
to this maybe back in 2003 or just listening to it on the radio wouldn't be listening to

46:33.460 --> 46:36.880
it as critically necessarily as I'm listening to it now.

46:36.880 --> 46:41.040
But that seems like something that should be a real problem for him and his listeners.

46:41.040 --> 46:47.280
The idea that he would be OK with a war emperor who goes around as long as they reaffirm our

46:47.280 --> 46:53.760
rights the same way that George Washington would have now obviously abolishing the Constitution.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.560
There would be a discussion.

46:55.560 --> 46:59.280
There's like all of his intros are like, you want to end tyranny?

46:59.280 --> 47:00.280
Well, so does he.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.280
It's like this.

47:01.280 --> 47:05.720
You understand that this is exactly the way that, you know, people rationalized a lot

47:05.720 --> 47:06.720
of it.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.040
So you want to end dictatorships?

47:08.040 --> 47:10.000
How about a benevolent one?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Right.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Interesting.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Yeah.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
And then now in the present day, I guess recent past when Trump was in power, he wanted to

47:16.000 --> 47:17.200
colonize space.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.200
Yeah.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.200
Yeah.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.200
Take over Greenland.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.200
I don't know.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.540
Man, I heard that shit so much.

47:23.540 --> 47:27.680
Do those people who call in and they're like, what do we get out of this war?

47:27.680 --> 47:30.960
Do they not understand how psychopathic that sounds like?

47:30.960 --> 47:32.920
Hey, what do I look?

47:32.920 --> 47:38.960
I'm sure it's fine if we go, you know, slaughter a bunch of civilians, my bottom line, what

47:38.960 --> 47:41.120
my gas prices are going to stay the same.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.120
Yeah.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.120
Yeah.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.120
Fuck you.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.120
How about that?

47:45.120 --> 47:46.120
Gross.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.120
You fucking psycho.

47:47.120 --> 47:49.760
Also, I was just sitting here thinking about it and it's like, let's imagine like a president

47:49.760 --> 47:52.080
that we were supportive of.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.080
Sure.

47:53.080 --> 47:56.920
Just coming out being like, I think I'm going to buy Greenland.

47:56.920 --> 48:03.000
Just imagine, even if you agree with all of the other policies, imagine going along like,

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
you know what?

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
This is a good idea.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
I'm telling you.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
I can't imagine it.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Here's what should have happened.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.300
Here's what we would have gotten Carter a second term, all right?

48:10.300 --> 48:14.680
The gas crisis is going on and he's like, hey, you know where there's gas?

48:14.680 --> 48:16.360
Me neither, but let's buy Greenland.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.140
I'm going to take big swings, baby.

48:19.140 --> 48:20.140
It's ours.

48:20.140 --> 48:21.140
Yeah.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.360
So Alex has a guest, which is sort of a rarity.

48:23.360 --> 48:30.200
I think this is only the second guest I've seen so far in 2003 and here he comes.

48:30.200 --> 48:33.600
We're joined by an expert on the New World Order.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.680
I've read several of his books and for some reason we haven't hooked up over all these

48:36.680 --> 48:38.560
years, but it's good to have him on.

48:38.560 --> 48:43.960
Dennis Lawrence Cuddy, historian and political analyst, took a PhD from the University of

48:43.960 --> 48:48.720
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, major in American history, minor in political science.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.720
Dr. Cuddy has taught university level.

48:50.720 --> 48:55.880
He's been a political and economic risk analyst for international consulting firm.

48:55.880 --> 49:00.120
There's a few things that really concerned me about this intro that Alex is reading for

49:00.120 --> 49:01.320
Dennis Cuddy.

49:01.320 --> 49:05.480
This is the exact wording that you'll find for him on pretty much all other websites,

49:05.480 --> 49:07.560
but it just doesn't sound right.

49:07.560 --> 49:11.200
When someone has been employed as an actual professor, their bio probably wouldn't say

49:11.200 --> 49:13.720
that they've, quote, taught at the university level.

49:13.720 --> 49:18.000
It would almost always specify the school where they were a professor.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.440
Professor of blank at the University of blank.

49:21.440 --> 49:24.920
Honestly, I've given a few lectures at colleges, so I guess I could technically claim that

49:24.920 --> 49:27.560
I've taught at the university level, but it doesn't mean anything.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.560
Oh shit, Dan.

49:29.560 --> 49:31.360
You can get on Info Wars.

49:31.360 --> 49:35.040
The second issue that I have with his bio is that he specifies a major and a minor in

49:35.040 --> 49:38.320
terms of his PhD, which is a little bit bizarre.

49:38.320 --> 49:41.660
Typically that's the language that people use to discuss their undergraduate education.

49:41.660 --> 49:45.520
Whereas if you reach the graduate level in a doctoral program, you'd be unlikely to have

49:45.520 --> 49:46.520
a minor.

49:46.520 --> 49:51.560
You'd probably discuss your area of emphasis as a way of discussing, you know, your credentials.

49:51.560 --> 49:53.360
This just seems really, really weird.

49:53.360 --> 49:57.560
It sounds like what you would describe if you didn't get a PhD.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.200
Well, I was worried about that because it does seem like that.

50:01.200 --> 50:06.120
Yeah, or if you purchased one from somewhere outside of the United States, perhaps.

50:06.120 --> 50:10.520
Well, I was concerned, but I was able to find his dissertation, which was published in a

50:10.520 --> 50:16.400
1978 issue of the Journal of American History titled, quote, American Immigration to Australia

50:16.400 --> 50:18.560
1945 to the Present.

50:18.560 --> 50:22.480
So it does appear that he did complete a PhD program, but I'm not sure what this area of

50:22.480 --> 50:26.400
study has to do with qualifying him to be an expert in the New World Order.

50:26.400 --> 50:30.300
If you check out his bibliography, it's shockingly all weird books about the New World Order

50:30.300 --> 50:32.800
and not so many books about Australian immigration.

50:32.800 --> 50:33.800
That sounds about right.

50:33.800 --> 50:37.320
Anyway, Dennis Cuddy is still active as a conspiracy weirdo to this day, and it appears

50:37.320 --> 50:40.800
that he's been pretty pro-Trump, which raises an interesting question about why he's not

50:40.800 --> 50:42.520
still a figure on Alex's show.

50:42.520 --> 50:46.160
I thought maybe they didn't hit it off, but they get along pretty well.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.160
Interesting.

50:47.160 --> 50:48.160
Yeah, I don't know.

50:48.160 --> 50:51.440
I don't know what happened, but he's not a name that I recognize from any of the present

50:51.440 --> 50:54.480
day sections that we've covered.

50:54.480 --> 50:57.000
Maybe he just got out of the game.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
No, he's still in the game.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.120
Maybe he got out of Alex's game.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.600
Maybe he got out of the heat, yeah.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.380
Maybe he's just like, Alex is an asshole.

51:03.380 --> 51:04.840
That's probably the case.

51:04.840 --> 51:08.720
Anyway, this guy's got an interesting strategy to convince people.

51:08.720 --> 51:11.840
I know you can't discriminate.

51:11.840 --> 51:16.480
If you're a university Ph.D. program, you can't discriminate based on religious beliefs

51:16.480 --> 51:22.840
or ideology, but could you be sneakily like, hey, what if you wanted to go on Infowars?

51:22.840 --> 51:24.080
Would you go on Infowars?

51:24.080 --> 51:27.120
And if the answer is yes, they're like, ha, caught you, no Ph.D.

51:27.120 --> 51:33.720
To be fair, it was 76 when he got his Ph.D. and Infowars did not exist at that point.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.640
Alex was two years old.

51:35.640 --> 51:38.680
Look, you can't litigate ex post facto.

51:38.680 --> 51:40.640
I've heard that from somewhere.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.840
So look, we want to give you this degree, but there's a two-year-old over in Dallas

51:44.840 --> 51:47.000
and he's going to do something real weird.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.760
Look, if the devil has been aware of Alex Jones from the beginning.

51:52.760 --> 51:53.760
So I don't know.

51:53.760 --> 51:58.280
Anyway, Dennis has got this interesting trick that he uses because he wants to cut through

51:58.280 --> 51:59.280
the bullshit.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.280
Oh boy.

52:00.280 --> 52:04.240
Like, if people don't agree with him, here's how he cuts through the bullshit.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.240
This is sneaky.

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
Let's hear it.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.480
How do we stop the New World Order?

52:07.480 --> 52:12.600
How do we educate the left and the right that they're really just part of a phony system?

52:12.600 --> 52:18.120
Well, the first thing, you have to crack through their predisposition to think you're a nut

52:18.120 --> 52:19.880
if you talk about conspiracy theories.

52:19.880 --> 52:25.160
And the best way to do that is, the way I do it is I set them up by saying, suppose

52:25.160 --> 52:29.640
I told you there was a power somewhere so complete, so pervasive, so interlocked, so

52:29.640 --> 52:33.280
watchful, you better not speak above your breath if you speak in condemnation of it.

52:33.280 --> 52:36.760
After they get finished laughing in my face for a while, I say, well, I didn't say that

52:36.760 --> 52:39.680
one of your heroes, Woodrow Wilson, said that.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.560
Now you've got the retention.

52:41.560 --> 52:45.120
First of all, I can't imagine how little I'd care about having a Woodrow Wilson quote

52:45.120 --> 52:46.120
snuck up on me.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.960
Oh no, my hero, Woodrow Wilson.

52:47.960 --> 52:51.920
Yeah, I think I would be like, boo!

52:51.920 --> 52:56.040
So secondly, and more importantly, what this guy's doing is misusing a quote from Wilson's

52:56.040 --> 52:58.280
Platform 1913.

52:58.280 --> 53:02.180
The full quote he's going from is, quote, since I entered politics, I've chiefly had

53:02.180 --> 53:04.680
men's views confided to me privately.

53:04.680 --> 53:08.000
Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.560
are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something.

53:10.560 --> 53:14.920
They know that there's a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked,

53:14.920 --> 53:18.800
so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak

53:18.800 --> 53:20.720
in condemnation of it.

53:20.720 --> 53:24.040
If you continue reading, it's super clear that what Wilson's talking about isn't a spooky

53:24.040 --> 53:29.480
cabal of globalists, but the completely unregulated nature of industry and how people who have

53:29.480 --> 53:33.160
already amassed a certain amount of power can use that to stomp out people who are just

53:33.160 --> 53:34.160
getting started.

53:34.160 --> 53:39.000
From a little later in the text, quote, and this is the country which has lifted to the

53:39.000 --> 53:43.580
admiration of the world its ideals of absolutely free opportunity, where no man is supposed

53:43.580 --> 53:47.720
to be under any limitation except the limitations of his character and his mind, where there's

53:47.720 --> 53:51.640
supposed to be no distinction of class, no distinction of blood, no distinction of social

53:51.640 --> 53:55.160
status, but where men win or lose by their merits.

53:55.160 --> 53:59.700
I lay it very close to my own conscience as a public man, whether we can any longer stand

53:59.700 --> 54:04.120
at our doors and welcome any newcomers upon these terms.

54:04.120 --> 54:07.040
American industry is not free, as once it was free.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.640
American enterprise is not free.

54:08.640 --> 54:13.020
The man with only a little capital is finding it harder to get into the field, more and

54:13.020 --> 54:15.840
more impossible to compete with the big fellow.

54:15.840 --> 54:16.840
Why?

54:16.840 --> 54:21.360
Because the laws of this country did not prevent the strong from crushing the weak.

54:21.360 --> 54:26.040
Antitrust issues were a really big topic of politics in the 1910s, and that's why it was

54:26.040 --> 54:27.520
a plank in Wilson's agenda.

54:27.520 --> 54:31.480
He was clearly in favor of taking power away from monopolies and giving a better chance

54:31.480 --> 54:35.320
to smaller, up-and-coming businesses, and that's what this passage from his platform

54:35.320 --> 54:36.500
is all about.

54:36.500 --> 54:40.160
If you just take a look at the section that Cuddy is reading out of context, it could

54:40.160 --> 54:44.120
sound like they were saying there was a group of villains running the world or whatever,

54:44.120 --> 54:47.280
but if you take it within its proper context, you read something very different.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.080
He's just in favor of regulation.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.080
I...

54:50.080 --> 54:51.540
Oh, boy.

54:51.540 --> 55:01.440
You know, a guy who says that, who also made the black servants in the White House hide

55:01.440 --> 55:05.960
it whenever he walked by because he didn't want to see them.

55:05.960 --> 55:06.960
Not cool.

55:06.960 --> 55:13.120
Maybe if you say that and do that, like, you gotta go back in time and kill this guy.

55:13.120 --> 55:17.000
Look, I'm not here to litigate Woodrow Wilson's career.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.680
I'm taking the text.

55:18.680 --> 55:19.760
No, no, no, totally.

55:19.760 --> 55:23.760
I just can't hear it in my head and know that at the same time without losing my mind.

55:23.760 --> 55:24.760
I understand it.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.880
That's why you're here, because that reaction is difficult to have.

55:26.880 --> 55:27.880
Yeah, it's very difficult.

55:27.880 --> 55:31.120
But the reason I'm here is to explain why this person is misusing a quote.

55:31.120 --> 55:32.120
I understand.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.120
We're a great team.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.120
Yes.

55:34.120 --> 55:38.960
And I don't know if I can accept that he doesn't understand that context.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.080
I find that difficult to believe.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.080
The Cuddy.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.080
Yes.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.080
Yeah.

55:45.080 --> 55:48.520
I find it difficult to believe that he would be able to read that quote, read further in

55:48.520 --> 55:51.720
the text, and not understand what this is about.

55:51.720 --> 55:57.640
Now, it's possible, and it's also possible that the depth of his research doesn't include

55:57.640 --> 56:00.040
the other paragraphs after this.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.040
Sure.

56:01.040 --> 56:04.920
I've seen this in some other text, in the same way that everybody in the right wing

56:04.920 --> 56:10.440
has not read Tragedy and Hope, they've only read stuff from like Skousen talking about

56:10.440 --> 56:11.440
Tragedy and Hope.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.440
Right, right, right, right.

56:12.440 --> 56:16.640
So it's possible that he has this second hand, this quote, and it sounds really good, and

56:16.640 --> 56:18.000
it's a way to freak normies out.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.440
Hey, check this out.

56:19.440 --> 56:24.000
But I don't know, I find it to be a problem for me to take him seriously.

56:24.000 --> 56:28.980
Anyway, they're talking, Alex and Cuddy, and one of the things I like is he's Dr. Cuddy,

56:28.980 --> 56:31.200
and that's Lisa Edelstein's character on House.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.200
Oh, okay.

56:32.200 --> 56:33.200
Yeah.

56:33.200 --> 56:34.200
All right.

56:34.200 --> 56:35.200
Mm-hmm.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.200
Okay.

56:36.200 --> 56:37.200
She's great.

56:37.200 --> 56:38.200
All right.

56:38.200 --> 56:39.200
Okay.

56:39.200 --> 56:45.320
So they're talking, and they get to a conversation about Bohemian Grove, and Alex has some more

56:45.320 --> 56:49.520
details about how unheroic his breaking in was.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.520
Okay.

56:50.520 --> 56:51.520
Let me bring this forward.

56:51.520 --> 56:53.080
Are you aware that I snuck into Bohemian Grove?

56:53.080 --> 56:55.640
Yes, sir, I've seen the video, very good.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.640
Well, I mean, I frankly couldn't believe it.

56:57.640 --> 57:02.120
I saw the news articles, the British media got me a map in, some of the code words from

57:02.120 --> 57:06.160
the spies inside, and I frankly believe I was actually allowed to sneak in there now

57:06.160 --> 57:09.720
that I look at it as part of a larger throw-it-in-our-face move.

57:09.720 --> 57:10.720
Oh.

57:10.720 --> 57:11.720
Okay.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.480
That certainly fits with, you know, like Ronson saying you were just allowed to walk in.

57:15.480 --> 57:16.480
Yeah.

57:16.480 --> 57:17.480
Huh.

57:17.480 --> 57:20.480
The story seems a little more dashing when he tells it now.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
Yeah.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.360
It's a little more humble back at this point.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.360
Interesting.

57:25.360 --> 57:26.360
Yep.

57:26.360 --> 57:31.080
Let me bring this mic down for this clip, because this pissed me off.

57:31.080 --> 57:34.600
So Alex is talking about Bohemian Grove, and he wants to bring up the satanic element of

57:34.600 --> 57:35.600
this.

57:35.600 --> 57:36.600
Sure.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
Right?

57:37.600 --> 57:39.280
You want to talk about their Satanists, and I'm like, hey, this is one of the big things

57:39.280 --> 57:40.840
I'm interested in 2003.

57:40.840 --> 57:41.840
Are you fighting the devil?

57:41.840 --> 57:42.840
Of course.

57:42.840 --> 57:43.840
We got to know.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.920
This pissed me off.

57:44.920 --> 57:50.960
How does the satanic element behind all this operate, you know, talk about the Illuminati,

57:50.960 --> 57:51.960
the history of this.

57:51.960 --> 57:53.960
Who are we really dealing with?

57:53.960 --> 57:57.840
Well, first, did you see any people running around naked there?

57:57.840 --> 58:00.000
It goes on for 15 days.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.800
I was there at the kickoff.

58:01.800 --> 58:04.880
David Gergen in the Washington Times said that they do indeed do that.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.880
Yeah.

58:05.880 --> 58:08.080
Spy Magazine admits that they ship in the male prostitutes.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.360
I didn't see that.

58:09.360 --> 58:12.040
I saw some weird behavior.

58:12.040 --> 58:16.460
I didn't show any, you know, I'm not going to go up and show old men and bank chairman

58:16.460 --> 58:17.460
with their.

58:17.460 --> 58:18.460
Well, I'm not going to.

58:18.460 --> 58:19.660
I saw some things.

58:19.660 --> 58:25.800
I saw mainly a strange urination ritual where two men walk up, pull their pants partially

58:25.800 --> 58:28.840
down and and then start urinating in front of each other.

58:28.840 --> 58:30.320
I didn't put that in the video.

58:30.320 --> 58:33.160
I'm guessing they were just drunk and they like peed on a bush.

58:33.160 --> 58:36.960
Yeah, that sounds more weird urination ritual.

58:36.960 --> 58:38.880
Ah, interesting.

58:38.880 --> 58:43.480
You know, I've come out of many a Cubs game before and thought, I got to get this weird

58:43.480 --> 58:45.880
urination ritual done real quick.

58:45.880 --> 58:47.760
Yeah, I've been to bonfire parties.

58:47.760 --> 58:49.880
They were just full of weird urination rituals.

58:49.880 --> 58:55.000
Hey guys, real quick, I'm going to take a walk over here and do my urination ritual

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
real quick.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Yeah, that's weird.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.440
But the thing that, the reason I'm pissed off by this is they don't get back to the

58:59.440 --> 59:00.440
initial question.

59:00.440 --> 59:03.080
Hey, they just get sidetracked by talking about peeing.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.680
It's like, God damn it.

59:04.680 --> 59:06.720
I wanted to know about the satanic element.

59:06.720 --> 59:08.380
That's why I'm, that's why I'm listening.

59:08.380 --> 59:13.140
It doesn't seem like it's that big of a deal if you're just going to get distracted with

59:13.140 --> 59:14.140
urination rituals.

59:14.140 --> 59:17.720
It's certainly not important enough to come back to immediately.

59:17.720 --> 59:24.080
So, um, this guy, Cuddy, um, prediction, uh, guy, he's a guy who knows things, he's read

59:24.080 --> 59:29.600
these documents and uh, boy, this, this, this, uh, take did not age well.

59:29.600 --> 59:35.720
The uh, the current situation with Iraq, what I tried to do there was say, uh, okay, if

59:35.720 --> 59:40.880
this power lead is in control of things and if there is a war, uh, military conflict in

59:40.880 --> 59:41.880
Iraq, what will happen?

59:41.880 --> 59:43.880
And I said, there's two possibilities.

59:43.880 --> 59:50.640
I said, if it's a staged war, it'll be over relatively soon, uh, with relatively few casualties,

59:50.640 --> 59:53.640
even from chemical or biological weapons.

59:53.640 --> 59:55.760
And that's basically what happened.

59:55.760 --> 59:59.080
So it's a staged war because it's over quick.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.760
You know, that's really comforting to know because I was worried that it was going to

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.720
blow up into a thing that destabilizes the entire world.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720
Yeah.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720
This is bad thinking.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.640
So his other possibility is thinking is what it is.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:16.540
His other possibility is that it's a real war and, but everything that's happened would

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:20.240
have happened differently if it was a real, it's like, this is just terrible.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240
Wow.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.240
Yeah.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.360
So that didn't like, it doesn't age well.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:30.480
Those who learn the past about Australian immigration are doomed to repeat the extra

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480
other past.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480
Yup.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480
Yeah.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.760
So, uh, one of Alex's big, uh, reasons to believe that 9-11 was an inside job, uh, is

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.080
that they were running a drill.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.080
Sure.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.080
Yeah.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080
Yeah.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080
Yeah.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080
Drills are very important to inside jobs.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.080
Yes.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080
Man.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.600
This, this made me laugh really hard because Cuddy accidentally punctures a giant hole

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.040
on that theory by trying to help Alex out.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.000
No one's asked any of these questions, have they?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.200
No one's asked why the AP reported that the CIA was doing a drill that morning of flying

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.200
jets in the buildings in New York and DC quote their cover for why NORAD stood down.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.840
Uh, yeah, and that, uh, the same outfit, uh, had a similar drill the year before and nobody

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:18.840
picked up on that either, but they had the drill that morning at that very time.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.640
That pause, that pause is great.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.240
That pause is staring daggers.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.640
That is a man who just got sliced to shreds with a glance.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:39.440
It's so important for the, uh, the theories surrounding the drills that they're not B

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.320
drills regularly or similar drills that have happened in the past.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.640
And they do it every year and nobody picked up on it, Dan.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.640
Ugh.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.320
Oh, so bright and cheery, he's like, I'm so helpful.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.080
I love moments like that because I do think that as much as, you know, there's still a

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:04.520
bunch of dumdums back then, there are people who are less on the same identical script.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.300
Like when you listen to these present day episodes, it'll be like Alex interviewing

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.160
his fucking lawyers who are doing yes and games with him.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:17.440
It's basically just not only that, but Alex, everyone kind of knows to not like puncture

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.460
anything or not to say anything that could be like, well, that's a reason why this doesn't

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.460
make sense.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:26.240
And in this moment, that guy has just thought, thought that added to the conspiracy and in

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.280
fact it actually blows it two shreds.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280
Makes it look bad.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.760
He was like a retriever bringing you the paper after stepping in a pile of shit, walking

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.760
through your door.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760
And he's like, I'm so good.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.640
See, I brought you the paper and you're like, you, oh shit.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:48.120
So earlier Jordan, we learned that Dennis Miller is a big time socialist, huge socialist.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.260
But now it is time to play the game show that is taking the country by storm.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:57.760
Who is an ultra commie?

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760
Every episode.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.880
I mean, at this point it's almost like Dennis Hastert.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880
I don't know.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.880
It could be anybody.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.840
Every episode so far in 2003, I think we've had Alex out somebody.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.040
There's a new ultra commie.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040
That's true.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040
That's true.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040
So who's it going to be this time?

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040
They're dropping like flies.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.040
You think it's Hastert?

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.040
No, I'm going to go with Condoleezza Rice.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040
Interesting.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.160
Uh, you were starting out a little earlier with a, uh, development, a discussion on,

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160
um, Mr. Crystal.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.720
I don't know if you quite got to it.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.120
I'd like to hear the rest of what you were going to tell us about Mr. Crystal.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120
Ultra commie.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120
Don't tell me.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120
Don't tell me.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120
It's Billy Crystal.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120
Ultra commie.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.120
All right.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.760
So yeah, we've got, uh, Michael Savage, Bill Crystal.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.400
That is what happens.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.240
That is what happens when you don't find Curly's gold.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240
All right.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.760
You become an ultra commie because it's clear that the ruling class has taken the gold before

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760
you got there.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760
Wrong.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:56.120
That's the rule.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:02.480
So earlier, um, we got distracted by, uh, urination rituals when Alex was about to talk

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.280
about the satanic element.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.280
Sure.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.800
This is like a prank on me.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.600
I swear to God.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.820
If they can be industrialized as snow factories, people are going to accept being prison guards

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:15.820
as their job.

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.920
They're going to accept being tattletale squads.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.480
They're going to accept this.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:24.600
They say America is going to be a police state enslavement grid that produces propaganda

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600
for the world.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.920
They said that's what America will be.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:39.520
The armpit of Satan literally, uh, am I on, Oh my God.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.520
Okay.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.440
Uh, Alex's mic went off in the middle of him saying Satan literally.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:48.720
I know it is, it is a little bit of a tease.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.640
It's like, this isn't admissible.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.640
He could have said anything.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:57.160
He could have said anything, but you're like, he was going to say literally, literally.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.160
And you know what that means.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.160
I can't make this up.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160
I'm going back into the past.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:09.480
I've been intrigued to see if he thinks that Satan is literal back then.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:16.800
His mic goes off in the middle of saying the word literal.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.760
Oh dude, you're a witch.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.760
It is.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760
You're a witch.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.880
It's becoming troubling to me.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.600
The level of these coincidences.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600
It is dangerous.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600
Yeah.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.840
But it is also pretty funny that his mic just went off and his guest is like, what?

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840
What's going on?

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:37.160
The only word that we needed to hear is the one word.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.400
And I needed him to expound on it more.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.400
You know?

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.400
And then Mike's off.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400
There we go.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.340
Anyway, this is a catastrophic problem that he's having.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:49.720
And economics and your job, and you're willing to have lower wages becomes more important

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.760
to you than the old fashioned patriotism.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:02.240
Thank you for joining us.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.240
Thanks for joining us, Dr. Cutty.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.760
We'll be right back, folks.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.760
Thank you.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.760
Stay with us.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.760
Who boy.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.760
Oh man.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.760
Oh man.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:16.760
Something's bad.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760
Yeah, that's not good.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760
Yeah.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760
It is.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.440
I mean, this does screw up my conspiracy theory to know that this kind of thing happens every

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.440
year.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.240
That does, it does bother.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.960
It makes me worry.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960
I don't know.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960
I can't imagine.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:35.040
I just have to assume that it's like, well, it's 2003, he had bad tech back then.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.040
Yeah.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.440
But he kind of understands that he has bad tech back then.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.440
Yeah.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.440
He doesn't expect anything else.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.440
Sure.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.360
So like one of the things that I think is pretty cool about 2003 is like, that's a big

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360
problem.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360
Yeah.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.480
You're on the radio, your mics just go completely out, your guest is left to try and tread water

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.960
on his own, and then you got to go out to break.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.960
Yeah.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.920
And Alex deals with it gracefully.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:04.360
I'm down here in Austin, Texas, and we're hooked up with the folks at Genesis, and rarely

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.600
does my little stereo line cut out to them right there at the end.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.160
It was cutting basically bring us out of break and I barely got back on in time to take us

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.680
out of that little segment there, but good job getting me hooked back up.

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.200
A lot of weird electronic stuff on my end.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.000
We got a lot of callers and I want to go to your calls.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.320
There's no like the globalists are trying to take us off air because we're too dangerous.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.160
There's no freaking out and leaving.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.160
He's laughing.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160
You know, it's like, I got a tech problem.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.160
Yeah.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.760
I'm not a normal person responding to difficulties that would be expected.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.880
That's true.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.880
That is true.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:47.360
Now, admittedly, I will say that there is, that would give me certain justification for

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:55.720
a larger reaction if, uh, say I'm having the same problems after spending $60 billion on

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720
a studio.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.040
You know, like if you're still having those problems, you should be angrier than if you

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.680
have shitty tech.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.680
Yeah.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:09.600
No, I mean, it does make sense because then you really can't blame it at all on the tech.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.120
No, but it is on you.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.520
It is definitely on you because you have not solved the problem for sure.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.760
That outbursts that we see in the present day.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760
It still is.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.000
It should be directed inwards as opposed to screaming at the staff and the, uh, the, uh,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
the audience.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yes, definitely.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.860
I just like, I just prefer to see this like, cause it's, it's not like a child lashing

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.160
out, uh, uh, constantly.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:36.760
It's like, you have a huge problem that happens on your show and you're able to laugh and

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:37.760
come back from break.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:38.760
Sure.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.640
Like, ah, good on him being able to take us out to break and handle it, you know, Hey,

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.840
you know, sometimes Genesis feed goes down.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.840
What are you going to do?

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840
Sure.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.840
Let's go to the call.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.840
Sure.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840
Yeah.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.720
I mean, everybody likes the VH1 part of behind the music where there are the, they're on

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.160
their meteoric rise, but they're just beginning and they're playing their show at the dumb

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.240
bar down the street and little did everybody know what he was going to do.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.640
So, uh, yeah, this is fun to see.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:09.960
So Alex gets to talk in a more about, uh, the democratization in Iraq and the government

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960
that is coming in.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.840
It's going to be a good one.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.920
Well, we know from history that, uh, again, very shortly after this episode, uh, de-bathification

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.920
happened.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.920
It was a good idea.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:28.080
Iraq, US reconstructing bath units, the most vicious bath CIA torturers, those trained

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.520
in the U S all of Saddam's top henchmen, except for a few titular head, uh, go sacrificial

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.560
lambs, uh, are going to be put back in control.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.080
So wrong.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.080
He's wrong.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.080
Wrong about that.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.080
Oh boy.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.080
Quite wrong.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.080
Yeah.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.960
So, um, it's, it's just interesting that he's, he's consistently going down this road and

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:52.480
it does set up an like a weird, I don't know what's going to happen as you know, like May

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480
comes to an end.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480
May continues.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.480
Like, how's he going to navigate that territory?

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:05.880
It is ironic even that it is almost his exact opinion of the bath that was echoed in American

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:12.680
policy while he's criticizing them in the idea that they would do the opposite of what

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680
they believe.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.680
Yeah.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.680
Yeah.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.680
It is strange because the way he's presenting things, he doesn't really have a good leg

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.440
to stand on to be opposed to de-bathification.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.440
Right.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.440
Right.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.440
Right.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.600
Once it comes along.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.600
Exactly.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.320
And I don't think he'll be willing to be strongly in favor.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.800
Certainly as things go along, I don't think he'll, he'll own the consequences.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.560
It didn't, it didn't go well.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.560
No.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.560
Yeah.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.460
So, uh, I would say that listening to this episode, there is very little, um, in terms

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.460
of news stories.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:48.460
Sure.

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:52.360
There is a little bit of like a couple of headlines thrown out here and there.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.960
He talks a lot about Richard Pearl, who he calls the Prince of Darkness.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960
Sure.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.280
I think there's, he's obsessed with that dude because I've heard him talk about that dude

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.520
in the present day.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520
Really?

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520
Yes.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520
Constantly.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.520
20 years.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.600
When he gets drunk on like a Rogan's show and stuff, he'll talk about Richard Pearl,

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600
the Prince of Darkness.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.240
He would go around, he'd go around at parties and tell women that like he kills people because

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.360
he thinks it's hot.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.680
He thinks that that'll get him aroused and stuff.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680
Okay.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.480
He won't be like, he brings up this dude a lot.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480
All right.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.160
Anyway, it's, there's not a whole lot.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.920
I do like a lifelong grudge.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.920
That's admirable.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:27.920
Yeah.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.920
There's something almost noble about that.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.560
Do you think 15 years from now he's not going to be yelling about Stelter?

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.560
Yeah.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.560
That's true.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.200
So, uh, Alex gets to the end of the show and he realizes, man, I didn't, I missed some

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200
stuff.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.320
Oh, there was so much news we didn't get to.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.800
More and more cities are passing pro bill of rights resolutions.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.400
A lot of conservative cities are doing it.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.000
I've got one on info wars.com.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.600
You ought to get to your city council or county commissioners and the man they pass it.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.640
So important to reaffirm the bill of rights.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.640
They can claim.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.640
We don't have any rights.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640
They're still God given.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:06.920
We still have them in the Anton LaVey, Christian conservative, Neo con, the commie cons will

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.800
be resisted, will be exposed with their little liberal buddies, totally staged.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.120
The people are waking up, millions of beginning to fight.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.680
You cannot stop us all.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.920
So have no fear.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.160
We shall prevail.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.800
Good God that was uninspired.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.800
Oh boy.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800
That was boring.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800
We shall prevail.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800
Let's go on guys.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.680
This is before he started doing his Churchill impression.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.400
Hey, now we shall fight them on the sheet.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.080
We're going to, okay guys, we got to get up.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.080
Yeah.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.040
So Alex, Alex comes to the end of the show and realizes that he didn't cover most of

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.060
the news as opposed to it happening an hour before the show ends.

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:49.960
And then still no more news is covered.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.560
Um, but yeah, he has, he's got a minute and what he wants to really hit on is there are

01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:00.120
people reaffirming the bill of rights, which is very meaningful and important.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.520
It's not, this is just the same thing as in 2009, all the 10th amendment resolutions and

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520
stuff.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.520
It's like, yes.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.520
Okay.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:12.760
We have to have the state houses pass these things that say the same thing as the constitution.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.480
Like, I don't know, man, it's, it's.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.880
What, to what extent do they describe God given rights?

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:31.920
You know, like, give me a biblical explanation of what rights God specifically gives us.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.960
Because I don't recall him writing the goddamn bill of rights.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.360
I don't know if it's derived directly from anything in the Bible, but this is, this is

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.320
a pretty standard element of anti-communism.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.560
No, of course.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:52.440
They have this idea that communism seeks to outlaw religion and get rid of religion and

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:59.520
in doing so you get rid of God and if you get rid of God, then there's no more justification

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.280
for why people have rights because they're endowed by the creator.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.480
So therefore now you have no rights.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480
Sure.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:12.280
Communism gets rid of God, which gets rid of rights, which makes you all slaves.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.720
That's where the important hinge is for the God given rights aspect.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.720
Right.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720
No, no, I understand.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.440
I just, I just feel like if you want to win in the marketplace of ideas, you should kind

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.760
of write down what rights you're peddling.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760
Well, they did.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.440
And we'll compare them to the other thing.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.440
They did.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.160
It's in the Declaration of Independence, Constitution.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.560
It's those rights.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.440
Those aren't rights that are given by the Constitution, those are God given rights that

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.040
are protected by the Constitution.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.000
Oh, oh, so it's even dumber than I thought it was.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Sort of.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Right.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.520
It's the same kind of, I don't know, it's an argument that you can run into a lot.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:51.920
It's the notion of like, does all morality stem from religion?

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920
Sure.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.920
Sure.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.920
Is ethics possible outside?

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:55.920
Naturally.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.920
And I would argue that it is.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.920
Well, yeah, obviously.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.920
We have several thousand years.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.120
But there are those who think that no, morality and ethics are impossible outside of a religious

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.120
framework.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.120
Right.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:10.120
And I don't know, I don't buy into that, but that seems to be kind of a kernel at the base

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.120
of their idea, like Alex and a lot of his associates' conception of rights.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:18.360
No, I just didn't, I didn't quite understand what they were talking about.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:23.440
Because generally speaking, whenever people start talking about God, I appreciate it if

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.920
they have some sort of biblical basis for it.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
It's just guns.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:28.800
Yeah, it does sound like it's just guns.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.100
Man, people love their guns.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.960
It was the 11th commandment.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:39.200
It's just, there's just, man, guns aren't, oh.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.440
The 11th commandment was, guns, baby!

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.680
Guns, guns, guns, baby!

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680
Yep.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:52.720
And Jesus said to, at the last, one of you will betray me before the cock, with a fucking

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.720
shotgun!

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:59.240
So, we come to the end of this exploration of back in 18 years ago today.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.000
18 years ago today.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.360
What an interesting glimpse.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.100
This very night, 18 years ago.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.740
Such wrong ideas about what was gonna happen.

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.800
Such misguided nonsense.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.020
Not good.

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.860
A weirdo presented as an expert.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:14.860
That's pretty normal.

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.860
Yeah, that's fair.

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:19.920
And more evidence that Alex should sue Joe Rogan for using the word powerful.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920
I think it's trademarked.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.320
Yeah, I don't know.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.200
I mean, I think you could get a, it'd be tough, though, to win a lawsuit whenever you've got

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.260
that, oh, Alex just said, we're gonna play that clip of Alex saying he's gonna gut him

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.360
like a pig, you know, like, how are you gonna win that kind of lawsuit?

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.360
Free speech, man.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.360
Ah, that's fair.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:45.760
I'm infuriated by the, going to urination talk and the mic's cutting out right around

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.080
when Satan was coming up.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.800
It's gonna be the armpit of Satan.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.760
I take that personally, a little bit.

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760
It's very funny.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:58.800
But I'm excited to see if the next couple episodes have anything that'll help clarify

01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800
positions.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.920
It'd be more funny if somebody actually cut off the mic whenever he was about to say,

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.280
literally like, we can't have that out there, boom, red button.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.600
Fred Anderson dives on that.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.200
Red button, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.800
He's up in Minnesota listening to The Feed's comic.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.000
I've never seen anybody move that fast.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Yeah.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
We'll find out more in the future, but until next time, Jordan, we have a website.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
We do have a website.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.600
Yes, we are also on Twitter.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.600
We are on Twitter.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.600

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.600
I go to bed.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.600
Jordan.

We are Facebook.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.320
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.320
doing God's work.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.320
Yep, we'll be back.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.240
But until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.600
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.120
And now, here comes the sex robots.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.440
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.440
Thanks for holding.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.440
Hello, Alex.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.440
I'm a first-time caller.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.440
I'm a huge fan.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.440
I love your work.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:18:12.400
