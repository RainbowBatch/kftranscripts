00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys. Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight. I'm Dan.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Jordan.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're a couple dudes. Let's sit around, drink novelty, worship Celine.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yep, oh boy.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're going to struggle with this for a while.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We should have added this earlier on, maybe in our 300th episode, and then we'd be practiced by now.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I just need to also be more mindful of it.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
True, true.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When I'm starting the episode, just remember, novelty beverage is out, worship Celine in.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Right. I mean, when you're starting any religion, you want to be more mindful.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sure.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I think that's the point.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There needs to be some intention to it, which we're failing.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sure, sure. Yeah.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, that would be our religion.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Eh, came back to life, who gives a shit? Whatever.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Live your own way.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah. So Jordan, how are you doing?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm doing well, Dan. I have a quick question for you.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Sure.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What is your bright spot today?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My bright spot today is actually, I think, okay, so you know how like in school you'd be like,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
when am I ever going to need to use this?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sure.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You talk about like math or anything.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sure, sure.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I sometimes feel that way about this podcast.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Like I learn stuff and I'm like, when am I ever going to need to do this?

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Fair, fair.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I spend a lot of time learning things that will never, ever come up in anyone's daily life.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
No, no, no. I think you're going to have a lot of natural sounding conversations that just end up in this information.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I had a moment where it actually came into play.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh shit.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And it felt really good.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, what happened?

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So I was taking a Lyft ride from coming home and the guy, it was a very nice conversation.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Nothing against this guy.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But we were talking about some of the like difficulties of the COVID year and all this.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And the conversation veered into talking about like public debt.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sure, sure.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And the deficit.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Sure.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so this guy was saying that-

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The Fed was started by three senators.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, no, no, no.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing that hyper specific.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Not there.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Just that like China owns half our debt.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh yeah.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And without even missing a beat, I was like, that's not true.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And he's like, yeah, they own a lot.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm like, they own a bit, but not nearly that much.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've looked into this.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's mostly stuff we owe ourselves.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Listen, sir, sir, I am one of the few people who, when you hear I've looked into this,

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you fucking listen.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
China owns a lot of debt.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Nope.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Nope.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Lyft ride over.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And you jumped out the window.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Guy was very nice and I didn't like want to shame him or be a dick about it or anything.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No, of course not.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But it was a rare occasion where it was like, ha ha ha.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Not going to back down on this one.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is the hill I die on.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So how about you?

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's your bright spot?

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've been to my first Cubs game in two years, Dan.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why was that?

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why was that?

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why was what, Dan?

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't make me do this.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Happy birthday, Jordan.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thanks, Dan.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Fine.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It was your birthday this weekend.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It was my birthday this weekend.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Happy birthday.

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I went to the game.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It was fantastic.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,500
I have a very fun story that is going to sound self-aggrandizing at first, but it is very

97
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,800
much not about that.

98
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,000
Frank Rizzo said you had the best arm in the game.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If only.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If only, Dan.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is that his first name?

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Anthony Rizzo.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Anthony Rizzo.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Who's Frank Rizzo?

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Frank Rizzo is a guy.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Who is Frank Rizzo?

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Character or something?

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, I think so.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Anyway, keep going.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah.

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Anyways, everybody was socially distanced in the park.

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,480
It was good stuff, and row behind us about 10 seats away, there was this dude who showed

113
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,640
up wearing a goddamn t-shirt.

114
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:36,560
It was a nice day, but at Wrigley, whatever it is outside, it is 20 degrees lower than

115
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
that.

116
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Sure.

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
On the thing.

118
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,660
This guy is absolutely freezing, and then the sun goes behind the clouds, and everybody

119
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,800
is freezing.

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,820
Everybody is curled up, and I keep turning and looking back at this fucking guy with

121
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,840
his bare sleeves.

122
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,280
I'm losing my arm.

123
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
I'm losing my mind, right?

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
I have to go.

125
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,360
I can't do this anymore.

126
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,160
So I go and I buy him a fucking blanket.

127
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,960
I have to.

128
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
This is not me being generous.

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,160
This is me like, I can't watch this fucking game unless you do something.

130
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,600
So it's either you get a blanket, or I ask them to make you leave.

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Those are your options.

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Blanket it is.

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
It's not a self-aggrandizing story at all.

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
You got to buy him a Snuggie.

135
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
That's basically what it was.

136
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,720
So it turns out Frank Rizzo was the racist mayor of Philadelphia.

137
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
He was a notorious-

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
That's why I remember the name!

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Yeah, he's a piece of shit!

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm looking at his Wikipedia page here, and as mayor, Rizzo was a strong opponent of desegregation

141
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,940
in Philadelphia schools, and prevented the construction of public housing in majority

142
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,480
white neighborhoods.

143
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,160
While running for a third term, Rizzo urged supporters to quote, vote white.

144
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,360
You know, I think that says a lot about us, that the first Rizzos that come to mind are

145
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,160
in your situation, anti-communist nightmares!

146
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
And in mine.

147
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,280
Well, also Ratso Rizzo, wasn't he a Muppet?

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Ratso was great.

149
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,840
Anyway, Jordan, today we have a prison day episode to go over, we're going to be talking

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,640
about- our last episode was May 7th, 2003.

151
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Correct.

152
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,320
Now today we're going to be talking about May 6th and 7th, 2021.

153
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Blackjack.

154
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,600
I think we both stopped for a second to see if the other would do it first!

155
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,480
What is wrong with us?

156
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,880
Why can't we do our own bits?

157
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,520
Well that's like, you know, when you get to the door at the same time with somebody who's

158
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
holding the door for who.

159
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,640
It was like I was letting you go, excuse me sir, after you.

160
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,880
This is interesting, it's a fun stretch of time and I'm excited to get into it.

161
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,680
But before we do, Jordan, we've got a wonk and a technocrat to give a shout out to.

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,320
First, a wonk, thank you so much, Marnix!

163
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,440
You're now a policy wonk.

164
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm a policy wonk!

165
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Thank you Marnix!

166
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,120
And technocrat, Dirk Gently's cat, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

167
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,440
I'm a policy wonk.

168
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew.

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

170
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,440
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

171
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's just get down to business.

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

173
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,000
Why you pimps so good?

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,640
My neck is freakishly large.

175
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,160
I declare info war on you.

176
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Dirk Gently's cat would also like to say happy birthday to Will S.

177
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
Ooh, happy birthday Will S.

178
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,480
So Dirk, you might notice there's a few, only a few policy wonks.

179
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
It's a bit shorter.

180
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,560
Yeah, and that's because in honor of your birthday, we have some birthday shout outs.

181
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Okay, okay, alright, we're doing May all at once.

182
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,120
Not all of May, but it turns out there's a cluster right around here that I think it's

183
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,440
because of you.

184
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Naturally.

185
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,000
So, Steven, happy birthday from Keith, that was over the weekend on the 9th, the 9th.

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Happy birthday.

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Day after your birthday.

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sunday.

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, come on, don't give people...

190
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,280
Don't give people detailed information.

191
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,680
My passwords aren't that strong.

192
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Oh no.

193
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,080
You might want to rethink those.

194
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,400
So also, Corinna, happy birthday, that's coming up on the 11th, so coming up in the middle

195
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
of this week.

196
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Happy birthday, Corinna.

197
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,800
And Tom, from his brother, Megaron.

198
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,720
He's just ten rons put together into one giant ron, naturally.

199
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,240
Is that how it works with the Queen's measurements?

200
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I know, do you mean like he's ten stone?

201
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Metric?

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,760
Couldn't come up with the word metric?

203
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,520
I was going to go with Power Rangers, he's a megazord.

204
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Okay.

205
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,960
And that is also on the 11th, happy birthday, Tom from Megaron.

206
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,000
Also, we have something that I missed in the mailbag last time we got together, so this

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,160
was something that I actually had on the list that I was going to bring up last time, but

208
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,440
I had forgotten the note in the other room, and this note is too good not to share with

209
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
the world.

210
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,760
Dear Dan and Jordan, the Society for the Preservation of Raptor Royalty have determined that I am

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,640
no longer fit to be regent for this raptor princess, as I have been traveling and moving

212
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,400
too much to keep her safe.

213
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Dan, I hope she doesn't eat your chocolate.

214
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,240
Jordan, I hope Dan doesn't eat your chocolate.

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
Thank you so much for your wonderful podcast and for the cool community on Facebook.

216
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:19,520
You guys help me stay sane, happy euphoria chocolating, I think, euphoric chocolating.

217
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,600
From Karen C, so this ceramic raptor princess is just the coolest thing.

218
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,400
I have to assume that Karen found this at like a thrift store or something, but it is

219
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
just amazing.

220
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
It's so cool.

221
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm going to post a picture of this on...

222
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,880
It's really kind of, it looks like it was made with, somebody made it and they were

223
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,840
like, this is going to come in handy 20 or 30 years from now.

224
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
20 or 30?

225
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,520
This looks like it's from the 20s.

226
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,080
It does kind of look, wow, that is old.

227
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

228
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Thank you so much.

229
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,800
Also, this was the package that came with all the candy that was marked Dan stop opening

230
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Jordan's candy.

231
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
That was the best.

232
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Yeah.

233
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
That was the best.

234
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,840
There was some candy and I was like, Dan, you can't eat this candy.

235
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
No.

236
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,720
It was the package that had a bunch of points.

237
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
You opened it.

238
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
So why don't you describe it?

239
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,280
That was the best part of this.

240
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
The first message, it was wrapped really, really heavily.

241
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,280
And the first message was like, Dan, this is Jordan's candy.

242
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Don't eat it.

243
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,960
And you just gave it to me from there.

244
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,200
So I took it home and I started trying to unwrap it.

245
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
The record should show that I did follow the instructions.

246
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,880
Yes, that's important because there were further instructions as you opened it up.

247
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,080
Down on the paper was written like, Dan, if you've made it this far, you need to stop.

248
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,880
And then still further was like, Dan, you've stolen Jordan's candy at this point.

249
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
It was just guilt.

250
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
It was fantastic.

251
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,800
I can't imagine how ashamed I would be if I saw those notes.

252
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,280
If you saw the second note, that was the best part.

253
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,360
The best part was I was like, God damn it.

254
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,720
If Dan had seen the second note, it would have been just, he would have spent two days

255
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,440
thinking about how he's the person who made it to the second note.

256
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,600
I feel like it's a test I didn't know I had passed.

257
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Yes, you passed it.

258
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
So that's great.

259
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Thank you so much, Karen.

260
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,560
That was a fun insult, I guess.

261
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,160
No, I think it was a test and you passed it and you're now King Arthur?

262
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,360
And the raptor princess will be well taken care of on our shelf of curiosities.

263
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,080
So Jordan, May 6th and 7th, I should say that this is a little fun for me.

264
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,920
There's actually, I mean, granted, it is like I brought up, like we're just anti-vax bullshit.

265
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Right, right, right.

266
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Whatever.

267
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,600
But there's a specific in this episode that allowed me to dig in a little bit and I enjoyed

268
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
that.

269
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Excellent.

270
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
So here's an out of context drop from today's show.

271
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
All right.

272
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Shut up, Jones.

273
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Okay.

274
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Might be able to use that quite a bit in the future.

275
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,580
I would stick with that one.

276
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,580
So here we go.

277
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,400
Alex is starting out this May 6th show and there's, see if you can think of a children's

278
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,880
story that comes to mind when you hear this.

279
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Okay.

280
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,520
The information I got before the broadcast started, dovetailed with all the major research,

281
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,200
scores of top scientists in other major studies.

282
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:12,000
But when I read the study from an extremely prestigious viral research institute at the

283
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,600
University of Texas, Galveston, where they do level four bio weapons research, I was

284
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,120
completely blown away.

285
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,240
And quite frankly, had trouble even being on air at this point.

286
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,640
This audience is millions of people.

287
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
You're incredible.

288
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
You're amazing.

289
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,080
But I've learned how the paradox works.

290
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:38,280
But I said, I have total proof that they knew that the COVID-19 vaccines, both mRNA and

291
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,600
virus vector delivery systems.

292
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,200
So both the Moderna, the Pfizer mRNA, and then the AstraZeneca and J and J shots, the

293
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:56,720
two different classes in the main literature warns that it causes massive auto-immune response

294
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,040
in the brain, the heart, and in the cardiovascular system, and that they recommend it not be

295
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,760
done because it caused massive death in the lab animals.

296
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,800
If I had that info, which I do, and I cover it here on air, it just gets lost in the background

297
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
noise.

298
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,280
But if I built it up and said, oh, this Saturday, I'm going to do a special show for three hours,

299
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,960
commercial free, everybody tune in, we would have millions and millions of people that

300
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,360
tuned in specifically for that information.

301
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,840
They would take it very seriously, like they were at a restaurant waiting for a big, nice

302
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,000
plate of food to come out, devour it, and then share it with others mentally.

303
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,480
And that's basically where we are.

304
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,640
Also, this audience is incredibly influential.

305
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,620
A lot of important people listen, but this is at this point, I should probably just go

306
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,320
off air and, or have Owen Schroyer come in and do a great job hosting, and just go show

307
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
this document.

308
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
That's definitely fiction.

309
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah.

310
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,080
So I just keep hearing the boy who cried wolf here.

311
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,080
This is a guy who's like, I have said that I have solved every problem too many times,

312
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,360
and now it's just background dressing.

313
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Can't really pull this off.

314
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
People don't get excited anymore.

315
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Not really doing it.

316
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,800
And now the only way for me to escalate things is to do a show on my day off, because that

317
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,680
makes it look like I'm serious.

318
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I guess.

319
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,200
And, oh God, Diminishing Returns, oh no.

320
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,280
It's almost as if there was some sort of law that somebody wrote about Diminishing Returns.

321
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,240
Also, I don't remember if I pulled a clip of this, but later in the show, so Alex is

322
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,920
saying that he's going to have to come back on Saturday to cover this thing, this mega

323
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,120
bombshell because it's the only way he can get attention.

324
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Can't not.

325
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,160
He does realize, ah shit, I'm supposed to take my daughter fishing on Saturday.

326
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,320
So he gets a pail of God and he's like, maybe I'll do it on Sunday, I don't know.

327
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,600
This, this man is truly the tip of the spear.

328
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes.

329
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Tireless.

330
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,680
The study that Alex is referring to is from 2012, and honestly, he's messing up some details,

331
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,440
but he's more right than he usually is here.

332
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Interesting.

333
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,140
Granted, this is a study about SARS, not SARS-CoV-2, but in terms of the level I'm used to him

334
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,480
making things up, I was surprised to open the study and see this in the conclusion section.

335
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,040
Quote, these SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection

336
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
with SARS-CoV.

337
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,160
However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrences of TH2 type immunopathology

338
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,400
suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV compounds was induced.

339
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,960
Caution in proceeding to application of SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.

340
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,020
That's pretty interesting.

341
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,600
And on its own, it sounds pretty scary.

342
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,820
Like the idea of making a coronavirus vaccine for humans is something that shouldn't be

343
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
done.

344
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,960
But it's pretty important to recognize that this is a part of medical literature history,

345
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,100
and that's not a static thing.

346
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,520
This probably doesn't need to be said, but changes have been made since 2012.

347
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,080
Additionally, the circumstances were different with a worldwide outbreak happening now creating

348
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,020
necessity, which of course is the mother of invention.

349
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,920
You can find some discussion of this very study Alex is referencing in more detailed

350
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,920
write-ups about the path that research has taken in terms of developing a coronavirus

351
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,600
vaccine going through SARS, MERS, and now SARS-CoV-2.

352
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,200
If Alex is just looking for flashy ways to smear science, he could find all sorts of

353
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,520
studies from the past that have shown difficulties with vaccine development, but that game relies

354
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,760
on pretending that people don't learn from these studies and then adjust their approaches.

355
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,040
One important thing to recognize is that the study that Alex is referring to, which you

356
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,360
can find by googling the title, Immunization with SARS Coronavirus Vaccines Leads to Pulmonary

357
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,440
Immunopathology on Challenge with the SARS Virus.

358
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
That's the title of it.

359
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,360
If you look for it, it's about completely different vaccines than the ones that have

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,560
been developed in response to COVID.

361
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,080
If you just read the first few pages of the study, you see that the vaccines that were

362
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,240
tested in this were two varieties.

363
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,660
They were inactivated whole virus vaccines or virus-like particle vaccines.

364
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,480
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based vaccines which work entirely differently than

365
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,680
either of the types in this study, so there's no direct relevance between the shots and

366
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,520
this study at all.

367
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,200
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, which is fairly similar to the virus-like

368
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,920
particle approach, but with a very important distinction.

369
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,880
The virus-like particle vaccines in the study use the structural elements of SARS devoid

370
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,000
of any viral genomes to trigger an immune response in people, whereas the J&J vaccine

371
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,740
uses a non-infectious virus to create the spike protein of COVID, which then teaches

372
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,760
our body to recognize that specific spike protein and fight it.

373
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,160
The point here is that this study Alex is covering is not a bombshell.

374
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,880
It does not require coming in on Saturday, but it does have a couple of good buzzwords

375
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,460
that jump off the page, and if you don't pay too much attention, it can kind of look like

376
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,740
it supports its narratives, Alex's narratives, but it's all bullshit.

377
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:58,680
This is going to be one of the things that he talks about almost exclusively, and it's

378
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,880
amazing to see how much he just makes up.

379
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,320
He's just making shit up.

380
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
It's amazing.

381
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:12,880
And look, okay, you can tell me the challenges and the things that were wrong in 2012, right?

382
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,520
But if you tell me that they're the same now, how many iPhones was that a go?

383
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,960
Was that, wait, what was that?

384
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,120
Was that the iPhone 4 years?

385
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,540
We're better than that now.

386
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,720
People were still talking about the Mayan calendar.

387
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Exactly.

388
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Yeah, we're fine, okay?

389
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,980
Don't tell me that in 2012, oh, in 2012, they had trouble making a vaccine.

390
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,160
So we should stop.

391
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,480
Well, there's a lot of variables that go into it and actually color the progression of the

392
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
vaccine's development.

393
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Totally.

394
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,880
And some of that we'll discuss a little bit later, but look, dude, Alex found out about

395
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,560
this and he is fucking mad.

396
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,920
This could save hundreds of millions, if not billions of people.

397
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,720
I thought it was over for humanity, again.

398
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm unable to continue the broadcast at this point.

399
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,760
This is not a drama.

400
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I just can't do it.

401
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,480
I was already doing too much this morning on other big subjects and then I got blindsided

402
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:20,620
by this and I'm in a controlled rage right now and I've got to take some time off, so

403
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,620
that's just the way it is.

404
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,100
I don't even know if I'm coming back anymore.

405
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,680
Maybe they need to kill everybody because the public doesn't care.

406
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Maybe you deserve to die.

407
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Okay.

408
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,040
It was at this point that I suspected Alex was in a bad mood about something.

409
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,640
Maybe something in his personal life was not exactly to his liking.

410
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,880
Why are so many people willing to follow somebody that publicly pouts like a whiny baby?

411
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
What are you talking about?

412
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Jordan.

413
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Maybe you all should just die.

414
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Jordan.

415
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Great.

416
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Yes.

417
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
We want you to lead the fucking resistance.

418
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,400
Jordan, this isn't a drama.

419
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,160
Jordan brought this study to his attention when he had already done so much work and

420
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,360
now everyone's got to die.

421
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:12,520
I just don't remember fucking Che Guevara in the middle of the revolution just being

422
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
like, you know what guys?

423
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Fine.

424
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
I just don't even, no, no, no.

425
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
I just don't even care anymore.

426
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
I don't even want to lead this revolution.

427
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
I'm sick of this.

428
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Yeah.

429
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm sick of this.

430
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
To quote Castro, wah.

431
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Yeah.

432
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Yeah.

433
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Jesus.

434
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Yep.

435
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,980
I mean, folks wants to protest about this study, man.

436
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,360
He wants to get out there and bullhorn like his roots.

437
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,480
Like he wants to get back to who he was in waking life.

438
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,600
That image of a guy driving around red in the face.

439
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Hero.

440
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,840
There's no doubt about this as a mass kill operation.

441
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
No doubt.

442
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,320
Maybe we should all go protest at Dell Children's Hospital or maybe go protest at the FBI in

443
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
North Austin.

444
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,560
I mean, I don't know what you do.

445
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,960
I mean, to draw attention and bullhorn here is the university of Texas prestigious bio

446
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,020
weapons research lab saying any vaccines for the coronavirus family cause massive auto

447
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:12,880
immune responses, strokes and heart attacks and blood clots.

448
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,120
Look at this.

449
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,840
They studied it on a whole bunch of animals and it killed mass numbers of them.

450
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,720
And we've already known this.

451
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,120
So there are some very basic lies Alex is telling about the study just in that little

452
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
rant.

453
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,280
And if you pay attention to the specific things he's lying about, you can see his motives

454
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,840
really clearly.

455
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,520
The first thing to be very clear about is that this study only had to do with reactions

456
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,360
to a vaccine in mice.

457
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,060
At the end of the study, they even say, quote, limitations of the present studies include

458
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,720
their performance in mice only and uncertainty of the relevance of rodent models to SARS

459
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,460
coronavirus vaccines in humans.

460
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,800
Max is skimming the study, so he's only looking at the first page and abstract, basically.

461
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,360
And if you only look at that and you don't actually read it, you might think that there

462
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,420
are more animals involved.

463
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,680
In the design section of the abstract, it says, quote, four candidate vaccines for humans

464
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,820
with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated on a mouse model of SARS and a VLP vaccine,

465
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,460
the vaccine given to ferrets and non-human primates, another whole virus vaccine and

466
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,740
an RDNA produced S protein.

467
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,520
Ferrets and non-human primates are referenced, but not as participants in the study.

468
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,080
The context of that is that VLP vaccines are typically the type that are given to those

469
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
animals.

470
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,080
If you weren't paying attention to the study at all and you just wanted to use the appearance

471
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,320
of it as a prop to scare people, it'd be really easy to see multiple animal names in the first

472
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,640
page and just kind of run with it.

473
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Yeah.

474
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Which is what Alex is doing.

475
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,960
Yeah, he's painting that like 12 monkeys picture where there's all these animals in cages in

476
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,880
like a dark lit room somewhere.

477
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Yeah.

478
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
So Alex is making up that the study showed that mass numbers of animals were killed because

479
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,680
of the vaccine.

480
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,440
There weren't massive numbers of mice involved to begin with, and if you read the study,

481
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,060
you would know how the study was designed.

482
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,400
They vaccinated the mice with the different vaccines and 56 days later, actually that's

483
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,740
not entirely true, 56 days into the study, five mice from each group were killed to assess

484
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,200
how well the vaccines had worked and to gauge lung issues that existed.

485
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,720
The remaining mice in each group were challenged with live SARS and then killed two days later

486
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
so their lungs could be studied.

487
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,340
There's no indication that lung issues or vaccine concerns killed even a single mouse

488
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,720
in this study.

489
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,320
Alex is making that up to make this story seem more interesting to his audience.

490
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,520
Third, Alex is making up the effects that this study found in vaccinated mice who were

491
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,760
faced with a SARS challenge.

492
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,400
He's including autoimmune conditions in the list because that's been a big talking point

493
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,360
on Infowars for a long time, so it's meant to give him the appearance of being right.

494
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,720
Strokes, heart attacks, and blood clots are included because these are the things that

495
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,840
people have been discussing as possibly related to various vaccines for COVID-19.

496
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Naturally.

497
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,920
There's not evidence of a causal link, but a public conversation about concerns surrounding

498
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,320
those issues has been going on, and Alex is trying to exacerbate those concerns and scare

499
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
his audience.

500
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,320
And in the study, as we know, the only real result was all of the mice had increased flatulence.

501
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
That was not in the study.

502
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh, are you sure?

503
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It should have been.

504
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,660
The actual study doesn't involve any of the conditions that Alex was listing.

505
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,000
The effects studied were entirely surrounding damage to lung tissue.

506
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,160
One of the following must be true, and I cannot stress this enough.

507
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,240
Alex has either not read this study at all and is just making all this stuff up, or he

508
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,860
has read the study and he knows that he's lying to his audience about what it says to

509
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,040
scare them.

510
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,960
There isn't a middle ground, but I will say that in that first possibility, that first

511
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,080
category is skimmed it and read a few words.

512
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,240
Yeah, that is definitely more likely.

513
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,560
Yeah, but it's still just making up what you think those words are.

514
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

515
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
It's bullshit.

516
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Yeah.

517
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
And I love it.

518
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
I love it.

519
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,700
I imagine when he looks at a article, it probably looks like, when you and I look at something

520
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,200
to read, we like see all the words, right?

521
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,520
I imagine every time he looks at one of these, it's like a redacted document in his brain.

522
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,920
Like his brain just cuts out all the words that aren't like usable.

523
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,320
But instead of the black bars, it's like demon faces.

524
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, it's just squiggly lines that burst off the page.

525
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,040
Or clowns walking, like doing John Cleese.

526
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,760
It's the pink elephants and he's got the brown bag and he looks at it and he's like, oh shit,

527
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,060
I got to quit drinking.

528
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,320
Instead of words, it's John Cleese, so he walks, but it's a weird clown.

529
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
That's my theory.

530
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Sure, sure.

531
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
So Alex is going to leave.

532
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Uh-huh.

533
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
He's got to go.

534
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
He's got to go.

535
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Maybe he doesn't.

536
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Okay.

537
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
You know what?

538
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
I'm not going to go off here.

539
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm just going to read the whole damn study on air, how's that sound?

540
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
That sounds good.

541
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:45,400
And again, usually these studies mince words and this spells it right out in the summary

542
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:52,600
on the front page, University of Texas, level four bioweapons lab in Galveston, Texas.

543
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,480
There's no way he's reading this study on air.

544
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,520
This whole overly dramatic breakdown of having to go off air and then deciding to stay on

545
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,000
air and read the whole study, it would come off a lot more genuine if he hadn't followed

546
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,240
the whole part of the beginning there where Alex was complaining that no one pays attention

547
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,160
to him unless he makes a big deal out of things.

548
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
There is that.

549
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,760
It almost feels like this kind of like fake struggling that he's going through.

550
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,960
It's like a piece of the necessary performance that he has to carry out to make anyone believe

551
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,800
that this piece of supposed evidence actually means anything.

552
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Yeah.

553
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,040
It's all just, it's just an act.

554
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,880
Yeah, you know, it reminds me of when James Brown used to, somebody would put the blanket

555
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,160
over his shoulders and he'd be like, ah, I'm too tired.

556
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
I can't go on anymore.

557
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,120
And he'd start walking off stage, but then the music would bring him right back, Dan.

558
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,120
I mean, it gets you into the performance, I guess.

559
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,680
Yeah, but you know, he's coming back.

560
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,280
Especially if you're on tour with him and you've seen it over and over.

561
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm basically on tour with Alex.

562
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
You're the grateful dad.

563
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Yeah.

564
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,400
And I do not like the hits.

565
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,040
The hits are boring.

566
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,620
Also, small point here.

567
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,120
It's like you've been following around Fish for 10 years, but you hate them.

568
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,540
But also don't, like, I think that's the worst example, right?

569
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,340
Fish do a lot of improvising.

570
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
That's true.

571
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Yeah.

572
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,360
A lot of those like long jams are, they put out all of their shows and people listen to

573
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
them.

574
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,040
Like that's the exact wrong example.

575
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
That's a good point.

576
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Look, I don't like Fish or anything.

577
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
Look, there are no doors.

578
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,760
But I think that that's a bad example.

579
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,000
Anyway, small point here, Jordan.

580
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,040
The lab at the University of Texas, Galveston is a level three biosafety lab, not a level

581
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
four.

582
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,960
I would feel like a stickler for pointing that out when Alex said it was level four,

583
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,640
but there's a big difference between those two.

584
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,040
And also that information is literally on page two of the study.

585
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,240
So if he made it that far, he would know what level it was.

586
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,400
I think he should read the whole study on air.

587
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,280
I think it would be a smart move in his situation.

588
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Ain't gonna do it.

589
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
I kind of doubt it.

590
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Ain't gonna do it.

591
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
That makes sense.

592
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,840
But he is going to yell a lot.

593
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
That sounds like it.

594
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Some of the rats died today.

595
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,920
Some died in six weeks, but they died and they bled out, folks.

596
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
They what?

597
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,200
Where their brain meets the sinus, they bled out their lungs, they bled out their thighs,

598
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,440
they bled out their stomachs, they bled out, they bled out, they bled out, they bled out,

599
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,920
they bled out.

600
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,440
Just like you shoot somebody with a 12-gauge shotgun with a double-aught buck, they bleed

601
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,560
out in about a minute.

602
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,680
This way you bleed out over the next few years.

603
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
My God.

604
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Wow.

605
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,880
I want to read.

606
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,480
I would give anything to read an accurate scientific study that was just like, there

607
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,040
was blood everywhere.

608
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,280
Oh, the rodent manatee.

609
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Oh, it's a nightmare.

610
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
It was a bad lung.

611
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,240
Oh, everywhere we went, blood on the walls.

612
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,760
It hit me in the nose.

613
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
God have mercy.

614
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:56,400
I mean, I don't want to minimize the grossness of even just reading this, all these mice

615
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
are euthanized.

616
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,960
There's something about it that makes me kind of uncomfortable.

617
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
There's a certain amount of it that's fucked up.

618
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,500
But it's completely different than what Alex is describing.

619
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,680
It is not people injecting mice with a vaccine and then them suddenly exploding in a blood

620
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
field.

621
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Watching them bleed out.

622
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,840
It's not a samurai movie from the 70s, man.

623
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,400
So Alex is lying about one line that I think someone must have highlighted for him in the

624
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
study.

625
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Quote, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then bled from the retroorbital sinus

626
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,900
plexus.

627
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,100
He's taking the second half of that sentence about bleeding and then pretending that it

628
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,560
didn't follow the first half where the mice were all put down in accordance with the methodology

629
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
of the study.

630
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,560
This doesn't mean that the mice died bleeding from their noses, but that's the image that

631
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,280
Alex wants to use these words to paint and it's a complete fabricator.

632
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,560
It's complete nonsense.

633
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
It's childish.

634
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:54,040
Just going up on JSTOR, reading the introduction, the very end of it is, Oh God, what have we

635
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
done?

636
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,280
Science has asked too long whether or not we could.

637
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,160
Make mice bleed out?

638
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Yes.

639
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Yeah.

640
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,680
So anyway, Alex makes up some more shit.

641
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Yep.

642
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:16,440
Imagine a 2012 highly respected peer reviewed university of Texas longterm study on all

643
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:24,480
sorts of different animals, finding massive blood clots, brain damage, heart attacks,

644
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,560
organ failure, you name it, and cautioning against vaccines for the coronavirus family.

645
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,540
So that clip is 23 seconds long.

646
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,680
And here's a list of, I bet there are more, but I caught eight here.

647
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,760
Maybe.

648
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,440
I got six big ones.

649
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Six big ones.

650
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Okay.

651
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Errors.

652
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
That is one.

653
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
It was not a longterm study.

654
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
Right.

655
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
Two.

656
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
It wasn't on all sorts of animals.

657
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
It was just mice.

658
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Right.

659
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
Three.

660
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
It didn't find massive blood clots.

661
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Nope.

662
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Four.

663
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
It didn't find brain damage.

664
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Nope.

665
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Five.

666
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
It didn't find heart attacks.

667
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
True.

668
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Six.

669
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
It did advise caution with proceeding with the application of SARS coronavirus vaccine

670
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
in humans.

671
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
That's all good and well, but it doesn't match the, what Alex is saying.

672
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,920
Like don't overdo, don't open Pandora's box.

673
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
Yeah.

674
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Totally.

675
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,640
There's a few others in there, but, uh, I, I felt like some might be splitting hairs,

676
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,720
but those are the major issues of the actual study.

677
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,960
Those were bonus ones that I just gave him just on account of being Alex.

678
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,240
I just assume you, whatever you think it is, add to, just to be safe.

679
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
You're a gambler.

680
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I'm a gambler.

681
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
I like it.

682
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
And I think that's a safe bet.

683
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Yeah.

684
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,440
Alex's brief summary of the study gets so much completely wrong that even if you didn't

685
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,000
suspect as I do that he's a willful liar, you should be really worried about his ability

686
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,960
to convey accurate information from primary sources.

687
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,180
Even if you think he has a heart of gold and he means well, and you know, he's a good guy,

688
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:46,120
this is a staggering display of inability to do the job he's tried to give himself.

689
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,320
This is like, sometimes I'll, I'll check in and I'll listen to these like, and I'll find

690
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,880
the primary source and it'd be like, Oh, this is bad.

691
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,080
This is bad work.

692
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
This is funny.

693
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
Yeah.

694
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
It's so embarrassingly bad.

695
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Yeah.

696
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,840
The bleeding out the noses.

697
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,080
This is, Oh God.

698
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,400
This is like, he's like a kid.

699
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,580
He should, he should begin this segment with that a carnival music, but in a minor key.

700
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,360
So you know, we're entering into a real fucked up world.

701
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,640
You know, nothing, this is topsy-turvy world.

702
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,600
Nothing's going to be real and it's all going to be terrifying.

703
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,440
Just coming into, yeah, it'll be great.

704
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Yeah.

705
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
I agree.

706
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,560
And man, I can't even begin to tell you there is a punchline that it floored me.

707
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Okay.

708
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
All right.

709
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:40,160
You, but you must think of the mice holy mackerel.

710
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,200
You ought to read here.

711
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Overhead shot, please.

712
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,920
What happened to the mice bleeding out their sinus, bleeding out their brains, bleeding

713
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,880
out their hearts, young mice, middle-aged mice, old mice, all the mice, young mice,

714
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,240
middle-aged mice, old mice, you have mice that were just getting ready to go off to

715
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,260
college with their whole lives ahead of them.

716
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,240
Mice that were two days away from retirement.

717
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Totally planning a life after their career at the software development firm.

718
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Going to move to Florida.

719
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
There's some traveling.

720
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Yeah, absolutely.

721
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,640
It was finally time.

722
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,000
Maybe going to get into the puzzles, you know, with your old, your spouse, my mouse, your

723
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
spouse mouse.

724
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Spouse mouse.

725
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Spouse mouse.

726
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, God damn it.

727
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,960
Then you got to think about the adolescent mice who just made the cut for the varsity

728
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
football team.

729
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Short, short.

730
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Yeah, of course.

731
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Cut down in their prime.

732
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Yeah.

733
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Could have been Heisman contenders.

734
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Yeah.

735
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Bo Jackson mouse.

736
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,680
He was almost going to make it in three professional sports.

737
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Yeah.

738
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Yeah.

739
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Tragic.

740
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Tragic.

741
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,800
It's her middle-aged mouse.

742
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,760
He's really, really painting a picture.

743
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,920
For a man who's killed that many dogs, how dare he try to make me care about mice?

744
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,280
What an asshole.

745
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,920
Again, just to be totally clear, I have reservations about the way animals are used.

746
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
No, absolutely.

747
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Animal testing is fucked up.

748
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Yeah.

749
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
I agree.

750
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,760
I don't want to unpack that right now while I'm busy laughing at middle-aged mice.

751
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
What a dick.

752
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,960
Young mice, middle-aged mice, old mice, they come for us all, man.

753
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,920
So Alex continues to make stuff up.

754
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Neutralizing antibody assays.

755
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,160
What happened to the animals?

756
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,920
Death.

757
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,980
University of Texas.

758
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,960
This is prestigious.

759
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,960
This is the university did a long-term study on a bunch of vaccines they already had on

760
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,280
the shelf and they all do the same thing.

761
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
MRNA or virus vector.

762
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,480
Alex is just skimming the paper now and he saw the headline neutralizing antibody assays.

763
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,080
And that's just the section about how post euthanasia, the samples are taken from the

764
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,880
animals and how they're processed in such a way as to preserve the evidence that antibodies

765
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,820
that might be detected were from the vaccine that was given as opposed to another source.

766
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,000
Alex has no idea what the words he's saying even mean.

767
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,120
He just knows they kind of sound scary.

768
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,760
Also, this study has literally nothing to do with MRNA vaccines.

769
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,480
None of the four vaccines studied were that type and Alex is just throwing that in to

770
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,880
make the audience scared of current day COVID-19 vaccination.

771
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Of course.

772
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,280
Because he has an agenda.

773
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Yeah.

774
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Yeah.

775
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Boy.

776
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Yeah.

777
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,840
And again, it's, it's a, it's a lab that they're, they're, they're put, they're put down.

778
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,080
It's not like Alex is making it sound like everybody is like, okay, we injected them

779
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,240
with the stuff and then they've got a giant meat cleaver and they just chop the mouse

780
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,160
off and they're like, we'll move on.

781
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
No, no, no.

782
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,160
Maybe there is a little bit of that, but I think the image he wants people to have is

783
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,520
that he, they injected them and then just watched them slowly.

784
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Yeah.

785
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Yeah.

786
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Yeah.

787
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Wow.

788
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
That's probably like they were counting the time.

789
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Right.

790
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Right.

791
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Yeah.

792
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
That's cool.

793
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
Yeah.

794
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,880
Why'd they never have a vaccine for the Corona family?

795
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,760
That's the most common, one of the most common families because it's a fricking protein that

796
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,880
your body's made up out of.

797
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,440
What else has your body made up?

798
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
It's incredible.

799
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,880
And I've got some, I was so ready to cover all this other news.

800
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,120
I just spent last night and this morning reading 50 something pages of a Pentagon DARPA document

801
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:29,120
just, I mean, I hope you're excited to have Alex not talk about that supposed DARPA document.

802
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,400
I'm looking forward to a 50 page DARPA document.

803
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Bad news.

804
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,640
Also, the reason there wasn't a coronavirus vaccine prior to now is primarily because

805
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,440
it's a challenging thing to do and money wasn't there for the research.

806
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,480
Most Corona viruses are not generally very severe and the two previous times there were

807
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,800
serious outbreaks with SARS and MERS, both were handled relatively well with containment

808
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,520
measures and proper protocols, so they never got to the point where money was flowing in

809
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,560
as an urgent solution was needed.

810
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Like now.

811
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Right.

812
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,760
COVID changed that factor in the equation.

813
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,480
And thankfully we also had some preliminary work done in forms of studies that were done

814
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,640
in the wake of SARS and MERS that helped inform current efforts that were going on.

815
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Of course.

816
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,240
A coronavirus vaccine probably could have been made in the past.

817
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,160
It just would have been a question of marshaling efforts and resources into the right places.

818
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,840
And that wasn't something that was seen as a good investment until recently.

819
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Right.

820
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Hopefully that lesson's been learned.

821
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah.

822
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Yeah.

823
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,320
You know, I would like it if more people realized that science, when it succeeds, is the culmination

824
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:37,720
of failures and not like a simple moment of single, a brilliant inspiration that appears

825
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,040
out of nowhere.

826
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,840
It's the culmination of years upon years upon years of work.

827
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Yeah.

828
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,920
And realistically, like a hundred things could go wrong and then that could lead to

829
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,560
something that's really huge.

830
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Totally.

831
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,120
Whereas, you know, you're not going to make the playoffs if you have an 0 in a hundred

832
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
record.

833
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
Right.

834
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Right.

835
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
Right.

836
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Right.

837
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,240
We're trained to have this win-loss kind of like success-failure way we look at stuff.

838
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,160
And it, yeah, it's a different paradigm.

839
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Yeah.

840
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
It's a completely different paradigm.

841
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,920
Failure is the goal.

842
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,940
Because if you fail all the time, then when you succeed, you're like, holy shit, this

843
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,940
is real.

844
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Yeah.

845
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Yeah.

846
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,760
So Alex has a bit of white identity based fears floating around.

847
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Oh yeah, about white.

848
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,280
We have Carol Baker, CDC spokeswoman, telling a giant amphitheater full of scientists and

849
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,000
doctors and nurses that white people are inherently bad and must be gotten rid of because they

850
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
don't submit to the government.

851
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,920
So that's where this is coming from.

852
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,400
And I guess we do have kind of an Irish, Scottish, English background of a thousand years of

853
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,200
war between those groups and kings trying to get freedom.

854
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,520
And that's where the Magna Carta and then juries and basic rights come from.

855
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Yes.

856
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Yes.

857
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,120
What white people basically invented really, really anchors the other white people that

858
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
want to run things.

859
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Wow.

860
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,880
I don't even know where to begin with all of the things wrapped up in just that.

861
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,680
Just saying that means you extrapolate what it means if this is real.

862
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,240
But I've heard Alex say things like that in the past, like the idea that sort of white

863
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
people created freedom.

864
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
No, totally.

865
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,320
But I have often thought that was kind of just a stray thought.

866
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,120
Maybe he was in too deep on a sentence.

867
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Sure, sure.

868
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,200
No, it's fundamental to his worldview.

869
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,800
It's fundamental to his worldview that no other culture has ever created any system

870
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
of freedom.

871
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Of freedom.

872
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Yeah.

873
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Freedom is essentially a white creation.

874
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,080
He cannot possibly believe that anything else happened.

875
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
It's outrageous.

876
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Yeah, he can't.

877
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:43,720
Imagine him reading about a matriarchal society.

878
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,240
Matriarchal societies that have existed in our past so many times and how much better

879
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
they are.

880
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,520
I can't even... Well, better is relative, but there are systems that work and are better

881
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,400
for... It depends on where you're living and the circumstances.

882
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
No, totally.

883
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Totally.

884
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
I'm sorry.

885
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
My anthropology hat slipped on.

886
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
I understand.

887
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
I respect that.

888
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm very troubled by that.

889
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,000
That's really fucked up.

890
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah.

891
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
But also that clip that he's talking about, about Dr. Carol Baker.

892
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,240
It's a clip that's been posted all over right-wing media.

893
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,720
It's about a minute and a half long, and it's a clip where Dr. Baker is saying that the

894
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,960
solution to getting rid of vaccine denial is getting rid of white people.

895
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,960
This is not at all being suggested as a serious solution.

896
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,160
It's clearly meant as a shock statement that furthers a different argument, which is conveniently

897
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,800
edited out of the clip that gets posted all over the media.

898
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,720
Most of the places you find this clip where they post it, it's super vague about where

899
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,760
the video comes from, sometimes just a year, and it's often the wrong year.

900
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,140
I suspect this is an intentional strategy to make it harder for the audience to confirm

901
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,760
the claims that are being made about it.

902
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,060
I tracked down the full video, and it's from a panel discussion being held by the National

903
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:59,920
Meningitis Association titled, quote, Achieving Childhood Vaccine Success in the United States.

904
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,720
It's not a giant amphitheater, but that visual does a lot more work for Alex, and he knows

905
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,880
the audience is just going to accept it over dumb shit, he says.

906
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,240
The larger context of the comment was in terms of a conversation about strategies to increase

907
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,000
vaccination rates.

908
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,620
Another panelist had suggested media training for doctors, and there was some disagreement

909
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,360
about whether or not the media training would be impactful.

910
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,740
Dr. Baker was expressing the position that the discussion to get children vaccinated

911
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,120
is an individual event that happens over and over all over the country every day, and media

912
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,740
training might not necessarily be the most helpful thing.

913
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,920
The conversation had also touched on multicultural issues, like communities that claim exemptions

914
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,040
from school vaccine mandates.

915
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,480
The comment Baker made appears to exist in the intersection of these two ideas, but it's

916
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,720
kind of a freewheeling panel discussion, so they kind of go off on some tangents, and

917
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,360
makes it a little bit difficult to know exactly where she was going.

918
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,100
But having watched the discussion, I'm absolutely certain that it has nothing to do with appealing

919
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
to white genocide.

920
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,300
I don't know.

921
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
I don't know.

922
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,400
It just sounds like the CDC's...

923
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,540
I feel like maybe the CDC is overreacting a little bit to the Trump years, but calling

924
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,920
for white genocide does seem...

925
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,040
She wasn't with the CDC at the time, I believe.

926
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
I think she was...

927
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Right.

928
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
Of course not.

929
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
Yeah.

930
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Because who fucking cares?

931
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
Previously.

932
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,040
Yeah.

933
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Let's just lie about everything.

934
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Yeah.

935
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
But Alex, boy, what a mess.

936
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
Yeah, that's not good.

937
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
White people invented freedom.

938
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
Oh, man.

939
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
He's in a mood.

940
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Man.

941
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
Yeah.

942
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,640
I mean, the English, Irish, and Scotch thing, they invented freedom?

943
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Like there was no...

944
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,600
Well, it's because they were fighting about kings or something.

945
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I mean, couldn't he say...

946
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,680
I mean, if you want it to be a super...

947
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,560
Don't white nationalists claim Rome too?

948
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,560
Or was...

949
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
I think they love Vikings.

950
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,880
Or was that too swarthy at the time?

951
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,880
They love Vikings.

952
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
They like...

953
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Well, yeah.

954
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
They're like the Norse runes.

955
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
Yes, yes.

956
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
The people who we most associate with freedom.

957
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
Mm-hmm.

958
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,880
Yeah.

959
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
Great.

960
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
So Alex is in a mood.

961
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,280
And I think I might be able to tell you why.

962
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Why?

963
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Mic down for this.

964
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Okay.

965
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,800
I have been called away to a little court hearing today, the wonders of family court.

966
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,680
So that's why I taped something this morning, because I've got to go at one o'clock today.

967
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,880
But I'll be back after that this afternoon.

968
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
There is so much to cover and so much to get to.

969
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,760
I wonder if that has to do anything with his mood.

970
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
Might be a bad mood.

971
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,440
Might be why he's fine with everybody dying.

972
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Could be fine.

973
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Could be something to do with it.

974
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,720
When I said that, I was like, oh, the mystery becomes clear.

975
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Yeah.

976
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,000
This is like the scene in a Poirot thing where it's like the great six f1 down.

977
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah, the dramatic reveal.

978
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

979
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
No, this is the dinner party.

980
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah.

981
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,920
I will slowly reveal the perpetrator of the court.

982
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
I have to go to family court.

983
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
Yes.

984
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Caught him.

985
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
It was him.

986
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Okay, yeah.

987
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
He was guilty.

988
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
Oh, this is why this is a bombshell.

989
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
No one pays attention to you.

990
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
Yeah, yeah.

991
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
And everyone's got to die.

992
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Yeah, yeah.

993
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Great.

994
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Yep.

995
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
Okay.

996
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
Thanks, Alex.

997
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,640
Even though he has to leave early, it doesn't stop him from continuing to be wrong about

998
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,520
everything about this study.

999
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,000
Sounds right.

1000
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,200
Overhead shot, please.

1001
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,080
Well, this just got brought to my attention.

1002
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,080
I went and checked it on the University of Texas website.

1003
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,600
This is the University of Texas Biological Research Center, level four, one of the most

1004
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,640
prestigious in the world.

1005
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,680
Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary autoimmune response.

1006
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,920
Immunopathology is what that means.

1007
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,680
And it says this autoimmune response is in the mice.

1008
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,720
We test on mice that are very similar to us with the way they react.

1009
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,800
And then they have to show the photos and all of it.

1010
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,040
And they have the control group, the non-control group, the control group, you know, those

1011
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,560
that were a challenge got really sick.

1012
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,280
Those that weren't given it didn't get sick.

1013
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,040
They did a bunch of studies and it's got all the photos of the holes even in their lungs,

1014
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,240
their brains.

1015
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
And their hearts.

1016
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
What?

1017
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Wait, what?

1018
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
They did three different vaccines.

1019
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,160
They did three different vaccines, three different types.

1020
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,880
Show me those fucking photos.

1021
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,640
They all killed the animals.

1022
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,760
So that's the University of Texas.

1023
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,840
So the lab isn't level four.

1024
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,080
Immunopathology does not mean autoimmune.

1025
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,160
The article has nothing to do with autoimmune conditions.

1026
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Correct.

1027
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,840
Alex is making up how he imagines this test was run.

1028
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:14,180
The only mice in the study were not challenged with live SARS were the five from each group

1029
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,200
that were killed two days early so they could have their lungs examined.

1030
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,640
The entire story of the vaccinated group getting sick after the challenge and non-vaccinated

1031
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,040
group being fine, that just comes from Alex's imagination.

1032
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,880
There were no photos in the study of hearts or brains because it's only about the lungs.

1033
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,320
That's the word Alex keeps tripping over in the study's title, pulmonary.

1034
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,960
Alex is making up that the other photos are in there or maybe he hallucinated them.

1035
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,960
I'm not sure.

1036
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,420
Also, they tested four vaccines in the study.

1037
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,080
Alex just thinks there were three because he was skimming and he saw the line, quote,

1038
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:50,160
three different experiments performed for comparing different vaccines are reported

1039
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
here.

1040
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,000
On page two, that's where that quote comes from, at the beginning of the study design

1041
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
section.

1042
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,280
In reality, there were four vaccines.

1043
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,880
Two of them were the same type of vaccine, whole virus vaccines, but they were prepared

1044
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,220
differently and used different adjuvants.

1045
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,720
So they were experimentally distinct.

1046
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
Sure.

1047
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,560
Also, none of the vaccines killed any animals.

1048
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
Right.

1049
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
This is all nonsense.

1050
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,480
Alex cannot fucking handle doing a...

1051
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,960
Again, I mean, I just want to read that study where they're like, fuck it, man.

1052
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,600
There are brains with holes in them, dude.

1053
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
Put it in the study.

1054
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Sure.

1055
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Great.

1056
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,600
Awesome.

1057
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,600
Anyway, he continues lying.

1058
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Of course.

1059
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,600
Well, I'll give Bill Gates and the UN and the globalists this.

1060
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:40,040
They've got huevos the size of the Grand Canyon or the size of the Grand Tetons, size of the

1061
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
planet.

1062
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,040
The National Bioweapons Lab, level four, found that all coronavirus vaccines cause bleeding

1063
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,920
in the lungs, the brain, the heart, and blood clots on a massive scale.

1064
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,080
In some cases, the majority of lab rats died.

1065
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,080
And that's the headline.

1066
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:03,880
Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology with all

1067
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,040
the challenged subjects, all the lab animals.

1068
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
That is from 2012.

1069
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,360
And there's a bunch of other reports coming out.

1070
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,360
They knew this.

1071
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,360
They did it.

1072
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,760
That way, they could plausibly deny when your loved one has a heart attack or a stroke or

1073
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,000
a blood clot and you see what's coming out with all the vaccines.

1074
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,800
Please don't forget, we're Lister supported, turbo force, 10 hours clean energy, back of

1075
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
stock, 40% off.

1076
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,800
Hey.

1077
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Holy shit.

1078
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Oh, boy.

1079
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,920
That was a 90 degree turn.

1080
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,320
God damn.

1081
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Jarring.

1082
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
That hurt.

1083
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,320
Yeah.

1084
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
That hurt.

1085
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,040
I feel like I was in a 30 mile an hour car crash right there.

1086
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:46,760
That sounds like a guy who's got to go to family court, plugging like a guy who's got

1087
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
to go to court with his ex-wife.

1088
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,760
Yeah.

1089
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,760
Yeah.

1090
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,760
That'll do it.

1091
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Yeah.

1092
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,220
So Alex has Nick Fuentes on for a little bit.

1093
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,360
And I didn't point this out on our last episode, but when the two of them were talking, Alex

1094
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,700
said that Nick Fuentes was going to get a channel on band.video on Alex's site.

1095
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,000
And I just took that to be stray talk because he said that to almost everybody who's seen

1096
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
the old man house phone.

1097
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,640
He said that to almost everybody who's nuts and a problem.

1098
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,640
Yeah.

1099
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Yeah.

1100
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
Yeah.

1101
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,640
Absolutely.

1102
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,480
But they have followed through and now Nick has an America First channel on Alex's website.

1103
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,000
Or, actually, that's better.

1104
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Keep it there.

1105
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Sure.

1106
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Keep it all there.

1107
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Get rid of everything else.

1108
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,120
So he's also got another iron in the fire that he's going to explain here.

1109
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,000
So I was on your show last week to talk about my placement on the no fly list, which we

1110
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,240
suspect was for political reasons, and you brought on the great lawyer, Norm Pattis,

1111
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,880
and we got a chance to talk a little bit.

1112
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,880
Really?

1113
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,100
And I actually gave him a call after your show, and I've now retained him to represent

1114
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:50,400
me in a case against the TSA, and we should be filing, I believe, next week.

1115
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,160
So we're going to take it to the courts against the TSA and the federal government.

1116
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,960
I guess stand up didn't work out.

1117
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,440
Wow.

1118
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,960
Man.

1119
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,000
Norm is running a good game.

1120
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,520
I don't know about that.

1121
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,720
There's something about some idiot just suddenly calling you because of Alex Jones and being

1122
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,400
like, fuck it, yeah, I'll run your dumb lawsuit that's not going to go anywhere, you idiot.

1123
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,400
Yeah.

1124
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Pay me.

1125
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,760
I guess there does appear to be a space for, like, I mean, this is a scam.

1126
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1127
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,120
It's not a real lawsuit.

1128
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
No.

1129
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,920
It's at best a fundraising opportunity for Nick Fuentes.

1130
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,920
Agreed.

1131
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,240
Norm's going to skim some of that off in billable hours or whatever.

1132
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
Yeah, why not?

1133
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,440
I guess that is a career path you could go down as a lawyer.

1134
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,680
Like Larry Klaiman did that for years, filing frivolous nonsense lawsuits.

1135
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,680
You're just a scammer.

1136
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,680
Yeah.

1137
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,680
That's fine.

1138
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,680
And if he wants to do that, great.

1139
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,040
I don't know anything about, I don't know a lot about his career.

1140
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,160
I know it seems like he's taking a turn for the racist lately.

1141
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,960
And I guess, you know, getting in bed with, I guess just being associated with Alex Jones

1142
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,960
too deeply.

1143
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Yeah.

1144
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
This is just what happens.

1145
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
It is.

1146
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
It gets you.

1147
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,600
Like Barnes ends up, like, doing interviews with Stefan Molyneux, and Norm's doing racist

1148
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,640
stand up and hanging out with Nick Fuentes.

1149
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,840
Yeah, you just can't, you can't do it.

1150
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,600
You can't, you can't, you can't go on to do something else.

1151
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,040
You can't exist in the modern GOP without being a white nationalist anyway, so.

1152
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,040
Seems tough.

1153
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,040
Yeah.

1154
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,080
So Alex goes off to family court, and I stopped listening.

1155
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,080
I don't care.

1156
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,080
I know.

1157
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,080
He's off to family court.

1158
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,080
Yeah.

1159
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
So he comes back in May 7th.

1160
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
Right.

1161
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,080
Uh.

1162
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,080
Does he come back in that day?

1163
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,360
I mean, not when his show's on.

1164
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Oh, okay.

1165
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,920
He might have shown up, like, for the war room or something.

1166
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,920
Gotcha.

1167
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,920
Gotcha.

1168
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,920
I would assume he came back and had a little bit of a business meeting with a model.

1169
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,920
Sure.

1170
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Sure.

1171
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Sure.

1172
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,920
I would assume.

1173
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,920
There's very little doubt of that.

1174
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,920
Yeah.

1175
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,920
There's a lot of work to get done around the office.

1176
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,880
Like, that chair needed to be thrown over there.

1177
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
I'm redecorating.

1178
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
Yeah.

1179
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
Yeah.

1180
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,880
Yeah.

1181
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,360
And that wall was, it was there, and there were zero holes in it.

1182
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,360
Yeah.

1183
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,360
And so I fixed that.

1184
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,680
It is, like, an unforgivable problem.

1185
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:16,960
So Alex comes back on the 7th, and he gets on air, and I was floored by how boring the

1186
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,720
first, like, half hour of his show was.

1187
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,720
Oh, yeah?

1188
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,720
He says nothing.

1189
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Aw.

1190
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
It's treading water.

1191
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,560
It's just like, here I am.

1192
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,120
He does a half hour of, I'm about to get to something.

1193
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,120
Kind of.

1194
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,400
He doesn't really feel like he was about to get there.

1195
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,360
It felt like other people might be getting to something.

1196
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,360
Right.

1197
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,360
Right.

1198
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,360
Right.

1199
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,360
He is not.

1200
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,360
But here's a little clip.

1201
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,040
The government's outlaw, the government's criminal, the government's oppressing you,

1202
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,840
the government's not legitimate, it's Chai-Com Globalist run, so following its directives

1203
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,360
is now a crime against your family and humanity.

1204
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,560
Any of this unconstitutional crap, any of the contact tracers, any intimidation to have

1205
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,920
guards, anybody telling you you gotta wear a mask, anybody giving you this crap is part

1206
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,000
of the enemy army, literally, that engineered this whole damn thing out of Wuhan.

1207
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,080
I listen to stuff like that, and I just, I can't understand how anybody could listen

1208
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:19,280
to Alex, take him seriously, and not recognize that terrorism is the directing.

1209
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,200
That's what, terrorism against the state is basically the only logical outcome of the

1210
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,560
things that he's saying.

1211
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,840
If you believe the things that he's saying, there is no solution.

1212
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,840
No.

1213
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,840
You're fighting the fucking devil.

1214
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,840
Yeah.

1215
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,000
The devil doesn't care about courts, the devil doesn't care about elections.

1216
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
No.

1217
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,800
There's no making peace with the devil, he's the devil.

1218
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Right.

1219
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,040
You have to eradicate him.

1220
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,040
Yes.

1221
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,720
And then the people who follow him, and surprise, all that's left is white people who you're

1222
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,720
friends with.

1223
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,920
I guess I'm not being totally fair, because the other conclusion I guess could be complete

1224
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,920
isolation.

1225
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,600
Like, you could have communes in the woods or something like that.

1226
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Or complete splinter society.

1227
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,080
Trying to topple the state.

1228
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,520
Those are the only two legitimate outcomes, because political organization is meaningless.

1229
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,520
Right.

1230
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:10,040
And like, okay, now the government is, it's outlaw, it's whatever, so any kind of rules

1231
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,840
that come from the government are not to be followed, it's a crime against humanity to

1232
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
wear a mask.

1233
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
Why would you run for office?

1234
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
You couldn't do shit.

1235
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,840
What would you, yeah.

1236
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,360
You'd get absorbed by the devil.

1237
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Totally.

1238
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,680
I just, I was thinking about that because I was so bored by the beginning of this episode.

1239
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1240
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:32,800
And it just, it strikes me that anybody who takes this seriously, they just can't.

1241
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,080
Or else they would be doing something horrible.

1242
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,480
I'll pitch them on this, okay, they've already tried to topple the government and it didn't

1243
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,480
go well.

1244
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
True.

1245
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,400
So try isolation.

1246
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,480
Everybody in the right wing just needs to go away.

1247
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:52,400
Well, I would recommend isolation with another individual for about an hour a week, chatting

1248
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,400
about.

1249
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
What do you think?

1250
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Life.

1251
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Just talking about your problems.

1252
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Yeah.

1253
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Yeah, get some.

1254
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Bounce it off another person.

1255
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Just.

1256
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
See how it feels to say some things out loud.

1257
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
Let it out.

1258
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
Yeah.

1259
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
Yeah.

1260
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
I recommend that for everybody, actually.

1261
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Not a terrible idea.

1262
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
Not just people on the right wing.

1263
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Not a terrible idea.

1264
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,680
So, Alex, you know, the day before, he was mostly just lying about this study, and I'm

1265
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,600
not going to lie, he does more of that.

1266
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,320
But today, he seems to be in a different mood.

1267
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,880
I would describe his mood as being very similar to a guy who went to family court the day

1268
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,880
before.

1269
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,640
Steel prices have tripled, corn has exploded, every commodity is exploding.

1270
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,080
And that's why I said, get into a basket of commodities.

1271
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,940
That's my advice to myself, if I was an investor.

1272
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:41,240
And get invested in a place in the country, doesn't need to be fancy, but away from people

1273
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,720
and know your neighbors, and have friends and family that are aware, and having your

1274
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,720
own gang, your own people to watch each other's back, is the most valuable thing in this universe,

1275
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:55,320
other than a relationship with Jesus Christ, the son of God.

1276
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,640
And so you better get ready now.

1277
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,280
I mean, look, I told you this a year ago, buy ammo, buy guns, they're going to steal

1278
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,280
the election from Trump.

1279
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,760
Then they're going to really clamp down.

1280
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,940
They're going to start a race war as the cover for the economic collapse.

1281
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,540
This is all a battle plan.

1282
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,960
We know what they're going to do.

1283
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,400
We should have been able to stop it.

1284
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,600
Enough folks didn't listen.

1285
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:18,040
Now people are listening, and I don't say that to act tough.

1286
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,440
I don't say that to be impressive.

1287
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,440
It's just, everybody needs to know what you've done keeping us on the air.

1288
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:30,180
We have all the big so-called government intelligence agencies listening.

1289
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:39,360
They're now just like the schedule, webs on a Labrador Retriever's feet, or it's like

1290
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,320
a, like people that grow a sixth toe or something.

1291
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,880
They don't have any power.

1292
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
They're just puppets.

1293
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,720
So corporations, the private groups, the big tech, it's got their own hit teams, their

1294
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,640
own labs making deadly synthetic drugs.

1295
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,600
I mean, just their own pedophile operations is giant industrial level evil.

1296
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:07,280
Just chewing up humanity like a combine cuts wheat or bales grass into bales of hay.

1297
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,680
As soon as we realize how much trouble we're in, we'll be able to turn this around.

1298
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:20,880
But I told everybody this, so I'll do a plug right now because I sell and stay on air with

1299
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,880
what I do myself.

1300
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,600
And when I got the best storeable food company, we sell it directly from infowarsdoor.com.

1301
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,600
They're full catalog.

1302
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,840
You get 10% off, the lowest price already out there, but I can only run that until next

1303
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,840
week, next Wednesday.

1304
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
All right.

1305
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
Sure.

1306
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
Yeah.

1307
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Easter sale.

1308
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
Yeah.

1309
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,840
You got to head to the country.

1310
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,840
Got to run away.

1311
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,840
Absolutely.

1312
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,000
And just incidentally.

1313
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,280
By the way, I'll plug this now while we're here.

1314
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,360
Look, it's a favor that I'm really, really, what do you think about it?

1315
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,360
Honestly.

1316
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,360
What do you think about it?

1317
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,000
I am gifting you this plug.

1318
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yes.

1319
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yeah.

1320
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah.

1321
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's a blessing.

1322
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Yeah.

1323
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,560
And so in order for you to repay that, you need to buy lots of food.

1324
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,560
Wow.

1325
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:11,080
You can get 2020 food prices now at preparewithalex.com or just find the subsection, storeablefood.com.

1326
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,080
And I would buy a lot of food.

1327
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,840
I'm buying more storeable food.

1328
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,520
I'm buying more ammunition.

1329
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,520
You said you have none.

1330
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,400
I am selling my house in Austin.

1331
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Good.

1332
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,440
Just had the realtor photographer over to get that done.

1333
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,440
And I am telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that there's a 90% chance we're

1334
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,520
going to go road warrior in this country for probably five, 10 years.

1335
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
Sure.

1336
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,080
And when this is all over, I would be surprised if 50 million, a hundred million people aren't

1337
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,080
dead.

1338
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,720
And you know, I've never talked like that in my 27 years on air.

1339
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,480
I only think that a 90% chance it's all over.

1340
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
Okay.

1341
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,480
Yeah.

1342
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,480
I've never talked like that.

1343
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,480
I've never said anything like that.

1344
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,280
Except for every time I was at court the day before.

1345
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:58,200
I have never said anything like that roughly 7 billion people will be exterminated so that

1346
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,040
only 500 million are left.

1347
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,320
I've never said anything like that.

1348
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
You know me.

1349
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,400
I've never talked like that except for almost all the time.

1350
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,620
I'm not really a doomsayer, you know, I'm not, that's not my thing.

1351
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,960
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to scare you.

1352
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,720
I like to play it close to the best.

1353
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Also boo.

1354
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,120
Now you should be terrified of all the people coming to kill you.

1355
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,120
Yes.

1356
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,640
And sure they look nice and they say nice things and they're exactly like you and they're

1357
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,280
just normal people, but they're actually working for the devil and you should murder them.

1358
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,160
And road warrior.

1359
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
And road warrior.

1360
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,480
For five to 10 years.

1361
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,880
Road warrior in five to 10 years.

1362
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,600
No, four or five to 10 years.

1363
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,600
Oh yeah.

1364
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,600
Oh that's right.

1365
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,600
Yeah.

1366
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:42,480
Yeah but you know, 50 to 100 million, that seems pretty good for a road warrior situation.

1367
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,800
I mean road, that's a pretty severe situation.

1368
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,680
Sure, but I feel like everybody was dead in road warrior, you're going through the wastes.

1369
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,800
No, I'm kind of agreeing with you, that's kind of a bright side kind of thought.

1370
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah, that's not bad.

1371
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,240
I would, if that was the worst road warrior was going to get it, I feel like it could

1372
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
be worse.

1373
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
Fair enough.

1374
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:05,560
So you know, it's the glass half empty, glass half full, Alex half empty, you half full.

1375
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,480
I'm an optimist, everybody knows that.

1376
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,760
So Alex sent this study that he found, that he was lying about all day yesterday, to a

1377
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,560
guy who works at UT.

1378
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,720
Who knows who this guy is?

1379
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,000
Okay, just a guy.

1380
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And I just thought this was really silly.

1381
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,960
I sent this to an individual I know that is high up in the board, let's just say, well

1382
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:31,840
I gave way too much, didn't I, let's say heads up a department at the University of Texas

1383
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,840
last night.

1384
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,760
And when I, I know this person for a long time, and when I send them text messages,

1385
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,160
they usually don't respond for like a week, but he responded back in about 20 minutes.

1386
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,560
And I said, Hey, UT put out this big study under a federal government grant nine years

1387
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:55,920
ago that, and I said, tell me what you think of it.

1388
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:05,680
I didn't even say, they said it was bad, don't take COVID based vaccines.

1389
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,680
This is 2012.

1390
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:13,960
I just said, Hey, UT put out this interesting report on COVID type viruses nine years ago.

1391
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,960
What do you think?

1392
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,960
Hell, I'll show you the text, I won't show you the name.

1393
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,960
Stop texting me.

1394
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:30,400
He messaged me back like Timothy Slater, and he said, well, it's very technical, but obviously

1395
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,800
I'm not taking the vaccine and this is a warning.

1396
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,840
This is a warning.

1397
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,080
This study was a warning.

1398
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,080
How, what?

1399
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,080
What?

1400
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,760
Well, with global stuff to do all their dirty work out in public.

1401
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,720
You know, I understand that, but I really, really don't give a shit about what anybody

1402
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,720
on any board thinks.

1403
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,200
I have a hard time with boards.

1404
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,680
While also the guy saying that he's not going to get the vaccine, I'm not entirely sure

1405
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,760
what all of his medical issues are, but Alex says that he's like, it's obviously someone

1406
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,220
on the board at UT is probably not a younger person.

1407
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,400
And also they had COVID already.

1408
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,320
So their doctor had told them, this is what he reads from the text message.

1409
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:14,120
Their doctor had told them that they already had a lot of antibodies naturally occurring

1410
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,320
from having had COVID.

1411
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,440
So the doctor had advised them not to get a shot, which is, I don't know.

1412
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,440
I'm not a doctor.

1413
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,440
So I don't know, but that's slightly different than don't get the shot, it'll kill you.

1414
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,440
It's going to kill you.

1415
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,560
You will, there are going to be pictures of holes in your brain.

1416
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,080
It seems like there's a slightly different pieces of advice.

1417
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,120
Could be a different angle.

1418
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,640
Also the idea that this is a warning is just so dumb.

1419
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
I love it.

1420
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,640
So dumb.

1421
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
It's a warning.

1422
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,520
Oh, I'd like to warn Alex.

1423
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:47,160
Um, no, you, you should know what you're talking about or else you sound really stupid.

1424
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,120
That was a good warning.

1425
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:55,580
That's titled immunization SARS coronavirus vaccine leads to pulmonary immunopathology

1426
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,720
of challenge with the SARS virus.

1427
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,720
Emu path.

1428
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:05,320
The challenge is the group of rats that were given the vaccine versus those that aren't.

1429
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:10,880
And they have autoimmune responses and their hearts and lungs roll up and they got bloody

1430
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,880
holes in them.

1431
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,720
Then they died of blood clots, which I'm sure you're hearing about in the news.

1432
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,920
I feel like I'm flogging a dead horse or possibly a dead mouse here, but I am constantly hitting

1433
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:24,000
this drum of Alex, not knowing anything about this study that he's reporting on, but he

1434
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,600
just keeps being wrong in new ways.

1435
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,680
He's wrong about the details of this study, but I think it's more disturbing that he doesn't

1436
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,760
understand basic terminology that's used, which makes me think that he doesn't even

1437
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:39,040
have a handle on the most elementary conversation that's going on in terms of this study as

1438
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,640
well as any others that he might be trying to discuss.

1439
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,640
Yeah, that sounds right.

1440
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,020
Alex says that the term challenge refers to the group of mice that were vaccinated as

1441
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,980
opposed to the ones that were not.

1442
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,000
And that's not what that term means.

1443
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,980
In the case of this study, there were groups of mice that were given various non-experimental

1444
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,200
injections to serve as control groups.

1445
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:01,120
For instance, one control group got actual live SARS, another just got the adjuvant.

1446
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:06,360
The term challenge refers to taking all of the mice in the experimental and control groups

1447
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,600
and challenging their immunity by exposing them to live SARS.

1448
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,240
That's what this experiment did.

1449
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,640
And it's critical to understand that concept, to understand this study at all, to any degree.

1450
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,660
There are times when Alex is being really dumb and it's funny, but this instance is

1451
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,600
almost getting embarrassing.

1452
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,880
Like this is disqualifying, childish.

1453
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:35,000
I think so far his descriptions just of like, here's what a study is, give me great concern.

1454
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
It's like, and this is true with just about everybody who's like, I know science, just

1455
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,360
describe how you do a study after, and this is supposed to be after he's read how they

1456
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
did the study.

1457
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,360
He poured over it, man.

1458
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,360
Yeah.

1459
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,360
Yeah.

1460
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,360
So just tell me how a study works.

1461
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,720
This is day two of his coverage.

1462
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,780
Just give me a simple, like here's the beginning of the study and explain to me what you think

1463
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,780
science does.

1464
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:04,800
Well, it turns out, I mean, I don't, I didn't see this, but it turns out that this study

1465
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,520
is actually evidence that giving the vaccine around, it's going to kill kids.

1466
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,520
Sure.

1467
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,360
These people are sick and now they're going to target the little children and mess them

1468
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,360
up for life.

1469
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,360
Oh man.

1470
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
Wow.

1471
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:22,040
I'm like, oh, suddenly all these kids have heart problems and have brain problems.

1472
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:26,760
Well, there's some conspiracy theorists say it's connected to the vaccine.

1473
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,000
No, the university of Texas says, don't do it.

1474
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It'll happen.

1475
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,400
But you don't care that young rats and old rats got sick and died.

1476
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,960
Because you're liberal.

1477
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,120
You're saving the earth for yourselves.

1478
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,120
Sure.

1479
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,920
I don't not care because I'm liberal.

1480
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,760
I don't care because I read the source.

1481
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,760
Wow.

1482
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,760
That would help.

1483
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,200
Don't you remember the part where the source was like, oh my God, there are all these mice

1484
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
bleeding out.

1485
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,520
We got holes in their brains and then rats broke in and they ate the mice and now they're

1486
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,520
exploding.

1487
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,680
They're going to give it to children next.

1488
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,960
How old are the rats?

1489
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,600
There are no middle aged rats.

1490
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,360
There are young rats and old rats in this circumstance.

1491
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,360
That's a relief.

1492
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,360
It is a relief.

1493
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,360
We're all middle aged here.

1494
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,360
It makes us more comfortable.

1495
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,360
Yep.

1496
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:19,200
So, at the end of last week, the world was reeling from the news that Bill and Melinda

1497
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,080
Gates were getting a divorce and I didn't care.

1498
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,680
Shoot them both into the sun.

1499
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:31,240
I didn't care for Alex's thoughts on it or at least I thought I didn't and then it turns

1500
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,520
out there's a massive conspiracy here.

1501
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,000
Why would I have guessed otherwise?

1502
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Right.

1503
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,080
Robert Barnes has shown up and Alex is now explaining to Barnes how this is all...

1504
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,960
See, I feel like Alex should know how Family Court works pretty well.

1505
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,960
Well...

1506
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,320
I mean, why was Gates and them crazy enough to do this?

1507
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,840
I think it's because he got busted with Epstein and they panicked as a diversion and they

1508
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,200
had this plan, Operation Lockstep on the Shelf.

1509
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,720
In fact, I know that's what happened.

1510
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,000
His wife's now confirmed she's pissed that he was having sex with kids probably.

1511
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Okay.

1512
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,560
A lot of words in there.

1513
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,640
That was a lot.

1514
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:11,920
She's basically confirmed probably.

1515
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,920
So yeah, his theory...

1516
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,240
How many adverbs are too many adverbs?

1517
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,240
That many.

1518
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,240
That many adverbs.

1519
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:22,520
His theory is essentially that Bill Gates got caught up with Epstein and it was all

1520
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,720
gonna come out and he's gonna take the fall for it now.

1521
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:33,100
And so his wife got a divorce to protect the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and she's

1522
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,440
confirmed it probably, basically.

1523
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,440
Basically.

1524
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,000
Probably pretty much.

1525
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
There was a story I saw in the Wall Street Journal that was about how Melinda Gates was

1526
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,040
mad about Bill Gates having an association with Epstein.

1527
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,040
Why?

1528
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,040
And...

1529
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,140
That was good acting.

1530
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,760
You appeared actually surprised.

1531
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,960
Thank you very much.

1532
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,880
And some people have made comments about that, but I think that the bridge that Alex is crossing

1533
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,560
is a little bit shaky.

1534
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1535
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,200
I mean, well, here's the bigger issues there.

1536
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,480
She knows he was hanging out with Epstein and he went to the island.

1537
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:18,040
It would be insane if she was not at least a little bit concerned about that.

1538
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,020
So that's not really a story to me.

1539
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,100
We all know that he spent time on Epstein's island.

1540
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,120
We all think Bill Gates is an evil bastard.

1541
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,120
Like it's fine.

1542
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,120
You know?

1543
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,280
I don't care why they're being divorced.

1544
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,120
I just want them shot on a rocket into the sun, Dan.

1545
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,120
Sure.

1546
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,960
But you have to understand that the divorce is a critical part of COVID existing.

1547
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,960
Ooh, no.

1548
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,560
I was definitely not understanding that.

1549
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,080
Because the divorce is protecting the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation now that Bill

1550
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,100
Gates is about to go down.

1551
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:53,160
But COVID was released because the Epstein connections were coming out in like 2019.

1552
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,160
Sure.

1553
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,160
And they fucking panicked.

1554
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
Sure.

1555
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
They hit the button that said COVID.

1556
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,160
Right.

1557
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,160
The COVID button.

1558
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,160
Right.

1559
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
And then there was a worldwide plague in order for Bill Gates's...

1560
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,360
Why is this the first I'm hearing of this particular aspect of the conspiracy considering,

1561
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:13,520
as Alex has told us so many times, he knows exactly how this is all going to play out?

1562
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,120
Well, I would suggest it's probably because this is improvisational storytelling and not

1563
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,000
actual news or research.

1564
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Also possible.

1565
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah.

1566
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,480
It seems like a fun wrinkle for Bill Gates's character.

1567
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,480
Yeah, why not?

1568
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,480
Put it in there.

1569
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,480
A good way to contextualize the divorce.

1570
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,480
Right.

1571
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
Right, right.

1572
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,480
And that's kind of just the way Alex was feeling.

1573
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,480
Yeah.

1574
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,480
This is character development.

1575
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,480
Yeah.

1576
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,480
Gotcha.

1577
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:35,480
So anyway, Barnes is in.

1578
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,360
And also Alex calls him Barnes and I feel like don't fucking call your lawyer by their

1579
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,360
last name.

1580
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,360
That's just not cool.

1581
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,560
No, no, no.

1582
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,120
I want to give my lawyer a nickname.

1583
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,320
I want to call my lawyer Dickie.

1584
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,120
Hey, come on, Dickie.

1585
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,120
Let's go.

1586
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,120
We got lawsuits.

1587
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,120
Come on, Dickie.

1588
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:56,200
You are fucked if you are that familiar with your lawyer.

1589
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,720
I want to call my lawyer Mr. Misses Something.

1590
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:05,280
I want a deep professional distance between us.

1591
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,520
I don't want to be like, what do you think of Barnes?

1592
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,040
I do not want to text my lawyer with a question about something.

1593
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,040
No, no, no.

1594
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,920
I don't want to text my lawyer when I'm drunk.

1595
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,120
Hey, Dickie, come out tonight.

1596
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,120
Come on, buddy.

1597
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,120
We're going drinking.

1598
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,440
So Barnes has got some news.

1599
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,440
Okay.

1600
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:28,240
Robert Barnes is about to give you exclusive breaking information.

1601
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,800
Here is the exclusive breaking information as humanity fights back.

1602
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,800
Robert Barnes.

1603
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:38,440
Yes, we're going to be filing suit over the next two weeks across the country against

1604
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:43,600
three groups, governments, employers, and educational institutions that are attempting

1605
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,640
to force or coerce people to have the vaccine.

1606
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,080
So Barnes is going to go spread a bunch of attention grabbing lawsuits around, which

1607
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,080
seems to be his specialty.

1608
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,080
Yeah.

1609
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:01,140
I just, I find it impossible to believe that you could listen to this entire show, hear

1610
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:06,800
Alex say that the government is an outlaw, and then listen to Barnes say he's going to

1611
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,200
file some lawsuits and be like, you get them.

1612
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,200
Yeah, this is going to solve things.

1613
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,760
This is an exclusive that I wanted to hear about.

1614
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,680
And I can't wait to throw some money at Barnes to support these lawsuits.

1615
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,800
We have to.

1616
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,840
What if we're able to get an injunction against the devil?

1617
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:28,140
Ooh, then we'll put his plan off for at least four more years.

1618
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,160
Such comical nonsense, what he's asking the audience to accept and believe.

1619
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,160
Yeah, yeah.

1620
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,160
It's wild.

1621
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,520
I don't, I don't think much of Barnes to go to the forest.

1622
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:46,240
You have to go away, get ammo, get food, hide, prepare for the road warrior.

1623
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:51,160
Now we've got an exclusive, sell some of that ammo and give you that money to Barnes.

1624
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,960
We've got a couple of lawsuits going around.

1625
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,960
Yeah.

1626
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:54,960
Jesus, man.

1627
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,920
I don't think much of Barnes and I wasn't like really all that worried about this lawsuit

1628
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,920
going anywhere.

1629
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,400
And then I heard this, I'm like, this is not going anywhere.

1630
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,280
So working with Bobby Kennedy and others on all of the legal issues related to these cases

1631
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,280
and the constitutional issues, we will have the suits filed within the next two weeks.

1632
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,080
He's working with Robert Kennedy, the anti-vax kingpin.

1633
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,080
Yeah, yeah.

1634
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,080
This is not going to work out.

1635
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,840
If you're Robert Kennedy Jr. and you don't get to call yourself Bobby.

1636
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,360
No, I feel like Barnes was doing that to sort of cover up the stink of the name Robert Kennedy.

1637
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,360
Yeah, exactly.

1638
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,360
Yeah, absolutely.

1639
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,800
He was not like, it's Robert Kennedy Jr.

1640
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,640
He's like, Bobby Kennedy.

1641
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,520
His ears perk up, they're like, did Sirhan Sirhan actually hide his, or what?

1642
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,520
Yeah.

1643
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,520
Another person I don't want to be on familiar terms with.

1644
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,520
Robert Kennedy Jr.

1645
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,820
Oh no, Robert Kennedy Jr., okay.

1646
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:49,560
So I'm going to just skip ahead real quick because I want Barnes to explain his lawsuit.

1647
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,800
We're suing under the ADA, the discrimination act that prohibits discrimination against

1648
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,440
anyone who is perceived as disabled.

1649
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,240
We're going to be doing the same thing actually in the context of the vaccines because my

1650
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:05,960
view is that requiring someone to have a vaccine is a perception that they're disabled and

1651
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,840
then treating them differently based on that perception is discriminating against them

1652
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,160
based on your perception of their disability.

1653
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:17,960
And that too is prohibited by the ADA and state analogous laws that are also similar.

1654
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:22,440
So the fact that Barnes is working with Robert Kennedy and the idea that this is the keystone

1655
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,760
of his argument combined to tell me this is not a case he expects to win.

1656
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,880
I would very much like to be in court the day he says those exact words to a judge.

1657
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,460
Just on its face, I suspect this would get thrown out, but there's a huge element of

1658
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:39,120
disability law that Barnes seems to be pretending doesn't exist.

1659
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,200
According to the government's page on disability discrimination, they do make a very important

1660
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,200
caveat.

1661
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,260
Quote, the law requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee or

1662
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:53,300
job applicant with a disability unless doing so would cause significant difficulty or expense

1663
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:56,760
for the employer an undue hardship.

1664
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,480
Even if somehow Barnes were able to convince a court that not wanting to get a vaccine

1665
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,520
was legally analogous to having a disability, he would still have a really hard time overcoming

1666
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,680
the argument that having people potentially spreading COVID around a workplace or school

1667
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:15,560
doesn't represent an undue hardship on an employer or educational institution.

1668
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:19,920
You run the risk of your workforce or teaching staff falling ill, and that's not even considering

1669
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,300
the potential of having to shut down a factory or a possible bad press that could come from

1670
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,720
being the site of a new outbreak.

1671
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,280
Much like Nick Fuentes trying to sue the TSA, this is not a serious case.

1672
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,720
This is a grift and a PR stunt disguised as a legitimate lawsuit.

1673
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,260
It's all just grandstanding and attention seeking behavior, and it's wasting everyone's

1674
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:40,260
fucking time.

1675
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,260
Yeah.

1676
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,260
Yep.

1677
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,200
But I do also want to be in the courtroom.

1678
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,200
Right.

1679
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,200
Yeah, no, totally.

1680
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,200
I do think it would be pretty funny.

1681
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,200
I get-

1682
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,200
Let's go to a courtroom.

1683
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,200
No, absolutely not.

1684
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:56,320
Like, I do get that lawyering is a profession and lawyers like to protect each other, and

1685
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:02,600
you know, judges don't often hold lawyers in contempt of court for, say, I don't know,

1686
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:07,220
going on Info Wars and saying that the stated reason that you're doing this lawsuit is based

1687
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:12,360
on magical nonsense thinking that you don't understand whatsoever that you may- what are

1688
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,880
you fucking talking about?

1689
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,880
Yeah.

1690
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,920
You know what I think the issue with Barnes is?

1691
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:23,680
I think that he's less a lawyer and more a guy who has a page on Dave Rubin's Patreon

1692
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,640
clone called Locals.

1693
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,640
That sounds like it.

1694
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,440
And I think he's promoting his Locals page with the looming idea of these lawsuits.

1695
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,440
Great.

1696
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,240
And I think that he's just trying to sucker people into supporting him on fake Patreon.

1697
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,240
Wow.

1698
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,240
And yeah.

1699
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,640
How did that lawyer collective of constitutional lawyers work out?

1700
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,680
Remember that one from a few years ago when he was going to start that group of people?

1701
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,240
Oh, they changed the world.

1702
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,240
Oh.

1703
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,240
Well, that's good.

1704
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,240
Yeah, I don't know if that happened.

1705
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,240
Boy, it seems like-

1706
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,520
It was a bad idea, so I'm actually kind of glad that it doesn't seem like it happened.

1707
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,000
Yeah, but it seems like they tried to get a lot of money for it.

1708
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I wonder what happened to all that money.

1709
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,960
Oh, well.

1710
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,000
Would you like to know how the Chinese people made COVID?

1711
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You would?

1712
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
That sounds more exciting.

1713
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,760
They gotta change the subject over to- this clip is nonsense.

1714
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,760
Okay.

1715
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,480
So that's how this- there's a lot of ways to do it, I've read about it.

1716
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,800
But one way the Chinese were doing it at Wuhan was, again, use a bunch of gene guns, firing

1717
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,440
a bunch of viruses together until you finally go through an electron microscope and find

1718
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,480
one that got the viruses together like you wanted, all meshed together.

1719
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,980
Then you replicate that in the pig.

1720
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:36,000
The pig dies of the virus, so you know it's deadly.

1721
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,920
You grind it up raw, feed it to piglets.

1722
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:43,240
Those that die again, you do it, then you extract the blood, then you take out the viruses

1723
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,240
you want.

1724
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,160
You have a growth of viruses, and you keep growing them, and then you release it into

1725
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,040
the human population where it starts replicating, and then you have the answer to the disease

1726
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,040
you created.

1727
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,960
The idea that this just accidentally, at the time it came out, when Trump was defeating

1728
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,000
China, and the world was waking up, and nationalism and free market was exploding, and we were

1729
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,960
going back to who we were, like 1955 on steroids, but for everybody, they had to counter it,

1730
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,440
and this is the globalist counter-offensive, and they admit they had plans like this on

1731
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,360
the shelf before.

1732
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,480
So my god, it's so obvious.

1733
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,480
What?

1734
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,200
It's so obvious.

1735
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,200
What?

1736
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,620
It's so obvious.

1737
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,840
What did he just say?

1738
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,120
Look, Occam's razor tells me that's exactly what happened.

1739
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,120
Did he just say it's so obvious?

1740
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,120
It's so obvious.

1741
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Alright.

1742
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,120
So obvious.

1743
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:33,200
Should sci-fi come with a warning label, like, you know, warning, advisory, for people who

1744
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,360
cannot tell the difference between reality and fantasy, this is really going to fuck

1745
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,360
you up.

1746
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,360
Yeah.

1747
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,600
This is really going to screw you up, you're going to think shit like what Alex just said.

1748
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,080
Do we need to have tests before you can read science fiction?

1749
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,080
Maybe.

1750
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,220
Do we need to have some sort of comprehension test where it's like, listen, it's like a

1751
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,920
family video, you know?

1752
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,000
Like they've got the room in the back with all the porn, you've got to be 18 to go into

1753
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
that room.

1754
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,400
Libraries should have that, but for sci-fi.

1755
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,200
Well, I think that science fiction expands people's minds in such a way that, you know,

1756
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:08,480
as a young boy reading like Ray Bradbury or something, you know, it hugely influenced

1757
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:15,480
a lot of creativity that, you know, maybe would have laid dormant in me as a young boy.

1758
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,160
And I think that that's the case for a lot of people.

1759
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:23,120
And I think that the good outweighs the bad because I think the case of Alex is so extreme.

1760
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,800
I'm not saying 18, I'm saying there should be a test, like whenever you can pass the

1761
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
test.

1762
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,320
I don't want to limit the excess of sci-fi to the young kids out there who could use

1763
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,320
it.

1764
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,320
Might be overkill.

1765
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,320
Might be overkill.

1766
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:41,240
As far as I know, there is only one person who has a relationship with sci-fi like Alex

1767
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,240
Jones, and it's Alex.

1768
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,720
I know, but we've got to stop him!

1769
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,720
Granted, the consequences are severe.

1770
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,720
They are very bad.

1771
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,720
They're very severe.

1772
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,720
They're very bad.

1773
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:54,440
And he's created a false reality for a lot of people to live in, and it's very profitable.

1774
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:59,240
But I don't think that, I don't think we need to regulate sci-fi.

1775
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,240
Might be an overreaction.

1776
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,240
Might be an overreaction, I understand that.

1777
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,240
Look, spitballing.

1778
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,240
It's blue sky thinking.

1779
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,240
I'm just trying.

1780
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:09,560
I'm trying to come up with reasons for this man who says that they're going to feed a

1781
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,160
pig to another pig to get the first...

1782
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,160
Yeah.

1783
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,360
I do like the idea, though, that Alex explains all that, and he's like, it's so obvious.

1784
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,640
And Barnes' reaction is, exactly.

1785
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,760
Exactly!

1786
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,880
What are you people in your brains?

1787
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,440
This is what I'm talking about when you go back to 2003, and you have these guests that

1788
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,920
are a little bit, at least like, on their own turf, or whatever.

1789
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,400
They're not these boot-lickin'...

1790
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,200
sycophantic nonsense people.

1791
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,760
Not only that, Alex, but yes.

1792
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
Of course!

1793
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,760
It is too obvious!

1794
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,760
You are totally right!

1795
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,960
No, naturally!

1796
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,680
So we gotta learn about a false flag.

1797
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,440
Oh, sure, of course.

1798
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,640
I think Barnes might be wrong.

1799
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,280
You dig in deep, you find out the Klan was not an organic, authentic group.

1800
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:00,880
The Klan would rise and fall depending on what the politicians in power supported them

1801
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,880
or not.

1802
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:06,960
They were weaponized tools of the establishment infrastructure local to the community.

1803
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,440
They were not some organic group.

1804
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,960
That's why, you know, people said the Klan made up of poor white people.

1805
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,960
Totally false.

1806
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,680
If it was poor white people, there would have been some rich white people hanging from trees.

1807
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:17,680
There weren't.

1808
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,680
Oh boy.

1809
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,680
Oh boy.

1810
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:24,720
I don't even want Barnes to speak.

1811
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,240
And now that he has, I regret it.

1812
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,020
The Klan was a false flag, my friend.

1813
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,920
That is, that is...

1814
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, it's a bummer.

1815
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,480
Oh boy.

1816
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:45,640
So also, he thinks not only that the Klan is a false flag, but that Antifa is, uh, they're

1817
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,640
hypocrites.

1818
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,240
If people want to look at Antifa, if Antifa was legitimately an anarchistic group, a group

1819
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:55,680
that was opposed to capitalism, why have they never attacked the Federal Reserve?

1820
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:02,120
But um...

1821
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,560
There are, you know, first of all, it's not an actual group, but also like there are people

1822
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,640
who associate with anti-fascism who are capitalist.

1823
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:15,120
There are people who are anti-fascist leaning who are anarchist or believe that there is

1824
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,120
a place for the state.

1825
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,440
You know, like it's not, it's anti-fascism.

1826
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,920
Here's not, I feel like he's missing that crucial aspect because I think it's, I think

1827
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:24,920
it's intentional.

1828
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,920
No, obviously it's intentional.

1829
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,920
He's a lawyer.

1830
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1831
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,960
No, you can't be like, if Antifa wants to be an anarchist group without immediately

1832
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,920
stopping and being like, does Antifa want to be an anarchist?

1833
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,640
Did they name themselves...

1834
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,640
Anarchy.

1835
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,160
Anarchist group or anti-capitalists, Antica.

1836
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:48,880
Like sure, we can do all of those things, but if you're describing it, it's called Antifa

1837
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,400
for fascism.

1838
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,320
You can be for capitalism and still against fascism, although one might argue that the

1839
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:59,760
eventual road will always lead to fascism, but that's a conversation for a different

1840
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,760
day.

1841
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:07,240
And I feel like prior to becoming an out-and-out white nationalist as he is now, Stefan Molyneux,

1842
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:12,440
the guy who Barnes is fine hanging out with, he was an anarcho-capitalist.

1843
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,440
He did say that.

1844
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,440
So.

1845
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,440
Yeah.

1846
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,440
Anyway.

1847
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:22,560
Hey, how about this, how many Wall Streets have you fucking occupied, you dumb shit?

1848
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,240
Why haven't they ever gone after the Fed?

1849
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,560
Who do you think occupied goddamn Wall Street?

1850
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,560
Well.

1851
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,560
Sure.

1852
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,560
But that was a false flag.

1853
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,560
Oh, that's true.

1854
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,560
Anyway.

1855
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,560
My bad.

1856
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Barnes skedaddles out because he's got to prep that lawsuit.

1857
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,560
Yeah, no, no.

1858
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,560
He's working.

1859
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,560
It's totally gonna work.

1860
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,560
Overnight.

1861
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,560
Yeah.

1862
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,560
Yeah.

1863
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,400
So Alex goes to calls and this caller, this little 10-second clip is perfect.

1864
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,240
They're announcing the new booster shots are going to be patches with micro glass that

1865
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,920
goes into your skin so they can track you.

1866
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,920
Did you know that?

1867
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,160
No, but I mean, I believe anything now and I just, I just.

1868
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,160
Yes, you will.

1869
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,160
Oh, oh no.

1870
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,160
No, no, no.

1871
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,160
Ma'am.

1872
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,160
Ma'am.

1873
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,160
No.

1874
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,160
Ma'am.

1875
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,160
Somebody save her.

1876
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,160
That was a perfect moment.

1877
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,160
Yeah.

1878
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,160
Alex says something and she's like, I didn't know that, but I'll believe anything.

1879
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,160
Yeah.

1880
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,160
You will.

1881
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,160
You will believe anything.

1882
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,160
So you're listening to this bullshit.

1883
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,160
Yeah.

1884
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:19,320
Man, you could probably run and win office as a Republican if your slogan was just, you'll

1885
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,920
believe any old shit I say.

1886
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:28,840
I bet, oh God, I bet if you did something that would be like universally decried as

1887
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,720
offensive and horrible.

1888
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,720
Yeah.

1889
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:36,120
Like just, I'm going to run for office, but I'm never going to wear a shirt.

1890
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,120
Yeah.

1891
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,200
You know, it's just like, yeah, I feel like we, most people wear shirts.

1892
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
I'm not a shirt guy.

1893
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,560
I just don't do shirts.

1894
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,560
Come on.

1895
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,620
I say it like it is shirtless.

1896
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:52,800
If you're really confident about it, I bet you could win on a GOP ticket.

1897
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,800
Probably.

1898
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,800
Yeah.

1899
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,800
Yeah.

1900
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,800
Cause they just don't fucking care.

1901
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,800
Yeah.

1902
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,440
They don't, they just hate the left.

1903
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,440
That's it.

1904
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:05,280
I stick it to the libs, but I insist on every public appearance that I have.

1905
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,120
I'm wearing a snake on my neck.

1906
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,520
Listen, listen, here's what we got.

1907
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,960
You want to stick it to the libs.

1908
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,360
You go with me.

1909
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,360
Shirt or no.

1910
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,680
You want to not stick it to the libs, you vote for one of those other assholes over

1911
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,680
there.

1912
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,680
They're not going to stick it to the libs.

1913
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,680
No, probably wearing a suit.

1914
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,780
Look, look, no shirt, no shoes, no service.

1915
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,640
No libs is what it is.

1916
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,000
No shirt, no shoes, no libs.

1917
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,200
No shirt, no shoes, no libs.

1918
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,200
Snake around my neck.

1919
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,200
Snake around my neck.

1920
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,200
Vote for me.

1921
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,200
Vote for me.

1922
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,480
So Alex, Alex has been having a good time on this, uh, this episode, but he kind of

1923
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,080
fucked up.

1924
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,520
He meant to play a bunch of videos of Antifa pretending to be cops.

1925
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,520
Sure.

1926
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,520
Sure.

1927
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,520
That sounds right.

1928
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,520
Um, but wait, I'm sorry.

1929
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,520
Antifa pretending to be cops.

1930
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,520
He just hasn't gotten to it though.

1931
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,120
And I really wanted to spend a half hour today on the Antifa videos of them acting like police

1932
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,080
and attacking everybody and going crazy and I'll try to play a few of the clips, but I'll

1933
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,160
just have to, I'll have to do it on the Sunday show.

1934
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:03,120
But I said four hours of your calls with your stories and I've been doing a pretty good

1935
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:08,920
job lately to get to these calls because they don't want this heard, they want this shutdown.

1936
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,360
But again, they're, they're, they're collapsing the economy and they're going to use a race

1937
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:18,760
war as the cover for the collapse and then blame that on the race war and the American

1938
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,760
people.

1939
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,760
So the banks don't get blamed.

1940
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:25,400
That's the big one ties together with the COVID that's a drill for martial law.

1941
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,880
But your calls actually are paramount above that.

1942
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,120
If I have the energy, I'm actually pretty exhausted right now before our, if you take

1943
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,960
about an hour off to do some, you know, research, I call that off, not talking for, I go back

1944
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:38,080
on air, but maybe I'll pop in there in the warm today.

1945
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,080
Wow.

1946
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:46,040
So, I mean, I, you know, that's difficult to follow just as ideas, but I guess the only

1947
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,360
thing I really take issue with is the idea that, well, there's a, you know, obviously

1948
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,500
there's going to be a global collapse and there's a race war coming naturally in order

1949
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:56,720
to make sure the bankers don't get blamed for that global class, but your calls are

1950
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,720
more important naturally.

1951
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,720
Absolutely.

1952
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,040
I don't know if I were a caller, I would take issue with that.

1953
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,880
I just don't even, I don't even know how to hear him.

1954
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,200
He's just saying words.

1955
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,200
Yeah.

1956
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,200
That's exactly what I'm hearing.

1957
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:12,880
I'm just hearing him say words like when he's, when you're following along with what he thinks

1958
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,200
is supposed to happen, what he's certain is supposed to happen, everything he's doing

1959
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,200
is insane.

1960
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,640
It is an insane person.

1961
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,640
Like that's what I'm saying.

1962
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,780
Is this real or fake?

1963
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:25,540
It doesn't matter if he believes this stuff, he's crazy.

1964
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:28,920
And if he doesn't believe this stuff, he's maybe more insane.

1965
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,920
Yeah.

1966
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,920
Cause this is...

1967
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,920
Ahhh!

1968
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,920
Yeah.

1969
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,160
So Alex does end up playing some videos of Antifa acting like cops.

1970
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,160
I think.

1971
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,160
I'm not sure.

1972
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,160
I didn't watch the video.

1973
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,840
I was just listening to the audio and this is a surreal thing if you are just listening

1974
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:49,160
to the audio because you can't see what's on the video and he doesn't say like, he doesn't

1975
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
narrate the video at all.

1976
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:57,020
Instead he just kind of mumbles about violence and it's very upsetting.

1977
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:01,480
They're like pretending and larping, they're like a SWAT team stopping a bank robber, but

1978
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,480
they're not.

1979
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,640
They're just beating people up and attacking people.

1980
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:10,400
I mean, I just, I couldn't be a cop and be around these people.

1981
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,920
I mean, it's just, it's just incredible.

1982
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,440
And then they go, don't attack us while they attack you.

1983
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,640
The left is just trash.

1984
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,640
And I'm sorry, man.

1985
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,000
I love that with the metal baton, they start attacking them.

1986
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,240
We're going to slit your throat, all this stuff.

1987
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,240
Huh?

1988
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,680
I mean, it's just who they are, man.

1989
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,160
They love it.

1990
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,160
I see.

1991
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,160
I can't get around that.

1992
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,280
I'd go, I'd go King Kong on those people.

1993
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,280
I mean, I'm telling you it'd be bad, man.

1994
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,280
Are you sure you don't want to fight a lawsuit?

1995
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,640
I got a real problem.

1996
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,840
You want to punch my buttons, be five or six people standing there and kick my ass.

1997
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,620
That punches the buttons, man.

1998
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:45,520
That the bunch of overwhelming group of people.

1999
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,280
That's when the big can of crazy man gets released and that's when people start getting

2000
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,280
hurt really bad.

2001
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,520
I mean, I even looking at it, I just, oh my God, I mean, those people would have their

2002
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:59,240
noses torn off, their heads bashed in, and then, uh, you know, some hat, somebody by

2003
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,320
one of them stabbed me from behind.

2004
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,120
I don't even care because I just destroy each person and one at a time only takes about

2005
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,120
five seconds.

2006
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,320
You actually get ahold of anybody can do this.

2007
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,600
Anybody can kill really what people have governors.

2008
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,600
I don't have one.

2009
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,600
Whoa.

2010
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,600
Okay.

2011
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,600
Oh, this has gone in a direction.

2012
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,600
Yeah.

2013
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,600
That's not good.

2014
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,240
Hey Alex, did you go to family court yesterday?

2015
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:26,560
Uh, well I do need to reestablish my male dominance, otherwise I won't have any self

2016
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,560
esteem whatsoever.

2017
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:32,720
And the only way I know how to express that is through fantasies of violence, which makes

2018
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,760
me a healthy person as everybody else.

2019
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,480
And assuring my audience that it's easy to kill people.

2020
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,900
Yeah, that's what it is.

2021
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,680
That's cause I'm a man, you know, I don't have a governor.

2022
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,840
God, I would, I would not like to see this kind of conversation on any program, like

2023
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:53,120
any program that's trying to be political or talk about issues, mumbling about murdering

2024
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,720
people is just, oof.

2025
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:02,220
Well, whoever, I mean, what lawyer was it that made it so that they couldn't show clips

2026
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,220
of his show?

2027
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,220
Barnes.

2028
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:05,220
Yeah.

2029
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,220
Was it Barnes?

2030
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,220
No, no, no.

2031
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:11,880
Cause, cause whoever did that, man, imagine just going to family court and just being

2032
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:16,440
like, Hey, after we went to family court last time, I'm going to play this clip of Alex

2033
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,600
on his show.

2034
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,720
It's very easy to kill.

2035
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,440
I do not have a governor.

2036
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,440
Yes.

2037
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,440
Most people think it's hard to kill.

2038
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,000
That's just cause they won't let themselves.

2039
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,240
I on the other hand, have an ease with murder.

2040
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,280
Your honor, could we please keep this man as far away from us as possible?

2041
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,260
Yes, of course.

2042
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:40,320
So Alex says something about murder that I actually kind of think is, I mean, it's not

2043
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,320
news.

2044
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,900
By the way, anybody can do this.

2045
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,580
Anybody can kill really easy.

2046
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:45,580
People have governors.

2047
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:46,580
I don't have one.

2048
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:49,520
And five, six people sort of follow me, even though I'm 47, I just young.

2049
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,960
I just want to, I want to tear them to pieces.

2050
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,400
And I know a lot of you have that in you too.

2051
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:58,460
And the left doesn't get that that whole veneer is starting to peel away, ladies and gentlemen.

2052
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,080
So I don't have a governor.

2053
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,940
No, I think we know that.

2054
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:03,480
And we have known that for a long time.

2055
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,840
We're very well aware of it.

2056
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,840
Yes.

2057
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,960
That's kind of been the whole thing about you and your types, Alex, is that you very

2058
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,000
clearly want to kill us.

2059
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Yeah.

2060
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,920
And we won't stop talking about it.

2061
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:21,720
In just, just amazing how in a very short period of time, you can say the left is just

2062
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,720
trash.

2063
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,720
They're just evil.

2064
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,720
They're just like this.

2065
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:29,120
Now, obviously I could kill and I want to, and I have no governor.

2066
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,120
And I know you do too.

2067
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,120
And you could kill.

2068
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,360
And it's much easier than you think.

2069
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,800
But that's the problem.

2070
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,920
That's the problem, Dan.

2071
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,120
The left is trash.

2072
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,120
Yeah.

2073
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,200
Now, obviously I have no governor or a moral system and I'm willing to kill.

2074
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:45,480
Despite being a Christian, I am ready and willing to kill with no governor.

2075
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,920
I have no governor.

2076
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:53,160
And the left thinks that they're all safe, but the veneer of our politeness and non-murdering

2077
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,480
is starting to slip.

2078
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,640
Hey buddy, it slipped a while ago.

2079
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,640
Yeah.

2080
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,640
Yeah.

2081
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,720
You remember when you stormed the god damn Capitol?

2082
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,720
Yeah.

2083
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,400
Or the Unite the Right rally or any of the...

2084
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,760
All the murders you guys do?

2085
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,020
Oh yeah, there were those too.

2086
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,020
There's all the fucking murders.

2087
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:10,280
The time Stuart Rhodes talks.

2088
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,280
Yeah.

2089
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,280
Yeah.

2090
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,280
That fucking psycho.

2091
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,280
Jesus.

2092
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,840
Anyway, we have one last clip here because Alex takes a call and I just want to play

2093
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,560
this because I think it's unhinged.

2094
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:28,880
One, I was going to see if you could hold a call-in prayer session show, like a segment

2095
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,760
hour for on Sunday or Sunday night or something like that.

2096
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,120
I think that's really smart.

2097
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,080
Or beyond that, people tell their testimony and talk about God and talk about how we need

2098
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,080
God.

2099
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,320
In fact, I don't think that's just an hour of a show.

2100
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:47,680
I'll do the next Sunday or a special show next week dedicated to God.

2101
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,680
You're right.

2102
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,680
All right.

2103
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,680
Thank you.

2104
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:51,680
Thank you.

2105
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,680
Yeah.

2106
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,080
Because on October 12th, 2016, you prayed for Trump to win and I prayed right along

2107
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,080
with you.

2108
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,800
And I think that granted the prayer, but...

2109
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:58,800
Yeah.

2110
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,040
I think our prayers got Trump elected and look, this is just like, this is great.

2111
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,640
If I were Alex, I would be so pumped about something like this because it's like, okay,

2112
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,760
the audience is starting to suggest that I become a televangelist.

2113
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,760
Yeah.

2114
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,320
If I can make this transition work...

2115
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,520
All I gotta do is just push a little bit through.

2116
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,520
Yes.

2117
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:20,960
If I can have a proof of concept where I start doing shows that are entirely pure religious

2118
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,920
nonsense and I can make that profitable, I can stop this whole bullshit.

2119
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,880
I can stop doing things that are going to get me sued all the time.

2120
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,360
I just want to scream at these people.

2121
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,360
I don't...

2122
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:34,360
Why...

2123
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,480
I wish I didn't have any...

2124
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,480
Governor?

2125
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:38,480
No.

2126
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,480
Biblical education.

2127
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,480
Oh.

2128
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,480
I just...

2129
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:42,480
It drives me insane.

2130
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:48,120
It was hammered into me so much, so fucking much, now that the idea of these people saying,

2131
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,400
oh, we're so fucking Christian and the left is evil and immoral and shit.

2132
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,920
Read your goddamn Bible.

2133
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,920
Do you imagine?

2134
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:55,920
It's in there.

2135
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,400
Can you imagine how Jesus would feel?

2136
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,400
It's in there.

2137
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,800
If you made money off of praying to him.

2138
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,800
No.

2139
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,800
He's going to...

2140
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,800
No.

2141
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,680
He's going to do an hour long show just about prayer for you, and then he's going to plug

2142
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,560
in the goddamn middle of it.

2143
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:10,560
In the middle of your prayer.

2144
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,560
And you're going to tell me.

2145
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,440
You're going to tell me you're Christian.

2146
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,520
You fucking pieces of shit.

2147
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,520
Please smite the global.

2148
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,520
God damn it.

2149
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,240
I hate these fucking people.

2150
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,120
Please smite my enemies.

2151
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,120
Amen.

2152
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,640
Also, God, I should tell you it's 25% off.

2153
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:26,640
I know.

2154
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,640
On bodies.

2155
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,640
It's unreal.

2156
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,640
Unreal.

2157
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:34,720
It is just, it is just sitting there.

2158
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,720
And I see...

2159
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,720
Yeah.

2160
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:41,720
I think, I think it would introduce a difficulty for me in terms of like, if his show went

2161
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,440
full televangelist, I think I'd have to keep...

2162
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,440
Having me here?

2163
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,440
No.

2164
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,680
I think I'd have to keep doing it.

2165
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:48,680
Right?

2166
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,000
I have to keep following the show.

2167
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Sure.

2168
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But at the same time...

2169
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,120
I mean, it's a new, it's a new frontier for us.

2170
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:55,120
Yeah.

2171
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,020
And to be clear, I don't think that necessarily that's where he's going.

2172
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,120
Although I do think it would be a smart decision.

2173
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,120
Probably.

2174
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:04,400
Which is why whenever there's sort of indications of an instinct to go that way, it's like,

2175
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,840
well, you should take that offer, Ant-Man.

2176
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,840
Probably smart.

2177
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,840
Yep.

2178
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:14,400
If you can survive these cases that you're in the middle of now and get to televangelism,

2179
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,400
you're golden.

2180
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,400
God, yeah.

2181
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,400
Jim Bakker's been scamming for decades.

2182
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,400
Decades!

2183
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,400
He went to fucking prison.

2184
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,400
He's not even trying.

2185
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,400
No.

2186
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:27,520
He stopped trying after he went to prison and just smoothly walked back into it.

2187
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,520
He has a compound.

2188
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,520
He has a compound.

2189
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,520
In the Ozarks.

2190
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,520
Everything you talk about.

2191
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,520
And no one talks about it.

2192
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,800
Everything you talk about, like I want to move into the middle of nowhere.

2193
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,880
Just do it, Jim Bakker.

2194
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,080
He sells survival food.

2195
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:40,600
He owns people who live in his compound.

2196
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,600
That's real.

2197
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,600
He can tell them what to do whenever he wants.

2198
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:45,600
Oh my God.

2199
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,600
Yeah.

2200
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,600
That's the hammock.

2201
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,480
That's the retirement that all shitheads like Alex should dream of.

2202
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:52,480
Yeah.

2203
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,520
Anyway, I thought this was fun.

2204
01:33:53,520 --> 01:34:02,680
If only because this study was just a travesty of Alex just being unable to even deal with

2205
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,120
any kind of source material.

2206
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,080
No, that wasn't even redacted.

2207
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,120
That was lit on fire before he even had the chance to read it.

2208
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,120
Yeah.

2209
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,360
It made me think very frequently.

2210
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,880
All right, shut up, Jones.

2211
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:14,880
Quite a few times.

2212
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,880
Nicely done.

2213
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:16,880
Thanks.

2214
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:17,880
Well done.

2215
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:18,880
Nice bookend.

2216
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,880
We came full circle.

2217
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,960
There was a narrative through line and you closed it out strong.

2218
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,720
And I came up with Spouse Mouse.

2219
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,720
Yes, exactly.

2220
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,720
Yeah.

2221
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,720
In a stroke of genius.

2222
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:28,720
Yeah.

2223
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,720
Oh, God.

2224
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:30,720
It was a good day.

2225
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,720
It was a good day.

2226
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,240
I am never going to top Spouse Mouse.

2227
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,240
You'll top Spouse Mouse.

2228
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,240
I'll try.

2229
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,800
Dan, Spouse Mouse is not that good.

2230
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,920
I might be tired.

2231
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:44,080
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back for another episode soon.

2232
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,620
But until then, we have a website.

2233
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,620
We do have a website.

2234
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,620
It's knowledgefight.com.

2235
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:48,620
Yes.

2236
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,620
We're also on Twitter.

2237
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,620
We are on Twitter.

2238
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:51,620
It's adagotabedjordan.com.

2239
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:52,620
Knowledge underscore fight.

2240
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,620
We are on Facebook.

2241
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:54,620
We are on Facebook.

2242
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:59,960
If you could please find a local charity or a bail fund in your area.

2243
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,960
Also check for a new episode of our role playing.

2244
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,960
Oh, yeah.

2245
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,960
That's right.

2246
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,960
Middle of the week.

2247
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,960
Yes.

2248
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:08,960
We will be putting that out middle of the week.

2249
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,840
Should have another exciting installment of Dutch Wildfang and Friends.

2250
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,840
Let's hope so.

2251
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,840
That's what I'm calling it from now on.

2252
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,840
Dutch Wildfang and Friends.

2253
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,400
I thought God's Damn Wizard was a terrible title.

2254
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,400
No, I know.

2255
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,400
It's a play on God damn.

2256
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,560
I assume there's a wizard we're going to run into eventually.

2257
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,560
Yeah.

2258
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,560
Yeah.

2259
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:24,560
So enjoy that.

2260
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,560
Look for that.

2261
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,560
Indeed.

2262
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,560
We'll be back.

2263
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,560
But until then, I'm Neo.

2264
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,560
I'm Leo.

2265
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,560
I'm DZX.

2266
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,560
Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

2267
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,560
And now here comes the sex robots.

2268
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,560
Andy in Kansas.

2269
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,560
You're on the air.

2270
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,560
Thanks for holding.

2271
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,560
Hello, Alex.

2272
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,560
I'm a first time caller.

2273
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,560
I'm a huge fan.

2274
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,560
I love your work.

2275
01:35:39,560 --> 01:36:07,560
I love you.
