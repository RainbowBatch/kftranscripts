N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys. Knowledgefight.

00:30.000 --> 00:47.000
Dan and Jordan, Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:47.000 --> 00:59.000
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight. I'm Dan.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Jordan.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
We're a couple dudes. Let's sit around, drink novelty, worship Celine.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Yep, oh boy.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We're going to struggle with this for a while.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
We should have added this earlier on, maybe in our 300th episode, and then we'd be practiced by now.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I just need to also be more mindful of it.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
True, true.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
When I'm starting the episode, just remember, novelty beverage is out, worship Celine in.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Right. I mean, when you're starting any religion, you want to be more mindful.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Sure.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I think that's the point.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
There needs to be some intention to it, which we're failing.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Sure, sure. Yeah.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, that would be our religion.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Eh, came back to life, who gives a shit? Whatever.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Live your own way.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah. So Jordan, how are you doing?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm doing well, Dan. I have a quick question for you.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Sure.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
What is your bright spot today?

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
My bright spot today is actually, I think, okay, so you know how like in school you'd be like,

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
when am I ever going to need to use this?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Sure.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
You talk about like math or anything.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Sure, sure.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I sometimes feel that way about this podcast.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Like I learn stuff and I'm like, when am I ever going to need to do this?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Fair, fair.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
I spend a lot of time learning things that will never, ever come up in anyone's daily life.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
No, no, no. I think you're going to have a lot of natural sounding conversations that just end up in this information.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I had a moment where it actually came into play.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Oh shit.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
And it felt really good.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Okay, what happened?

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
So I was taking a Lyft ride from coming home and the guy, it was a very nice conversation.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Nothing against this guy.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
But we were talking about some of the like difficulties of the COVID year and all this.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
And the conversation veered into talking about like public debt.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Sure, sure.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
And the deficit.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Sure.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
And so this guy was saying that-

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
The Fed was started by three senators.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
No, no, no, no.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Nothing that hyper specific.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Not there.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
No.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Okay.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Just that like China owns half our debt.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
And without even missing a beat, I was like, that's not true.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
And he's like, yeah, they own a lot.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm like, they own a bit, but not nearly that much.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I've looked into this.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
It's mostly stuff we owe ourselves.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Listen, sir, sir, I am one of the few people who, when you hear I've looked into this,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
you fucking listen.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
China owns a lot of debt.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Nope.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Nope.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Lyft ride over.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
And you jumped out the window.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Guy was very nice and I didn't like want to shame him or be a dick about it or anything.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
No, of course not.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
But it was a rare occasion where it was like, ha ha ha.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Not going to back down on this one.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
This is the hill I die on.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
So how about you?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
What's your bright spot?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I've been to my first Cubs game in two years, Dan.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Why was that?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Why was that?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Why was what, Dan?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Don't make me do this.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Happy birthday, Jordan.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Thanks, Dan.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Fine.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
It was your birthday this weekend.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
It was my birthday this weekend.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Happy birthday.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I went to the game.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
It was fantastic.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.500
I have a very fun story that is going to sound self-aggrandizing at first, but it is very

03:58.500 --> 03:59.800
much not about that.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.000
Frank Rizzo said you had the best arm in the game.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
If only.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
If only, Dan.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Is that his first name?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Anthony Rizzo.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Anthony Rizzo.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Who's Frank Rizzo?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Frank Rizzo is a guy.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Who is Frank Rizzo?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Character or something?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, I think so.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Anyway, keep going.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Anyways, everybody was socially distanced in the park.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.480
It was good stuff, and row behind us about 10 seats away, there was this dude who showed

04:24.480 --> 04:28.640
up wearing a goddamn t-shirt.

04:28.640 --> 04:36.560
It was a nice day, but at Wrigley, whatever it is outside, it is 20 degrees lower than

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
that.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.560
Sure.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
On the thing.

04:39.560 --> 04:43.660
This guy is absolutely freezing, and then the sun goes behind the clouds, and everybody

04:43.660 --> 04:44.800
is freezing.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.820
Everybody is curled up, and I keep turning and looking back at this fucking guy with

04:48.820 --> 04:50.840
his bare sleeves.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.280
I'm losing my arm.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.240
I'm losing my mind, right?

04:54.240 --> 04:55.240
I have to go.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.360
I can't do this anymore.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.160
So I go and I buy him a fucking blanket.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.960
I have to.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.720
This is not me being generous.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.160
This is me like, I can't watch this fucking game unless you do something.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.600
So it's either you get a blanket, or I ask them to make you leave.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.600
Those are your options.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
Blanket it is.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.600
It's not a self-aggrandizing story at all.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.520
You got to buy him a Snuggie.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
That's basically what it was.

05:18.520 --> 05:22.720
So it turns out Frank Rizzo was the racist mayor of Philadelphia.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.720
He was a notorious-

05:24.720 --> 05:26.720
That's why I remember the name!

05:26.720 --> 05:28.720
Yeah, he's a piece of shit!

05:28.720 --> 05:33.920
I'm looking at his Wikipedia page here, and as mayor, Rizzo was a strong opponent of desegregation

05:33.920 --> 05:38.940
in Philadelphia schools, and prevented the construction of public housing in majority

05:38.940 --> 05:40.480
white neighborhoods.

05:40.480 --> 05:47.160
While running for a third term, Rizzo urged supporters to quote, vote white.

05:47.160 --> 05:52.360
You know, I think that says a lot about us, that the first Rizzos that come to mind are

05:52.360 --> 05:56.160
in your situation, anti-communist nightmares!

05:56.160 --> 05:57.160
And in mine.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.280
Well, also Ratso Rizzo, wasn't he a Muppet?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.280
Ratso was great.

06:00.280 --> 06:05.840
Anyway, Jordan, today we have a prison day episode to go over, we're going to be talking

06:05.840 --> 06:09.640
about- our last episode was May 7th, 2003.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.640
Correct.

06:10.640 --> 06:15.320
Now today we're going to be talking about May 6th and 7th, 2021.

06:15.320 --> 06:16.320
Blackjack.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.600
I think we both stopped for a second to see if the other would do it first!

06:20.600 --> 06:22.480
What is wrong with us?

06:22.480 --> 06:23.880
Why can't we do our own bits?

06:23.880 --> 06:28.520
Well that's like, you know, when you get to the door at the same time with somebody who's

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
holding the door for who.

06:29.520 --> 06:34.640
It was like I was letting you go, excuse me sir, after you.

06:34.640 --> 06:39.880
This is interesting, it's a fun stretch of time and I'm excited to get into it.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.680
But before we do, Jordan, we've got a wonk and a technocrat to give a shout out to.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.320
First, a wonk, thank you so much, Marnix!

06:47.320 --> 06:48.440
You're now a policy wonk.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.440
I'm a policy wonk!

06:49.440 --> 06:50.440
Thank you Marnix!

06:50.440 --> 06:56.120
And technocrat, Dirk Gently's cat, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.440
I'm a policy wonk.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.560
Crikey mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:01.800 --> 07:04.440
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, alright?

07:04.440 --> 07:06.000
Let's just get down to business.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.080
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.000
Why you pimps so good?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.640
My neck is freakishly large.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.160
I declare info war on you.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.440
Dirk Gently's cat would also like to say happy birthday to Will S.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.120
Ooh, happy birthday Will S.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.480
So Dirk, you might notice there's a few, only a few policy wonks.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
It's a bit shorter.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.560
Yeah, and that's because in honor of your birthday, we have some birthday shout outs.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.560
Okay, okay, alright, we're doing May all at once.

07:31.560 --> 07:36.120
Not all of May, but it turns out there's a cluster right around here that I think it's

07:36.120 --> 07:37.440
because of you.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
Naturally.

07:38.440 --> 07:45.000
So, Steven, happy birthday from Keith, that was over the weekend on the 9th, the 9th.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Happy birthday.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Day after your birthday.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Sunday.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Oh, come on, don't give people...

07:49.000 --> 07:50.280
Don't give people detailed information.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.680
My passwords aren't that strong.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
Oh no.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.080
You might want to rethink those.

07:55.080 --> 08:00.400
So also, Corinna, happy birthday, that's coming up on the 11th, so coming up in the middle

08:00.400 --> 08:01.400
of this week.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
Happy birthday, Corinna.

08:02.400 --> 08:07.800
And Tom, from his brother, Megaron.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.720
He's just ten rons put together into one giant ron, naturally.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.240
Is that how it works with the Queen's measurements?

08:14.240 --> 08:17.240
I know, do you mean like he's ten stone?

08:17.240 --> 08:18.240
Metric?

08:18.240 --> 08:19.760
Couldn't come up with the word metric?

08:19.760 --> 08:22.520
I was going to go with Power Rangers, he's a megazord.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.520
Okay.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.960
And that is also on the 11th, happy birthday, Tom from Megaron.

08:27.960 --> 08:35.000
Also, we have something that I missed in the mailbag last time we got together, so this

08:35.000 --> 08:40.160
was something that I actually had on the list that I was going to bring up last time, but

08:40.160 --> 08:46.440
I had forgotten the note in the other room, and this note is too good not to share with

08:46.440 --> 08:47.440
the world.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.760
Dear Dan and Jordan, the Society for the Preservation of Raptor Royalty have determined that I am

08:51.760 --> 08:57.640
no longer fit to be regent for this raptor princess, as I have been traveling and moving

08:57.640 --> 08:59.400
too much to keep her safe.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.800
Dan, I hope she doesn't eat your chocolate.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.240
Jordan, I hope Dan doesn't eat your chocolate.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.600
Thank you so much for your wonderful podcast and for the cool community on Facebook.

09:09.600 --> 09:19.520
You guys help me stay sane, happy euphoria chocolating, I think, euphoric chocolating.

09:19.520 --> 09:26.600
From Karen C, so this ceramic raptor princess is just the coolest thing.

09:26.600 --> 09:31.400
I have to assume that Karen found this at like a thrift store or something, but it is

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
just amazing.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.400
It's so cool.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.760
I'm going to post a picture of this on...

09:35.760 --> 09:40.880
It's really kind of, it looks like it was made with, somebody made it and they were

09:40.880 --> 09:43.840
like, this is going to come in handy 20 or 30 years from now.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.840
20 or 30?

09:44.840 --> 09:46.520
This looks like it's from the 20s.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.080
It does kind of look, wow, that is old.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.880
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

09:50.880 --> 09:51.880
Thank you so much.

09:51.880 --> 09:56.800
Also, this was the package that came with all the candy that was marked Dan stop opening

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
Jordan's candy.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.800
That was the best.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.800
Yeah.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.800
That was the best.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.840
There was some candy and I was like, Dan, you can't eat this candy.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.840
No.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.720
It was the package that had a bunch of points.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.720
You opened it.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.720
So why don't you describe it?

10:08.720 --> 10:10.280
That was the best part of this.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.280
The first message, it was wrapped really, really heavily.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.280
And the first message was like, Dan, this is Jordan's candy.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.280
Don't eat it.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.960
And you just gave it to me from there.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.200
So I took it home and I started trying to unwrap it.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.920
The record should show that I did follow the instructions.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.880
Yes, that's important because there were further instructions as you opened it up.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.080
Down on the paper was written like, Dan, if you've made it this far, you need to stop.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.880
And then still further was like, Dan, you've stolen Jordan's candy at this point.

10:37.880 --> 10:38.880
It was just guilt.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.880
It was fantastic.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.800
I can't imagine how ashamed I would be if I saw those notes.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.280
If you saw the second note, that was the best part.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.360
The best part was I was like, God damn it.

10:47.360 --> 10:52.720
If Dan had seen the second note, it would have been just, he would have spent two days

10:52.720 --> 10:56.440
thinking about how he's the person who made it to the second note.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.600
I feel like it's a test I didn't know I had passed.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
Yes, you passed it.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
So that's great.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
Thank you so much, Karen.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.560
That was a fun insult, I guess.

11:05.560 --> 11:11.160
No, I think it was a test and you passed it and you're now King Arthur?

11:11.160 --> 11:17.360
And the raptor princess will be well taken care of on our shelf of curiosities.

11:17.360 --> 11:24.080
So Jordan, May 6th and 7th, I should say that this is a little fun for me.

11:24.080 --> 11:29.920
There's actually, I mean, granted, it is like I brought up, like we're just anti-vax bullshit.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
Right, right, right.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
Whatever.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.600
But there's a specific in this episode that allowed me to dig in a little bit and I enjoyed

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
that.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
Excellent.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.600
So here's an out of context drop from today's show.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.600
All right.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.600
Shut up, Jones.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
Okay.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.400
Might be able to use that quite a bit in the future.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.580
I would stick with that one.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.580
So here we go.

11:45.580 --> 11:51.400
Alex is starting out this May 6th show and there's, see if you can think of a children's

11:51.400 --> 11:53.880
story that comes to mind when you hear this.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.880
Okay.

11:54.880 --> 12:01.520
The information I got before the broadcast started, dovetailed with all the major research,

12:01.520 --> 12:04.200
scores of top scientists in other major studies.

12:04.200 --> 12:12.000
But when I read the study from an extremely prestigious viral research institute at the

12:12.000 --> 12:17.600
University of Texas, Galveston, where they do level four bio weapons research, I was

12:17.600 --> 12:20.120
completely blown away.

12:20.120 --> 12:25.240
And quite frankly, had trouble even being on air at this point.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.640
This audience is millions of people.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.640
You're incredible.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.640
You're amazing.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.080
But I've learned how the paradox works.

12:31.080 --> 12:38.280
But I said, I have total proof that they knew that the COVID-19 vaccines, both mRNA and

12:38.280 --> 12:41.600
virus vector delivery systems.

12:41.600 --> 12:48.200
So both the Moderna, the Pfizer mRNA, and then the AstraZeneca and J and J shots, the

12:48.200 --> 12:56.720
two different classes in the main literature warns that it causes massive auto-immune response

12:56.720 --> 13:02.040
in the brain, the heart, and in the cardiovascular system, and that they recommend it not be

13:02.040 --> 13:05.760
done because it caused massive death in the lab animals.

13:05.760 --> 13:11.800
If I had that info, which I do, and I cover it here on air, it just gets lost in the background

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
noise.

13:12.800 --> 13:18.280
But if I built it up and said, oh, this Saturday, I'm going to do a special show for three hours,

13:18.280 --> 13:22.960
commercial free, everybody tune in, we would have millions and millions of people that

13:22.960 --> 13:27.360
tuned in specifically for that information.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.840
They would take it very seriously, like they were at a restaurant waiting for a big, nice

13:31.840 --> 13:39.000
plate of food to come out, devour it, and then share it with others mentally.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.480
And that's basically where we are.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.640
Also, this audience is incredibly influential.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.620
A lot of important people listen, but this is at this point, I should probably just go

13:47.620 --> 13:54.320
off air and, or have Owen Schroyer come in and do a great job hosting, and just go show

13:54.320 --> 13:55.320
this document.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.320
That's definitely fiction.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.320
Yeah.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.080
So I just keep hearing the boy who cried wolf here.

14:01.080 --> 14:06.080
This is a guy who's like, I have said that I have solved every problem too many times,

14:06.080 --> 14:08.360
and now it's just background dressing.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.360
Can't really pull this off.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.360
People don't get excited anymore.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.360
Not really doing it.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.800
And now the only way for me to escalate things is to do a show on my day off, because that

14:15.800 --> 14:17.680
makes it look like I'm serious.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.680
I guess.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.200
And, oh God, Diminishing Returns, oh no.

14:22.200 --> 14:26.280
It's almost as if there was some sort of law that somebody wrote about Diminishing Returns.

14:26.280 --> 14:30.240
Also, I don't remember if I pulled a clip of this, but later in the show, so Alex is

14:30.240 --> 14:33.920
saying that he's going to have to come back on Saturday to cover this thing, this mega

14:33.920 --> 14:36.120
bombshell because it's the only way he can get attention.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.120
Can't not.

14:37.120 --> 14:41.160
He does realize, ah shit, I'm supposed to take my daughter fishing on Saturday.

14:41.160 --> 14:45.320
So he gets a pail of God and he's like, maybe I'll do it on Sunday, I don't know.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.600
This, this man is truly the tip of the spear.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
Yes.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
Tireless.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.680
The study that Alex is referring to is from 2012, and honestly, he's messing up some details,

14:54.680 --> 14:57.440
but he's more right than he usually is here.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.440
Interesting.

14:58.440 --> 15:04.140
Granted, this is a study about SARS, not SARS-CoV-2, but in terms of the level I'm used to him

15:04.140 --> 15:09.480
making things up, I was surprised to open the study and see this in the conclusion section.

15:09.480 --> 15:15.040
Quote, these SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
with SARS-CoV.

15:16.040 --> 15:23.160
However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrences of TH2 type immunopathology

15:23.160 --> 15:28.400
suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV compounds was induced.

15:28.400 --> 15:33.960
Caution in proceeding to application of SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.020
That's pretty interesting.

15:35.020 --> 15:36.600
And on its own, it sounds pretty scary.

15:36.600 --> 15:41.820
Like the idea of making a coronavirus vaccine for humans is something that shouldn't be

15:41.820 --> 15:42.820
done.

15:42.820 --> 15:46.960
But it's pretty important to recognize that this is a part of medical literature history,

15:46.960 --> 15:49.100
and that's not a static thing.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.520
This probably doesn't need to be said, but changes have been made since 2012.

15:52.520 --> 15:57.080
Additionally, the circumstances were different with a worldwide outbreak happening now creating

15:57.080 --> 16:00.020
necessity, which of course is the mother of invention.

16:00.020 --> 16:03.920
You can find some discussion of this very study Alex is referencing in more detailed

16:03.920 --> 16:07.920
write-ups about the path that research has taken in terms of developing a coronavirus

16:07.920 --> 16:12.600
vaccine going through SARS, MERS, and now SARS-CoV-2.

16:12.600 --> 16:17.200
If Alex is just looking for flashy ways to smear science, he could find all sorts of

16:17.200 --> 16:21.520
studies from the past that have shown difficulties with vaccine development, but that game relies

16:21.520 --> 16:26.760
on pretending that people don't learn from these studies and then adjust their approaches.

16:26.760 --> 16:31.040
One important thing to recognize is that the study that Alex is referring to, which you

16:31.040 --> 16:36.360
can find by googling the title, Immunization with SARS Coronavirus Vaccines Leads to Pulmonary

16:36.360 --> 16:40.440
Immunopathology on Challenge with the SARS Virus.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.440
That's the title of it.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.360
If you look for it, it's about completely different vaccines than the ones that have

16:45.360 --> 16:47.560
been developed in response to COVID.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.080
If you just read the first few pages of the study, you see that the vaccines that were

16:51.080 --> 16:53.240
tested in this were two varieties.

16:53.240 --> 16:58.660
They were inactivated whole virus vaccines or virus-like particle vaccines.

16:58.660 --> 17:03.480
The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based vaccines which work entirely differently than

17:03.480 --> 17:07.680
either of the types in this study, so there's no direct relevance between the shots and

17:07.680 --> 17:09.520
this study at all.

17:09.520 --> 17:14.200
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, which is fairly similar to the virus-like

17:14.200 --> 17:17.920
particle approach, but with a very important distinction.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.880
The virus-like particle vaccines in the study use the structural elements of SARS devoid

17:21.880 --> 17:28.000
of any viral genomes to trigger an immune response in people, whereas the J&J vaccine

17:28.000 --> 17:32.740
uses a non-infectious virus to create the spike protein of COVID, which then teaches

17:32.740 --> 17:36.760
our body to recognize that specific spike protein and fight it.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.160
The point here is that this study Alex is covering is not a bombshell.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.880
It does not require coming in on Saturday, but it does have a couple of good buzzwords

17:43.880 --> 17:47.460
that jump off the page, and if you don't pay too much attention, it can kind of look like

17:47.460 --> 17:51.740
it supports its narratives, Alex's narratives, but it's all bullshit.

17:51.740 --> 17:58.680
This is going to be one of the things that he talks about almost exclusively, and it's

17:58.680 --> 18:01.880
amazing to see how much he just makes up.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.320
He's just making shit up.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.320
It's amazing.

18:04.320 --> 18:12.880
And look, okay, you can tell me the challenges and the things that were wrong in 2012, right?

18:12.880 --> 18:18.520
But if you tell me that they're the same now, how many iPhones was that a go?

18:18.520 --> 18:19.960
Was that, wait, what was that?

18:19.960 --> 18:22.120
Was that the iPhone 4 years?

18:22.120 --> 18:24.540
We're better than that now.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.720
People were still talking about the Mayan calendar.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.720
Exactly.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.720
Yeah, we're fine, okay?

18:29.720 --> 18:33.980
Don't tell me that in 2012, oh, in 2012, they had trouble making a vaccine.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.160
So we should stop.

18:35.160 --> 18:41.480
Well, there's a lot of variables that go into it and actually color the progression of the

18:41.480 --> 18:42.480
vaccine's development.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.480
Totally.

18:43.480 --> 18:47.880
And some of that we'll discuss a little bit later, but look, dude, Alex found out about

18:47.880 --> 18:51.560
this and he is fucking mad.

18:51.560 --> 18:57.920
This could save hundreds of millions, if not billions of people.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.720
I thought it was over for humanity, again.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.360
I'm unable to continue the broadcast at this point.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.760
This is not a drama.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.760
I just can't do it.

19:08.760 --> 19:12.480
I was already doing too much this morning on other big subjects and then I got blindsided

19:12.480 --> 19:20.620
by this and I'm in a controlled rage right now and I've got to take some time off, so

19:20.620 --> 19:21.620
that's just the way it is.

19:21.620 --> 19:25.100
I don't even know if I'm coming back anymore.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.680
Maybe they need to kill everybody because the public doesn't care.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.680
Maybe you deserve to die.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.680
Okay.

19:30.680 --> 19:36.040
It was at this point that I suspected Alex was in a bad mood about something.

19:36.040 --> 19:40.640
Maybe something in his personal life was not exactly to his liking.

19:40.640 --> 19:46.880
Why are so many people willing to follow somebody that publicly pouts like a whiny baby?

19:46.880 --> 19:47.880
What are you talking about?

19:47.880 --> 19:48.880
Jordan.

19:48.880 --> 19:49.880
Maybe you all should just die.

19:49.880 --> 19:50.880
Jordan.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
Great.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.880
Yes.

19:52.880 --> 19:53.880
We want you to lead the fucking resistance.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.400
Jordan, this isn't a drama.

19:57.400 --> 20:02.160
Jordan brought this study to his attention when he had already done so much work and

20:02.160 --> 20:04.360
now everyone's got to die.

20:04.360 --> 20:12.520
I just don't remember fucking Che Guevara in the middle of the revolution just being

20:12.520 --> 20:13.520
like, you know what guys?

20:13.520 --> 20:14.520
Fine.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.520
I just don't even, no, no, no.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.520
I just don't even care anymore.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
I don't even want to lead this revolution.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.520
I'm sick of this.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.520
Yeah.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.520
I'm sick of this.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
To quote Castro, wah.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.520
Yeah.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
Yeah.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
Jesus.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.520
Yep.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.980
I mean, folks wants to protest about this study, man.

20:27.980 --> 20:31.360
He wants to get out there and bullhorn like his roots.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.480
Like he wants to get back to who he was in waking life.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.600
That image of a guy driving around red in the face.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.600
Hero.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.840
There's no doubt about this as a mass kill operation.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.840
No doubt.

20:43.840 --> 20:48.320
Maybe we should all go protest at Dell Children's Hospital or maybe go protest at the FBI in

20:48.320 --> 20:49.320
North Austin.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.560
I mean, I don't know what you do.

20:50.560 --> 20:56.960
I mean, to draw attention and bullhorn here is the university of Texas prestigious bio

20:56.960 --> 21:04.020
weapons research lab saying any vaccines for the coronavirus family cause massive auto

21:04.020 --> 21:12.880
immune responses, strokes and heart attacks and blood clots.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.120
Look at this.

21:14.120 --> 21:18.840
They studied it on a whole bunch of animals and it killed mass numbers of them.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.720
And we've already known this.

21:20.720 --> 21:25.120
So there are some very basic lies Alex is telling about the study just in that little

21:25.120 --> 21:26.120
rant.

21:26.120 --> 21:29.280
And if you pay attention to the specific things he's lying about, you can see his motives

21:29.280 --> 21:30.840
really clearly.

21:30.840 --> 21:34.520
The first thing to be very clear about is that this study only had to do with reactions

21:34.520 --> 21:36.360
to a vaccine in mice.

21:36.360 --> 21:40.060
At the end of the study, they even say, quote, limitations of the present studies include

21:40.060 --> 21:44.720
their performance in mice only and uncertainty of the relevance of rodent models to SARS

21:44.720 --> 21:47.460
coronavirus vaccines in humans.

21:47.460 --> 21:51.800
Max is skimming the study, so he's only looking at the first page and abstract, basically.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.360
And if you only look at that and you don't actually read it, you might think that there

21:55.360 --> 21:57.420
are more animals involved.

21:57.420 --> 22:01.680
In the design section of the abstract, it says, quote, four candidate vaccines for humans

22:01.680 --> 22:08.820
with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated on a mouse model of SARS and a VLP vaccine,

22:08.820 --> 22:13.460
the vaccine given to ferrets and non-human primates, another whole virus vaccine and

22:13.460 --> 22:16.740
an RDNA produced S protein.

22:16.740 --> 22:21.520
Ferrets and non-human primates are referenced, but not as participants in the study.

22:21.520 --> 22:26.080
The context of that is that VLP vaccines are typically the type that are given to those

22:26.080 --> 22:27.080
animals.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.080
If you weren't paying attention to the study at all and you just wanted to use the appearance

22:30.080 --> 22:34.320
of it as a prop to scare people, it'd be really easy to see multiple animal names in the first

22:34.320 --> 22:35.640
page and just kind of run with it.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.640
Yeah.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.640
Which is what Alex is doing.

22:37.640 --> 22:41.960
Yeah, he's painting that like 12 monkeys picture where there's all these animals in cages in

22:41.960 --> 22:43.880
like a dark lit room somewhere.

22:43.880 --> 22:44.880
Yeah.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.320
So Alex is making up that the study showed that mass numbers of animals were killed because

22:48.320 --> 22:49.680
of the vaccine.

22:49.680 --> 22:53.440
There weren't massive numbers of mice involved to begin with, and if you read the study,

22:53.440 --> 22:56.060
you would know how the study was designed.

22:56.060 --> 23:01.400
They vaccinated the mice with the different vaccines and 56 days later, actually that's

23:01.400 --> 23:06.740
not entirely true, 56 days into the study, five mice from each group were killed to assess

23:06.740 --> 23:11.200
how well the vaccines had worked and to gauge lung issues that existed.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.720
The remaining mice in each group were challenged with live SARS and then killed two days later

23:15.720 --> 23:17.720
so their lungs could be studied.

23:17.720 --> 23:21.340
There's no indication that lung issues or vaccine concerns killed even a single mouse

23:21.340 --> 23:22.720
in this study.

23:22.720 --> 23:26.320
Alex is making that up to make this story seem more interesting to his audience.

23:26.320 --> 23:31.520
Third, Alex is making up the effects that this study found in vaccinated mice who were

23:31.520 --> 23:33.760
faced with a SARS challenge.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.400
He's including autoimmune conditions in the list because that's been a big talking point

23:37.400 --> 23:41.360
on Infowars for a long time, so it's meant to give him the appearance of being right.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.720
Strokes, heart attacks, and blood clots are included because these are the things that

23:44.720 --> 23:48.840
people have been discussing as possibly related to various vaccines for COVID-19.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.840
Naturally.

23:49.840 --> 23:53.920
There's not evidence of a causal link, but a public conversation about concerns surrounding

23:53.920 --> 23:58.320
those issues has been going on, and Alex is trying to exacerbate those concerns and scare

23:58.320 --> 23:59.320
his audience.

23:59.320 --> 24:04.320
And in the study, as we know, the only real result was all of the mice had increased flatulence.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.000
That was not in the study.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Oh, are you sure?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
It should have been.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.660
The actual study doesn't involve any of the conditions that Alex was listing.

24:11.660 --> 24:16.000
The effects studied were entirely surrounding damage to lung tissue.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.160
One of the following must be true, and I cannot stress this enough.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.240
Alex has either not read this study at all and is just making all this stuff up, or he

24:24.240 --> 24:27.860
has read the study and he knows that he's lying to his audience about what it says to

24:27.860 --> 24:29.040
scare them.

24:29.040 --> 24:32.960
There isn't a middle ground, but I will say that in that first possibility, that first

24:32.960 --> 24:36.080
category is skimmed it and read a few words.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.240
Yeah, that is definitely more likely.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.560
Yeah, but it's still just making up what you think those words are.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
It's bullshit.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.560
Yeah.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
And I love it.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
I love it.

24:46.560 --> 24:51.700
I imagine when he looks at a article, it probably looks like, when you and I look at something

24:51.700 --> 24:54.200
to read, we like see all the words, right?

24:54.200 --> 24:58.520
I imagine every time he looks at one of these, it's like a redacted document in his brain.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.920
Like his brain just cuts out all the words that aren't like usable.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.320
But instead of the black bars, it's like demon faces.

25:05.320 --> 25:09.000
Yeah, it's just squiggly lines that burst off the page.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.040
Or clowns walking, like doing John Cleese.

25:12.040 --> 25:16.760
It's the pink elephants and he's got the brown bag and he looks at it and he's like, oh shit,

25:16.760 --> 25:18.060
I got to quit drinking.

25:18.060 --> 25:22.320
Instead of words, it's John Cleese, so he walks, but it's a weird clown.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.320
That's my theory.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.320
Sure, sure.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.320
So Alex is going to leave.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.320
Uh-huh.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.320
He's got to go.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.320
He's got to go.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.320
Maybe he doesn't.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.320
Okay.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.320
You know what?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.320
I'm not going to go off here.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.720
I'm just going to read the whole damn study on air, how's that sound?

25:35.720 --> 25:37.160
That sounds good.

25:37.160 --> 25:45.400
And again, usually these studies mince words and this spells it right out in the summary

25:45.400 --> 25:52.600
on the front page, University of Texas, level four bioweapons lab in Galveston, Texas.

25:52.600 --> 25:56.480
There's no way he's reading this study on air.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.520
This whole overly dramatic breakdown of having to go off air and then deciding to stay on

26:00.520 --> 26:05.000
air and read the whole study, it would come off a lot more genuine if he hadn't followed

26:05.000 --> 26:08.240
the whole part of the beginning there where Alex was complaining that no one pays attention

26:08.240 --> 26:10.160
to him unless he makes a big deal out of things.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.160
There is that.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.760
It almost feels like this kind of like fake struggling that he's going through.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.960
It's like a piece of the necessary performance that he has to carry out to make anyone believe

26:18.960 --> 26:21.800
that this piece of supposed evidence actually means anything.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.800
Yeah.

26:22.800 --> 26:25.040
It's all just, it's just an act.

26:25.040 --> 26:31.880
Yeah, you know, it reminds me of when James Brown used to, somebody would put the blanket

26:31.880 --> 26:34.160
over his shoulders and he'd be like, ah, I'm too tired.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.160
I can't go on anymore.

26:35.160 --> 26:40.120
And he'd start walking off stage, but then the music would bring him right back, Dan.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.120
I mean, it gets you into the performance, I guess.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.680
Yeah, but you know, he's coming back.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.280
Especially if you're on tour with him and you've seen it over and over.

26:49.280 --> 26:52.240
I'm basically on tour with Alex.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.240
You're the grateful dad.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.240
Yeah.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.400
And I do not like the hits.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.040
The hits are boring.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.620
Also, small point here.

27:00.620 --> 27:05.120
It's like you've been following around Fish for 10 years, but you hate them.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.540
But also don't, like, I think that's the worst example, right?

27:07.540 --> 27:09.340
Fish do a lot of improvising.

27:09.340 --> 27:10.340
That's true.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.340
Yeah.

27:11.340 --> 27:15.360
A lot of those like long jams are, they put out all of their shows and people listen to

27:15.360 --> 27:16.360
them.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.040
Like that's the exact wrong example.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.040
That's a good point.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.040
Look, I don't like Fish or anything.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.040
Look, there are no doors.

27:22.040 --> 27:26.760
But I think that that's a bad example.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.000
Anyway, small point here, Jordan.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.040
The lab at the University of Texas, Galveston is a level three biosafety lab, not a level

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
four.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.960
I would feel like a stickler for pointing that out when Alex said it was level four,

27:37.960 --> 27:39.640
but there's a big difference between those two.

27:39.640 --> 27:43.040
And also that information is literally on page two of the study.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.240
So if he made it that far, he would know what level it was.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.400
I think he should read the whole study on air.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.280
I think it would be a smart move in his situation.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.280
Ain't gonna do it.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.280
I kind of doubt it.

27:52.280 --> 27:53.280
Ain't gonna do it.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.280
That makes sense.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.840
But he is going to yell a lot.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.840
That sounds like it.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
Some of the rats died today.

27:57.840 --> 28:02.920
Some died in six weeks, but they died and they bled out, folks.

28:02.920 --> 28:03.920
They what?

28:03.920 --> 28:10.200
Where their brain meets the sinus, they bled out their lungs, they bled out their thighs,

28:10.200 --> 28:16.440
they bled out their stomachs, they bled out, they bled out, they bled out, they bled out,

28:16.440 --> 28:17.920
they bled out.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.440
Just like you shoot somebody with a 12-gauge shotgun with a double-aught buck, they bleed

28:21.440 --> 28:23.560
out in about a minute.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.680
This way you bleed out over the next few years.

28:25.680 --> 28:26.680
My God.

28:26.680 --> 28:27.680
Wow.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.880
I want to read.

28:29.880 --> 28:34.480
I would give anything to read an accurate scientific study that was just like, there

28:34.480 --> 28:36.040
was blood everywhere.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.280
Oh, the rodent manatee.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.280
Oh, it's a nightmare.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.280
It was a bad lung.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.240
Oh, everywhere we went, blood on the walls.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.760
It hit me in the nose.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.760
God have mercy.

28:47.760 --> 28:56.400
I mean, I don't want to minimize the grossness of even just reading this, all these mice

28:56.400 --> 28:57.400
are euthanized.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.960
There's something about it that makes me kind of uncomfortable.

28:59.960 --> 29:00.960
There's a certain amount of it that's fucked up.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.500
But it's completely different than what Alex is describing.

29:03.500 --> 29:09.680
It is not people injecting mice with a vaccine and then them suddenly exploding in a blood

29:09.680 --> 29:10.680
field.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.680
Watching them bleed out.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.840
It's not a samurai movie from the 70s, man.

29:14.840 --> 29:19.400
So Alex is lying about one line that I think someone must have highlighted for him in the

29:19.400 --> 29:20.400
study.

29:20.400 --> 29:26.400
Quote, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then bled from the retroorbital sinus

29:26.400 --> 29:27.900
plexus.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.100
He's taking the second half of that sentence about bleeding and then pretending that it

29:31.100 --> 29:35.560
didn't follow the first half where the mice were all put down in accordance with the methodology

29:35.560 --> 29:36.560
of the study.

29:36.560 --> 29:40.560
This doesn't mean that the mice died bleeding from their noses, but that's the image that

29:40.560 --> 29:44.280
Alex wants to use these words to paint and it's a complete fabricator.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.560
It's complete nonsense.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.560
It's childish.

29:46.560 --> 29:54.040
Just going up on JSTOR, reading the introduction, the very end of it is, Oh God, what have we

29:54.040 --> 29:55.040
done?

29:55.040 --> 30:00.280
Science has asked too long whether or not we could.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.160
Make mice bleed out?

30:02.160 --> 30:03.160
Yes.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.160
Yeah.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.680
So anyway, Alex makes up some more shit.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.680
Yep.

30:08.680 --> 30:16.440
Imagine a 2012 highly respected peer reviewed university of Texas longterm study on all

30:16.440 --> 30:24.480
sorts of different animals, finding massive blood clots, brain damage, heart attacks,

30:24.480 --> 30:31.560
organ failure, you name it, and cautioning against vaccines for the coronavirus family.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.540
So that clip is 23 seconds long.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.680
And here's a list of, I bet there are more, but I caught eight here.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.760
Maybe.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.440
I got six big ones.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.440
Six big ones.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.440
Okay.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.440
Errors.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.440
That is one.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.440
It was not a longterm study.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.440
Right.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.440
Two.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.440
It wasn't on all sorts of animals.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.440
It was just mice.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.440
Right.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.440
Three.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.440
It didn't find massive blood clots.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.440
Nope.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.440
Four.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.440
It didn't find brain damage.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.440
Nope.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.440
Five.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.440
It didn't find heart attacks.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.440
True.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.440
Six.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.440
It did advise caution with proceeding with the application of SARS coronavirus vaccine

31:01.440 --> 31:02.440
in humans.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.440
That's all good and well, but it doesn't match the, what Alex is saying.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.920
Like don't overdo, don't open Pandora's box.

31:04.920 --> 31:05.920
Yeah.

31:05.920 --> 31:06.920
Totally.

31:06.920 --> 31:10.640
There's a few others in there, but, uh, I, I felt like some might be splitting hairs,

31:10.640 --> 31:12.720
but those are the major issues of the actual study.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.960
Those were bonus ones that I just gave him just on account of being Alex.

31:15.960 --> 31:20.240
I just assume you, whatever you think it is, add to, just to be safe.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.240
You're a gambler.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
I'm a gambler.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
I like it.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.240
And I think that's a safe bet.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
Yeah.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.440
Alex's brief summary of the study gets so much completely wrong that even if you didn't

31:28.440 --> 31:33.000
suspect as I do that he's a willful liar, you should be really worried about his ability

31:33.000 --> 31:36.960
to convey accurate information from primary sources.

31:36.960 --> 31:41.180
Even if you think he has a heart of gold and he means well, and you know, he's a good guy,

31:41.180 --> 31:46.120
this is a staggering display of inability to do the job he's tried to give himself.

31:46.120 --> 31:51.320
This is like, sometimes I'll, I'll check in and I'll listen to these like, and I'll find

31:51.320 --> 31:53.880
the primary source and it'd be like, Oh, this is bad.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.080
This is bad work.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.080
This is funny.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.080
Yeah.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.080
It's so embarrassingly bad.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.080
Yeah.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.840
The bleeding out the noses.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.080
This is, Oh God.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.400
This is like, he's like a kid.

32:04.400 --> 32:09.580
He should, he should begin this segment with that a carnival music, but in a minor key.

32:09.580 --> 32:12.360
So you know, we're entering into a real fucked up world.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.640
You know, nothing, this is topsy-turvy world.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.600
Nothing's going to be real and it's all going to be terrifying.

32:17.600 --> 32:21.440
Just coming into, yeah, it'll be great.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.440
Yeah.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.440
I agree.

32:23.440 --> 32:28.560
And man, I can't even begin to tell you there is a punchline that it floored me.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.560
Okay.

32:29.560 --> 32:30.560
All right.

32:30.560 --> 32:40.160
You, but you must think of the mice holy mackerel.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.200
You ought to read here.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.200
Overhead shot, please.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.920
What happened to the mice bleeding out their sinus, bleeding out their brains, bleeding

32:47.920 --> 32:53.880
out their hearts, young mice, middle-aged mice, old mice, all the mice, young mice,

32:53.880 --> 32:58.240
middle-aged mice, old mice, you have mice that were just getting ready to go off to

32:58.240 --> 33:00.260
college with their whole lives ahead of them.

33:00.260 --> 33:02.240
Mice that were two days away from retirement.

33:02.240 --> 33:06.240
Totally planning a life after their career at the software development firm.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.240
Going to move to Florida.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.240
There's some traveling.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.240
Yeah, absolutely.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.640
It was finally time.

33:10.640 --> 33:16.000
Maybe going to get into the puzzles, you know, with your old, your spouse, my mouse, your

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
spouse mouse.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Spouse mouse.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Spouse mouse.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Oh, God damn it.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.960
Then you got to think about the adolescent mice who just made the cut for the varsity

33:25.960 --> 33:26.960
football team.

33:26.960 --> 33:27.960
Short, short.

33:27.960 --> 33:28.960
Yeah, of course.

33:28.960 --> 33:29.960
Cut down in their prime.

33:29.960 --> 33:30.960
Yeah.

33:30.960 --> 33:31.960
Could have been Heisman contenders.

33:31.960 --> 33:32.960
Yeah.

33:32.960 --> 33:33.960
Bo Jackson mouse.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.680
He was almost going to make it in three professional sports.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.680
Yeah.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.680
Yeah.

33:38.680 --> 33:39.680
Tragic.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.680
Tragic.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.800
It's her middle-aged mouse.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.760
He's really, really painting a picture.

33:46.760 --> 33:50.920
For a man who's killed that many dogs, how dare he try to make me care about mice?

33:50.920 --> 33:52.280
What an asshole.

33:52.280 --> 33:56.920
Again, just to be totally clear, I have reservations about the way animals are used.

33:56.920 --> 33:57.920
No, absolutely.

33:57.920 --> 33:58.920
Animal testing is fucked up.

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
Yeah.

33:59.920 --> 34:00.920
I agree.

34:00.920 --> 34:06.760
I don't want to unpack that right now while I'm busy laughing at middle-aged mice.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
What a dick.

34:07.760 --> 34:14.960
Young mice, middle-aged mice, old mice, they come for us all, man.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.920
So Alex continues to make stuff up.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.920
Neutralizing antibody assays.

34:21.920 --> 34:25.160
What happened to the animals?

34:25.160 --> 34:27.920
Death.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.980
University of Texas.

34:28.980 --> 34:31.960
This is prestigious.

34:31.960 --> 34:36.960
This is the university did a long-term study on a bunch of vaccines they already had on

34:36.960 --> 34:41.280
the shelf and they all do the same thing.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.320
MRNA or virus vector.

34:44.320 --> 34:48.480
Alex is just skimming the paper now and he saw the headline neutralizing antibody assays.

34:48.480 --> 34:53.080
And that's just the section about how post euthanasia, the samples are taken from the

34:53.080 --> 34:56.880
animals and how they're processed in such a way as to preserve the evidence that antibodies

34:56.880 --> 35:02.820
that might be detected were from the vaccine that was given as opposed to another source.

35:02.820 --> 35:05.000
Alex has no idea what the words he's saying even mean.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.120
He just knows they kind of sound scary.

35:07.120 --> 35:11.760
Also, this study has literally nothing to do with MRNA vaccines.

35:11.760 --> 35:15.480
None of the four vaccines studied were that type and Alex is just throwing that in to

35:15.480 --> 35:18.880
make the audience scared of current day COVID-19 vaccination.

35:18.880 --> 35:19.880
Of course.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.280
Because he has an agenda.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.280
Yeah.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.280
Yeah.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.280
Boy.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.280
Yeah.

35:25.280 --> 35:30.840
And again, it's, it's a, it's a lab that they're, they're, they're put, they're put down.

35:30.840 --> 35:35.080
It's not like Alex is making it sound like everybody is like, okay, we injected them

35:35.080 --> 35:38.240
with the stuff and then they've got a giant meat cleaver and they just chop the mouse

35:38.240 --> 35:40.160
off and they're like, we'll move on.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.160
No, no, no.

35:41.160 --> 35:44.160
Maybe there is a little bit of that, but I think the image he wants people to have is

35:44.160 --> 35:47.520
that he, they injected them and then just watched them slowly.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.520
Yeah.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
Yeah.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
Yeah.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
Wow.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.520
That's probably like they were counting the time.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.520
Right.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
Right.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
Yeah.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.520
That's cool.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.520
Yeah.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.880
Why'd they never have a vaccine for the Corona family?

36:00.880 --> 36:04.760
That's the most common, one of the most common families because it's a fricking protein that

36:04.760 --> 36:08.880
your body's made up out of.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.440
What else has your body made up?

36:10.440 --> 36:11.440
It's incredible.

36:11.440 --> 36:14.880
And I've got some, I was so ready to cover all this other news.

36:14.880 --> 36:22.120
I just spent last night and this morning reading 50 something pages of a Pentagon DARPA document

36:22.120 --> 36:29.120
just, I mean, I hope you're excited to have Alex not talk about that supposed DARPA document.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.400
I'm looking forward to a 50 page DARPA document.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.400
Bad news.

36:32.400 --> 36:36.640
Also, the reason there wasn't a coronavirus vaccine prior to now is primarily because

36:36.640 --> 36:41.440
it's a challenging thing to do and money wasn't there for the research.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.480
Most Corona viruses are not generally very severe and the two previous times there were

36:45.480 --> 36:49.800
serious outbreaks with SARS and MERS, both were handled relatively well with containment

36:49.800 --> 36:53.520
measures and proper protocols, so they never got to the point where money was flowing in

36:53.520 --> 36:55.560
as an urgent solution was needed.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.560
Like now.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.560
Right.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.760
COVID changed that factor in the equation.

36:59.760 --> 37:03.480
And thankfully we also had some preliminary work done in forms of studies that were done

37:03.480 --> 37:08.640
in the wake of SARS and MERS that helped inform current efforts that were going on.

37:08.640 --> 37:09.640
Of course.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.240
A coronavirus vaccine probably could have been made in the past.

37:13.240 --> 37:17.160
It just would have been a question of marshaling efforts and resources into the right places.

37:17.160 --> 37:20.840
And that wasn't something that was seen as a good investment until recently.

37:20.840 --> 37:21.840
Right.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.840
Hopefully that lesson's been learned.

37:22.840 --> 37:23.840
Yeah.

37:23.840 --> 37:24.840
Yeah.

37:24.840 --> 37:29.320
You know, I would like it if more people realized that science, when it succeeds, is the culmination

37:29.320 --> 37:37.720
of failures and not like a simple moment of single, a brilliant inspiration that appears

37:37.720 --> 37:39.040
out of nowhere.

37:39.040 --> 37:42.840
It's the culmination of years upon years upon years of work.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.840
Yeah.

37:43.840 --> 37:47.920
And realistically, like a hundred things could go wrong and then that could lead to

37:47.920 --> 37:49.560
something that's really huge.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.560
Totally.

37:50.560 --> 37:54.120
Whereas, you know, you're not going to make the playoffs if you have an 0 in a hundred

37:54.120 --> 37:55.120
record.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.120
Right.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.120
Right.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.120
Right.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.120
Right.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.240
We're trained to have this win-loss kind of like success-failure way we look at stuff.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.160
And it, yeah, it's a different paradigm.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.160
Yeah.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.160
It's a completely different paradigm.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.920
Failure is the goal.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.940
Because if you fail all the time, then when you succeed, you're like, holy shit, this

38:11.940 --> 38:12.940
is real.

38:12.940 --> 38:13.940
Yeah.

38:13.940 --> 38:14.940
Yeah.

38:14.940 --> 38:20.760
So Alex has a bit of white identity based fears floating around.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.760
Oh yeah, about white.

38:21.760 --> 38:27.280
We have Carol Baker, CDC spokeswoman, telling a giant amphitheater full of scientists and

38:27.280 --> 38:32.000
doctors and nurses that white people are inherently bad and must be gotten rid of because they

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
don't submit to the government.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.920
So that's where this is coming from.

38:34.920 --> 38:39.400
And I guess we do have kind of an Irish, Scottish, English background of a thousand years of

38:39.400 --> 38:43.200
war between those groups and kings trying to get freedom.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.520
And that's where the Magna Carta and then juries and basic rights come from.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.520
Yes.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.520
Yes.

38:49.520 --> 38:54.120
What white people basically invented really, really anchors the other white people that

38:54.120 --> 38:55.120
want to run things.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
Wow.

38:56.120 --> 39:01.880
I don't even know where to begin with all of the things wrapped up in just that.

39:01.880 --> 39:07.680
Just saying that means you extrapolate what it means if this is real.

39:07.680 --> 39:11.240
But I've heard Alex say things like that in the past, like the idea that sort of white

39:11.240 --> 39:12.240
people created freedom.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.240
No, totally.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.320
But I have often thought that was kind of just a stray thought.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.120
Maybe he was in too deep on a sentence.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.120
Sure, sure.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.200
No, it's fundamental to his worldview.

39:21.200 --> 39:26.800
It's fundamental to his worldview that no other culture has ever created any system

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
of freedom.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.800
Of freedom.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.800
Yeah.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.800
Freedom is essentially a white creation.

39:30.800 --> 39:35.080
He cannot possibly believe that anything else happened.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.080
It's outrageous.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.080
Yeah, he can't.

39:37.080 --> 39:43.720
Imagine him reading about a matriarchal society.

39:43.720 --> 39:48.240
Matriarchal societies that have existed in our past so many times and how much better

39:48.240 --> 39:49.240
they are.

39:49.240 --> 39:54.520
I can't even... Well, better is relative, but there are systems that work and are better

39:54.520 --> 39:57.400
for... It depends on where you're living and the circumstances.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.400
No, totally.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.400
Totally.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.400
I'm sorry.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.400
My anthropology hat slipped on.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.400
I understand.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.400
I respect that.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.160
I'm very troubled by that.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.000
That's really fucked up.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.520
But also that clip that he's talking about, about Dr. Carol Baker.

40:13.520 --> 40:17.240
It's a clip that's been posted all over right-wing media.

40:17.240 --> 40:21.720
It's about a minute and a half long, and it's a clip where Dr. Baker is saying that the

40:21.720 --> 40:25.960
solution to getting rid of vaccine denial is getting rid of white people.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.960
This is not at all being suggested as a serious solution.

40:28.960 --> 40:33.160
It's clearly meant as a shock statement that furthers a different argument, which is conveniently

40:33.160 --> 40:36.800
edited out of the clip that gets posted all over the media.

40:36.800 --> 40:40.720
Most of the places you find this clip where they post it, it's super vague about where

40:40.720 --> 40:44.760
the video comes from, sometimes just a year, and it's often the wrong year.

40:44.760 --> 40:48.140
I suspect this is an intentional strategy to make it harder for the audience to confirm

40:48.140 --> 40:50.760
the claims that are being made about it.

40:50.760 --> 40:54.060
I tracked down the full video, and it's from a panel discussion being held by the National

40:54.060 --> 40:59.920
Meningitis Association titled, quote, Achieving Childhood Vaccine Success in the United States.

40:59.920 --> 41:03.720
It's not a giant amphitheater, but that visual does a lot more work for Alex, and he knows

41:03.720 --> 41:06.880
the audience is just going to accept it over dumb shit, he says.

41:06.880 --> 41:11.240
The larger context of the comment was in terms of a conversation about strategies to increase

41:11.240 --> 41:13.000
vaccination rates.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.620
Another panelist had suggested media training for doctors, and there was some disagreement

41:16.620 --> 41:19.360
about whether or not the media training would be impactful.

41:19.360 --> 41:23.740
Dr. Baker was expressing the position that the discussion to get children vaccinated

41:23.740 --> 41:28.120
is an individual event that happens over and over all over the country every day, and media

41:28.120 --> 41:31.740
training might not necessarily be the most helpful thing.

41:31.740 --> 41:35.920
The conversation had also touched on multicultural issues, like communities that claim exemptions

41:35.920 --> 41:38.040
from school vaccine mandates.

41:38.040 --> 41:42.480
The comment Baker made appears to exist in the intersection of these two ideas, but it's

41:42.480 --> 41:46.720
kind of a freewheeling panel discussion, so they kind of go off on some tangents, and

41:46.720 --> 41:49.360
makes it a little bit difficult to know exactly where she was going.

41:49.360 --> 41:54.100
But having watched the discussion, I'm absolutely certain that it has nothing to do with appealing

41:54.100 --> 41:55.100
to white genocide.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.300
I don't know.

41:56.300 --> 41:57.300
I don't know.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.400
It just sounds like the CDC's...

41:59.400 --> 42:03.540
I feel like maybe the CDC is overreacting a little bit to the Trump years, but calling

42:03.540 --> 42:04.920
for white genocide does seem...

42:04.920 --> 42:07.040
She wasn't with the CDC at the time, I believe.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.040
I think she was...

42:08.040 --> 42:09.040
Right.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.040
Of course not.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.040
Yeah.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.040
Because who fucking cares?

42:12.040 --> 42:13.040
Previously.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.040
Yeah.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.040
Let's just lie about everything.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.040
Yeah.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.040
But Alex, boy, what a mess.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.040
Yeah, that's not good.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.040
White people invented freedom.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.040
Oh, man.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.040
He's in a mood.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.040
Man.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.040
Yeah.

42:23.040 --> 42:28.640
I mean, the English, Irish, and Scotch thing, they invented freedom?

42:28.640 --> 42:29.640
Like there was no...

42:29.640 --> 42:32.600
Well, it's because they were fighting about kings or something.

42:32.600 --> 42:33.600
I mean, couldn't he say...

42:33.600 --> 42:38.680
I mean, if you want it to be a super...

42:38.680 --> 42:40.560
Don't white nationalists claim Rome too?

42:40.560 --> 42:41.560
Or was...

42:41.560 --> 42:42.560
I think they love Vikings.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.880
Or was that too swarthy at the time?

42:43.880 --> 42:44.880
They love Vikings.

42:44.880 --> 42:45.880
They like...

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
Well, yeah.

42:46.880 --> 42:47.880
They're like the Norse runes.

42:47.880 --> 42:48.880
Yes, yes.

42:48.880 --> 42:49.880
The people who we most associate with freedom.

42:49.880 --> 42:50.880
Mm-hmm.

42:50.880 --> 42:51.880
Yeah.

42:51.880 --> 42:52.880
Great.

42:52.880 --> 42:53.880
So Alex is in a mood.

42:53.880 --> 42:56.280
And I think I might be able to tell you why.

42:56.280 --> 42:57.280
Why?

42:57.280 --> 42:58.280
Mic down for this.

42:58.280 --> 42:59.280
Okay.

42:59.280 --> 43:04.800
I have been called away to a little court hearing today, the wonders of family court.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.680
So that's why I taped something this morning, because I've got to go at one o'clock today.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.880
But I'll be back after that this afternoon.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.880
There is so much to cover and so much to get to.

43:12.880 --> 43:14.760
I wonder if that has to do anything with his mood.

43:14.760 --> 43:15.760
Might be a bad mood.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.440
Might be why he's fine with everybody dying.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.440
Could be fine.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
Could be something to do with it.

43:20.440 --> 43:23.720
When I said that, I was like, oh, the mystery becomes clear.

43:23.720 --> 43:24.720
Yeah.

43:24.720 --> 43:29.000
This is like the scene in a Poirot thing where it's like the great six f1 down.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Yeah, the dramatic reveal.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
No, this is the dinner party.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Yeah.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.920
I will slowly reveal the perpetrator of the court.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.760
I have to go to family court.

43:37.760 --> 43:38.760
Yes.

43:38.760 --> 43:39.760
Caught him.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.760
It was him.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.760
Okay, yeah.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.760
He was guilty.

43:42.760 --> 43:43.760
Oh, this is why this is a bombshell.

43:43.760 --> 43:44.760
No one pays attention to you.

43:44.760 --> 43:45.760
Yeah, yeah.

43:45.760 --> 43:46.760
And everyone's got to die.

43:46.760 --> 43:47.760
Yeah, yeah.

43:47.760 --> 43:48.760
Great.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.760
Yep.

43:49.760 --> 43:50.760
Okay.

43:50.760 --> 43:51.760
Thanks, Alex.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.640
Even though he has to leave early, it doesn't stop him from continuing to be wrong about

43:54.640 --> 43:56.520
everything about this study.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.000
Sounds right.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.200
Overhead shot, please.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.080
Well, this just got brought to my attention.

44:01.080 --> 44:04.080
I went and checked it on the University of Texas website.

44:04.080 --> 44:09.600
This is the University of Texas Biological Research Center, level four, one of the most

44:09.600 --> 44:12.640
prestigious in the world.

44:12.640 --> 44:19.680
Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary autoimmune response.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.920
Immunopathology is what that means.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.680
And it says this autoimmune response is in the mice.

44:25.680 --> 44:28.720
We test on mice that are very similar to us with the way they react.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.800
And then they have to show the photos and all of it.

44:30.800 --> 44:35.040
And they have the control group, the non-control group, the control group, you know, those

44:35.040 --> 44:38.560
that were a challenge got really sick.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.280
Those that weren't given it didn't get sick.

44:40.280 --> 44:45.040
They did a bunch of studies and it's got all the photos of the holes even in their lungs,

44:45.040 --> 44:46.240
their brains.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.240
And their hearts.

44:47.240 --> 44:48.240
What?

44:48.240 --> 44:49.240
Wait, what?

44:49.240 --> 44:50.240
They did three different vaccines.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.160
They did three different vaccines, three different types.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.880
Show me those fucking photos.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.640
They all killed the animals.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.760
So that's the University of Texas.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.840
So the lab isn't level four.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.080
Immunopathology does not mean autoimmune.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.160
The article has nothing to do with autoimmune conditions.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.160
Correct.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.840
Alex is making up how he imagines this test was run.

45:08.840 --> 45:14.180
The only mice in the study were not challenged with live SARS were the five from each group

45:14.180 --> 45:17.200
that were killed two days early so they could have their lungs examined.

45:17.200 --> 45:21.640
The entire story of the vaccinated group getting sick after the challenge and non-vaccinated

45:21.640 --> 45:25.040
group being fine, that just comes from Alex's imagination.

45:25.040 --> 45:29.880
There were no photos in the study of hearts or brains because it's only about the lungs.

45:29.880 --> 45:34.320
That's the word Alex keeps tripping over in the study's title, pulmonary.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.960
Alex is making up that the other photos are in there or maybe he hallucinated them.

45:37.960 --> 45:38.960
I'm not sure.

45:38.960 --> 45:41.420
Also, they tested four vaccines in the study.

45:41.420 --> 45:45.080
Alex just thinks there were three because he was skimming and he saw the line, quote,

45:45.080 --> 45:50.160
three different experiments performed for comparing different vaccines are reported

45:50.160 --> 45:51.160
here.

45:51.160 --> 45:55.000
On page two, that's where that quote comes from, at the beginning of the study design

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
section.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.280
In reality, there were four vaccines.

45:58.280 --> 46:01.880
Two of them were the same type of vaccine, whole virus vaccines, but they were prepared

46:01.880 --> 46:04.220
differently and used different adjuvants.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.720
So they were experimentally distinct.

46:05.720 --> 46:06.720
Sure.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.560
Also, none of the vaccines killed any animals.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
Right.

46:09.560 --> 46:10.560
This is all nonsense.

46:10.560 --> 46:13.480
Alex cannot fucking handle doing a...

46:13.480 --> 46:19.960
Again, I mean, I just want to read that study where they're like, fuck it, man.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.600
There are brains with holes in them, dude.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.600
Put it in the study.

46:24.600 --> 46:25.600
Sure.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.600
Great.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.600
Awesome.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.600
Anyway, he continues lying.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.600
Of course.

46:29.600 --> 46:32.600
Well, I'll give Bill Gates and the UN and the globalists this.

46:32.600 --> 46:40.040
They've got huevos the size of the Grand Canyon or the size of the Grand Tetons, size of the

46:40.040 --> 46:41.040
planet.

46:41.040 --> 46:47.040
The National Bioweapons Lab, level four, found that all coronavirus vaccines cause bleeding

46:47.040 --> 46:51.920
in the lungs, the brain, the heart, and blood clots on a massive scale.

46:51.920 --> 46:56.080
In some cases, the majority of lab rats died.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.080
And that's the headline.

46:57.080 --> 47:03.880
Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology with all

47:03.880 --> 47:08.040
the challenged subjects, all the lab animals.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.040
That is from 2012.

47:09.040 --> 47:11.360
And there's a bunch of other reports coming out.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.360
They knew this.

47:12.360 --> 47:13.360
They did it.

47:13.360 --> 47:17.760
That way, they could plausibly deny when your loved one has a heart attack or a stroke or

47:17.760 --> 47:21.000
a blood clot and you see what's coming out with all the vaccines.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.800
Please don't forget, we're Lister supported, turbo force, 10 hours clean energy, back of

47:24.800 --> 47:25.800
stock, 40% off.

47:25.800 --> 47:26.800
Hey.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.800
Holy shit.

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
Oh, boy.

47:28.800 --> 47:30.920
That was a 90 degree turn.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.320
God damn.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
Jarring.

47:33.320 --> 47:34.320
That hurt.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.320
Yeah.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.320
That hurt.

47:36.320 --> 47:38.040
I feel like I was in a 30 mile an hour car crash right there.

47:38.040 --> 47:46.760
That sounds like a guy who's got to go to family court, plugging like a guy who's got

47:46.760 --> 47:47.760
to go to court with his ex-wife.

47:47.760 --> 47:48.760
Yeah.

47:48.760 --> 47:49.760
Yeah.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.760
That'll do it.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.760
Yeah.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.220
So Alex has Nick Fuentes on for a little bit.

47:53.220 --> 47:58.360
And I didn't point this out on our last episode, but when the two of them were talking, Alex

47:58.360 --> 48:03.700
said that Nick Fuentes was going to get a channel on band.video on Alex's site.

48:03.700 --> 48:08.000
And I just took that to be stray talk because he said that to almost everybody who's seen

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
the old man house phone.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.640
He said that to almost everybody who's nuts and a problem.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.640
Yeah.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.640
Yeah.

48:13.640 --> 48:14.640
Yeah.

48:14.640 --> 48:15.640
Absolutely.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.480
But they have followed through and now Nick has an America First channel on Alex's website.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.000
Or, actually, that's better.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Keep it there.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Sure.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Keep it all there.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Get rid of everything else.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.120
So he's also got another iron in the fire that he's going to explain here.

48:29.120 --> 48:34.000
So I was on your show last week to talk about my placement on the no fly list, which we

48:34.000 --> 48:39.240
suspect was for political reasons, and you brought on the great lawyer, Norm Pattis,

48:39.240 --> 48:40.880
and we got a chance to talk a little bit.

48:40.880 --> 48:41.880
Really?

48:41.880 --> 48:45.100
And I actually gave him a call after your show, and I've now retained him to represent

48:45.100 --> 48:50.400
me in a case against the TSA, and we should be filing, I believe, next week.

48:50.400 --> 48:54.160
So we're going to take it to the courts against the TSA and the federal government.

48:54.160 --> 48:56.960
I guess stand up didn't work out.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.440
Wow.

48:58.440 --> 48:59.960
Man.

48:59.960 --> 49:03.000
Norm is running a good game.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.520
I don't know about that.

49:05.520 --> 49:10.720
There's something about some idiot just suddenly calling you because of Alex Jones and being

49:10.720 --> 49:16.400
like, fuck it, yeah, I'll run your dumb lawsuit that's not going to go anywhere, you idiot.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.400
Yeah.

49:17.400 --> 49:18.400
Pay me.

49:18.400 --> 49:24.760
I guess there does appear to be a space for, like, I mean, this is a scam.

49:24.760 --> 49:25.760
Yeah, absolutely.

49:25.760 --> 49:27.120
It's not a real lawsuit.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.120
No.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.920
It's at best a fundraising opportunity for Nick Fuentes.

49:30.920 --> 49:31.920
Agreed.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.240
Norm's going to skim some of that off in billable hours or whatever.

49:35.240 --> 49:36.240
Yeah, why not?

49:36.240 --> 49:39.440
I guess that is a career path you could go down as a lawyer.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.680
Like Larry Klaiman did that for years, filing frivolous nonsense lawsuits.

49:43.680 --> 49:44.680
You're just a scammer.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.680
Yeah.

49:45.680 --> 49:46.680
That's fine.

49:46.680 --> 49:47.680
And if he wants to do that, great.

49:47.680 --> 49:52.040
I don't know anything about, I don't know a lot about his career.

49:52.040 --> 49:55.160
I know it seems like he's taking a turn for the racist lately.

49:55.160 --> 49:59.960
And I guess, you know, getting in bed with, I guess just being associated with Alex Jones

49:59.960 --> 50:00.960
too deeply.

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
Yeah.

50:01.960 --> 50:02.960
This is just what happens.

50:02.960 --> 50:03.960
It is.

50:03.960 --> 50:04.960
It gets you.

50:04.960 --> 50:11.600
Like Barnes ends up, like, doing interviews with Stefan Molyneux, and Norm's doing racist

50:11.600 --> 50:13.640
stand up and hanging out with Nick Fuentes.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.840
Yeah, you just can't, you can't do it.

50:15.840 --> 50:18.600
You can't, you can't, you can't go on to do something else.

50:18.600 --> 50:23.040
You can't exist in the modern GOP without being a white nationalist anyway, so.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.040
Seems tough.

50:24.040 --> 50:25.040
Yeah.

50:25.040 --> 50:29.080
So Alex goes off to family court, and I stopped listening.

50:29.080 --> 50:30.080
I don't care.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.080
I know.

50:31.080 --> 50:32.080
He's off to family court.

50:32.080 --> 50:33.080
Yeah.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.080
So he comes back in May 7th.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.080
Right.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.080
Uh.

50:36.080 --> 50:37.080
Does he come back in that day?

50:37.080 --> 50:38.360
I mean, not when his show's on.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.360
Oh, okay.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.920
He might have shown up, like, for the war room or something.

50:40.920 --> 50:41.920
Gotcha.

50:41.920 --> 50:42.920
Gotcha.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.920
I would assume he came back and had a little bit of a business meeting with a model.

50:45.920 --> 50:46.920
Sure.

50:46.920 --> 50:47.920
Sure.

50:47.920 --> 50:48.920
Sure.

50:48.920 --> 50:49.920
I would assume.

50:49.920 --> 50:50.920
There's very little doubt of that.

50:50.920 --> 50:51.920
Yeah.

50:51.920 --> 50:52.920
There's a lot of work to get done around the office.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.880
Like, that chair needed to be thrown over there.

50:55.880 --> 50:56.880
I'm redecorating.

50:56.880 --> 50:57.880
Yeah.

50:57.880 --> 50:58.880
Yeah.

50:58.880 --> 50:59.880
Yeah.

50:59.880 --> 51:03.360
And that wall was, it was there, and there were zero holes in it.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.360
Yeah.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.360
And so I fixed that.

51:05.360 --> 51:08.680
It is, like, an unforgivable problem.

51:08.680 --> 51:16.960
So Alex comes back on the 7th, and he gets on air, and I was floored by how boring the

51:16.960 --> 51:18.720
first, like, half hour of his show was.

51:18.720 --> 51:19.720
Oh, yeah?

51:19.720 --> 51:20.720
He says nothing.

51:20.720 --> 51:21.720
Aw.

51:21.720 --> 51:22.720
It's treading water.

51:22.720 --> 51:24.560
It's just like, here I am.

51:24.560 --> 51:28.120
He does a half hour of, I'm about to get to something.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.120
Kind of.

51:29.120 --> 51:31.400
He doesn't really feel like he was about to get there.

51:31.400 --> 51:34.360
It felt like other people might be getting to something.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.360
Right.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.360
Right.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.360
Right.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.360
He is not.

51:38.360 --> 51:39.360
But here's a little clip.

51:39.360 --> 51:43.040
The government's outlaw, the government's criminal, the government's oppressing you,

51:43.040 --> 51:48.840
the government's not legitimate, it's Chai-Com Globalist run, so following its directives

51:48.840 --> 51:52.360
is now a crime against your family and humanity.

51:52.360 --> 51:57.560
Any of this unconstitutional crap, any of the contact tracers, any intimidation to have

51:57.560 --> 52:01.920
guards, anybody telling you you gotta wear a mask, anybody giving you this crap is part

52:01.920 --> 52:07.000
of the enemy army, literally, that engineered this whole damn thing out of Wuhan.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.080
I listen to stuff like that, and I just, I can't understand how anybody could listen

52:12.080 --> 52:19.280
to Alex, take him seriously, and not recognize that terrorism is the directing.

52:19.280 --> 52:24.200
That's what, terrorism against the state is basically the only logical outcome of the

52:24.200 --> 52:25.560
things that he's saying.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.840
If you believe the things that he's saying, there is no solution.

52:28.840 --> 52:29.840
No.

52:29.840 --> 52:30.840
You're fighting the fucking devil.

52:30.840 --> 52:31.840
Yeah.

52:31.840 --> 52:35.000
The devil doesn't care about courts, the devil doesn't care about elections.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
No.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.800
There's no making peace with the devil, he's the devil.

52:39.800 --> 52:40.800
Right.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.040
You have to eradicate him.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.040
Yes.

52:43.040 --> 52:46.720
And then the people who follow him, and surprise, all that's left is white people who you're

52:46.720 --> 52:47.720
friends with.

52:47.720 --> 52:51.920
I guess I'm not being totally fair, because the other conclusion I guess could be complete

52:51.920 --> 52:52.920
isolation.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.600
Like, you could have communes in the woods or something like that.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
Or complete splinter society.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.080
Trying to topple the state.

52:59.080 --> 53:03.520
Those are the only two legitimate outcomes, because political organization is meaningless.

53:03.520 --> 53:04.520
Right.

53:04.520 --> 53:10.040
And like, okay, now the government is, it's outlaw, it's whatever, so any kind of rules

53:10.040 --> 53:13.840
that come from the government are not to be followed, it's a crime against humanity to

53:13.840 --> 53:14.840
wear a mask.

53:14.840 --> 53:15.840
Why would you run for office?

53:15.840 --> 53:16.840
You couldn't do shit.

53:16.840 --> 53:17.840
What would you, yeah.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.360
You'd get absorbed by the devil.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.360
Totally.

53:20.360 --> 53:24.680
I just, I was thinking about that because I was so bored by the beginning of this episode.

53:24.680 --> 53:25.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:25.680 --> 53:32.800
And it just, it strikes me that anybody who takes this seriously, they just can't.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.080
Or else they would be doing something horrible.

53:35.080 --> 53:38.480
I'll pitch them on this, okay, they've already tried to topple the government and it didn't

53:38.480 --> 53:39.480
go well.

53:39.480 --> 53:40.480
True.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.400
So try isolation.

53:42.400 --> 53:45.480
Everybody in the right wing just needs to go away.

53:45.480 --> 53:52.400
Well, I would recommend isolation with another individual for about an hour a week, chatting

53:52.400 --> 53:53.400
about.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.400
What do you think?

53:54.400 --> 53:55.400
Life.

53:55.400 --> 53:56.400
Just talking about your problems.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.400
Yeah.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.400
Yeah, get some.

53:58.400 --> 53:59.400
Bounce it off another person.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.400
Just.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.400
See how it feels to say some things out loud.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.400
Let it out.

54:02.400 --> 54:03.400
Yeah.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.400
Yeah.

54:04.400 --> 54:05.400
I recommend that for everybody, actually.

54:05.400 --> 54:06.400
Not a terrible idea.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.400
Not just people on the right wing.

54:07.400 --> 54:08.400
Not a terrible idea.

54:08.400 --> 54:12.680
So, Alex, you know, the day before, he was mostly just lying about this study, and I'm

54:12.680 --> 54:14.600
not going to lie, he does more of that.

54:14.600 --> 54:18.320
But today, he seems to be in a different mood.

54:18.320 --> 54:23.880
I would describe his mood as being very similar to a guy who went to family court the day

54:23.880 --> 54:24.880
before.

54:24.880 --> 54:29.640
Steel prices have tripled, corn has exploded, every commodity is exploding.

54:29.640 --> 54:33.080
And that's why I said, get into a basket of commodities.

54:33.080 --> 54:36.940
That's my advice to myself, if I was an investor.

54:36.940 --> 54:41.240
And get invested in a place in the country, doesn't need to be fancy, but away from people

54:41.240 --> 54:44.720
and know your neighbors, and have friends and family that are aware, and having your

54:44.720 --> 54:49.720
own gang, your own people to watch each other's back, is the most valuable thing in this universe,

54:49.720 --> 54:55.320
other than a relationship with Jesus Christ, the son of God.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.640
And so you better get ready now.

54:56.640 --> 55:01.280
I mean, look, I told you this a year ago, buy ammo, buy guns, they're going to steal

55:01.280 --> 55:02.280
the election from Trump.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.760
Then they're going to really clamp down.

55:03.760 --> 55:06.940
They're going to start a race war as the cover for the economic collapse.

55:06.940 --> 55:08.540
This is all a battle plan.

55:08.540 --> 55:09.960
We know what they're going to do.

55:09.960 --> 55:11.400
We should have been able to stop it.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.600
Enough folks didn't listen.

55:12.600 --> 55:18.040
Now people are listening, and I don't say that to act tough.

55:18.040 --> 55:19.440
I don't say that to be impressive.

55:19.440 --> 55:23.440
It's just, everybody needs to know what you've done keeping us on the air.

55:23.440 --> 55:30.180
We have all the big so-called government intelligence agencies listening.

55:30.180 --> 55:39.360
They're now just like the schedule, webs on a Labrador Retriever's feet, or it's like

55:39.360 --> 55:43.320
a, like people that grow a sixth toe or something.

55:43.320 --> 55:44.880
They don't have any power.

55:44.880 --> 55:45.880
They're just puppets.

55:45.880 --> 55:50.720
So corporations, the private groups, the big tech, it's got their own hit teams, their

55:50.720 --> 55:53.640
own labs making deadly synthetic drugs.

55:53.640 --> 55:58.600
I mean, just their own pedophile operations is giant industrial level evil.

55:58.600 --> 56:07.280
Just chewing up humanity like a combine cuts wheat or bales grass into bales of hay.

56:07.280 --> 56:11.680
As soon as we realize how much trouble we're in, we'll be able to turn this around.

56:11.680 --> 56:20.880
But I told everybody this, so I'll do a plug right now because I sell and stay on air with

56:20.880 --> 56:21.880
what I do myself.

56:21.880 --> 56:25.600
And when I got the best storeable food company, we sell it directly from infowarsdoor.com.

56:25.600 --> 56:26.600
They're full catalog.

56:26.600 --> 56:31.840
You get 10% off, the lowest price already out there, but I can only run that until next

56:31.840 --> 56:32.840
week, next Wednesday.

56:32.840 --> 56:33.840
All right.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.840
Sure.

56:34.840 --> 56:35.840
Yeah.

56:35.840 --> 56:36.840
Easter sale.

56:36.840 --> 56:37.840
Yeah.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.840
You got to head to the country.

56:38.840 --> 56:39.840
Got to run away.

56:39.840 --> 56:40.840
Absolutely.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.000
And just incidentally.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.280
By the way, I'll plug this now while we're here.

56:46.280 --> 56:51.360
Look, it's a favor that I'm really, really, what do you think about it?

56:51.360 --> 56:52.360
Honestly.

56:52.360 --> 56:53.360
What do you think about it?

56:53.360 --> 56:55.000
I am gifting you this plug.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
Yes.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Yeah.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Yeah.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
It's a blessing.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Yeah.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.560
And so in order for you to repay that, you need to buy lots of food.

57:02.560 --> 57:03.560
Wow.

57:03.560 --> 57:11.080
You can get 2020 food prices now at preparewithalex.com or just find the subsection, storeablefood.com.

57:11.080 --> 57:12.080
And I would buy a lot of food.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.840
I'm buying more storeable food.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.520
I'm buying more ammunition.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.520
You said you have none.

57:16.520 --> 57:19.400
I am selling my house in Austin.

57:19.400 --> 57:20.400
Good.

57:20.400 --> 57:24.440
Just had the realtor photographer over to get that done.

57:24.440 --> 57:29.440
And I am telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that there's a 90% chance we're

57:29.440 --> 57:32.520
going to go road warrior in this country for probably five, 10 years.

57:32.520 --> 57:33.520
Sure.

57:33.520 --> 57:38.080
And when this is all over, I would be surprised if 50 million, a hundred million people aren't

57:38.080 --> 57:39.080
dead.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.720
And you know, I've never talked like that in my 27 years on air.

57:40.720 --> 57:45.480
I only think that a 90% chance it's all over.

57:45.480 --> 57:46.480
Okay.

57:46.480 --> 57:47.480
Yeah.

57:47.480 --> 57:48.480
I've never talked like that.

57:48.480 --> 57:49.480
I've never said anything like that.

57:49.480 --> 57:51.280
Except for every time I was at court the day before.

57:51.280 --> 57:58.200
I have never said anything like that roughly 7 billion people will be exterminated so that

57:58.200 --> 58:00.040
only 500 million are left.

58:00.040 --> 58:01.320
I've never said anything like that.

58:01.320 --> 58:02.320
You know me.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.400
I've never talked like that except for almost all the time.

58:04.400 --> 58:08.620
I'm not really a doomsayer, you know, I'm not, that's not my thing.

58:08.620 --> 58:10.960
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to scare you.

58:10.960 --> 58:12.720
I like to play it close to the best.

58:12.720 --> 58:13.720
Also boo.

58:13.720 --> 58:17.120
Now you should be terrified of all the people coming to kill you.

58:17.120 --> 58:18.120
Yes.

58:18.120 --> 58:22.640
And sure they look nice and they say nice things and they're exactly like you and they're

58:22.640 --> 58:26.280
just normal people, but they're actually working for the devil and you should murder them.

58:26.280 --> 58:28.160
And road warrior.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.160
And road warrior.

58:29.160 --> 58:30.480
For five to 10 years.

58:30.480 --> 58:31.880
Road warrior in five to 10 years.

58:31.880 --> 58:33.600
No, four or five to 10 years.

58:33.600 --> 58:34.600
Oh yeah.

58:34.600 --> 58:35.600
Oh that's right.

58:35.600 --> 58:36.600
Yeah.

58:36.600 --> 58:42.480
Yeah but you know, 50 to 100 million, that seems pretty good for a road warrior situation.

58:42.480 --> 58:44.800
I mean road, that's a pretty severe situation.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.680
Sure, but I feel like everybody was dead in road warrior, you're going through the wastes.

58:48.680 --> 58:51.800
No, I'm kind of agreeing with you, that's kind of a bright side kind of thought.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.000
Yeah, that's not bad.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.240
I would, if that was the worst road warrior was going to get it, I feel like it could

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
be worse.

58:58.240 --> 58:59.240
Fair enough.

58:59.240 --> 59:05.560
So you know, it's the glass half empty, glass half full, Alex half empty, you half full.

59:05.560 --> 59:07.480
I'm an optimist, everybody knows that.

59:07.480 --> 59:13.760
So Alex sent this study that he found, that he was lying about all day yesterday, to a

59:13.760 --> 59:15.560
guy who works at UT.

59:15.560 --> 59:16.720
Who knows who this guy is?

59:16.720 --> 59:18.000
Okay, just a guy.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And I just thought this was really silly.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.960
I sent this to an individual I know that is high up in the board, let's just say, well

59:25.960 --> 59:31.840
I gave way too much, didn't I, let's say heads up a department at the University of Texas

59:31.840 --> 59:32.840
last night.

59:32.840 --> 59:37.760
And when I, I know this person for a long time, and when I send them text messages,

59:37.760 --> 59:43.160
they usually don't respond for like a week, but he responded back in about 20 minutes.

59:43.160 --> 59:47.560
And I said, Hey, UT put out this big study under a federal government grant nine years

59:47.560 --> 59:55.920
ago that, and I said, tell me what you think of it.

59:55.920 --> 01:00:05.680
I didn't even say, they said it was bad, don't take COVID based vaccines.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680
This is 2012.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:13.960
I just said, Hey, UT put out this interesting report on COVID type viruses nine years ago.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.960
What do you think?

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.960
Hell, I'll show you the text, I won't show you the name.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:20.960
Stop texting me.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:30.400
He messaged me back like Timothy Slater, and he said, well, it's very technical, but obviously

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.800
I'm not taking the vaccine and this is a warning.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.840
This is a warning.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.080
This study was a warning.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080
How, what?

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080
What?

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.760
Well, with global stuff to do all their dirty work out in public.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.720
You know, I understand that, but I really, really don't give a shit about what anybody

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.720
on any board thinks.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.200
I have a hard time with boards.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.680
While also the guy saying that he's not going to get the vaccine, I'm not entirely sure

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.760
what all of his medical issues are, but Alex says that he's like, it's obviously someone

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.220
on the board at UT is probably not a younger person.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.400
And also they had COVID already.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.320
So their doctor had told them, this is what he reads from the text message.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.120
Their doctor had told them that they already had a lot of antibodies naturally occurring

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.320
from having had COVID.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.440
So the doctor had advised them not to get a shot, which is, I don't know.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440
I'm not a doctor.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.440
So I don't know, but that's slightly different than don't get the shot, it'll kill you.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440
It's going to kill you.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.560
You will, there are going to be pictures of holes in your brain.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.080
It seems like there's a slightly different pieces of advice.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.120
Could be a different angle.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.640
Also the idea that this is a warning is just so dumb.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.640
I love it.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640
So dumb.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640
It's a warning.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.520
Oh, I'd like to warn Alex.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:47.160
Um, no, you, you should know what you're talking about or else you sound really stupid.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.120
That was a good warning.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:55.580
That's titled immunization SARS coronavirus vaccine leads to pulmonary immunopathology

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.720
of challenge with the SARS virus.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.720
Emu path.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.320
The challenge is the group of rats that were given the vaccine versus those that aren't.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.880
And they have autoimmune responses and their hearts and lungs roll up and they got bloody

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.880
holes in them.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.720
Then they died of blood clots, which I'm sure you're hearing about in the news.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.920
I feel like I'm flogging a dead horse or possibly a dead mouse here, but I am constantly hitting

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.000
this drum of Alex, not knowing anything about this study that he's reporting on, but he

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.600
just keeps being wrong in new ways.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.680
He's wrong about the details of this study, but I think it's more disturbing that he doesn't

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.760
understand basic terminology that's used, which makes me think that he doesn't even

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.040
have a handle on the most elementary conversation that's going on in terms of this study as

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.640
well as any others that he might be trying to discuss.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.640
Yeah, that sounds right.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.020
Alex says that the term challenge refers to the group of mice that were vaccinated as

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.980
opposed to the ones that were not.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.000
And that's not what that term means.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.980
In the case of this study, there were groups of mice that were given various non-experimental

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.200
injections to serve as control groups.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:01.120
For instance, one control group got actual live SARS, another just got the adjuvant.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.360
The term challenge refers to taking all of the mice in the experimental and control groups

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.600
and challenging their immunity by exposing them to live SARS.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.240
That's what this experiment did.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:17.640
And it's critical to understand that concept, to understand this study at all, to any degree.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.660
There are times when Alex is being really dumb and it's funny, but this instance is

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.600
almost getting embarrassing.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.880
Like this is disqualifying, childish.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:35.000
I think so far his descriptions just of like, here's what a study is, give me great concern.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It's like, and this is true with just about everybody who's like, I know science, just

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.360
describe how you do a study after, and this is supposed to be after he's read how they

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
did the study.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360
He poured over it, man.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.360
Yeah.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360
Yeah.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360
So just tell me how a study works.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.720
This is day two of his coverage.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.780
Just give me a simple, like here's the beginning of the study and explain to me what you think

01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.780
science does.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:04.800
Well, it turns out, I mean, I don't, I didn't see this, but it turns out that this study

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.520
is actually evidence that giving the vaccine around, it's going to kill kids.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.520
Sure.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.360
These people are sick and now they're going to target the little children and mess them

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
up for life.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360
Oh man.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.360
Wow.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.040
I'm like, oh, suddenly all these kids have heart problems and have brain problems.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:26.760
Well, there's some conspiracy theorists say it's connected to the vaccine.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.000
No, the university of Texas says, don't do it.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It'll happen.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.400
But you don't care that young rats and old rats got sick and died.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.960
Because you're liberal.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.120
You're saving the earth for yourselves.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.120
Sure.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.920
I don't not care because I'm liberal.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.760
I don't care because I read the source.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.760
Wow.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.760
That would help.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.200
Don't you remember the part where the source was like, oh my God, there are all these mice

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.200
bleeding out.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.520
We got holes in their brains and then rats broke in and they ate the mice and now they're

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.520
exploding.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.680
They're going to give it to children next.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.960
How old are the rats?

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.600
There are no middle aged rats.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.360
There are young rats and old rats in this circumstance.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360
That's a relief.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360
It is a relief.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.360
We're all middle aged here.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360
It makes us more comfortable.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.360
Yep.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:19.200
So, at the end of last week, the world was reeling from the news that Bill and Melinda

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.080
Gates were getting a divorce and I didn't care.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.680
Shoot them both into the sun.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:31.240
I didn't care for Alex's thoughts on it or at least I thought I didn't and then it turns

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.520
out there's a massive conspiracy here.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.000
Why would I have guessed otherwise?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Right.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.080
Robert Barnes has shown up and Alex is now explaining to Barnes how this is all...

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.960
See, I feel like Alex should know how Family Court works pretty well.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960
Well...

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.320
I mean, why was Gates and them crazy enough to do this?

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.840
I think it's because he got busted with Epstein and they panicked as a diversion and they

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.200
had this plan, Operation Lockstep on the Shelf.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.720
In fact, I know that's what happened.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.000
His wife's now confirmed she's pissed that he was having sex with kids probably.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Okay.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.560
A lot of words in there.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.640
That was a lot.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.920
She's basically confirmed probably.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.920
So yeah, his theory...

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.240
How many adverbs are too many adverbs?

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.240
That many.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.240
That many adverbs.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:22.520
His theory is essentially that Bill Gates got caught up with Epstein and it was all

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.720
gonna come out and he's gonna take the fall for it now.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:33.100
And so his wife got a divorce to protect the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and she's

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.440
confirmed it probably, basically.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.440
Basically.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.000
Probably pretty much.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
There was a story I saw in the Wall Street Journal that was about how Melinda Gates was

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.040
mad about Bill Gates having an association with Epstein.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040
Why?

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040
And...

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.140
That was good acting.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.760
You appeared actually surprised.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.960
Thank you very much.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:00.880
And some people have made comments about that, but I think that the bridge that Alex is crossing

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.560
is a little bit shaky.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.200
I mean, well, here's the bigger issues there.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.480
She knows he was hanging out with Epstein and he went to the island.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:18.040
It would be insane if she was not at least a little bit concerned about that.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.020
So that's not really a story to me.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.100
We all know that he spent time on Epstein's island.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.120
We all think Bill Gates is an evil bastard.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120
Like it's fine.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.120
You know?

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.280
I don't care why they're being divorced.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.120
I just want them shot on a rocket into the sun, Dan.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120
Sure.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.960
But you have to understand that the divorce is a critical part of COVID existing.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960
Ooh, no.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.560
I was definitely not understanding that.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.080
Because the divorce is protecting the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation now that Bill

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.100
Gates is about to go down.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:53.160
But COVID was released because the Epstein connections were coming out in like 2019.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.160
Sure.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.160
And they fucking panicked.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.160
Sure.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.160
They hit the button that said COVID.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160
Right.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.160
The COVID button.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.160
Right.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.160
And then there was a worldwide plague in order for Bill Gates's...

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.360
Why is this the first I'm hearing of this particular aspect of the conspiracy considering,

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:13.520
as Alex has told us so many times, he knows exactly how this is all going to play out?

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.120
Well, I would suggest it's probably because this is improvisational storytelling and not

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.000
actual news or research.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Also possible.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yeah.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.480
It seems like a fun wrinkle for Bill Gates's character.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.480
Yeah, why not?

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.480
Put it in there.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.480
A good way to contextualize the divorce.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.480
Right.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.480
Right, right.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.480
And that's kind of just the way Alex was feeling.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.480
Yeah.

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.480
This is character development.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.480
Yeah.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.480
Gotcha.

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.480
So anyway, Barnes is in.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.360
And also Alex calls him Barnes and I feel like don't fucking call your lawyer by their

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360
last name.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360
That's just not cool.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.560
No, no, no.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.120
I want to give my lawyer a nickname.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.320
I want to call my lawyer Dickie.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.120
Hey, come on, Dickie.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120
Let's go.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120
We got lawsuits.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.120
Come on, Dickie.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:56.200
You are fucked if you are that familiar with your lawyer.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.720
I want to call my lawyer Mr. Misses Something.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.280
I want a deep professional distance between us.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.520
I don't want to be like, what do you think of Barnes?

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.040
I do not want to text my lawyer with a question about something.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040
No, no, no.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.920
I don't want to text my lawyer when I'm drunk.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.120
Hey, Dickie, come out tonight.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.120
Come on, buddy.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.120
We're going drinking.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.440
So Barnes has got some news.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440
Okay.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.240
Robert Barnes is about to give you exclusive breaking information.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.800
Here is the exclusive breaking information as humanity fights back.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800
Robert Barnes.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.440
Yes, we're going to be filing suit over the next two weeks across the country against

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.600
three groups, governments, employers, and educational institutions that are attempting

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.640
to force or coerce people to have the vaccine.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:53.080
So Barnes is going to go spread a bunch of attention grabbing lawsuits around, which

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.080
seems to be his specialty.

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080
Yeah.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:01.140
I just, I find it impossible to believe that you could listen to this entire show, hear

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:06.800
Alex say that the government is an outlaw, and then listen to Barnes say he's going to

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.200
file some lawsuits and be like, you get them.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.200
Yeah, this is going to solve things.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.760
This is an exclusive that I wanted to hear about.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.680
And I can't wait to throw some money at Barnes to support these lawsuits.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.800
We have to.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.840
What if we're able to get an injunction against the devil?

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.140
Ooh, then we'll put his plan off for at least four more years.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:33.160
Such comical nonsense, what he's asking the audience to accept and believe.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.160
It's wild.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.520
I don't, I don't think much of Barnes to go to the forest.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:46.240
You have to go away, get ammo, get food, hide, prepare for the road warrior.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:51.160
Now we've got an exclusive, sell some of that ammo and give you that money to Barnes.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.960
We've got a couple of lawsuits going around.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960
Yeah.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960
Jesus, man.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.920
I don't think much of Barnes and I wasn't like really all that worried about this lawsuit

01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.920
going anywhere.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.400
And then I heard this, I'm like, this is not going anywhere.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:07.280
So working with Bobby Kennedy and others on all of the legal issues related to these cases

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.280
and the constitutional issues, we will have the suits filed within the next two weeks.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.080
He's working with Robert Kennedy, the anti-vax kingpin.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080
This is not going to work out.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.840
If you're Robert Kennedy Jr. and you don't get to call yourself Bobby.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:25.360
No, I feel like Barnes was doing that to sort of cover up the stink of the name Robert Kennedy.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360
Yeah, exactly.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360
Yeah, absolutely.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.800
He was not like, it's Robert Kennedy Jr.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.640
He's like, Bobby Kennedy.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.520
His ears perk up, they're like, did Sirhan Sirhan actually hide his, or what?

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.520
Yeah.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.520
Another person I don't want to be on familiar terms with.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.520
Robert Kennedy Jr.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.820
Oh no, Robert Kennedy Jr., okay.

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:49.560
So I'm going to just skip ahead real quick because I want Barnes to explain his lawsuit.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.800
We're suing under the ADA, the discrimination act that prohibits discrimination against

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.440
anyone who is perceived as disabled.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.240
We're going to be doing the same thing actually in the context of the vaccines because my

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.960
view is that requiring someone to have a vaccine is a perception that they're disabled and

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.840
then treating them differently based on that perception is discriminating against them

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.160
based on your perception of their disability.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.960
And that too is prohibited by the ADA and state analogous laws that are also similar.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:22.440
So the fact that Barnes is working with Robert Kennedy and the idea that this is the keystone

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.760
of his argument combined to tell me this is not a case he expects to win.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.880
I would very much like to be in court the day he says those exact words to a judge.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.460
Just on its face, I suspect this would get thrown out, but there's a huge element of

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.120
disability law that Barnes seems to be pretending doesn't exist.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.200
According to the government's page on disability discrimination, they do make a very important

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.200
caveat.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.260
Quote, the law requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee or

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.300
job applicant with a disability unless doing so would cause significant difficulty or expense

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:56.760
for the employer an undue hardship.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.480
Even if somehow Barnes were able to convince a court that not wanting to get a vaccine

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.520
was legally analogous to having a disability, he would still have a really hard time overcoming

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.680
the argument that having people potentially spreading COVID around a workplace or school

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:15.560
doesn't represent an undue hardship on an employer or educational institution.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.920
You run the risk of your workforce or teaching staff falling ill, and that's not even considering

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.300
the potential of having to shut down a factory or a possible bad press that could come from

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.720
being the site of a new outbreak.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.280
Much like Nick Fuentes trying to sue the TSA, this is not a serious case.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.720
This is a grift and a PR stunt disguised as a legitimate lawsuit.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.260
It's all just grandstanding and attention seeking behavior, and it's wasting everyone's

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.260
fucking time.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.260
Yeah.

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.260
Yep.

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:45.200
But I do also want to be in the courtroom.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.200
Right.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.200
Yeah, no, totally.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.200
I do think it would be pretty funny.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.200
I get-

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.200
Let's go to a courtroom.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200
No, absolutely not.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.320
Like, I do get that lawyering is a profession and lawyers like to protect each other, and

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.600
you know, judges don't often hold lawyers in contempt of court for, say, I don't know,

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.220
going on Info Wars and saying that the stated reason that you're doing this lawsuit is based

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:12.360
on magical nonsense thinking that you don't understand whatsoever that you may- what are

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.880
you fucking talking about?

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.880
Yeah.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.920
You know what I think the issue with Barnes is?

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:23.680
I think that he's less a lawyer and more a guy who has a page on Dave Rubin's Patreon

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.640
clone called Locals.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640
That sounds like it.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.440
And I think he's promoting his Locals page with the looming idea of these lawsuits.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.440
Great.

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.240
And I think that he's just trying to sucker people into supporting him on fake Patreon.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.240
Wow.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.240
And yeah.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.640
How did that lawyer collective of constitutional lawyers work out?

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.680
Remember that one from a few years ago when he was going to start that group of people?

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.240
Oh, they changed the world.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240
Oh.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.240
Well, that's good.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.240
Yeah, I don't know if that happened.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240
Boy, it seems like-

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.520
It was a bad idea, so I'm actually kind of glad that it doesn't seem like it happened.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.000
Yeah, but it seems like they tried to get a lot of money for it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I wonder what happened to all that money.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.960
Oh, well.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.000
Would you like to know how the Chinese people made COVID?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
You would?

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
That sounds more exciting.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.760
They gotta change the subject over to- this clip is nonsense.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.760
Okay.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.480
So that's how this- there's a lot of ways to do it, I've read about it.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.800
But one way the Chinese were doing it at Wuhan was, again, use a bunch of gene guns, firing

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.440
a bunch of viruses together until you finally go through an electron microscope and find

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.480
one that got the viruses together like you wanted, all meshed together.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.980
Then you replicate that in the pig.

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:36.000
The pig dies of the virus, so you know it's deadly.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.920
You grind it up raw, feed it to piglets.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.240
Those that die again, you do it, then you extract the blood, then you take out the viruses

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.240
you want.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.160
You have a growth of viruses, and you keep growing them, and then you release it into

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.040
the human population where it starts replicating, and then you have the answer to the disease

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.040
you created.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.960
The idea that this just accidentally, at the time it came out, when Trump was defeating

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.000
China, and the world was waking up, and nationalism and free market was exploding, and we were

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.960
going back to who we were, like 1955 on steroids, but for everybody, they had to counter it,

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.440
and this is the globalist counter-offensive, and they admit they had plans like this on

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.360
the shelf before.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.480
So my god, it's so obvious.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.480
What?

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.200
It's so obvious.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.200
What?

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.620
It's so obvious.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.840
What did he just say?

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.120
Look, Occam's razor tells me that's exactly what happened.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.120
Did he just say it's so obvious?

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.120
It's so obvious.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.120
Alright.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120
So obvious.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:33.200
Should sci-fi come with a warning label, like, you know, warning, advisory, for people who

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.360
cannot tell the difference between reality and fantasy, this is really going to fuck

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.360
you up.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.360
Yeah.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.600
This is really going to screw you up, you're going to think shit like what Alex just said.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.080
Do we need to have tests before you can read science fiction?

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.080
Maybe.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.220
Do we need to have some sort of comprehension test where it's like, listen, it's like a

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.920
family video, you know?

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.000
Like they've got the room in the back with all the porn, you've got to be 18 to go into

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
that room.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.400
Libraries should have that, but for sci-fi.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.200
Well, I think that science fiction expands people's minds in such a way that, you know,

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.480
as a young boy reading like Ray Bradbury or something, you know, it hugely influenced

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:15.480
a lot of creativity that, you know, maybe would have laid dormant in me as a young boy.

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:18.160
And I think that that's the case for a lot of people.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:23.120
And I think that the good outweighs the bad because I think the case of Alex is so extreme.

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.800
I'm not saying 18, I'm saying there should be a test, like whenever you can pass the

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800
test.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.320
I don't want to limit the excess of sci-fi to the young kids out there who could use

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.320
it.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.320
Might be overkill.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.320
Might be overkill.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.240
As far as I know, there is only one person who has a relationship with sci-fi like Alex

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.240
Jones, and it's Alex.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.720
I know, but we've got to stop him!

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.720
Granted, the consequences are severe.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.720
They are very bad.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.720
They're very severe.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.720
They're very bad.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.440
And he's created a false reality for a lot of people to live in, and it's very profitable.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:59.240
But I don't think that, I don't think we need to regulate sci-fi.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.240
Might be an overreaction.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.240
Might be an overreaction, I understand that.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.240
Look, spitballing.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.240
It's blue sky thinking.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240
I'm just trying.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.560
I'm trying to come up with reasons for this man who says that they're going to feed a

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.160
pig to another pig to get the first...

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.160
Yeah.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.360
I do like the idea, though, that Alex explains all that, and he's like, it's so obvious.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.640
And Barnes' reaction is, exactly.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.760
Exactly!

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.880
What are you people in your brains?

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.440
This is what I'm talking about when you go back to 2003, and you have these guests that

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.920
are a little bit, at least like, on their own turf, or whatever.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.400
They're not these boot-lickin'...

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.200
sycophantic nonsense people.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.760
Not only that, Alex, but yes.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760
Of course!

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760
It is too obvious!

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760
You are totally right!

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.960
No, naturally!

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.680
So we gotta learn about a false flag.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.440
Oh, sure, of course.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.640
I think Barnes might be wrong.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.280
You dig in deep, you find out the Klan was not an organic, authentic group.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.880
The Klan would rise and fall depending on what the politicians in power supported them

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880
or not.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.960
They were weaponized tools of the establishment infrastructure local to the community.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.440
They were not some organic group.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.960
That's why, you know, people said the Klan made up of poor white people.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.960
Totally false.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.680
If it was poor white people, there would have been some rich white people hanging from trees.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.680
There weren't.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.680
Oh boy.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.680
Oh boy.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.720
I don't even want Barnes to speak.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.240
And now that he has, I regret it.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.020
The Klan was a false flag, my friend.

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.920
That is, that is...

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.000
Yeah, it's a bummer.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.480
Oh boy.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:45.640
So also, he thinks not only that the Klan is a false flag, but that Antifa is, uh, they're

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640
hypocrites.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:51.240
If people want to look at Antifa, if Antifa was legitimately an anarchistic group, a group

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:55.680
that was opposed to capitalism, why have they never attacked the Federal Reserve?

01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:02.120
But um...

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.560
There are, you know, first of all, it's not an actual group, but also like there are people

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.640
who associate with anti-fascism who are capitalist.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.120
There are people who are anti-fascist leaning who are anarchist or believe that there is

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.120
a place for the state.

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:19.440
You know, like it's not, it's anti-fascism.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.920
Here's not, I feel like he's missing that crucial aspect because I think it's, I think

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.920
it's intentional.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920
No, obviously it's intentional.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920
He's a lawyer.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.960
No, you can't be like, if Antifa wants to be an anarchist group without immediately

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.920
stopping and being like, does Antifa want to be an anarchist?

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:37.640
Did they name themselves...

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.640
Anarchy.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:43.160
Anarchist group or anti-capitalists, Antica.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:48.880
Like sure, we can do all of those things, but if you're describing it, it's called Antifa

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.400
for fascism.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.320
You can be for capitalism and still against fascism, although one might argue that the

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:59.760
eventual road will always lead to fascism, but that's a conversation for a different

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.760
day.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:07.240
And I feel like prior to becoming an out-and-out white nationalist as he is now, Stefan Molyneux,

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:12.440
the guy who Barnes is fine hanging out with, he was an anarcho-capitalist.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.440
He did say that.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.440
So.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.440
Yeah.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.440
Anyway.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:22.560
Hey, how about this, how many Wall Streets have you fucking occupied, you dumb shit?

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.240
Why haven't they ever gone after the Fed?

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.560
Who do you think occupied goddamn Wall Street?

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560
Well.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.560
Sure.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560
But that was a false flag.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560
Oh, that's true.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.560
Anyway.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.560
My bad.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560
Barnes skedaddles out because he's got to prep that lawsuit.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560
Yeah, no, no.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.560
He's working.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.560
It's totally gonna work.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.560
Overnight.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:40.560
Yeah.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.560
Yeah.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:46.400
So Alex goes to calls and this caller, this little 10-second clip is perfect.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:50.240
They're announcing the new booster shots are going to be patches with micro glass that

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.920
goes into your skin so they can track you.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920
Did you know that?

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:57.160
No, but I mean, I believe anything now and I just, I just.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160
Yes, you will.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160
Oh, oh no.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160
No, no, no.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160
Ma'am.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.160
Ma'am.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.160
No.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.160
Ma'am.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.160
Somebody save her.

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160
That was a perfect moment.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.160
Yeah.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.160
Alex says something and she's like, I didn't know that, but I'll believe anything.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.160
Yeah.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.160
You will.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.160
You will believe anything.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.160
So you're listening to this bullshit.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.160
Yeah.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:19.320
Man, you could probably run and win office as a Republican if your slogan was just, you'll

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.920
believe any old shit I say.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:28.840
I bet, oh God, I bet if you did something that would be like universally decried as

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.720
offensive and horrible.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.720
Yeah.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:36.120
Like just, I'm going to run for office, but I'm never going to wear a shirt.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.120
Yeah.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:42.200
You know, it's just like, yeah, I feel like we, most people wear shirts.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.200
I'm not a shirt guy.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.560
I just don't do shirts.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.560
Come on.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.620
I say it like it is shirtless.

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:52.800
If you're really confident about it, I bet you could win on a GOP ticket.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.800
Probably.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.800
Yeah.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.800
Yeah.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.800
Cause they just don't fucking care.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.800
Yeah.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.440
They don't, they just hate the left.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.440
That's it.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.280
I stick it to the libs, but I insist on every public appearance that I have.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.120
I'm wearing a snake on my neck.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.520
Listen, listen, here's what we got.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.960
You want to stick it to the libs.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.360
You go with me.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360
Shirt or no.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:15.680
You want to not stick it to the libs, you vote for one of those other assholes over

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.680
there.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.680
They're not going to stick it to the libs.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.680
No, probably wearing a suit.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.780
Look, look, no shirt, no shoes, no service.

01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:23.640
No libs is what it is.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.000
No shirt, no shoes, no libs.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.200
No shirt, no shoes, no libs.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.200
Snake around my neck.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.200
Snake around my neck.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.200
Vote for me.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.200
Vote for me.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.480
So Alex, Alex has been having a good time on this, uh, this episode, but he kind of

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.080
fucked up.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.520
He meant to play a bunch of videos of Antifa pretending to be cops.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.520
Sure.

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520
Sure.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.520
That sounds right.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520
Um, but wait, I'm sorry.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520
Antifa pretending to be cops.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520
He just hasn't gotten to it though.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:52.120
And I really wanted to spend a half hour today on the Antifa videos of them acting like police

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.080
and attacking everybody and going crazy and I'll try to play a few of the clips, but I'll

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.160
just have to, I'll have to do it on the Sunday show.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.120
But I said four hours of your calls with your stories and I've been doing a pretty good

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:08.920
job lately to get to these calls because they don't want this heard, they want this shutdown.

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.360
But again, they're, they're, they're collapsing the economy and they're going to use a race

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:18.760
war as the cover for the collapse and then blame that on the race war and the American

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.760
people.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.760
So the banks don't get blamed.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.400
That's the big one ties together with the COVID that's a drill for martial law.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.880
But your calls actually are paramount above that.

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.120
If I have the energy, I'm actually pretty exhausted right now before our, if you take

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:35.960
about an hour off to do some, you know, research, I call that off, not talking for, I go back

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.080
on air, but maybe I'll pop in there in the warm today.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.080
Wow.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:46.040
So, I mean, I, you know, that's difficult to follow just as ideas, but I guess the only

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.360
thing I really take issue with is the idea that, well, there's a, you know, obviously

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.500
there's going to be a global collapse and there's a race war coming naturally in order

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:56.720
to make sure the bankers don't get blamed for that global class, but your calls are

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.720
more important naturally.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.720
Absolutely.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.040
I don't know if I were a caller, I would take issue with that.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.880
I just don't even, I don't even know how to hear him.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.200
He's just saying words.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.200
Yeah.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.200
That's exactly what I'm hearing.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.880
I'm just hearing him say words like when he's, when you're following along with what he thinks

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.200
is supposed to happen, what he's certain is supposed to happen, everything he's doing

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200
is insane.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.640
It is an insane person.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640
Like that's what I'm saying.

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.780
Is this real or fake?

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.540
It doesn't matter if he believes this stuff, he's crazy.

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:28.920
And if he doesn't believe this stuff, he's maybe more insane.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:29.920
Yeah.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.920
Cause this is...

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:31.920
Ahhh!

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.920
Yeah.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.160
So Alex does end up playing some videos of Antifa acting like cops.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.160
I think.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.160
I'm not sure.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160
I didn't watch the video.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.840
I was just listening to the audio and this is a surreal thing if you are just listening

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:49.160
to the audio because you can't see what's on the video and he doesn't say like, he doesn't

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
narrate the video at all.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:57.020
Instead he just kind of mumbles about violence and it's very upsetting.

01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:01.480
They're like pretending and larping, they're like a SWAT team stopping a bank robber, but

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.480
they're not.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.640
They're just beating people up and attacking people.

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.400
I mean, I just, I couldn't be a cop and be around these people.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.920
I mean, it's just, it's just incredible.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.440
And then they go, don't attack us while they attack you.

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.640
The left is just trash.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640
And I'm sorry, man.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.000
I love that with the metal baton, they start attacking them.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.240
We're going to slit your throat, all this stuff.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.240
Huh?

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.680
I mean, it's just who they are, man.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.160
They love it.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160
I see.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.160
I can't get around that.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.280
I'd go, I'd go King Kong on those people.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.280
I mean, I'm telling you it'd be bad, man.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.280
Are you sure you don't want to fight a lawsuit?

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.640
I got a real problem.

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.840
You want to punch my buttons, be five or six people standing there and kick my ass.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.620
That punches the buttons, man.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.520
That the bunch of overwhelming group of people.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.280
That's when the big can of crazy man gets released and that's when people start getting

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280
hurt really bad.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.520
I mean, I even looking at it, I just, oh my God, I mean, those people would have their

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:59.240
noses torn off, their heads bashed in, and then, uh, you know, some hat, somebody by

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.320
one of them stabbed me from behind.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.120
I don't even care because I just destroy each person and one at a time only takes about

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.120
five seconds.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.320
You actually get ahold of anybody can do this.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.600
Anybody can kill really what people have governors.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.600
I don't have one.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.600
Whoa.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.600
Okay.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.600
Oh, this has gone in a direction.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.600
Yeah.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.600
That's not good.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.240
Hey Alex, did you go to family court yesterday?

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:26.560
Uh, well I do need to reestablish my male dominance, otherwise I won't have any self

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.560
esteem whatsoever.

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.720
And the only way I know how to express that is through fantasies of violence, which makes

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.760
me a healthy person as everybody else.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.480
And assuring my audience that it's easy to kill people.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.900
Yeah, that's what it is.

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.680
That's cause I'm a man, you know, I don't have a governor.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.840
God, I would, I would not like to see this kind of conversation on any program, like

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:53.120
any program that's trying to be political or talk about issues, mumbling about murdering

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.720
people is just, oof.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:02.220
Well, whoever, I mean, what lawyer was it that made it so that they couldn't show clips

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.220
of his show?

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.220
Barnes.

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:05.220
Yeah.

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:06.220
Was it Barnes?

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.220
No, no, no.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:11.880
Cause, cause whoever did that, man, imagine just going to family court and just being

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.440
like, Hey, after we went to family court last time, I'm going to play this clip of Alex

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.600
on his show.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.720
It's very easy to kill.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.440
I do not have a governor.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.440
Yes.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.440
Most people think it's hard to kill.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.000
That's just cause they won't let themselves.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.240
I on the other hand, have an ease with murder.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.280
Your honor, could we please keep this man as far away from us as possible?

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.260
Yes, of course.

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:40.320
So Alex says something about murder that I actually kind of think is, I mean, it's not

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.320
news.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.900
By the way, anybody can do this.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:44.580
Anybody can kill really easy.

01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:45.580
People have governors.

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:46.580
I don't have one.

01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.520
And five, six people sort of follow me, even though I'm 47, I just young.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.960
I just want to, I want to tear them to pieces.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.400
And I know a lot of you have that in you too.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.460
And the left doesn't get that that whole veneer is starting to peel away, ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.080
So I don't have a governor.

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.940
No, I think we know that.

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:03.480
And we have known that for a long time.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.840
We're very well aware of it.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:05.840
Yes.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.960
That's kind of been the whole thing about you and your types, Alex, is that you very

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.000
clearly want to kill us.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Yeah.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.920
And we won't stop talking about it.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:21.720
In just, just amazing how in a very short period of time, you can say the left is just

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.720
trash.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:23.720
They're just evil.

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.720
They're just like this.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.120
Now, obviously I could kill and I want to, and I have no governor.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.120
And I know you do too.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120
And you could kill.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.360
And it's much easier than you think.

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.800
But that's the problem.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.920
That's the problem, Dan.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.120
The left is trash.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.120
Yeah.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.200
Now, obviously I have no governor or a moral system and I'm willing to kill.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:45.480
Despite being a Christian, I am ready and willing to kill with no governor.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.920
I have no governor.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:53.160
And the left thinks that they're all safe, but the veneer of our politeness and non-murdering

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.480
is starting to slip.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.640
Hey buddy, it slipped a while ago.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.640
Yeah.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.640
Yeah.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.720
You remember when you stormed the god damn Capitol?

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.720
Yeah.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.400
Or the Unite the Right rally or any of the...

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.760
All the murders you guys do?

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.020
Oh yeah, there were those too.

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.020
There's all the fucking murders.

01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:10.280
The time Stuart Rhodes talks.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.280
Yeah.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.280
Yeah.

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.280
That fucking psycho.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.280
Jesus.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.840
Anyway, we have one last clip here because Alex takes a call and I just want to play

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.560
this because I think it's unhinged.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:28.880
One, I was going to see if you could hold a call-in prayer session show, like a segment

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.760
hour for on Sunday or Sunday night or something like that.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.120
I think that's really smart.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:39.080
Or beyond that, people tell their testimony and talk about God and talk about how we need

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.080
God.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.320
In fact, I don't think that's just an hour of a show.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.680
I'll do the next Sunday or a special show next week dedicated to God.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.680
You're right.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.680
All right.

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.680
Thank you.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:51.680
Thank you.

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:52.680
Yeah.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.080
Because on October 12th, 2016, you prayed for Trump to win and I prayed right along

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.080
with you.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.800
And I think that granted the prayer, but...

01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:58.800
Yeah.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:03.040
I think our prayers got Trump elected and look, this is just like, this is great.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.640
If I were Alex, I would be so pumped about something like this because it's like, okay,

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.760
the audience is starting to suggest that I become a televangelist.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.760
Yeah.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.320
If I can make this transition work...

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.520
All I gotta do is just push a little bit through.

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.520
Yes.

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.960
If I can have a proof of concept where I start doing shows that are entirely pure religious

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.920
nonsense and I can make that profitable, I can stop this whole bullshit.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.880
I can stop doing things that are going to get me sued all the time.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.360
I just want to scream at these people.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.360
I don't...

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.360
Why...

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.480
I wish I didn't have any...

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.480
Governor?

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:38.480
No.

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:39.480
Biblical education.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:40.480
Oh.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:41.480
I just...

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.480
It drives me insane.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:48.120
It was hammered into me so much, so fucking much, now that the idea of these people saying,

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:52.400
oh, we're so fucking Christian and the left is evil and immoral and shit.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:53.920
Read your goddamn Bible.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.920
Do you imagine?

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.920
It's in there.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.400
Can you imagine how Jesus would feel?

01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.400
It's in there.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.800
If you made money off of praying to him.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:01.800
No.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800
He's going to...

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:03.800
No.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:07.680
He's going to do an hour long show just about prayer for you, and then he's going to plug

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.560
in the goddamn middle of it.

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.560
In the middle of your prayer.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.560
And you're going to tell me.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.440
You're going to tell me you're Christian.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.520
You fucking pieces of shit.

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.520
Please smite the global.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520
God damn it.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.240
I hate these fucking people.

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.120
Please smite my enemies.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:23.120
Amen.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.640
Also, God, I should tell you it's 25% off.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.640
I know.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:27.640
On bodies.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.640
It's unreal.

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:29.640
Unreal.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:34.720
It is just, it is just sitting there.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.720
And I see...

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.720
Yeah.

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:41.720
I think, I think it would introduce a difficulty for me in terms of like, if his show went

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.440
full televangelist, I think I'd have to keep...

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.440
Having me here?

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:46.440
No.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.680
I think I'd have to keep doing it.

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:48.680
Right?

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.000
I have to keep following the show.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Sure.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But at the same time...

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.120
I mean, it's a new, it's a new frontier for us.

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.120
Yeah.

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.020
And to be clear, I don't think that necessarily that's where he's going.

01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.120
Although I do think it would be a smart decision.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.120
Probably.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:04.400
Which is why whenever there's sort of indications of an instinct to go that way, it's like,

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.840
well, you should take that offer, Ant-Man.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.840
Probably smart.

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:08.840
Yep.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:14.400
If you can survive these cases that you're in the middle of now and get to televangelism,

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.400
you're golden.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.400
God, yeah.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400
Jim Bakker's been scamming for decades.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.400
Decades!

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.400
He went to fucking prison.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.400
He's not even trying.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.400
No.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:27.520
He stopped trying after he went to prison and just smoothly walked back into it.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.520
He has a compound.

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.520
He has a compound.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.520
In the Ozarks.

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.520
Everything you talk about.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:32.520
And no one talks about it.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.800
Everything you talk about, like I want to move into the middle of nowhere.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.880
Just do it, Jim Bakker.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.080
He sells survival food.

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.600
He owns people who live in his compound.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.600
That's real.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.600
He can tell them what to do whenever he wants.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.600
Oh my God.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.600
Yeah.

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:47.600
That's the hammock.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:51.480
That's the retirement that all shitheads like Alex should dream of.

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:52.480
Yeah.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.520
Anyway, I thought this was fun.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:02.680
If only because this study was just a travesty of Alex just being unable to even deal with

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.120
any kind of source material.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.080
No, that wasn't even redacted.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.120
That was lit on fire before he even had the chance to read it.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.120
Yeah.

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.360
It made me think very frequently.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.880
All right, shut up, Jones.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:14.880
Quite a few times.

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:15.880
Nicely done.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:16.880
Thanks.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880
Well done.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:18.880
Nice bookend.

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:19.880
We came full circle.

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.960
There was a narrative through line and you closed it out strong.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.720
And I came up with Spouse Mouse.

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.720
Yes, exactly.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.720
Yeah.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.720
In a stroke of genius.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:28.720
Yeah.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.720
Oh, God.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.720
It was a good day.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.720
It was a good day.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.240
I am never going to top Spouse Mouse.

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.240
You'll top Spouse Mouse.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.240
I'll try.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.800
Dan, Spouse Mouse is not that good.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.920
I might be tired.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:44.080
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back for another episode soon.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.620
But until then, we have a website.

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:46.620
We do have a website.

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:47.620
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.620
Yes.

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:49.620
We're also on Twitter.

01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.620
We are on Twitter.

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.620
It's adagotabedjordan.com.

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.620
Knowledge underscore fight.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.620
We are on Facebook.

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.620
We are on Facebook.

01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:59.960
If you could please find a local charity or a bail fund in your area.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.960
Also check for a new episode of our role playing.

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:04.960
Oh, yeah.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:05.960
That's right.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:06.960
Middle of the week.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:07.960
Yes.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:08.960
We will be putting that out middle of the week.

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.840
Should have another exciting installment of Dutch Wildfang and Friends.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.840
Let's hope so.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:13.840
That's what I'm calling it from now on.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:14.840
Dutch Wildfang and Friends.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.400
I thought God's Damn Wizard was a terrible title.

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.400
No, I know.

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.400
It's a play on God damn.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.560
I assume there's a wizard we're going to run into eventually.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.560
Yeah.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.560
Yeah.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.560
So enjoy that.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560
Look for that.

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.560
Indeed.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:27.560
We'll be back.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.560
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560
I'm Leo.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.560
I'm DZX.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.560
Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.560
And now here comes the sex robots.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.560
Andy in Kansas.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.560
You're on the air.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560
Thanks for holding.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.560
Hello, Alex.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.560
I'm a first time caller.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:38.560
I'm a huge fan.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.560
I love your work.

01:35:39.560 --> 01:36:07.560
I love you.
