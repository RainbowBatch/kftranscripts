00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,080
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,440
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for knowledgefight

knowledgefight

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys

Andy and Kansas

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,800
Stop it

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
Andy and K-Andy and Kansas

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,040
It's time to pray

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
I love your work

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,760

00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
I love you

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm Dan, I'm Jordan

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,920
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh indeed we are Dan

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,000
This is the second time we've had to record the intro because something happened and it wasn't recording

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,200
And in that we riffed about how I'm not a one take guy, now this is the second take of our intro

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
So here we go, and it was better on the second go round

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm not sure it was, I think it was a little smoother on the first take

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,680
You know, you were a little in your head on the second take because you were disappointed that the first take was so good

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
And you wrote down in your notebook, not a one take

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,560
Well, that's my fault, it was too good a joke

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
It was

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,480
It was too good

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
I had to cut you off at the pass

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Yeah, well you know what my bright spot is

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,480
Uh, this?

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,160
You got it

38
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,680
Dan, quick question

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,160
What's up?

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,120
What's your bright spot, buddy?

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,200
My bright spot today, Jordan, is that I made a return visit to the much-legended

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,160
Ballyhooed

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,000
No, I don't know if anyone's Ballyhooed, but it is the stuff of legend the witch store here in Chicago

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,480
Agreed

45
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Um, I went there, they have crystal balls and books and probably tarot cards and

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,400
For sure

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,080
Uh, sage that you can burn to like purify places and what have you

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,400
But they also have a large selection of bath salts

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,880
Uh huh

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,160
And I have gotten

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,920
Bath salts that grant wishes

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
That is true, that is true

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,760
Yes

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,160
Um, I have a bag that has, uh, it promises psychic powers and I have not used it yet

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Because I'm afraid to

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
Does it describe them?

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,040
No

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,000
It doesn't, what?

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,640
No, no

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
I need more, I need specifics

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,760
If you're gonna give me psychic powers, that can backfire so easily

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
That's why I haven't used them yet

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
It's too risky

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
Too much power

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,640
Uh huh

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
No one man should have all that power

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,320
I've seen a number of these movies about telepathy that end up because it's such a,

68
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,480
Such a nuisance hearing everyone's thoughts

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
Yeah, totally, you think it's a good idea

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,600
It's one of those classic monkey's paw type situations, you know

71
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,760
Be careful what you wish for and I will never wish for psychic powers

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,520
Yeah, so that's, that's on, uh, on my, near my bathtub

73
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,600
As a, in case of emergency, break glass

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,320
Right, right, right

75
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,440
Get some psychic powers

76
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,120
But yeah, for now

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,320
They're at the gates, get the psychic bath salts, quick, get Dan in the bathtub now

78
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,960
For now it's just tranquility and peace

79
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,320
I like that, that's a good spell

80
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,040
So how about you?

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,760
Uh, for me, Dan, uh, the French Open

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
Coming, coming up soon, coming up soon

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,920
Rafa in a bunch of, uh, he's at the, uh, playing on clay right now

84
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,680
Getting, uh, uh, uh, ready to go for his, uh, inevitable next French Open win

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,120
And today he fought a really tough, uh, match with, uh, Shapovalov

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,480
Who is also one of my favorite players

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,800
Okay

88
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,120
He's a Canadian kid, gangles, uh, in the present tense

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
Like he's gangling at you

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:42,960
Okay

91
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,880
Uh, incredible tennis player, though

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,320
Fantastic match, won it in the tie break

93
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,040
Rafa, it's just great, it was a great morning

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,360
Very exciting

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,080
It was a great morning

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,600
That was at three this morning, I bet?

97
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,320
That was at, that was at six this morning, thank you very much

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Well, I'm glad you, glad you got to enjoy that

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,680
Yes, I did

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
So, Jordan, today we have, uh, well, I was gonna say it's interesting

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
But we have an episode to go off on

102
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,600
See, now that's what I want

103
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:07,760
Yeah

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
That's what I want from late night shows

105
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,400
I've been, I've been broken

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,080
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we've still got to do a show

107
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
It's Thursday, I don't know what to tell you

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
It's in the contract

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,080
No, that's not fair

110
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,760
It's, there's some fun stuff in here

111
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,680
But there's, there's another thing that I'm just becoming endlessly, um,

112
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,440
What's, what, ground down by

113
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,920
Ah, yes

114
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,400
I will say

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:28,720
Yes

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
So this is May 11th, 2021, Blackjack

117
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,800
Blackjack, oh, I wasn't even close on that one

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,200
No

119
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
No, that was brutal

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,360
So, the thing that I'm getting ground down by is that, um, thing that we've already talked

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,760
about, that sort of dynamic, this show is incredibly one-note

122
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
It's all anti-vax nonsense

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah

124
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,080
Um, and when Alex comes through with something exciting like one of these primary source

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,320
documents that's, like, actually, oh, this is kind of an interesting thing to look into

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,280
There's things we can learn here

127
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,680
Sure

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,200
Middle-aged mice come up

129
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,600
Fantastic

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Spouse mouse

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
What fun we can have there

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,960
Totally

133
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
Other times, Alex just, he's got nothing

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Sure

135
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
And sometimes that nothing comes in the form of a bombshell

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
And I'm sick and fucking tired of non-existent bombshells

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
Have we heard anything about Polygon yet?

138
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,160
No

139
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,480
No

140
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,240
I'm sick of the, like, the biggest news in the world being nothing and just, like, that,

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,200
it burns out something in your brain

142
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah

143
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,960
You know, where you're just, like, hearing somebody be so fake excited about something

144
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,640
Something, I don't know, I'm gonna be in the past for the next episode

146
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,400
You're being gaslit

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,520
You're being gaslit in a way that is exhausting

148
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,200
You can only be gaslit so long before it starts to break your psyche

149
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
At the same time, I have no expectation that I should be believing Alex

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,240
Sure

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
So that helps a little bit

152
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,680
It does

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,720
It makes it less painful, but the process is still there and it's frustrating

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
You're not completely inculcated from that kind of result

155
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,920
Yeah, and so today's bombshell was just, like, I'm out, I'm gonna be out for a while, so

156
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,440
Today's bombshell

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,920
Yeah

158
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,560
Okay

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
I'm selling this episode real well

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,280
So, Jordan, before we get into this, though, let's take a little moment and say hello

161
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,000
to some wonks

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
Ooh, that's a great idea

163
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,920
So, first, I can't wait to see LeVar Burton host Jeopardy in July

164
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,440
You are now a policy wonk

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,480
I'm a policy wonk

166
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,880
Thank you very much, I agree with you on all fronts

167
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
I bet LeVar Burton's a policy wonk, too

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,680
That'd be nice

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
Honkinatrix, practitioner of clown-like bondage, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

170
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,200
I'm a policy wonk

171
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Thank you very much

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Thank you

173
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,080
Next, The Foxiest Chicken, Emily, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

174
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,120
I'm a policy wonk

175
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Thank you very much, The Foxiest Chicken, Emily

176
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Thank you

177
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
Next, Frank Rizzo, Jerky, you are now a policy wonk

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm a policy wonk

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
Thank you very much, Frank Rizzo, Jerky

180
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
And, uh, I don't want to say this, oh well

181
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,920
Don't whisper it into my ear and I'll say it

182
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm not going to do that

183
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,880
Okay, fair enough

184
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,640
I'll just bite the bullet on this

185
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,640
The Return of Poop Feast 420, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

186
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm a policy wonk

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,120
Thank you very much, I'm looking forward to the third installment, that's going to be my favorite

188
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,200
Revenge of Poop Feast 420

189
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
Yes, absolutely

190
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,880
And then I'd like to say thank you to technocrat out there, David S.

191
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,040
Thank you so much, you are now a technocrat

192
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm a policy wonk

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

194
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
How's your 401k doing, bro?

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,520
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

196
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
Let's just get down to business

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
We ain't making that money off that heroin

198
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,160
Why you pimps so good?

199
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,560
My neck is freakishly large

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,040
I declare info war on you

201
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,840
Thank you, David

202
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,360
Yes, thank you very much, David

203
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
Also, I don't know how to do this exactly sometimes, you know, like

204
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,400
Yeah

205
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
Well wishes for birthdays

206
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,480
Sure, sure, sure

207
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Sometimes it's kind of difficult for me because

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,640
You do it at the bottom of a well, naturally

209
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,560
That's where I throw my pennies

210
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
For everyone's birthday, I should say, everybody who we wish a happy birthday to,

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,520
I do throw a penny into a well

212
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
That's really nice of you

213
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,440
That's nice of you

214
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,960
I should do that, I just, you know, I don't walk by enough wells

215
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,480
Yeah, there's so many in my neighborhood

216
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,200
I know, it's true

217
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm not always sure whenever someone's birthday is on the weekend

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
Whether we should do this on the Friday show or on the Monday show, what do you do?

219
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,080
That's fair

220
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
Do you do it after the fact or do you wish them a happy birthday a couple days early?

221
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
It's like Saint Patrick's Day, when do you celebrate it?

222
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
When is it observed?

223
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,840
When is it, yeah

224
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,640
I never quite know, but I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead of the game on this one

225
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,560
On the 16th, this weekend coming up, Cameron's got a 30th birthday

226
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
And Nicole would like to wish him a happy birthday

227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,920
Well congratulations, Cameron

228
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,840
Yep, happy birthday, hope you have a great one

229
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
And hope doing this in advance was better than like if you'd heard this on Monday

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,040
I've been like, wow, that would have made my birthday a lot better if I'd fucking heard it earlier

231
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,480
Yeah, but what if this is so important to him that now

232
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,760
the rest of his actual birthday is just gonna be a huge letdown

233
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Everybody's gonna be like, happy birthday

234
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,520
And he's gonna be like, my birthday was when the Knowledge Fight guys said happy birthday for way too long

235
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,040
This is the risk we take

236
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,720
So Jordan, there's one bit of news that's been going around that I want to address

237
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
Doesn't come up on this episode, but it is something that happened

238
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
at the beginning of this week, and that is that Alex is back in the gold game, my man

239
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
InfoWarsGold.com

240
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,240
Alright, it's about time

241
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah, I've been seeing indications that he was getting ready to start this back up again

242
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,000
But I wasn't sure if he was ever gonna take the plunge

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,840
And then a large portion of the show on Monday was an interview with his new gold sponsor

244
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,200
A guy named Drew Mason from St. Joseph Partners

245
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,640
A precious metals outfit out of Pauley, Pennsylvania

246
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,760
I didn't know too much about this guy or his business

247
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,520
outside of the fact that he decided to get into business with Alex Jones in 2021

248
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,120
So I can't say much about what's going on with him, but I know he's not cool

249
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,080
I cannot give this gold away

250
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,040
I'm gonna have to partner with Alex Jones

251
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
So I did find it interesting

252
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
I was looking into it a little bit

253
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,560
And there's no physical address for St. Joseph's Partner available on their website

254
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,480
That struck me as a little bit curious

255
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,560
It's just an asshole with a chest buried in his backyard

256
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,960
Well, the contact information is literally just an email address

257
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,760
Yeah, exactly

258
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
It's an asshole with a chest buried in his backyard

259
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
But here's where things get weird

260
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,920
Okay

261
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,080
So if you click on their contact us page

262
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,320
An image of a Google map pops up

263
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,680
With a marker at the address 8 The Green Dover, Delaware 19901

264
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,960
However

265
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,000
That's a tax shelter

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,840
Delaware is a tax shelter state

267
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,760
If you Google St. Joseph Partners, you get a different address

268
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,920
1776 Lancaster Avenue, Powley, Pennsylvania

269
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,080
This is the address for Powley Plaza, which is a strip mall of shops

270
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,720
It doesn't look like there's a real, like, brick and mortar location for this gold out there

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,840
Sure, sure, sure

272
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,160
There is a Reed as Italian ice

273
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,040
I think they specifically may have chosen 1776 as a...

274
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
No, I don't think so

275
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,440
I think it's a coincidence

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,240
Oh, okay

277
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,840
Powley is a city with a population of, like, just over 3,500

278
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,000
So why would they have a shop there?

279
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,880
It's ridiculous

280
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,120
Right

281
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a UPS drop box

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,120
That's what it is

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
Yeah, of course it is

284
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,720
Yeah

285
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,040
So as you astutely already realized, Delaware is a tax haven type of state

286
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah

287
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,880
And 8 The Green

288
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,840
Thanks, Biden

289
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,120
8 The Green in Dover is a pretty notorious address

290
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,920
It's the location that's used by a company known as a registered agent incorporated

291
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,400
which allows people to incorporate their business in Delaware

292
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,640
Right

293
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
Which a lot of folks do to avoid

294
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,040
Avoid taxes

295
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,520
But it's actually not that...

296
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,040
It's not all about taxes

297
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,400
So LegalZoom has a breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating in Delaware

298
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,160
And one of the perks is when you file in Delaware, you don't need to disclose your

299
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
directors' and officers' names to the state, which allows you anonymity

300
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,800
Oh, that's way better than not paying taxes

301
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
I bet people would pay extra taxes for that option

302
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
This became an issue a few years back, as was covered in the Delaware News Journal when

303
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,960
the SEC was trying to investigate whether a number of Delaware-based LLCs had engaged in fraud

304
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,240
235 companies were at issue, 24 of them were based in Colorado, while the rest were in Delaware

305
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
And most of the businesses in Delaware were run through a registered agent incorporated

306
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah

307
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,440
Anyway, none of this proves anything that's explicit wrongdoing, but it's a bit sketchy

308
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
I would say that the only way Alex could come up with a gold dealer I'd be less inclined

309
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
to do business with than Ted Anderson is if it was a guy who had no apparent physical

310
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
address whose site appears to be explicitly saying that he got a phony incorporation in Delaware

311
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,360
Yeah

312
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,560
I would steer clear of this, and if anybody out there is actually interested in investing

313
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,320
in precious metals, I have to assume that there is a safer and better option

314
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,280
So many other options that aren't just a weird dude with a UPS dropbox

315
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah, it's...

316
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
There's at least three other options

317
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,000
There's renting a boat and going under the water for sunken treasure

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
That's a way better option

319
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,420
Yeah

320
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Then of course there is globetrotting and stealing ancient artifacts from Egypt and the like

321
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,200
Sure

322
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
That's always a good option

323
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,520
And then I guess the securities market?

324
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,720
Alchemy

325
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,360
Oh, alchemy

326
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,840
You forgot alchemy

327
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Shit, I forgot four

328
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,200
Yeah

329
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Yep

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,160
You're right

331
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
There's always four ways to learn

332
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,080
You got it

333
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,680
So yeah, I don't know, I'm not too excited about this endeavor

334
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,280
I think it looks really sketchy as hell

335
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,720
And it's just another instance of Alex having like landing pages with other people's shit

336
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,040
Right

337
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,680
Because it's like, okay, so yeah, infowarsgold.com

338
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,160
But that just takes you to St. Joseph Partners slash Infowars

339
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,040
It's just taking a cut

340
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160
It's just an affiliate tracking league

341
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,800
Yeah, basically

342
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,520
Yeah

343
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,600
So we get to May 11th here, starting it off, Tuesday's show

344
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay

345
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
Alex has big news

346
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,040
Does he?

347
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,360
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, May 11th, the year is 2021

348
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,720
And this is undoubtedly the most important news we've ever broken today

349
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,360
I stayed up here late last night but got too exhausted to finish the report

350
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,400
It'll be done in a few hours and I was so pleasantly surprised

351
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,600
when I got home and turned on Tucker Carlson to have dinner with my family

352
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,040
that he stumped us

353
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,520
Gross

354
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,240
Yeah, I know, that was an upsetting image

355
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,560
Gross, gross

356
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,720
But even past that, I love the idea that it's like, I have the biggest news of my career

357
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,160
and I got sleepy last night

358
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,240
I was just too tired

359
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,200
I was just too tired

360
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,920
Honestly, you know, around 11 o'clock the Xanax kicks in and I'm just out

361
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,880
I'm in a life and death battle with the devil

362
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
Sure, sure

363
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,560
And I have the silver bullet that will defeat the devil

364
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:26,800
Right

365
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,680
Yeah, I mean, I think that's one of the devil's big advantages

366
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
He never seems to get tired

367
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,960
He casts sleepy spells on people

368
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,040
Well, that's nice, that's nice

369
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
So I was curious about this big news

370
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,280
and actually I decided that this would be the day that I've covered

371
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,360
because he's got the biggest news ever

372
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,760
Of course

373
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,560
We already had the biggest news ever like twice this week

374
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,040
Right

375
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,280
And so I was like, wow, I mean, this has got to be big

376
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,160
Here's the headline, Tucker Carlson, Anthony Fauci let the coronavirus pandemic happen

377
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,360
Well, they did it on purpose

378
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,120
Why isn't there a criminal investigation?

379
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,560
Well, we have the smoking gun where the director for Bill Gates and for Fauci

380
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,920
admitted to creating the five in one super virus on video

381
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,960
So the video that Alex is referring to is an episode of a podcast called This Week in Virology

382
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,760
produced by the American Society for Microbiology

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,240
Sure

384
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,560
The guest is Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance

385
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
Alex claims that he's a director for Bill Gates

386
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,600
but this clip that's from the actual interview seems a little bit at odds with that

387
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,960
Do you have support from say Gates Foundation?

388
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
No, we don't, we never got Gates money

389
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,880
I think that Gates, Gates have a strategy of specifically targeting things

390
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
that they consider neglected, diseases that were neglected

391
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
We're working on what they consider not neglected diseases

392
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,040
So I guess he got no funding from Gates

393
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,080
Yeah, that would make sense

394
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,120
Anyway, big mess up there on the giant news of the day right out of the gate

395
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,880
Yeah, that's not a good start

396
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,880
So this is a really interesting interview that Peter Daszak had

397
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
but it's being completely misused by Alex

398
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,400
to paint the picture of a guy confessing to created SARS-CoV-2

399
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,400
In reality, the EcoHealth Alliance is a nonprofit that works on global health issues

400
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,440
from the perspective of what Peter calls One Health

401
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
This is a philosophy that every condition has a human component,

402
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,960
an animal component, and an environmental component

403
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,080
Trying to approach any condition without considering the intersection of these three

404
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,360
is not going to be as full of a strategy as taking the full picture into mind

405
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,920
Right

406
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,040
The EcoHealth Alliance grew out of a conservation organization

407
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,760
and part of their ethos is a belief that you can make pragmatic

408
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,440
and economically sound arguments for ecological conservation

409
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,840
For instance, in the interview, Peter brings up the unexamined health costs of deforestation

410
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,040
that massively outweigh the profits that are made from the practice

411
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,600
Right

412
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,240
If it can be made clear to everyone, the decision makers,

413
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,960
that not only is destruction of nature bad,

414
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,760
but it's also not even in the best interests of profit,

415
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,040
these people believe that they can make headway towards conservation action

416
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Right

417
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
I watched the whole 35-minute interview and essentially what it comes down to

418
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
is that Peter discusses working with labs in many countries, including China,

419
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
where they do surveillance of animal populations

420
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,400
to try to identify any diseases that could become a problem for humans

421
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,040
Sure

422
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,360
One of the concerns he brings up is coronaviruses

423
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,440
and he discusses how you can manipulate coronaviruses in a lab pretty easily

424
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Alex is taking that statement to be a confession

425
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,360
that Peter combined a bunch of viruses together

426
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,080
and then unleashed them as SARS coronavirus 2

427
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,160
But the reality is really different

428
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,560
It's really just about crafting lab tests that assess

429
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,520
whether or not newly discovered viruses can even infect humans

430
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah

431
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,680
If I were Peter Daschik, I would immediately sue Alex Jones

432
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,160
Totally

433
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,880
There's a video with a picture of him with the title, quote,

434
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,440
Smoking gun video Fauci project manager confesses to creating COVID-19

435
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
That's a definitive claim

436
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
That is definitive

437
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,640
That Alex is reporting

438
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,600
Defamatory

439
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
It's outrageous

440
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:54,400
And I can't imagine, like, how unsafe this is to do to somebody

441
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,800
Yeah, no, no

442
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,200
And I don't know, like, exactly what the line is for, like, public figure

443
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,680
But I'm not sure that I would put the president of eco-health non-profit

444
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,880
as a public figure in the same way that, like, a celebrity or someone

445
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
At the same time, I guess an argument could be made

446
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,520
that he's become somebody who goes around on some news programs

447
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,360
talking about COVID

448
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,440
Because of assholes like Alex

449
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,600
Alex forced him into becoming a public figure by giving him the attention

450
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,680
that he should never have had in the first place

451
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,280
if anybody responsibly treated this fucking pandemic

452
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,920
No, I think even without some of that, he would have been seen as somebody

453
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,240
who would be gone to for interviews on, like, in the early days of the outbreak

454
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,640
Sure

455
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,440
I think he still would have made some media rounds

456
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,320
But again, what I'm saying is I'm not sure exactly where that line is

457
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,800
Yeah

458
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm not sure what side he's on, but I would be, I would be

459
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,080
Let's find out, I would like to find out

460
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,360
I would like to fuck around and find out, quite literally

461
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I think it would be worth discovering

462
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,080
because you can't just do this to people

463
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,040
It's outrageous

464
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,400
No, I saw a little bit of that Tucker thing and I just began spitting

465
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Like, the idea of him doing that after being the cause of us all being locked down

466
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
for a fucking year

467
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,120
That's grounds for immediate slapping

468
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,680
If you see him, you get to slap Tucker Carlson in the face

469
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:26,160
The Tucker piece was largely based on that article that Nicholas Wade wrote

470
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,080
And even that doesn't claim to have a conclusion

471
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,200
The second or third paragraph of it is, I have no direct evidence for either theory

472
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,440
Yeah

473
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,920
Whether it's a lab origin or natural origin

474
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,160
Yeah

475
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,200
And it's being used by people like Tucker to push the, it must have been made in a lab

476
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah

477
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
Now, Alex's version is far more irresponsible than what Tucker's doing

478
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,760
Oh, totally, totally

479
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,520
Which is, which is normal, but

480
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,640
Anyway, Alex got scooped by Tucker

481
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,960
Now, I told you at the end of the war yesterday

482
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,520
that the biggest news yet was coming out, but I would break it today

483
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,400
Tucker Carlson broke it last night and he gave you about 80% of it

484
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,560
But the clip he didn't play, and we're going to get to that after we play the Tucker Carlson

485
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,520
Report, a part of it, is that the director of the program under Fauci and Gates

486
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,880
On record funded by them, four million bucks for just six programs

487
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
They funded some others as well at the Wuhan lab

488
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
Gave an interview and admitted they were splicing five viruses together

489
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,480
As a bio weapon to then produce a, quote, vaccine for it

490
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,000
And that they got emergency authorization to do it

491
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,320
This is game over for these people, ladies and gentlemen

492
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
If the public ever grasped this

493
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,280
It's game over

494
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,920
It's game over

495
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,320
Yep

496
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,360
Sure

497
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,040
A lot of stuff being made up in that clip

498
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,600
Yikes

499
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,360
So Alex plays Tucker clips for most, like a lot of the first hour

500
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,040
That's, that's a good job

501
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,360
And I don't make a big enough deal out of this, but like he plays a lot of the first hour

502
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
A lot of Tucker Carlson clips

503
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,760
That's great

504
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,120
It's a lot of, like in place of special reports sometimes

505
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,560
You'll just have a Tucker segment

506
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,360
That's awesome

507
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,720
I love it

508
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,560
I love not having to do my job, and that is a perfect encapsulation of

509
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,400
I will just let a famous person fill in time

510
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,960
That's great

511
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,600
And it'll deeply associate myself with him

512
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,080
Totally

513
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,360
Yeah, it's

514
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,120
Brilliant, brilliant marketing strategy

515
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Anyway, I found this to be a little funny

516
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,600
Here's Tucker Carlson and we'll come back with the rest of the story

517
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,960
You're never taking off the mask

518
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,280
Get ready for a lifetime of filthy wet cotton covering your mouth

519
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
Reduced oxygen flow to your brain

520
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,600
And a world where every stranger looks the same because no one has a face

521
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,400
When Kamala Harris and her husband kissed the other day while wearing masks

522
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,040
They were giving you a preview of your daughter's wedding

523
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,560
In a masked world, human beings never really touch each other

524
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,040
You whiny fucking babies, you whiny babies

525
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,240
I don't watch Tucker Carlson that much, so I don't know if this is like indicative of his style

526
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,920
That is, whoa, holy shit

527
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,400
He's got some very dramatic writers employed on that staff

528
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
That is your daughter's wedding

529
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,240
You're gonna watch your daughter and her husband kiss with masks on

530
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,200
Okay, instead of sign language, there should just be a picture-in-picture of a guy making the jerk-off motion

531
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,120
Just like, listen to this fucking asshole

532
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,760
What a dick

533
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,400
Ugh

534
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,800
And I mean like, what was it, just like the next day the CDC released guidance that if you're vaccinated you don't have to wear masks

535
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,040
No, that's, it should be criminal

536
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,200
It should be criminal to be Tucker Carlson

537
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,160
It should be criminal

538
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,560
You can slap, if you see him in the streets, you slap him in the face

539
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,920
This is a dangerous precedent to set

540
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,880
You're right, you're right

541
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,760
Gotta walk that back

542
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,840
Okay, there's only, then we will only set this precedent for one person

543
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,640
I'm not sure I can sign off on that, but the point is, you're never gonna be taking the mask off

544
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,320
Smashcock, two hours later

545
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,640
The next day, Jesus Christ

546
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,160
Great, cool

547
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
Anyway, Alex has the biggest news ever

548
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host

549
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,920
We're breaking the biggest news we have ever brought out on air

550
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
It is incredible what's happening

551
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,080
The lab manager for the COVID-19 gain-of-function research being done at Chapel Hill

552
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:32,160
had it moved with the scientists at Wuhan and then admits on video to merging five viruses together

553
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,280
to be able to then deploy them

554
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,080
See, I was listening to this and it didn't match with the interview that I had watched

555
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,640
Yeah

556
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,680
It didn't seem at all accurate

557
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,720
He's on video saying five different viruses were combined

558
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,680
Play that clip

559
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,520
What a bombshell, he confesses to it

560
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,680
So I was really confused

561
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,320
Like I said, it didn't seem like it was what I had watched

562
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,120
So I went and I watched Alex's special report about this

563
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,800
I was trying to figure out what was going on

564
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,360
Right, right, right

565
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
And that helped make it a little clear

566
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,040
Daschick was talking about how some of the coronaviruses they discovered didn't have

567
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,640
known treatments, and the interviewer, the person giving the interview, asks a follow-up

568
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,680
question about that

569
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,080
Daschick then discusses how if you're going to create a vaccine for something like SARS

570
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,000
because so much of it involves the spike protein, you probably want to create a vaccine that

571
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,240
was effective against multiple coronaviruses

572
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,960
Sure

573
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,200
He was just discussing it in terms of like that is that seems like something people would

574
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
do if they were going to go that route

575
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Have you ever

576
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,520
That is not at all as him saying, I've used viruses

577
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
I've fused viruses together

578
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,280
Alex might as well just scream like, we kill one bird, one stone, no more!

579
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,720
He's like, Alex is pretending this guy's like, I stitched together viruses with a needle and thread

580
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,160
Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah

581
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,120
He's got some magical sci-fi technology where it's spinning around with, yeah, it's stupid

582
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,640
Now, it should be incredibly clear and very strongly pointed to that Alex is talking about

583
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,720
this with the premeditated intention of hurting people, with the idea of shutting down the

584
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,600
economy, the idea of killing people in the developing world, and he's saying that this

585
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,680
guy is admitting to doing that by way of creating the virus SARS-CoV-2

586
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,480
Yes

587
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,240
And I think he should be sued for that

588
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,880
Yeah, he did just call the man responsible for what would essentially be mass scale murder

589
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,520
So I would hope that that would be in some way defamatory

590
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,960
It feels like it's real playing with fire

591
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
Especially considering everything we know about Alex's audience

592
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,600
Yeah

593
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,680
Anyway, I was like, wow, okay, this is not a bombshell

594
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,240
But it feels like Alex is going to talk about this quite a bit

595
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,720
A lot

596
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,800
Uh, then he said this and I was like, what?

597
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,480
Now, I have Alfie Oakes on about the pipeline shutdown, the food shortages

598
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,000
He's one of the biggest producers of food in Florida, if not the biggest

599
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
He doesn't just own grocery stores

600
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,480
His real business is growing food

601
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,040
And I wanted to get his expert take on the inflation we're seeing and where that's going

602
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,600
So Alfie Oakes is the guy who owns that grocery store that Alex went to in Florida for a week

603
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,560
a while back

604
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,120
Is he a former oil pipeline expert?

605
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,760
I don't care

606
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,160
No, he's not, but I don't care what he has to say either

607
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,480
However, it should be noted that he's only relevant in any way because he's made a big

608
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,520
deal out of how no one has to wear masks in his grocery store

609
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,080
In a completely unrelated story, I would like to inform you that Ted Nugent tested positive

610
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,040
for COVID just one week after doing an in-store appearance at Oakes grocery store seed to table

611
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,720
Prior to this, Oakes had appeared on Ted Nugent's YouTube show called The Spirit Campfire

612
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,320
and said, quote, no one is getting infected here, no one's dying

613
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,960
I want to get the truth out, it's a fraud, it's a sham

614
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,000
And people have to wake up

615
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,680
Anyway, fuck these people

616
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,480
Oh my god

617
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,880
God, I'm starting to think that believing that witches are responsible for your problems

618
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
is a recipe for getting COVID

619
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,520
So Alex has this idea that no one else is posting this Tucker Carlson segment

620
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,760
and so he's going to put it up on his website, but just because no one else is posting it

621
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,400
not because he's trying to poach content or anything

622
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,160
We're going to have the whole thing posted to the Band.video

623
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,840
so in case they try to take it down

624
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,240
and the full Tucker Carlson 14-minute dialogue has also been posted

625
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,040
because Fox isn't posting that on YouTube

626
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,160
They always post this full show, they always post clips, they're not doing it

627
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,200
So in the interest of public interest, I'm posting it to Band.video

628
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,120
for commentary and analysis and historic reference

629
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,600
Historic reference

630
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,800
That's a free copyright

631
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
I'm not canceling Alfie Oakes, I already did it yesterday

632
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,200
and I'm not canceling Ted Nugent, they're here and it all ties together

633
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,160
but after they're gone in an hour and five minutes from now

634
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,520
I am going to, you see this stack right here?

635
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,280
This is all the documents he's talking about and the videos of total open and shut case

636
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,360
There isn't a grand jury in America

637
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,600
If I had a day to show them this and the clips would not indict Fauci

638
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
and indict Peter Daszak and all these people

639
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,640
That'd be really funny to see Alex trying to prosecute a grand jury

640
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,320
Yeah, you know this, Alex doesn't have his heart in this

641
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,840
It doesn't feel like it

642
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
I think he didn't actually read the story

643
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,800
because I get a sense at a lot of points that he doesn't really have a handle on the details

644
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,080
of things and he can't really weaponize the story correctly

645
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840
He's treading water a whole lot

646
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,320
and that's one of the things that I find incredibly frustrating

647
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,120
Like this video, this podcast interview was months old

648
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,240
It's maybe a year old

649
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,800
Of course

650
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,480
I think it was from March 2020, I believe

651
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
and if you go and look at it on YouTube months back

652
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,480
people are commenting on it like, oh my God, the smoking gun

653
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,160
of, you know, so it's something that's been in that space for a while

654
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,080
Alex has no rush to report this

655
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
It's just that Tucker brought it up the night before

656
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,040
So Alex needs to make a bombshell out of it without actually knowing the story at all

657
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,320
And so he just kind of rushes to air and it's stupid

658
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,120
I just, I find myself just incredibly uninspired

659
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,840
And at the same time, I think it's incredibly funny that Ted Nugent probably got COVID

660
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,760
by going to this guy's grocery store

661
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,480
and they're both guests on the show today

662
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:26,880
Yeah

663
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,920
That's weird

664
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,520
Yeah, that's, I don't even know how to deal with that

665
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,880
Honestly, in like a real universe where you believe in reality

666
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,280
like where you accept reality as a thing

667
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,880
I can't be in the headspace of somebody who thinks any of what happened is okay

668
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
It's funny, but it's not great

669
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
No, no

670
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,320
It's not the kind of funny I'm looking for

671
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,640
No

672
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
And this is why I'm going to be in the past for a little bit

673
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,760
No, it's, I'm going to scream, I told you so funny

674
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,400
Yeah

675
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,400
So anyway, Fauci, that guy, Tony Fauci

676
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,360
who Alex actually looked into like at the beginning of the pandemic

677
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,120
and he's an all-star, he's a legend

678
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,880
and Dr. Steve Pacanik said that he's one of the best who's ever existed

679
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,840
One of the best there's ever been

680
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
But then all that went away really fast

681
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,040
Hey, wow, that's because he's evil

682
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,480
Anyway, he's got to be executed

683
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
Well, I'm going to tell you Fauci and Gates and all of them

684
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,920
are going to be lucky if they just spend all that rest of their lives in prison

685
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,040
after we have Nuremberg trials

686
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,680
A lot of them

687
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,200
If justice is done through the courts

688
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,600
I'm not calling for outside the courts of vigilante stuff

689
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,440
but I believe they should be tried for treason and biological warfare

690
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,560
under the Nuremberg code

691
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,600
And I believe just like Nazi scientists, they should be executed

692
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,560
Oh, I thought you meant hired to work for us

693
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,320
I stand for justice against these criminals

694
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,480
And we'll see who wins in the end of this

695
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
But I know this, I'm with God

696
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
And that's what really matters

697
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,720
God watches over our battlefields, over our lives, over our children

698
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,680
and over our destiny

699
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,880
And I put my hands into Jesus Christ's hands

700
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,920
I put my soul into Christ's orbit

701
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,080
And I commit myself to God

702
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,920
All right, I got to go to break

703
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,320
We got Alfie Oakes coming on

704
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,640
One of the biggest food producers on the East Coast

705
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,080
to tell you what's really going on

706
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,400
with the giant food price increases that are already here and coming

707
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,080
Don't forget, you have until tomorrow night at midnight

708
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,680
that it's got to end to get last year's prices on high quality, affordable food

709
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
ready to ship to you within days

710
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,480
They ship it out the next day

711
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,360
That's convenient

712
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,400
It's May

713
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,640
Yeah

714
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,280
You're going to have another chance to get last year's prices today

715
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,400
I think so, yeah

716
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,760
December, you'll have a chance to get last year's prices

717
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,880
You're going to be all right

718
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
It's not going to be it

719
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,080
The Easter sale is going to be going in December

720
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,320
Yeah

721
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,800
So yeah, I just, I found that to be like, just, right?

722
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,920
This is how it goes

723
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,400
Yeah

724
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,040
Intense, violent fantasies towards his enemies

725
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,520
Yeah

726
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Blah, blah, blah, I love God

727
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,080
Food guy's coming on to scare you, I sell food

728
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,320
Yeah

729
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,200
It's cookie cutter, cut and paste

730
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,840
That is really, really lazy

731
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,200
It's just really lazy

732
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,600
It is

733
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,840
And we all have our bad days, but for Infowars, this is just unacceptable

734
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,760
And it's such a stark contrast between the bad day that surrounded the middle-aged mice

735
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
Because at least that's funny as hell

736
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,680
Yeah

737
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,480
That's lazy, that's bad, but there's a funniness to it

738
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,760
There's an energy to it

739
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,760
This is a 35-minute podcast interview with a guy from a year ago

740
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,240
Yeah

741
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,680
That is interesting, but Alex doesn't have a handle on it and can't really do much with it

742
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,480
It's just, I don't know

743
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,680
And your guests are a grocery store guy and a

744
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,240
A perv

745
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,560
A perv, a former, yeah

746
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,000
Fuck both of these guys

747
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,840
So there's other news in the world though

748
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,240
Sure

749
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
Of course, that pipeline

750
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,240
Naturally

751
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,480
Yes

752
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,360
Mm-hmm

753
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,920
Yeah

754
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,000
I heard this clip and my response to it was, okay, Alex, fine

755
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,560
Then you've got the Keystone XL Pipeline that was opening a few months ago

756
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,120
It got closed to bring in all the oil from Canada and around the Midwest down to Houston

757
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,880
To be refined and then sent up the Colonial Pipeline to the East Coast

758
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
So Biden shut that down

759
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,120
They say some shadowy hacker group did it

760
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,640
They say they want to post-industrial America

761
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,840
He said he would kill fossil fuels

762
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,560
I believe the main suspect is Biden now blaming Russia

763
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,600
That's just where the historical evidence is

764
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
And, you know, if he already shut down our main other pipeline

765
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,120
Well, why wouldn't he shut down the other?

766
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,840
I have made up that Biden is the prime suspect in the Colonial Pipeline

767
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,680
And now I'm reporting it as the most likely possibility

768
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,320
Interesting

769
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,720
Yeah

770
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,560
Interesting if true

771
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,920
Historical analysis

772
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,160
If true, that would be

773
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,280
That's a way bigger bombshell than anything else

774
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,600
Bombshell President Hacks' Own Pipeline

775
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,560
That's a bombshell

776
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,200
That'd be crazy

777
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,760
Right there

778
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Yeah, and also I can't help but, like, now that I know that Alex, you know, back in the past

779
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,680
Would say that his prediction of 9-11 was based on historical analysis

780
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,400
Sure, sure

781
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,960
And research

782
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,320
And then it turns out it was just a dream

783
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,360
Bill Cooper said that

784
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,560
But he also just had a dream

785
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,920
Well, it was a good dream

786
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,040
I can't help but hear him say stuff is based on, like, research and analysis

787
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,840
And be like, you're probably lying and you probably had a dream

788
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,040
Yeah, you watched the net the night before and then transposed Biden's face onto Sandra Bullock

789
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,480
Which is a nightmare, I agree

790
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,560
You fell asleep watching Tucker and now you had a little bit of the Nyquil and you're fucked up

791
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Man, I still can't get my head around the idea that the whole family, like,

792
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,480
gathers around a dinner table and they have Tucker Carlson on

793
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,920
I bet they don't

794
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,120
Of course they don't

795
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,160
That would be a, that's the worst thing I can think of

796
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,440
Yeah, I bet they don't do that

797
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,160
I bet Alex sits alone and eats dinner watching Tucker Carlson

798
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,760
Yeah, I imagine Alex spends a lot of time alone watching Tucker Carlson

799
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Gotta take notes

800
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,680
So Alfie Oakes is on and it's mostly just about fear, spreading fear about food and stuff

801
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,400
Sure

802
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,000
But you also should know that if you want to take that seriously

803
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,080
You should know what else Alfie believes

804
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,280
We know that Biden, the Biden White House agenda is lockstep with every single thing that these

805
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,760
globalists want to do to ruin our country, to have their takeover

806
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,600
We're the last beacon and I do feel, with all this doom that we see

807
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,640
I do feel very confident that we're going to get the country back this time

808
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,760
It's not going to be easy, it's not going to be as fast as everybody wants

809
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,920
But our American spirit is still there

810
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,280
I feel firmly that there was 80 million people that voted for Trump

811
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,080
And somewhere in the 61 million that voted for Biden

812
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,280
And the majority of Americans even in the national polls do not agree

813
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,360
70% of Republicans, 31% of Democrats in the numbers higher know it was a fraud

814
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,120
Stay there, let's talk about solutions

815
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,760
Yeah, so Trump actually won in 2020 and we're going to get the country back?

816
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:42,960
Huh

817
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,640
So does he seem like a really credible source, the kind of guy you want to hang out with?

818
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,360
What is it about white man and undeserved confidence?

819
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,720
Where does it come from, Dan?

820
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,360
He says looking into a mirror

821
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,720
I don't know if this confidence that Alfie's got is undeserved

822
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,840
Because I think he's a sleuth

823
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,200
That's possible?

824
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
I think he's a sleuth

825
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,400
And I base that on this next clip where he lays out a conspiracy that is almost certainly true

826
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,080
He can probably not come close to proving it

827
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,280
And he might also tip his hand a little bit too much at the end of this one

828
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
Will he give me a discount on eggs?

829
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,280
Maybe

830
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,920
Okay

831
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,840
These companies like Monsanto in particular owned by Bayer

832
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,040
Think about this and this scam has been going on for a long time

833
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,160
And it used to be maybe thought of as a conspiracy theory

834
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,360
But we're watching it play out

835
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,920
Used to be

836
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,520
We disrupted like putting real fertilizer in the ground

837
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
Like real organic fertilizer

838
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,200
They're putting this chemical MPK that Bayer will sell these farmers

839
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,360
Universities are telling them it's okay to use

840
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,160
Then because it's not nutrient rich

841
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,360
It grows an inferior product and most of it's GMO stuff

842
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,800
So then that product grows

843
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,920
We put it in our bodies

844
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
Our bodies are starving to death

845
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,360
We fill up our guts with stuff

846
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,080
But we're starving because the food that we're eating is not nutrient rich

847
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,200
And then guess what?

848
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,000
We get ill

849
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,840
And guess what company is selling you the pharmaceutical drugs

850
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,520
That supposedly make you better

851
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,240
It's Bayer

852
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,440
It's the same company

853
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,360
So it's a vicious cycle

854
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,400
And it's really

855
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,080
I don't know if they were that genius to create it

856
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,200
Or if they've just been

857
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,040
Let it go along the way

858
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,920
But this

859
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh we actually have documents where they give us the illnesses to then give us the treatments

860
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,360
Exactly

861
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,440
It's 100% what's happening

862
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,600
And this is why

863
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm not saying it because I have local farms and we grow the stuff the right way

864
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,240
But go out there and support your local farms

865
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,680
Oh it's good that you're not saying that because you run competing business interests

866
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,240
Well

867
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
Because I might have been worried that

868
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,040
There's that

869
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
Look I'm no fan of Monsanto

870
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,160
No I think we've all

871
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,640
I think that's the only thing that unites all Americans except for the ones who work high up in

872
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,560
Monsanto is that I think everybody's gotten high and yelled about Monsanto to each other at one point or another

873
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,640
Yeah I think that some of the practices that they have are disreputable and I'm not a fan

874
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,840
But I don't think it's sensible to speculate that they are making everyone sick

875
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,080
So Bayer can sell prescriptions

876
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,800
Or whatever

877
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,120
And then for Alex to say we have the documents that they get us in order to sell us cures

878
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,560
But I mean you don't need

879
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
That's so not specific

880
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,920
You don't need any conspiracy theories because a business trying to monopolize food is bad

881
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,420
Yeah

882
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,400
Before you go any their entire existence is now based around trying to control food

883
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,840
And everybody needs food

884
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:52,720
Yeah the idea I think ever of making terminal seeds you know that don't

885
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,000
That that's just so fucking evil I'm like real downright

886
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm not

887
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:58,960
God damn

888
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,520
I'm not sure what you do to legislate it but any company that would be interested in doing that

889
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,200
I find to be abhorrent

890
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,700
Yeah

891
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,880
And I understand why the profit motivation would lead you to that idea

892
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah no of course

893
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,920
But it's it's no good

894
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,280
Yeah no absolutely

895
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,880
So anyway I don't like Alfie much I think that conspiracy that he's got is really stupid

896
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,480
But he did contribute to one thing I can get behind and that is probably giving Ted Nugent COVID

897
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,000
That is good that is good

898
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Uh so

899
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
Not all heroes wear capes dad

900
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,440
Well Ted Nugent's back and better than ever

901
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,840
Damn it

902
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,720
He's fine

903
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,200
Shit

904
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,480
But he still rambles a lot

905
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,960
Okay

906
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,960
So right now as I face you Alex I couldn't be healthier

907
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,000
I couldn't be more cocked locked and ready to rock the glock around the cock Mr. Spock

908
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,120
And I killed two black pup with my bow and arrow

909
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:56,400
I'm literally tooth picking my teeth right now in an in an immeasurable joyous celebration of medicine

910
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,720
It sounds like he always sounds like he's on coke but talks all the time about how sober he is

911
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,280
Yeah I know

912
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,160
It's really frustrating

913
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,280
That's so annoying

914
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,640
So anyway a lot of this

915
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,840
I hate him so much

916
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:14,560
A lot of this appearance on uh the show is about how excited Ted Nugent is that people celebrated

917
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,320
him getting COVID because because it validates him because all these bad people are against him

918
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,400
And I would say that it's just because he's been a dick for a really long time and no one likes him

919
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,040
Yeah

920
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,920
Yeah but some of my other musician friends from around the country got hit real hard

921
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,080
Now you never heard those stories

922
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,880
Yes you did

923
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:40,000
And no devils wrote journalistic hate hoping that my friends and other bands die

924
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,800
They weren't shitty

925
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,720
For the Chinese virus but they did that about me

926
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,840
Because you're shitty

927
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,800
I know you love me I feel the love I celebrate the love

928
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,920
But do you realize as as bad of a mofo as I think I am

929
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:59,280
I couldn't possibly be as wonderful of a human being to deserve the hate from the Satanists

930
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,480
That they've trended a global article celebrating my sickness and suffering

931
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,960
Is proof that they're scared to death of me and it makes me so happy and so strong

932
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,320
Oh man that's cute

933
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,760
No no one is scared to death of you we were all just kind of hoping you'd finally go away

934
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,360
I do think that there's something probably unhealthy about people being happy about or

935
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,000
laughing at or celebrating when some tragedy befalls someone who is an asshole

936
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,560
Sure sure

937
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,560
But I would be an idiot to not think that the reason is because Ted Nugent's a fucking idiot

938
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:34,960
Yeah

939
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,000
Alright he's a fucking asshole

940
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,400
Yeah

941
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,040
It's not because anybody's afraid of him or his ideas

942
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,360
He's ready to rock around the clock like Spock or whatever the fuck cares

943
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:51,200
Yeah this is all your fault it's all his fault personally like that's that's the thing it's

944
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,440
it's not necessarily schadenfreude so much as it is when somebody spends so long telling you that

945
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,520
this thing isn't even fucking real and all of this shit everybody's celebrating because fucking now

946
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,320
do you get it do you get it now and they won't and they won't so that's why the only thing you

947
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,560
have left to do is be like well I guess I just hope he dies or goes away

948
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,640
You laugh you know you laugh at Ted Nugent getting COVID after going to a

949
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,320
COVID is a hoax grocery store and having a whole long period of time where you're yelling about

950
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,640
oh you know it's not that bad it's all wow in the same way that like you laugh when Ted Nugent

951
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,960
bans guns at his concert right you know it's the same yeah kind of like oh that's interesting

952
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:42,240
no it's a it's a physical real world example of the you know me reaping versus me sewing meme

953
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,880
you know like that kind of thing so now Ted Nugent has an interesting metaphor here that

954
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,920
I was very confused by I want to see if you can make sense of this okay well I consider myself a

955
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,840
Schindler and my list of Jews that I'm saving is growing so quickly and so voluminously and they're

956
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:05,040
all white brown shirts hate everything I stand for now that's some metaphor that I think the Alex

957
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,360
Jones viewers will understand but some people will completely miss my point is that I have

958
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:20,720
dedicated myself to being in the asset column to be productive so I I do think he's right that some

959
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,520
people will get that metaphor confused because even when he's trying to explain it he's just

960
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,800
he's explaining it that he's put himself in the asset column of life he's productive yeah that's

961
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,600
what he's talking about and the way he's explaining that is he's Oscar Schindler right saving Jews

962
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:43,600
who's on he what does he mean does he have a physical list of people that he's acting like

963
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,360
Schindler about or is it just that the brown shirts don't like him well I mean based on what

964
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,880
he's describing like being productive yeah in the asset column yeah the only way that that really

965
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,640
helps other people is by example I guess sure so I don't know I don't understand this no I don't

966
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,200
understand that metaphor I don't think it's offensive I don't see him actively saving anyone

967
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,120
and I see him stealing the valor of an actual hero in order to prop himself up and boost his

968
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,880
ego and confidence yep it was offensive yeah very offensive so uh there's a solution to the problems

969
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,400
in the world and of course it's guns but there's another solution uh that Ted Nugent has it's more

970
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,200
Alex's ah what do we do when the country's awake uh but they've stolen the election and are really

971
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,680
trying to start a civil war well Alex number one uh we need more Alex Jones that are willing to

972
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,960
put their literally their lives on the line spotlighting the cockroaches that have metastasized

973
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:54,160
into every orifice every every element of America the media our government uh Hollywood uh academia

974
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,440
it's literally at their best moment they're marxists more often than not they're literally

975
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,880
rock solid in this in the Satan column if you look what they're doing that the economy it's

976
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,720
all artificial we're selling pork bellies and orange futures that there are no groves of orange

977
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,960
to represent and the pigs won't have enough babies to produce the pork bellies that they're selling

978
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,320
I mean I'm just the entire player but I understand economics 101 but the most important thing is to

979
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,440
support the Alex Jones to watch Tucker Carlson and look at the evidence and share it with our

980
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,320
dumb friends and our dumb family members with all due respect I don't have any dumb family members

981
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,200
and I don't have any wrong friends but I see them wearing masks on their motorcycle so I know there's

982
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,560
some really dumb people out there that have turned into walking breathing mouth breathing zombies

983
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,200
so there's something that I that stuck out to me when I was hearing that and it's just he's angry

984
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,280
yeah he's really really really angry he's trying to come off with this laughing like I'm just a

985
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:03,040
guitar player but yeah but he's fucking so mad there is there is an effect of rage underneath

986
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,640
everything that he's saying that is really unsettling yeah yeah he's a he's a real psycho

987
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,800
yeah it's a real psychopath kind of thing to do it feels it it feels scary let's call John Ronson

988
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,440
and uh see what he has to say about the psychopath test for I just love I just love to go from one

989
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,720
clip where he describes himself as Schindler and then to the next clip where he describes his

990
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,680
political enemies the same way the Nazis described the Jews boy it's not glaring it sure seems like

991
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,720
a strange thing for someone like Schindler to do yeah awkward yeah weird awkward is not the word

992
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,120
I would use almost like all Nazis now want to describe themselves as the Jews despite the fact

993
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:54,800
that they are still trying to exterminate them weird great so um they have uh Alex and uh Ted

994
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,840
they have uh some commonalities uh some less complimentary than others um one of them that

995
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:08,400
is a little bit maybe neutral is an interest in the outdoors and hunting sure um and so Alex

996
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,680
believes that the most effective way to convert liberals over to their side is to go hunting and

997
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,040
then Ted Nugent says something that I find a problem getting back to hunting I found with

998
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,840
leftists and liberals I've taken a lot of Hollywood people out over the years my judge and I did a few

999
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,960
times in Texas they convert to shooting and hunting instantly and and don't know why they

1000
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,040
were taught to hate it so I found the most successful way to convert leftists is if you

1001
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,520
can get them hunting or fishing there's no question about I've had such a success with

1002
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,440
that from the rock and roll world that I'm in where they've been brainwashed that somehow

1003
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,240
animals have rights in between the barbecue the brain dead propaganda mushy goofness that exists

1004
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:54,080
out there but to the man and the woman and mostly the Ted Nugent camp for kids children we baptized

1005
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,360
tens of thousands of people who were animal rights inclined because of the propaganda

1006
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:05,680
and then they realize you want grass-fed natural organic renewable ultimate healthy protein it's

1007
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,160
called venison I don't know if he actually has a camp for kids but if he does I'm gonna guess

1008
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,320
he's not all that hands on that should be illegal that should be illegal but I think that just from

1009
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,400
from like a you know umbrellaing out from that clip sure he believes that animals don't have

1010
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,960
rights yeah no he absolutely believes that anything that is an animal is subject to man's

1011
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:36,000
domain over earth he's a dominionist I think that there's there's an interesting argument to be had

1012
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,560
that animals have more rights than we ascribe to them right I think because they have less agency

1013
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:49,360
I am not fully conversant on some of the arguments in favor of vegetarianism or veganism from

1014
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,760
ethical perspective sure but I think that there are some interesting uh things that can be

1015
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,880
discussed along those lines right and and I just look at it as like I live with a cat Selene is

1016
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,520
like a friend to me yeah and I believe that she has many rights now if I were Ted Nugent

1017
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:15,120
I should only be mad if you killed Selene because she was my property right the only thing there is

1018
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,680
a property right that's been violated as opposed to something really fucked up you've taken the

1019
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:26,240
like life of this this uh this companion animal what that also means though is that you have the

1020
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:33,280
right to kill Ted Nugent if he attacks Selene in any way because property rights are sacrosanct

1021
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:39,760
yeah it is it is strange too to imagine the way he would distinguish between humans and animals

1022
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:48,080
in terms of where do rights begin yeah um I think that's really troubling I I think I think you

1023
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:55,520
could go too far with it maybe I would say that if you think animals have no rights you are probably

1024
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,440
of the opinion that uh many people are also animals who don't have rights or cockroaches

1025
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:08,720
exactly so uh I would uh I would not enjoy anybody who's like no rights that's not good

1026
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:15,840
and I think typically it's best to to err on the side of uh being more sensitive sensitive to uh

1027
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:22,800
ascribing rights to to animals I mean they can't communicate but they're clearly having a like a

1028
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,560
conscious experience absolutely there's no way that you can have not figured out that animals

1029
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:35,920
have personalities by now it's it's pretty pretty messed up yeah Ted yeah Ted anyway again there

1030
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,880
should be a restraining order keeping him away from any children if somebody writes his songs

1031
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,120
that's an immediate restraining order away from children I'm choosing to believe that that was

1032
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,720
a metaphorical flourish like rock around the clock with a sock on my head sure sure glock

1033
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:57,520
bock bock yeah that's a chicken doesn't have rights that's true anyway uh Alex gets uh Ted

1034
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,960
out of there and uh it's because he's got the biggest news in the world to break which I mean

1035
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,040
he's had a bit of time to do that already decided to talk to Alfie Oakes and Ted Nugent oh my god

1036
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:16,720
ladies and gentlemen I'm about to break the most important news in my 27 years on air

1037
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,880
Reagan breaks union strike absolutely incredible and if this information does

1038
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,000
not bring the criminals to justice if it does not reverse the operations that they've launched

1039
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,360
then things are going to get a lot darker a lot quicker let me give you a summation before I go

1040
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,600
through the evidence so when Alex says something like if this doesn't bring down the globalist

1041
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,840
things are going to get dark fast it's essentially him saying I can't make up anything more

1042
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,440
sensational or antagonizing than this like the next step from this is me telling you to kill

1043
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,960
people yeah I can't make it more clear I already know this is impotent so you guys better

1044
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,600
glean my actual meaning from this because I'm making it very obvious yeah so anyway you get

1045
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:09,120
to the big news emergency alert Fauci project manager confesses to creating COVID-19

1046
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,520
Tucker Carlson began to break this last night I told you on the war room we'd be breaking it today

1047
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:22,400
he broke it that's great but he didn't get to the last part where he admits the project manager

1048
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,600
because legally they couldn't get to that last five get the five viruses that they combined them

1049
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,720
for a vaccine but to make the vaccine you got to make the pathogen of something that never existed

1050
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,720
that no one would ever make yeah I think Tucker didn't cover that because it's not in the interview

1051
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,840
yeah so this next clip I thought was really funny because he's talking about Tucker's segment about

1052
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:48,080
this yeah and while he's talking Alex is kind of being a little wishy-washy about whether or not

1053
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,160
Tucker segments being censored sure and I think it is this like all right I'm posting a 15-minute

1054
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,880
long video that's clearly owned by another media organization yeah I better come up with a good

1055
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:08,000
reason why that's okay something and now Tucker Carlson has come out the 14-minute report last

1056
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,160
night that they're not posting the YouTube so we posted the Bandaw video and exposed this

1057
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,880
so we posted the Bandaw video and exposed this the censored Tucker Carlson report Anthony Fauci

1058
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,360
let the coronavirus pandemic happen why isn't there a criminal investigation that's the Fox

1059
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,400
news headline and Fox has the report but it's not on YouTube there it is censored see the

1060
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,960
Tucker Carlson Wuhan lab report Fox News won't let you see and that's the crew's great I didn't

1061
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,360
give him a headline this I did say the headline this morning I actually said say see the censored

1062
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,880
report see the censored Tucker Carlson Anthony Fauci so just change the headline please to

1063
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,120
censored and then this headline overhead shot please this headline right here this headline

1064
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,600
Tucker Carlson Anthony Fauci let the coronavirus pandemic happen why isn't there a criminal

1065
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:07,200
investigation okay this is the censored report in the sub headline you explain that Fox isn't

1066
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,400
posting this online they may have changed that since I went live oh well maybe okay maybe they

1067
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:20,160
posted it okay okay all right all right get at it again jerk off motion in the picture in picture

1068
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,400
a hundred percent Jesus so Alex ends up talking a little bit about this story about the

1069
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:33,600
interview on the This Week in Virology it's just this is tragic so here it is

1070
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:46,240
Peter Daska president of EcoHealth Alliance starting in 14 with project lead on six NIH

1071
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:53,600
projects would focus on the emergence of novel zoonetic coronaviruses COVID with bad origins

1072
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,400
some of the project's work was performed at the Wuhan Institute of Virology now we're going to

1073
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,880
show you him saying that it's an hour-long interview oh Alex is just stumbling over

1074
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,280
everything yeah it's not an hour-long interview it's a 35-minute interview it's not good just

1075
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,960
everything is is just it's even by the rules of rounding up you're going to 40 it feels like a

1076
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,000
guy trying to climb a rock but it's just covered in slime or something yeah it's just not working

1077
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,960
no it is very much like he doesn't understand at all what he's talking about and so they're just

1078
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:31,200
like we don't have much else on the show today clearly all we could get is fucking Alfie and a

1079
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:38,000
disgusting Ted Nugent so fuck it let's air tucker stuff and I'll just kind of riff through it

1080
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,160
yeah and like really oversell it yeah so he talks a little bit more about some details and it's

1081
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,600
again not accurate the six project received a total funding of three million seven hundred

1082
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,520
forty eight thousand seven hundred fifteen dollars from the National Institute of Allergy

1083
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,960
and Infectious Disease that's what Fauci is the head of and we've got all the grants and all that

1084
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,720
all the grants and all that right here so Alex is reading some information here but he doesn't

1085
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,360
really understand any of it the amount that he's talking about that three million plus dollars

1086
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:13,040
that's the amount of grant funding that EcoHealth Alliance has received since 2014 from the NIAID

1087
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,520
for a project that was meant to assess the risk of bat coronaviruses spurred on by the SARS and

1088
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,080
MERS outbreaks and the need to prepare right right right right one of the findings that this research

1089
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,600
that was funded by this grant arrived at was they found a number of bat-borne SARS-like coronaviruses

1090
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,720
and interestingly they also found quote serological evidence of human exposure among people living

1091
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,840
nearby this is something that tends in the direction of the natural origin theory for SARS

1092
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:43,280
coronavirus 2 people who are researching naturally occurring coronaviruses had found a number of them

1093
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,720
and discovered evidence of previous spillover of viruses that had previously gone unnoticed if the

1094
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,960
particular virus had been different in any of those cases or something had gone slightly

1095
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,000
differently people had interacted differently any of those instances could have been the start

1096
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,680
of an outbreak yeah Alex's main piece of evidence he's presenting here these these grants and this

1097
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,680
study it actually makes me think the opposite of what his conclusion is I'm I'm blown away

1098
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:15,200
like this is this goes back to that hospital this goes back to the COVID payments from Medicare

1099
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:21,760
where it's like they get 16 grand like I'm blown away that you think you can make me worried about

1100
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:28,480
a conspiracy theory where it's like it cost the globalists and the devil three million to kill

1101
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,680
everyone on earth if that's how much it costs to kill us why do I have to deal with all these

1102
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,200
fucking billionaires they don't need that money they could kill me with a few million yeah nothing

1103
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:46,640
yeah yeah it's I don't know it it's that it's that part of your brain that just doesn't quite

1104
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,800
you know three million dollars is a whole lot of money it seems like an insane amount of like I

1105
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,520
would I will never see three million dollars but yeah that's nothing in terms of a research grant

1106
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:03,520
that was over the course of 2014 to seven years yeah it's not that it's not that much in terms of

1107
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,800
what research actually costs yeah absolutely I mean for a business if you want to say if you

1108
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:16,080
want to say that a conspiracy theory about this is a huge deal over seven years a business would

1109
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:21,680
probably be disappointed with revenues if they were only at that amount Alex would be disappointed

1110
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:27,280
Alex would be furious with revenues if he didn't get a three million in five years in seven years

1111
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,320
or whatever yeah so anyway I just found myself incredibly uninspired by this conspiracy but I

1112
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,800
was inspired by this which we've heard before but I got to thinking about it a little more

1113
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,680
I was talking to Dave Mustaine one time I'm not name dropping he said I want you to help me write

1114
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,280
a new album with songs like Four Horsemen I wrote and I just looked at him right along my car here

1115
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,600
in Austin I said dude this is a very surreal day we just had dinner with Willie Nelson

1116
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,000
and I said I said I think that's up to you to write that album and he did write that album

1117
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,680
so I what a great story that was that was a great story that was on par with I was walking down on

1118
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:12,160
uh New York City Avenue and I saw Ben Affleck and I was like hey Ben and he was like hey

1119
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:19,840
Dave Mustaine was really drunk around me one time exactly it's the same story that sucks yeah I

1120
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:28,000
kind of disappointed because I it sounds kind of like Alex is trying to claim that Dave Mustaine

1121
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,080
wanted him to help so so respects Alex as a songwriter but he wants him to help write

1122
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,200
songs that would be on the album right that had Four Horsemen on it and that was Kill Em All

1123
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,760
by Metallica which came out in 1983 when Alex was nine yeah I wish I wish that was what he

1124
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,440
was actually claiming yeah but it's like no I want you to help me write songs that are like that

1125
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:57,360
let's get a burrito yeah I can't imagine I can't imagine anybody turning and looking at Alex sober

1126
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:04,480
and being like hey I want you in an enclosed space with me uh writing songs together Alex

1127
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:12,640
Alex you're basically the Jim Steinman of your generation I need you to bring this song to life

1128
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:19,360
come on get uh get Taylor Swift's producers out here get those Swedes get the Matrix yeah get

1129
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:26,160
them going where's the dream would you need them for Alex's next album so I I think we've been

1130
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,000
talking a little bit uh along the way through this episode that it just feels like Alex doesn't have

1131
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,560
anything to grab on to no just it it feels really in terms of the conspiracy here's two and a half

1132
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:42,400
minutes of Alex saying nothing okay basically just kind of dancing around but he doesn't know

1133
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:50,480
anything to to latch on to terrible this is hands down the biggest crop of awakening the the the

1134
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:57,760
biggest hall of truth the biggest wound to the globalists the biggest opportunity to deal a

1135
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:04,800
death blow to these people politically to their agenda to kill their agenda and I mean the domino

1136
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:11,040
starts falling you're gonna have Nuremberg trials I mean there's gonna be people getting hung sure

1137
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,800
because that's what happens when you launch a bio attack is you get marched up there and they pull

1138
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:21,600
a switch and a trap door opens up and you fall about you're a fan of Assad that's what happens

1139
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:26,080
and your legs start kicking you take a dump down the side of your leg what I don't like death I

1140
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,400
don't like killing people I don't like starting to fight with these murderers but they started

1141
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,440
to fight with us and and I'm just telling you like I said in the first hour that we don't

1142
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:44,320
want any violence against Fauci or Bill Gates or the New World Order from vigilantes you want to

1143
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,320
take our governments and our countries back and we want to have them indicted with all the evidence

1144
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:56,480
and we want to see them up on Nuremberg too and that's what last weekend I had the weekend before

1145
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,120
last I had Dr. Francis Boyle on and he laid all that as well then the punishment for what they've

1146
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:06,000
done is death and so I don't say that to be dramatic I don't say that to stick my head in

1147
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,840
the mouth of a lion these guys are hyenas but still they can what stop it because I will not be

1148
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:18,160
a coward coward and I want to thank God for your prayers listeners and I want to thank God for

1149
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:26,400
God taking action this is devastating devastating devastating

1150
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:35,200
there's no way to describe how much trouble they're in and I can tell you this they're

1151
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:42,800
never going to get out of this now one way or another this is a political death blow to what

1152
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:47,760
these guys did they're megalomaniacs though they were mad at Trump they were mad at Bolsonaro

1153
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,280
they were mad at Boris Johnson who's a follower but thought he was winning Brexit and could do

1154
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,720
what he wanted they launched this to bankrupt the small economy to bankrupt the hard-working people

1155
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,320
to let the global banks and big box stores take over with big tech and they had it cooked up and

1156
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,360
they had it ready and they did it in China so they could release it so they had plausible

1157
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:10,400
deniability and so it was an attack on humanity none of that has anything to do with any of the

1158
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,960
bombshell stories nothing just rambling and ranting about nothing yeah assuming the conclusion

1159
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:24,000
has already been made it's it's it's time filler it's nothing yeah that's brutal yeah that's brutal

1160
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,040
also if Alex says megalomaniac if he calls somebody a megalomaniac and doesn't say it takes

1161
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:37,520
one to no one then it's disqualified it doesn't count if you do say it takes one to no one maybe

1162
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:43,120
i'll listen to you because you are number absolutely one of them yeah but i think i think

1163
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,680
what's going on generally speaking is that alex doesn't have a good handle on this story he knows

1164
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:53,760
a few details he's already spent those um so you spend a bunch of time rambling about uh you know

1165
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,280
like Fauci will hang and uh oh we've all proven it it's all this great sure because i think what's

1166
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,720
really interesting to the audience isn't it really the nitty-gritty details or anything like that

1167
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,840
it's an emotional experience yeah and alex is giving them an emotional experience and that is

1168
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:16,720
the this is the end that we have details are bad whenever but we've won there's no way they're

1169
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,360
going to get out of this one it doesn't sound like the duke boys they're in trouble i don't know the

1170
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:26,640
duke boys tended to get out of them not the globalists oh that's fair this is a big deal

1171
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,240
and i'm here to tell you that i have never felt so much fulfillment and i wouldn't call it

1172
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,240
satisfaction this is a horrible thing we're in a global war the globalists are at war with

1173
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,680
humanity this is a terrible thing happening but i've been around 47 years and i have never

1174
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:50,480
never felt so much satisfaction in my life except maybe a few times where i was getting my ass

1175
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:59,920
absolutely beat uh and i dug down deep and turned on the turned on the ben grim power and you know

1176
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,160
broke that guy's jaw and saw his head at the ground and i wasn't happy i'd hurt him bad but

1177
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:09,440
i was happy that i'd won the fight it was just a it's a feeling of just satisfaction that you just

1178
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:17,280
you did it and you reached down and you turned it on ed risking my life you risking your life

1179
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,080
everything we've done together man the satisfaction right now because i can tell

1180
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:29,760
you they're not going to survive this and everything they've done to all these people

1181
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:35,520
these millions they've killed all the people they starved to death with the lockdowns they're gonna

1182
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:42,160
get retribution they're gonna be avenged so alex is basically like on this tip where he's like the

1183
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:47,760
nuremberg trials will start in june yeah like you might as well be like planning them and getting

1184
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,880
like a twitch stream ready for the nuremberg trials yeah this really does seem like uh

1185
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:58,640
army building that's supposed to no it's not it's it's given the good news of the the victory

1186
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:07,600
we have won yeah the globalists are done now that this video from a year ago has been talked about

1187
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,400
that doesn't sound true to me no it doesn't no that's the emotional experience that alex is

1188
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,400
wishing to create and convey because he's got nothing else yeah he's got nothing else and this

1189
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:25,520
news doesn't really lend itself all that well to like uh be very scared yeah it is interesting the

1190
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:34,960
oh the like there is a ratio between emotional manipulation and actual details for right-wing

1191
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,000
people because they you can't just give them information that that that doesn't work you

1192
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,560
have to have emotional manipulation and you can't let information get in the way of that emotional

1193
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:51,040
manipulation but you also can't have nothing like this is nothing it's a lot of nothing yeah nothing

1194
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,840
you know it's it's uh it was infuriating to listen to in the in the sense that it was

1195
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:02,960
um kind of like i would describe it as being like eating a cinnamon twist from taco bell

1196
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:08,240
but without any of the flavor i was about to say empty calories no taste yeah it was exactly

1197
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,920
cinnamon sugar on it but it's that same you get you got the texture of what you were supposed to

1198
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,600
eat but there's nothing to it it's just mush yeah yeah and and as somebody who you know really does

1199
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:25,680
get excited when there's uh middle-aged mice studies to look into of course uh whenever there's

1200
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:32,240
something like the spars document to look into totally i find this to be a little bit unsatisfying

1201
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:39,120
and i take it personally yeah i i resent it yeah yeah i don't think that alex's quarterly uh

1202
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:47,280
job evaluation is going to go well just just from my perspective having uh information about how

1203
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:55,040
uh the boss feels uh which is springsteen of course q3 is gonna be rough it's gonna be terrible

1204
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,960
he's gonna have to get his numbers up if you want a sense of how real a piece of news is to alex

1205
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,520
i think one of the things you should take uh stock of is how much of the time of the

1206
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:11,120
show is actually spent talking about that bombshell yeah yeah is this such a bombshell

1207
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:17,760
that you don't go away and talk to alvie oaks and ted nugent forever yeah is this such a bombshell

1208
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:24,800
that you don't uh i don't know spend the end of your show just talking about nothing and then

1209
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,080
cover this for a little while i want to play a short clip from the war room not

1210
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:37,280
owen schroyer three to six p.m but steve bannon's war room and i know steve bannon

1211
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,120
and roger stone have had their fights uh i i don't want to be in a fight with anybody

1212
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,880
i've had my issues with bannon but he's obviously a smart guy but he and his

1213
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,120
host co-host made a statement about alex jones people used to think was crazy

1214
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:55,840
but now he's improving right well that that's how it is when you're ahead of your time but

1215
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,480
it's not about me being ahead of my time it's about people realizing that we don't make this

1216
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,760
stuff up we really tirelessly research and we have a wide spectrum understanding of the world we're

1217
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:12,880
not specialist generalist in that we really study how the globalists operate and we know how they

1218
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,720
do things so we know how to counter them and and we know how to beat them everything should be

1219
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:23,520
about the globalist because they're the ones in control of civilization taking us to a very bad

1220
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:29,440
place and so that's what i'm getting at here but it is good to see it trend yesterday alex jones

1221
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:35,280
trended on twitter again that alex jones was right and uh you can just type in my name or you can do

1222
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:42,640
it all over many other places sure sure so so a little bit of alex jones uh media attention gets

1223
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,400
some get some coverage here i i just feel like he's such an insecure dick yeah like it's it's

1224
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:55,200
so sad like uh how many times has have we heard him talk about hating steve bannon he's a fucking

1225
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:01,440
worm the worst he's the devil he's part he's gone to the globalist he's part of their team

1226
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,920
he was so pissed off when steve bannon named his show war room it was an attack on info

1227
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,400
force trying to take away all their hey but look he's a smart guy because he said something nice

1228
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,880
about me and let's spend 10 minutes on my show talking about how someone said something about me

1229
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:23,040
what an asshole not hard today alex isn't a bad guy well i wish i hadn't screamed that everybody

1230
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,320
should kill him uh it turns out that you know he said i wasn't a bad guy so yeah he's a pretty

1231
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:34,880
cool dude he gets it he gets it have you ever seen uh uh bill mar's basically secret tucker

1232
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:42,240
have you ever have you ever seen like a a breaking news story uh or a bombshell report

1233
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:47,520
and then all the news organizations who normally have like live blogs and there's constant media

1234
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,720
coverage just kind of stop and they're like can we just ramble around a little bit we just got

1235
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:57,440
to have a little fun you know this bombshell story is fine but you know i'm just gonna talk

1236
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:03,040
a little shit with my buddy over here right wolf blitzer guy derails the show situation room

1237
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:09,280
for a while because someone tweeted about it yeah so brian stelter is just all of a sudden like

1238
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,840
hey guys you know uh i met willie nelson one time yeah yeah we went out for dinner one night

1239
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:19,600
uh you know he's like hey you pretty good songwriter yeah brian stelter is like oh one

1240
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,080
time i was hanging out with uh uh jumbo wumba and they wanted me to write an album

1241
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:31,600
oh boy yeah and even just like let's let's think of it even closer analog imagine brian stelter

1242
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:38,000
taking time to yell about alex jones's appearance totally totally so look at how big

1243
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,400
look at how big fat alex's neck is isn't that great isn't this great content that everybody

1244
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:52,000
tuned in to see yeah so uh i feel like the job has not been done and alex doubles down on not doing

1245
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,840
his job all right folks um i meant to take calls today i did and paul watson's coming up i got a

1246
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,400
lot to hit before the show's over in 22 minutes or before my part of the broadcast is over

1247
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:09,920
but let me do this because it's so powerful i aired it during a little no man's land first five

1248
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,360
of the second hour but this is really an important report he's playing a special report for the second

1249
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:22,560
time in this show he's replaying a special report that that's how little he cares about the story

1250
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:29,680
that he's covering this is this is kind of amazing yeah this is a complete abdication of any even

1251
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:35,360
pretense of work yeah yeah yeah to me to me every indication is like i don't know enough to

1252
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,560
competently even riff on this yeah yeah yeah uh but i do want to cover it because tucker

1253
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,360
covered it last night and i'll be way behind if i wait until tomorrow this is the bullshit that you

1254
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:51,200
get from a shitty boss where he's always any mistake you make like perhaps not being able

1255
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:56,400
to figure out how the phone system works for 20 years he's always screaming at you but then

1256
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,120
whenever he comes to work with this bullshit you don't get to yell back at him that he's wasting

1257
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:06,160
everybody's fucking time somebody should drive like a button where they get to scream hey screw

1258
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,960
you you suck at this job i think that's what our podcast is oh that's fair so we don't have a

1259
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:17,360
button though alex uh spent some more time uh talking about the pipeline hack and uh i want

1260
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,440
to remind you that he's always right his gut is very strong this is not gonna sound good this

1261
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:27,840
ain't hard oh i'd give it about a 95 chance the globalist did the pipeline shutdown

1262
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,720
five percent chance somebody got pissed they shut down keystone inside and it's doing that to show

1263
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:40,240
everybody the dependence on pipelines 95 it's globalist five percent chance that i'm wrong

1264
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:44,480
it was done by people pissed off uh with the keystone being shut down to show people how

1265
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,640
dependent we are but see that's in a logical world you do that and then maybe we'll understand but

1266
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:55,120
no there's no logic here yeah so wait what 95 chance globalist false flag five percent chance

1267
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:00,400
false flag carried out by people trying to remind us that pipelines are important okay so it's an

1268
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,280
educational false flag so if i understand correctly there's a zero percent chance it

1269
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:12,720
was hackers the logical in a logical world yes naturally somebody on the inside would be furious

1270
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:17,600
about people shutting down the keystone pipeline yeah so it only makes sense that they would then

1271
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,120
shut down a different pipeline as an educational lesson yeah yeah yeah like hey be careful what you

1272
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,440
wish for right that's exactly what's going on call that terrorism that would be technically

1273
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:33,920
terrorism yes yes there might be attacking infrastructure to teach a lesson to let's say

1274
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:40,400
spread fear yeah i think i think it's interesting to see the way that alex's brain kind of like

1275
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,920
comes up with possibilities yeah he's just a terrorist you know anything has to be fake

1276
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,720
everything has to be everything has to be fake what kind of fake is it yep it's very stupid what

1277
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:58,000
a dick yep so alex is uh ranting because again just filling time the left want to be homeless

1278
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,760
they want their children brain damage they want to be dead everybody i know the one got the vaccine

01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:28,240
it's how i operate and so you got 2020 price parasitic would be better until tomorrow night

1293
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,600
and then it's gonna go to its regular price it's still a great deal and they've told me in the next

1294
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,360
two weeks or so they're gonna have to go up in price so you're not just gonna not get to sale

1295
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,200
it's gonna have to go to price because the whole thing's shutting down and the supply chains are

1296
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:44,560
breaking down and the pipelines are being turned off because we're under attack be afraid wow

1297
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:50,880
you see you see the transition generally from like scary narrative into ad but then you saw

1298
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,680
the reverse where it's the ad leads into terrorizing the audience of course that's uh

1299

1302
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,880
saying is that i am going to take you hostage with fear and then you will give me money yeah

1303
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:23,120
and that's why you should be afraid yep very very afraid very afraid i'm getting more storeable food

1306
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:39,040
as well just get ready and my parents have got a trailer out a little ranch i've got a solar and

1307
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,800
all the stuff that's gone in and i gotta get a little shack or something for me too because

1308
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:49,760
it's gonna be like road warrior if we don't turn this around and there's not much time left what's

1309
01:17:49,760 --> 01:18:00,160
the shack for so info war store.com it's a funky little shack um look i am sick and tired of

1310
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:06,400
schrodinger's bug out location i know right i'm so sick of it i don't care for this nonsense of i

1311
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,040
have a compound or maybe i should make one because the world's so dangerous and scary now yeah

1312
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,560
ugh it's a will they won't they that uh is infuriating yeah let's get together with rachel

1313
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,520
ross come on buddy also here's the thing that i want to bring attention to at the end of this

1314
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,240
episode alex is talking about how we need to be really scared you gotta buy that food yeah got

1315
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:32,240
a bug out location and all this course half an hour earlier he was laughing about how fulfilled

1316
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,640
he feels because the globalists aren't done for right thanks to this bombshell that he can't quite

1317
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:43,040
get himself to really cover it in any detail absolutely that is incongruent it's nonsense

1318
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:49,040
and the reason is because the emotional experience of defeating the globalists is something that he

1319
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,200
wants you to you know it's yeah it keeps people having fun yeah and then at the end you gotta

1320
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,960
scare people because that's how the money comes in yeah no one makes money off defeating the

1321
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:05,280
globalists yeah yeah it's terrorist edging yes so annoying yeah i would like some sort of

1322
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:13,920
man you just get caught up in that you know it just rewires your your ability to process if

1323
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:20,320
you're just so emotionally overstimulated all the time with no actual release it just drives you

1324
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:28,560
insane like it's it's insane it's it's borderline solitary confinement you know yeah it's awful

1325
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,680
yeah and i think i think that's the i don't know yeah i don't know what else to say but yeah it's

1326
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:38,720
a mess it's kind of weird how you can sell stuff because of that isn't that a weird uh aspect of

1327
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:45,040
our biology is that somehow all the way along the line evolution has led to people being like

1328
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:50,480
be afraid and buy my shit well i mean i think that's the american dream snake oil salesman

1329
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:55,600
and what have you there is a certain american aspect of the snake oil it's very americana

1330
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,800
the way alex is uh it kind of manipulating people in order to sell them bullshit yeah it's hard to

1331
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,000
it's hard not to think if we ever did eradicate these type of snake oil salesmen that we wouldn't

1332
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,720
also have like writers and and different people making nostalgic stories about when you the snake

1333
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,720
oil con man going from town to town you know just to be clear when you say eradicate you're talking

1334
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:22,000
about like regulate out of existence yes yeah yeah no no no no no this is not a this is not

1335
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,640
a cockroach system i mean like we don't have the snake oil salesman anymore it's some long

1336
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:31,280
distant point in the future right people will feel nostalgic for them yeah of course yeah of

1337
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:38,320
course because we're insane yep yep oh well yeah anyway um hey i look forward to going back to the

1338
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:44,800
past because i find myself incredibly frustrated by this asshole yeah and i don't want to hear

1339
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,440
about another goddamn bombshell that's disappointing i want to go back to the past

1340
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:56,800
when news was measured and uh sometimes guests were combative sure and uh everything was what

1341
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:03,760
it was yeah and uh not this overly dramatic nonsense uh every single day yeah it's just
