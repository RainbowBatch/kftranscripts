N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:18.080
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

00:18.080 --> 00:21.440
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.440 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:23.920 --> 00:25.120
knowledgefight

00:25.120 --> 00:28.960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys

00:28.960 --> 00:30.000
knowledgefight

00:30.000 --> 00:31.040
Dan and Jordan

00:31.040 --> 00:32.080
knowledgefight

00:34.480 --> 00:36.320
I need, I need money

00:39.280 --> 00:40.320
Andy and Kansas

00:42.160 --> 00:42.800
Stop it

00:42.800 --> 00:44.480
Andy and K-Andy and Kansas

00:46.080 --> 00:47.040
It's time to pray

00:47.040 --> 00:49.280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

00:49.280 --> 00:51.680
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:51.680 --> 00:52.960
I love your work

00:52.960 --> 00:53.760
knowledgefight

00:55.600 --> 00:56.800
knowledgefight.com

00:56.800 --> 00:59.280
I love you

00:59.280 --> 01:01.360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight

01:01.360 --> 01:03.200
I'm Dan, I'm Jordan

01:03.200 --> 01:07.920
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:07.920 --> 01:09.200
Oh indeed we are Dan

01:09.200 --> 01:14.000
This is the second time we've had to record the intro because something happened and it wasn't recording

01:14.000 --> 01:19.200
And in that we riffed about how I'm not a one take guy, now this is the second take of our intro

01:19.200 --> 01:21.920
So here we go, and it was better on the second go round

01:21.920 --> 01:24.640
I'm not sure it was, I think it was a little smoother on the first take

01:24.640 --> 01:29.680
You know, you were a little in your head on the second take because you were disappointed that the first take was so good

01:29.680 --> 01:32.320
And you wrote down in your notebook, not a one take

01:32.320 --> 01:34.560
Well, that's my fault, it was too good a joke

01:34.560 --> 01:35.680
It was

01:35.680 --> 01:36.480
It was too good

01:36.480 --> 01:37.840
I had to cut you off at the pass

01:37.840 --> 01:39.840
Yeah, well you know what my bright spot is

01:39.840 --> 01:40.480
Uh, this?

01:41.440 --> 01:42.160
You got it

01:42.160 --> 01:43.680
Dan, quick question

01:43.680 --> 01:44.160
What's up?

01:44.160 --> 01:45.120
What's your bright spot, buddy?

01:45.120 --> 01:51.200
My bright spot today, Jordan, is that I made a return visit to the much-legended

01:51.200 --> 01:52.160
Ballyhooed

01:52.160 --> 01:58.000
No, I don't know if anyone's Ballyhooed, but it is the stuff of legend the witch store here in Chicago

01:58.000 --> 01:58.480
Agreed

01:58.480 --> 02:03.840
Um, I went there, they have crystal balls and books and probably tarot cards and

02:03.840 --> 02:04.400
For sure

02:04.400 --> 02:08.080
Uh, sage that you can burn to like purify places and what have you

02:08.080 --> 02:10.400
But they also have a large selection of bath salts

02:10.400 --> 02:10.880
Uh huh

02:10.880 --> 02:12.160
And I have gotten

02:12.160 --> 02:13.920
Bath salts that grant wishes

02:13.920 --> 02:15.280
That is true, that is true

02:15.280 --> 02:15.760
Yes

02:15.760 --> 02:22.160
Um, I have a bag that has, uh, it promises psychic powers and I have not used it yet

02:22.160 --> 02:23.040
Because I'm afraid to

02:23.040 --> 02:24.480
Does it describe them?

02:24.480 --> 02:25.040
No

02:25.040 --> 02:26.000
It doesn't, what?

02:26.000 --> 02:26.640
No, no

02:26.640 --> 02:28.640
I need more, I need specifics

02:28.640 --> 02:31.760
If you're gonna give me psychic powers, that can backfire so easily

02:31.760 --> 02:33.040
That's why I haven't used them yet

02:33.040 --> 02:35.280
It's too risky

02:35.280 --> 02:36.080
Too much power

02:36.080 --> 02:36.640
Uh huh

02:36.640 --> 02:38.000
No one man should have all that power

02:38.000 --> 02:42.320
I've seen a number of these movies about telepathy that end up because it's such a,

02:42.320 --> 02:44.480
Such a nuisance hearing everyone's thoughts

02:44.480 --> 02:46.080
Yeah, totally, you think it's a good idea

02:46.080 --> 02:49.600
It's one of those classic monkey's paw type situations, you know

02:49.600 --> 02:53.760
Be careful what you wish for and I will never wish for psychic powers

02:53.760 --> 02:57.520
Yeah, so that's, that's on, uh, on my, near my bathtub

02:57.520 --> 02:59.600
As a, in case of emergency, break glass

02:59.600 --> 03:00.320
Right, right, right

03:00.320 --> 03:01.440
Get some psychic powers

03:02.320 --> 03:03.120
But yeah, for now

03:03.120 --> 03:08.320
They're at the gates, get the psychic bath salts, quick, get Dan in the bathtub now

03:08.320 --> 03:10.960
For now it's just tranquility and peace

03:10.960 --> 03:12.320
I like that, that's a good spell

03:12.320 --> 03:13.040
So how about you?

03:13.040 --> 03:15.760
Uh, for me, Dan, uh, the French Open

03:16.640 --> 03:19.200
Coming, coming up soon, coming up soon

03:19.200 --> 03:23.920
Rafa in a bunch of, uh, he's at the, uh, playing on clay right now

03:23.920 --> 03:31.680
Getting, uh, uh, uh, ready to go for his, uh, inevitable next French Open win

03:31.680 --> 03:35.120
And today he fought a really tough, uh, match with, uh, Shapovalov

03:35.120 --> 03:36.480
Who is also one of my favorite players

03:36.480 --> 03:36.800
Okay

03:36.800 --> 03:41.120
He's a Canadian kid, gangles, uh, in the present tense

03:41.120 --> 03:42.640
Like he's gangling at you

03:42.640 --> 03:42.960
Okay

03:42.960 --> 03:44.880
Uh, incredible tennis player, though

03:45.680 --> 03:48.320
Fantastic match, won it in the tie break

03:48.320 --> 03:51.040
Rafa, it's just great, it was a great morning

03:51.040 --> 03:51.360
Very exciting

03:51.360 --> 03:52.080
It was a great morning

03:52.080 --> 03:53.600
That was at three this morning, I bet?

03:53.600 --> 03:56.320
That was at, that was at six this morning, thank you very much

03:57.200 --> 03:59.040
Well, I'm glad you, glad you got to enjoy that

03:59.040 --> 03:59.680
Yes, I did

03:59.680 --> 04:03.280
So, Jordan, today we have, uh, well, I was gonna say it's interesting

04:03.280 --> 04:04.720
But we have an episode to go off on

04:06.240 --> 04:07.600
See, now that's what I want

04:07.600 --> 04:07.760
Yeah

04:07.760 --> 04:09.520
That's what I want from late night shows

04:09.520 --> 04:10.400
I've been, I've been broken

04:10.400 --> 04:14.080
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we've still got to do a show

04:14.080 --> 04:15.920
It's Thursday, I don't know what to tell you

04:15.920 --> 04:17.040
It's in the contract

04:17.040 --> 04:18.080
No, that's not fair

04:18.080 --> 04:19.760
It's, there's some fun stuff in here

04:19.760 --> 04:23.680
But there's, there's another thing that I'm just becoming endlessly, um,

04:25.760 --> 04:27.440
What's, what, ground down by

04:27.440 --> 04:27.920
Ah, yes

04:27.920 --> 04:28.400
I will say

04:28.400 --> 04:28.720
Yes

04:28.720 --> 04:30.640
So this is May 11th, 2021, Blackjack

04:30.640 --> 04:32.800
Blackjack, oh, I wasn't even close on that one

04:32.800 --> 04:33.200
No

04:33.200 --> 04:34.320
No, that was brutal

04:34.320 --> 04:39.360
So, the thing that I'm getting ground down by is that, um, thing that we've already talked

04:39.360 --> 04:41.760
about, that sort of dynamic, this show is incredibly one-note

04:41.760 --> 04:43.120
It's all anti-vax nonsense

04:43.120 --> 04:43.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah

04:43.760 --> 04:50.080
Um, and when Alex comes through with something exciting like one of these primary source

04:50.080 --> 04:54.320
documents that's, like, actually, oh, this is kind of an interesting thing to look into

04:54.320 --> 04:55.280
There's things we can learn here

04:55.280 --> 04:55.680
Sure

04:55.680 --> 04:57.200
Middle-aged mice come up

04:57.200 --> 04:57.600
Fantastic

04:57.600 --> 04:58.800
Spouse mouse

04:58.800 --> 05:00.240
What fun we can have there

05:00.240 --> 05:00.960
Totally

05:00.960 --> 05:05.280
Other times, Alex just, he's got nothing

05:05.280 --> 05:05.680
Sure

05:05.680 --> 05:08.800
And sometimes that nothing comes in the form of a bombshell

05:08.800 --> 05:12.560
And I'm sick and fucking tired of non-existent bombshells

05:13.840 --> 05:15.680
Have we heard anything about Polygon yet?

05:15.680 --> 05:16.160
No

05:16.160 --> 05:16.480
No

05:16.480 --> 05:22.240
I'm sick of the, like, the biggest news in the world being nothing and just, like, that,

05:23.440 --> 05:25.200
it burns out something in your brain

05:25.200 --> 05:25.440
Yeah

05:25.440 --> 05:28.960
You know, where you're just, like, hearing somebody be so fake excited about something

05:28.960 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

05:30.000 --> 05:32.640
Something, I don't know, I'm gonna be in the past for the next episode

05:32.640 --> 05:34.400
You're being gaslit

05:34.400 --> 05:37.520
You're being gaslit in a way that is exhausting

05:37.520 --> 05:41.200
You can only be gaslit so long before it starts to break your psyche

05:41.200 --> 05:44.000
At the same time, I have no expectation that I should be believing Alex

05:44.000 --> 05:44.240
Sure

05:44.240 --> 05:45.280
So that helps a little bit

05:45.280 --> 05:45.680
It does

05:45.680 --> 05:48.720
It makes it less painful, but the process is still there and it's frustrating

05:48.720 --> 05:53.520
You're not completely inculcated from that kind of result

05:53.520 --> 05:57.920
Yeah, and so today's bombshell was just, like, I'm out, I'm gonna be out for a while, so

05:57.920 --> 05:59.440
Today's bombshell

05:59.440 --> 05:59.920
Yeah

05:59.920 --> 06:00.560
Okay

06:00.560 --> 06:02.240
I'm selling this episode real well

06:03.440 --> 06:07.280
So, Jordan, before we get into this, though, let's take a little moment and say hello

06:07.280 --> 06:08.000
to some wonks

06:08.000 --> 06:08.880
Ooh, that's a great idea

06:08.880 --> 06:11.920
So, first, I can't wait to see LeVar Burton host Jeopardy in July

06:11.920 --> 06:13.440
You are now a policy wonk

06:13.440 --> 06:14.480
I'm a policy wonk

06:14.480 --> 06:16.880
Thank you very much, I agree with you on all fronts

06:16.880 --> 06:18.800
I bet LeVar Burton's a policy wonk, too

06:18.800 --> 06:19.680
That'd be nice

06:19.680 --> 06:24.240
Honkinatrix, practitioner of clown-like bondage, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

06:24.240 --> 06:25.200
I'm a policy wonk

06:25.200 --> 06:26.160
Thank you very much

06:26.160 --> 06:26.560
Thank you

06:26.560 --> 06:30.080
Next, The Foxiest Chicken, Emily, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

06:30.080 --> 06:31.120
I'm a policy wonk

06:31.120 --> 06:33.200
Thank you very much, The Foxiest Chicken, Emily

06:33.200 --> 06:33.600
Thank you

06:33.600 --> 06:36.720
Next, Frank Rizzo, Jerky, you are now a policy wonk

06:36.720 --> 06:37.680
I'm a policy wonk

06:37.680 --> 06:40.240
Thank you very much, Frank Rizzo, Jerky

06:40.240 --> 06:43.840
And, uh, I don't want to say this, oh well

06:43.840 --> 06:45.920
Don't whisper it into my ear and I'll say it

06:45.920 --> 06:46.560
I'm not going to do that

06:46.560 --> 06:46.880
Okay, fair enough

06:46.880 --> 06:48.640
I'll just bite the bullet on this

06:48.640 --> 06:52.640
The Return of Poop Feast 420, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

06:52.640 --> 06:54.080
I'm a policy wonk

06:54.080 --> 06:59.120
Thank you very much, I'm looking forward to the third installment, that's going to be my favorite

06:59.120 --> 07:01.200
Revenge of Poop Feast 420

07:01.200 --> 07:02.400
Yes, absolutely

07:02.400 --> 07:06.880
And then I'd like to say thank you to technocrat out there, David S.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.040
Thank you so much, you are now a technocrat

07:09.040 --> 07:10.240
I'm a policy wonk

07:10.240 --> 07:13.280
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

07:13.280 --> 07:14.720
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:14.720 --> 07:17.520
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.800
Let's just get down to business

07:18.800 --> 07:20.880
We ain't making that money off that heroin

07:20.880 --> 07:22.160
Why you pimps so good?

07:22.880 --> 07:24.560
My neck is freakishly large

07:24.560 --> 07:27.040
I declare info war on you

07:27.040 --> 07:27.840
Thank you, David

07:27.840 --> 07:29.360
Yes, thank you very much, David

07:29.360 --> 07:32.080
Also, I don't know how to do this exactly sometimes, you know, like

07:32.080 --> 07:32.400
Yeah

07:32.400 --> 07:33.680
Well wishes for birthdays

07:33.680 --> 07:34.480
Sure, sure, sure

07:34.480 --> 07:36.400
Sometimes it's kind of difficult for me because

07:36.400 --> 07:38.640
You do it at the bottom of a well, naturally

07:38.640 --> 07:40.560
That's where I throw my pennies

07:40.560 --> 07:44.000
For everyone's birthday, I should say, everybody who we wish a happy birthday to,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.520
I do throw a penny into a well

07:45.520 --> 07:46.720
That's really nice of you

07:46.720 --> 07:47.440
That's nice of you

07:47.440 --> 07:50.960
I should do that, I just, you know, I don't walk by enough wells

07:50.960 --> 07:52.480
Yeah, there's so many in my neighborhood

07:52.480 --> 07:53.200
I know, it's true

07:54.400 --> 07:58.000
I'm not always sure whenever someone's birthday is on the weekend

07:58.000 --> 08:01.520
Whether we should do this on the Friday show or on the Monday show, what do you do?

08:01.520 --> 08:02.080
That's fair

08:02.080 --> 08:05.280
Do you do it after the fact or do you wish them a happy birthday a couple days early?

08:05.280 --> 08:07.520
It's like Saint Patrick's Day, when do you celebrate it?

08:07.520 --> 08:08.480
When is it observed?

08:08.480 --> 08:09.840
When is it, yeah

08:09.840 --> 08:14.640
I never quite know, but I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead of the game on this one

08:14.640 --> 08:18.560
On the 16th, this weekend coming up, Cameron's got a 30th birthday

08:18.560 --> 08:20.240
And Nicole would like to wish him a happy birthday

08:20.240 --> 08:21.920
Well congratulations, Cameron

08:21.920 --> 08:23.840
Yep, happy birthday, hope you have a great one

08:24.960 --> 08:28.720
And hope doing this in advance was better than like if you'd heard this on Monday

08:28.720 --> 08:33.040
I've been like, wow, that would have made my birthday a lot better if I'd fucking heard it earlier

08:33.040 --> 08:36.480
Yeah, but what if this is so important to him that now

08:36.480 --> 08:39.760
the rest of his actual birthday is just gonna be a huge letdown

08:39.760 --> 08:41.760
Everybody's gonna be like, happy birthday

08:41.760 --> 08:47.520
And he's gonna be like, my birthday was when the Knowledge Fight guys said happy birthday for way too long

08:47.520 --> 08:49.040
This is the risk we take

08:50.400 --> 08:54.720
So Jordan, there's one bit of news that's been going around that I want to address

08:54.720 --> 08:58.160
Doesn't come up on this episode, but it is something that happened

08:58.160 --> 09:01.760
at the beginning of this week, and that is that Alex is back in the gold game, my man

09:02.320 --> 09:04.560
InfoWarsGold.com

09:04.560 --> 09:06.240
Alright, it's about time

09:06.240 --> 09:09.680
Yeah, I've been seeing indications that he was getting ready to start this back up again

09:09.680 --> 09:12.000
But I wasn't sure if he was ever gonna take the plunge

09:12.000 --> 09:15.840
And then a large portion of the show on Monday was an interview with his new gold sponsor

09:15.840 --> 09:19.200
A guy named Drew Mason from St. Joseph Partners

09:19.200 --> 09:22.640
A precious metals outfit out of Pauley, Pennsylvania

09:23.600 --> 09:25.760
I didn't know too much about this guy or his business

09:25.760 --> 09:29.520
outside of the fact that he decided to get into business with Alex Jones in 2021

09:29.520 --> 09:33.120
So I can't say much about what's going on with him, but I know he's not cool

09:33.120 --> 09:36.080
I cannot give this gold away

09:36.080 --> 09:39.040
I'm gonna have to partner with Alex Jones

09:39.040 --> 09:40.480
So I did find it interesting

09:40.480 --> 09:41.760
I was looking into it a little bit

09:41.760 --> 09:46.560
And there's no physical address for St. Joseph's Partner available on their website

09:48.560 --> 09:52.480
That struck me as a little bit curious

09:52.480 --> 09:56.560
It's just an asshole with a chest buried in his backyard

09:56.560 --> 09:58.960
Well, the contact information is literally just an email address

09:58.960 --> 09:59.760
Yeah, exactly

09:59.760 --> 10:01.920
It's an asshole with a chest buried in his backyard

10:01.920 --> 10:03.440
But here's where things get weird

10:03.440 --> 10:03.920
Okay

10:03.920 --> 10:06.080
So if you click on their contact us page

10:06.080 --> 10:08.320
An image of a Google map pops up

10:08.320 --> 10:13.680
With a marker at the address 8 The Green Dover, Delaware 19901

10:14.320 --> 10:14.960
However

10:14.960 --> 10:16.000
That's a tax shelter

10:16.000 --> 10:17.840
Delaware is a tax shelter state

10:18.400 --> 10:21.760
If you Google St. Joseph Partners, you get a different address

10:21.760 --> 10:25.920
1776 Lancaster Avenue, Powley, Pennsylvania

10:25.920 --> 10:30.080
This is the address for Powley Plaza, which is a strip mall of shops

10:30.960 --> 10:36.720
It doesn't look like there's a real, like, brick and mortar location for this gold out there

10:36.720 --> 10:37.840
Sure, sure, sure

10:37.840 --> 10:40.160
There is a Reed as Italian ice

10:40.160 --> 10:45.040
I think they specifically may have chosen 1776 as a...

10:45.680 --> 10:46.480
No, I don't think so

10:46.480 --> 10:47.440
I think it's a coincidence

10:47.440 --> 10:48.240
Oh, okay

10:48.240 --> 10:51.840
Powley is a city with a population of, like, just over 3,500

10:51.840 --> 10:54.000
So why would they have a shop there?

10:54.000 --> 10:54.880
It's ridiculous

10:54.880 --> 10:55.120
Right

10:56.240 --> 10:58.000
It's a UPS drop box

10:58.000 --> 10:59.120
That's what it is

10:59.120 --> 11:00.080
Yeah, of course it is

11:00.080 --> 11:00.720
Yeah

11:00.720 --> 11:07.040
So as you astutely already realized, Delaware is a tax haven type of state

11:07.040 --> 11:07.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah

11:07.840 --> 11:08.880
And 8 The Green

11:08.880 --> 11:09.840
Thanks, Biden

11:09.840 --> 11:13.120
8 The Green in Dover is a pretty notorious address

11:13.120 --> 11:17.920
It's the location that's used by a company known as a registered agent incorporated

11:17.920 --> 11:20.400
which allows people to incorporate their business in Delaware

11:20.400 --> 11:20.640
Right

11:20.640 --> 11:22.240
Which a lot of folks do to avoid

11:22.240 --> 11:23.040
Avoid taxes

11:23.040 --> 11:25.520
But it's actually not that...

11:25.520 --> 11:27.040
It's not all about taxes

11:27.760 --> 11:32.400
So LegalZoom has a breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating in Delaware

11:32.400 --> 11:36.160
And one of the perks is when you file in Delaware, you don't need to disclose your

11:36.160 --> 11:39.760
directors' and officers' names to the state, which allows you anonymity

11:39.760 --> 11:42.800
Oh, that's way better than not paying taxes

11:42.800 --> 11:45.360
I bet people would pay extra taxes for that option

11:45.360 --> 11:49.680
This became an issue a few years back, as was covered in the Delaware News Journal when

11:49.680 --> 11:54.960
the SEC was trying to investigate whether a number of Delaware-based LLCs had engaged in fraud

11:54.960 --> 12:00.240
235 companies were at issue, 24 of them were based in Colorado, while the rest were in Delaware

12:00.240 --> 12:04.240
And most of the businesses in Delaware were run through a registered agent incorporated

12:04.240 --> 12:05.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah

12:05.120 --> 12:09.440
Anyway, none of this proves anything that's explicit wrongdoing, but it's a bit sketchy

12:10.000 --> 12:13.600
I would say that the only way Alex could come up with a gold dealer I'd be less inclined

12:13.600 --> 12:17.920
to do business with than Ted Anderson is if it was a guy who had no apparent physical

12:17.920 --> 12:22.720
address whose site appears to be explicitly saying that he got a phony incorporation in Delaware

12:22.720 --> 12:23.360
Yeah

12:23.360 --> 12:26.560
I would steer clear of this, and if anybody out there is actually interested in investing

12:26.560 --> 12:30.320
in precious metals, I have to assume that there is a safer and better option

12:30.320 --> 12:35.280
So many other options that aren't just a weird dude with a UPS dropbox

12:35.280 --> 12:36.480
Yeah, it's...

12:36.480 --> 12:38.480
There's at least three other options

12:38.480 --> 12:44.000
There's renting a boat and going under the water for sunken treasure

12:44.000 --> 12:45.920
That's a way better option

12:45.920 --> 12:46.420
Yeah

12:46.880 --> 12:54.880
Then of course there is globetrotting and stealing ancient artifacts from Egypt and the like

12:54.880 --> 12:55.200
Sure

12:55.200 --> 12:56.400
That's always a good option

12:57.360 --> 12:59.520
And then I guess the securities market?

13:00.160 --> 13:00.720
Alchemy

13:00.720 --> 13:01.360
Oh, alchemy

13:01.360 --> 13:01.840
You forgot alchemy

13:01.840 --> 13:02.640
Shit, I forgot four

13:02.640 --> 13:03.200
Yeah

13:03.200 --> 13:03.600
Yep

13:03.600 --> 13:04.160
You're right

13:04.160 --> 13:05.440
There's always four ways to learn

13:05.440 --> 13:06.080
You got it

13:06.080 --> 13:09.680
So yeah, I don't know, I'm not too excited about this endeavor

13:09.680 --> 13:11.280
I think it looks really sketchy as hell

13:11.280 --> 13:16.720
And it's just another instance of Alex having like landing pages with other people's shit

13:16.720 --> 13:17.040
Right

13:17.040 --> 13:19.680
Because it's like, okay, so yeah, infowarsgold.com

13:19.680 --> 13:24.160
But that just takes you to St. Joseph Partners slash Infowars

13:24.160 --> 13:25.040
It's just taking a cut

13:25.040 --> 13:26.160
It's just an affiliate tracking league

13:26.160 --> 13:26.800
Yeah, basically

13:26.800 --> 13:27.520
Yeah

13:27.520 --> 13:31.600
So we get to May 11th here, starting it off, Tuesday's show

13:31.600 --> 13:32.000
Okay

13:32.000 --> 13:34.160
Alex has big news

13:34.160 --> 13:35.040
Does he?

13:35.040 --> 13:39.360
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, May 11th, the year is 2021

13:40.240 --> 13:44.720
And this is undoubtedly the most important news we've ever broken today

13:45.760 --> 13:49.360
I stayed up here late last night but got too exhausted to finish the report

13:49.360 --> 13:52.400
It'll be done in a few hours and I was so pleasantly surprised

13:52.400 --> 13:55.600
when I got home and turned on Tucker Carlson to have dinner with my family

13:56.160 --> 13:57.040
that he stumped us

13:57.040 --> 13:57.520
Gross

13:57.520 --> 14:00.240
Yeah, I know, that was an upsetting image

14:00.240 --> 14:02.560
Gross, gross

14:02.560 --> 14:06.720
But even past that, I love the idea that it's like, I have the biggest news of my career

14:06.720 --> 14:08.160
and I got sleepy last night

14:08.160 --> 14:10.240
I was just too tired

14:10.240 --> 14:11.200
I was just too tired

14:11.760 --> 14:17.920
Honestly, you know, around 11 o'clock the Xanax kicks in and I'm just out

14:17.920 --> 14:20.880
I'm in a life and death battle with the devil

14:20.880 --> 14:21.920
Sure, sure

14:21.920 --> 14:26.560
And I have the silver bullet that will defeat the devil

14:26.560 --> 14:26.800
Right

14:28.880 --> 14:31.680
Yeah, I mean, I think that's one of the devil's big advantages

14:31.680 --> 14:33.040
He never seems to get tired

14:33.040 --> 14:34.960
He casts sleepy spells on people

14:34.960 --> 14:37.040
Well, that's nice, that's nice

14:37.040 --> 14:38.800
So I was curious about this big news

14:39.520 --> 14:43.280
and actually I decided that this would be the day that I've covered

14:43.280 --> 14:45.360
because he's got the biggest news ever

14:45.360 --> 14:45.760
Of course

14:45.760 --> 14:48.560
We already had the biggest news ever like twice this week

14:48.560 --> 14:49.040
Right

14:49.040 --> 14:51.280
And so I was like, wow, I mean, this has got to be big

14:51.920 --> 14:56.160
Here's the headline, Tucker Carlson, Anthony Fauci let the coronavirus pandemic happen

14:56.160 --> 14:57.360
Well, they did it on purpose

14:57.360 --> 14:59.120
Why isn't there a criminal investigation?

14:59.120 --> 15:04.560
Well, we have the smoking gun where the director for Bill Gates and for Fauci

15:05.280 --> 15:09.920
admitted to creating the five in one super virus on video

15:09.920 --> 15:14.960
So the video that Alex is referring to is an episode of a podcast called This Week in Virology

15:14.960 --> 15:17.760
produced by the American Society for Microbiology

15:17.760 --> 15:18.240
Sure

15:18.240 --> 15:22.560
The guest is Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance

15:22.560 --> 15:24.880
Alex claims that he's a director for Bill Gates

15:24.880 --> 15:29.600
but this clip that's from the actual interview seems a little bit at odds with that

15:29.600 --> 15:32.960
Do you have support from say Gates Foundation?

15:32.960 --> 15:34.960
No, we don't, we never got Gates money

15:34.960 --> 15:40.880
I think that Gates, Gates have a strategy of specifically targeting things

15:40.880 --> 15:44.000
that they consider neglected, diseases that were neglected

15:44.000 --> 15:47.440
We're working on what they consider not neglected diseases

15:47.440 --> 15:49.040
So I guess he got no funding from Gates

15:49.040 --> 15:50.080
Yeah, that would make sense

15:50.080 --> 15:55.120
Anyway, big mess up there on the giant news of the day right out of the gate

15:55.120 --> 15:56.880
Yeah, that's not a good start

15:56.880 --> 16:00.880
So this is a really interesting interview that Peter Daszak had

16:00.880 --> 16:02.880
but it's being completely misused by Alex

16:02.880 --> 16:06.400
to paint the picture of a guy confessing to created SARS-CoV-2

16:06.400 --> 16:10.400
In reality, the EcoHealth Alliance is a nonprofit that works on global health issues

16:10.400 --> 16:13.440
from the perspective of what Peter calls One Health

16:13.440 --> 16:16.160
This is a philosophy that every condition has a human component,

16:16.160 --> 16:18.960
an animal component, and an environmental component

16:18.960 --> 16:22.080
Trying to approach any condition without considering the intersection of these three

16:22.080 --> 16:25.360
is not going to be as full of a strategy as taking the full picture into mind

16:25.360 --> 16:25.920
Right

16:25.920 --> 16:29.040
The EcoHealth Alliance grew out of a conservation organization

16:29.040 --> 16:31.760
and part of their ethos is a belief that you can make pragmatic

16:31.760 --> 16:35.440
and economically sound arguments for ecological conservation

16:35.440 --> 16:39.840
For instance, in the interview, Peter brings up the unexamined health costs of deforestation

16:39.840 --> 16:43.040
that massively outweigh the profits that are made from the practice

16:43.040 --> 16:43.600
Right

16:43.600 --> 16:46.240
If it can be made clear to everyone, the decision makers,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.960
that not only is destruction of nature bad,

16:48.960 --> 16:51.760
but it's also not even in the best interests of profit,

16:51.760 --> 16:55.040
these people believe that they can make headway towards conservation action

16:55.040 --> 16:55.600
Right

16:55.600 --> 16:59.120
I watched the whole 35-minute interview and essentially what it comes down to

16:59.120 --> 17:03.120
is that Peter discusses working with labs in many countries, including China,

17:03.120 --> 17:05.280
where they do surveillance of animal populations

17:05.280 --> 17:08.400
to try to identify any diseases that could become a problem for humans

17:08.400 --> 17:09.040
Sure

17:09.040 --> 17:11.360
One of the concerns he brings up is coronaviruses

17:11.360 --> 17:15.440
and he discusses how you can manipulate coronaviruses in a lab pretty easily

17:15.440 --> 17:17.440
Alex is taking that statement to be a confession

17:17.440 --> 17:19.360
that Peter combined a bunch of viruses together

17:19.360 --> 17:22.080
and then unleashed them as SARS coronavirus 2

17:22.080 --> 17:24.160
But the reality is really different

17:24.160 --> 17:26.560
It's really just about crafting lab tests that assess

17:26.560 --> 17:29.520
whether or not newly discovered viruses can even infect humans

17:29.520 --> 17:30.160
Yeah

17:30.160 --> 17:33.680
If I were Peter Daschik, I would immediately sue Alex Jones

17:33.680 --> 17:34.160
Totally

17:34.160 --> 17:36.880
There's a video with a picture of him with the title, quote,

17:36.880 --> 17:41.440
Smoking gun video Fauci project manager confesses to creating COVID-19

17:41.440 --> 17:42.400
That's a definitive claim

17:42.400 --> 17:43.520
That is definitive

17:43.520 --> 17:44.640
That Alex is reporting

17:44.640 --> 17:45.600
Defamatory

17:45.600 --> 17:46.880
It's outrageous

17:47.680 --> 17:54.400
And I can't imagine, like, how unsafe this is to do to somebody

17:54.400 --> 17:54.800
Yeah, no, no

17:54.800 --> 17:59.200
And I don't know, like, exactly what the line is for, like, public figure

17:59.200 --> 18:03.680
But I'm not sure that I would put the president of eco-health non-profit

18:03.680 --> 18:06.880
as a public figure in the same way that, like, a celebrity or someone

18:07.600 --> 18:09.520
At the same time, I guess an argument could be made

18:09.520 --> 18:13.520
that he's become somebody who goes around on some news programs

18:13.520 --> 18:15.360
talking about COVID

18:15.360 --> 18:17.440
Because of assholes like Alex

18:17.440 --> 18:21.600
Alex forced him into becoming a public figure by giving him the attention

18:21.600 --> 18:23.680
that he should never have had in the first place

18:23.680 --> 18:27.280
if anybody responsibly treated this fucking pandemic

18:27.280 --> 18:31.920
No, I think even without some of that, he would have been seen as somebody

18:31.920 --> 18:38.240
who would be gone to for interviews on, like, in the early days of the outbreak

18:38.240 --> 18:38.640
Sure

18:38.640 --> 18:41.440
I think he still would have made some media rounds

18:41.440 --> 18:44.320
But again, what I'm saying is I'm not sure exactly where that line is

18:44.320 --> 18:44.800
Yeah

18:44.800 --> 18:48.320
I'm not sure what side he's on, but I would be, I would be

18:48.320 --> 18:50.080
Let's find out, I would like to find out

18:50.880 --> 18:53.360
I would like to fuck around and find out, quite literally

18:53.360 --> 18:55.360
I think it would be worth discovering

18:55.360 --> 18:58.080
because you can't just do this to people

18:58.080 --> 18:59.040
It's outrageous

18:59.040 --> 19:04.400
No, I saw a little bit of that Tucker thing and I just began spitting

19:04.400 --> 19:12.400
Like, the idea of him doing that after being the cause of us all being locked down

19:12.400 --> 19:14.000
for a fucking year

19:14.800 --> 19:17.120
That's grounds for immediate slapping

19:17.120 --> 19:19.680
If you see him, you get to slap Tucker Carlson in the face

19:19.680 --> 19:26.160
The Tucker piece was largely based on that article that Nicholas Wade wrote

19:26.160 --> 19:30.080
And even that doesn't claim to have a conclusion

19:30.080 --> 19:35.200
The second or third paragraph of it is, I have no direct evidence for either theory

19:35.200 --> 19:35.440
Yeah

19:35.440 --> 19:37.920
Whether it's a lab origin or natural origin

19:37.920 --> 19:38.160
Yeah

19:39.040 --> 19:45.200
And it's being used by people like Tucker to push the, it must have been made in a lab

19:45.200 --> 19:45.440
Yeah

19:46.000 --> 19:50.640
Now, Alex's version is far more irresponsible than what Tucker's doing

19:50.640 --> 19:51.760
Oh, totally, totally

19:51.760 --> 19:53.520
Which is, which is normal, but

19:54.800 --> 19:56.640
Anyway, Alex got scooped by Tucker

19:57.200 --> 19:58.960
Now, I told you at the end of the war yesterday

19:58.960 --> 20:01.520
that the biggest news yet was coming out, but I would break it today

20:02.160 --> 20:08.400
Tucker Carlson broke it last night and he gave you about 80% of it

20:09.280 --> 20:12.560
But the clip he didn't play, and we're going to get to that after we play the Tucker Carlson

20:12.560 --> 20:17.520
Report, a part of it, is that the director of the program under Fauci and Gates

20:17.520 --> 20:20.880
On record funded by them, four million bucks for just six programs

20:20.880 --> 20:22.640
They funded some others as well at the Wuhan lab

20:23.760 --> 20:27.440
Gave an interview and admitted they were splicing five viruses together

20:27.440 --> 20:30.480
As a bio weapon to then produce a, quote, vaccine for it

20:31.520 --> 20:34.000
And that they got emergency authorization to do it

20:35.040 --> 20:38.320
This is game over for these people, ladies and gentlemen

20:38.320 --> 20:40.080
If the public ever grasped this

20:40.080 --> 20:41.280
It's game over

20:41.280 --> 20:41.920
It's game over

20:41.920 --> 20:42.320
Yep

20:42.960 --> 20:43.360
Sure

20:43.360 --> 20:45.040
A lot of stuff being made up in that clip

20:45.040 --> 20:45.600
Yikes

20:45.600 --> 20:51.360
So Alex plays Tucker clips for most, like a lot of the first hour

20:51.360 --> 20:53.040
That's, that's a good job

20:53.040 --> 20:57.360
And I don't make a big enough deal out of this, but like he plays a lot of the first hour

20:57.360 --> 20:58.880
A lot of Tucker Carlson clips

20:58.880 --> 20:59.760
That's great

20:59.760 --> 21:03.120
It's a lot of, like in place of special reports sometimes

21:03.120 --> 21:04.560
You'll just have a Tucker segment

21:04.560 --> 21:05.360
That's awesome

21:05.920 --> 21:06.720
I love it

21:06.720 --> 21:12.560
I love not having to do my job, and that is a perfect encapsulation of

21:12.560 --> 21:16.400
I will just let a famous person fill in time

21:16.400 --> 21:16.960
That's great

21:16.960 --> 21:19.600
And it'll deeply associate myself with him

21:19.600 --> 21:20.080
Totally

21:20.640 --> 21:21.360
Yeah, it's

21:21.360 --> 21:23.120
Brilliant, brilliant marketing strategy

21:23.120 --> 21:25.120
Anyway, I found this to be a little funny

21:25.120 --> 21:27.600
Here's Tucker Carlson and we'll come back with the rest of the story

21:28.560 --> 21:30.960
You're never taking off the mask

21:30.960 --> 21:35.280
Get ready for a lifetime of filthy wet cotton covering your mouth

21:35.280 --> 21:37.440
Reduced oxygen flow to your brain

21:37.440 --> 21:41.600
And a world where every stranger looks the same because no one has a face

21:42.640 --> 21:46.400
When Kamala Harris and her husband kissed the other day while wearing masks

21:46.400 --> 21:49.040
They were giving you a preview of your daughter's wedding

21:49.680 --> 21:52.560
In a masked world, human beings never really touch each other

21:52.560 --> 21:59.040
You whiny fucking babies, you whiny babies

21:59.040 --> 22:04.240
I don't watch Tucker Carlson that much, so I don't know if this is like indicative of his style

22:04.240 --> 22:07.920
That is, whoa, holy shit

22:08.480 --> 22:14.400
He's got some very dramatic writers employed on that staff

22:14.400 --> 22:17.440
That is your daughter's wedding

22:17.440 --> 22:22.240
You're gonna watch your daughter and her husband kiss with masks on

22:22.240 --> 22:29.200
Okay, instead of sign language, there should just be a picture-in-picture of a guy making the jerk-off motion

22:29.200 --> 22:31.120
Just like, listen to this fucking asshole

22:31.120 --> 22:31.760
What a dick

22:31.760 --> 22:32.400
Ugh

22:32.400 --> 22:38.800
And I mean like, what was it, just like the next day the CDC released guidance that if you're vaccinated you don't have to wear masks

22:38.800 --> 22:41.040
No, that's, it should be criminal

22:41.040 --> 22:43.200
It should be criminal to be Tucker Carlson

22:43.200 --> 22:44.160
It should be criminal

22:44.160 --> 22:48.560
You can slap, if you see him in the streets, you slap him in the face

22:48.560 --> 22:49.920
This is a dangerous precedent to set

22:49.920 --> 22:50.880
You're right, you're right

22:50.880 --> 22:51.760
Gotta walk that back

22:51.760 --> 22:55.840
Okay, there's only, then we will only set this precedent for one person

22:55.840 --> 23:00.640
I'm not sure I can sign off on that, but the point is, you're never gonna be taking the mask off

23:00.640 --> 23:02.320
Smashcock, two hours later

23:02.320 --> 23:04.640
The next day, Jesus Christ

23:05.280 --> 23:06.160
Great, cool

23:07.360 --> 23:08.960
Anyway, Alex has the biggest news ever

23:09.600 --> 23:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host

23:12.000 --> 23:15.920
We're breaking the biggest news we have ever brought out on air

23:15.920 --> 23:17.680
It is incredible what's happening

23:17.680 --> 23:24.080
The lab manager for the COVID-19 gain-of-function research being done at Chapel Hill

23:24.080 --> 23:32.160
had it moved with the scientists at Wuhan and then admits on video to merging five viruses together

23:35.840 --> 23:39.280
to be able to then deploy them

23:39.280 --> 23:44.080
See, I was listening to this and it didn't match with the interview that I had watched

23:44.080 --> 23:44.640
Yeah

23:44.640 --> 23:47.680
It didn't seem at all accurate

23:47.680 --> 23:50.720
He's on video saying five different viruses were combined

23:52.720 --> 23:53.680
Play that clip

23:53.680 --> 23:57.520
What a bombshell, he confesses to it

23:57.520 --> 23:59.680
So I was really confused

23:59.680 --> 24:02.320
Like I said, it didn't seem like it was what I had watched

24:02.320 --> 24:05.120
So I went and I watched Alex's special report about this

24:05.120 --> 24:06.800
I was trying to figure out what was going on

24:06.800 --> 24:07.360
Right, right, right

24:07.360 --> 24:08.960
And that helped make it a little clear

24:08.960 --> 24:13.040
Daschick was talking about how some of the coronaviruses they discovered didn't have

24:13.040 --> 24:18.640
known treatments, and the interviewer, the person giving the interview, asks a follow-up

24:18.640 --> 24:19.680
question about that

24:19.680 --> 24:24.080
Daschick then discusses how if you're going to create a vaccine for something like SARS

24:24.080 --> 24:28.000
because so much of it involves the spike protein, you probably want to create a vaccine that

24:28.000 --> 24:30.240
was effective against multiple coronaviruses

24:30.240 --> 24:30.960
Sure

24:30.960 --> 24:35.200
He was just discussing it in terms of like that is that seems like something people would

24:35.200 --> 24:36.800
do if they were going to go that route

24:36.800 --> 24:37.600
Have you ever

24:37.600 --> 24:41.520
That is not at all as him saying, I've used viruses

24:41.520 --> 24:43.520
I've fused viruses together

24:43.520 --> 24:49.280
Alex might as well just scream like, we kill one bird, one stone, no more!

24:49.280 --> 24:54.720
He's like, Alex is pretending this guy's like, I stitched together viruses with a needle and thread

24:54.720 --> 24:56.160
Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah

24:56.160 --> 25:01.120
He's got some magical sci-fi technology where it's spinning around with, yeah, it's stupid

25:01.120 --> 25:08.640
Now, it should be incredibly clear and very strongly pointed to that Alex is talking about

25:08.640 --> 25:14.720
this with the premeditated intention of hurting people, with the idea of shutting down the

25:14.720 --> 25:19.600
economy, the idea of killing people in the developing world, and he's saying that this

25:19.600 --> 25:27.680
guy is admitting to doing that by way of creating the virus SARS-CoV-2

25:27.680 --> 25:28.480
Yes

25:28.480 --> 25:30.240
And I think he should be sued for that

25:30.240 --> 25:36.880
Yeah, he did just call the man responsible for what would essentially be mass scale murder

25:36.880 --> 25:41.520
So I would hope that that would be in some way defamatory

25:41.520 --> 25:44.960
It feels like it's real playing with fire

25:44.960 --> 25:47.360
Especially considering everything we know about Alex's audience

25:47.360 --> 25:47.600
Yeah

25:48.240 --> 25:51.680
Anyway, I was like, wow, okay, this is not a bombshell

25:51.680 --> 25:54.240
But it feels like Alex is going to talk about this quite a bit

25:54.240 --> 25:54.720
A lot

25:54.720 --> 25:56.800
Uh, then he said this and I was like, what?

25:57.520 --> 26:02.480
Now, I have Alfie Oakes on about the pipeline shutdown, the food shortages

26:02.480 --> 26:06.000
He's one of the biggest producers of food in Florida, if not the biggest

26:06.000 --> 26:07.440
He doesn't just own grocery stores

26:08.800 --> 26:10.480
His real business is growing food

26:11.280 --> 26:15.040
And I wanted to get his expert take on the inflation we're seeing and where that's going

26:15.040 --> 26:19.600
So Alfie Oakes is the guy who owns that grocery store that Alex went to in Florida for a week

26:19.600 --> 26:20.560
a while back

26:20.560 --> 26:23.120
Is he a former oil pipeline expert?

26:23.120 --> 26:23.760
I don't care

26:23.760 --> 26:26.160
No, he's not, but I don't care what he has to say either

26:26.160 --> 26:30.480
However, it should be noted that he's only relevant in any way because he's made a big

26:30.480 --> 26:33.520
deal out of how no one has to wear masks in his grocery store

26:33.520 --> 26:38.080
In a completely unrelated story, I would like to inform you that Ted Nugent tested positive

26:38.080 --> 26:43.040
for COVID just one week after doing an in-store appearance at Oakes grocery store seed to table

26:43.920 --> 26:48.720
Prior to this, Oakes had appeared on Ted Nugent's YouTube show called The Spirit Campfire

26:48.720 --> 26:52.320
and said, quote, no one is getting infected here, no one's dying

26:52.320 --> 26:54.960
I want to get the truth out, it's a fraud, it's a sham

26:54.960 --> 26:56.000
And people have to wake up

26:56.560 --> 26:57.680
Anyway, fuck these people

26:57.680 --> 26:58.480
Oh my god

26:58.480 --> 27:04.880
God, I'm starting to think that believing that witches are responsible for your problems

27:04.880 --> 27:07.120
is a recipe for getting COVID

27:08.000 --> 27:13.520
So Alex has this idea that no one else is posting this Tucker Carlson segment

27:14.160 --> 27:17.760
and so he's going to put it up on his website, but just because no one else is posting it

27:17.760 --> 27:20.400
not because he's trying to poach content or anything

27:21.120 --> 27:24.160
We're going to have the whole thing posted to the Band.video

27:24.160 --> 27:25.840
so in case they try to take it down

27:25.840 --> 27:30.240
and the full Tucker Carlson 14-minute dialogue has also been posted

27:30.240 --> 27:33.040
because Fox isn't posting that on YouTube

27:33.040 --> 27:36.160
They always post this full show, they always post clips, they're not doing it

27:36.160 --> 27:39.200
So in the interest of public interest, I'm posting it to Band.video

27:40.720 --> 27:43.120
for commentary and analysis and historic reference

27:44.320 --> 27:45.600
Historic reference

27:45.600 --> 27:46.800
That's a free copyright

27:47.520 --> 27:50.080
I'm not canceling Alfie Oakes, I already did it yesterday

27:50.080 --> 27:53.200
and I'm not canceling Ted Nugent, they're here and it all ties together

27:53.200 --> 27:56.160
but after they're gone in an hour and five minutes from now

27:57.200 --> 27:59.520
I am going to, you see this stack right here?

28:00.160 --> 28:05.280
This is all the documents he's talking about and the videos of total open and shut case

28:05.280 --> 28:07.360
There isn't a grand jury in America

28:07.360 --> 28:11.600
If I had a day to show them this and the clips would not indict Fauci

28:11.600 --> 28:14.000
and indict Peter Daszak and all these people

28:14.000 --> 28:18.640
That'd be really funny to see Alex trying to prosecute a grand jury

28:18.640 --> 28:22.320
Yeah, you know this, Alex doesn't have his heart in this

28:22.320 --> 28:23.840
It doesn't feel like it

28:23.840 --> 28:25.760
I think he didn't actually read the story

28:26.400 --> 28:32.800
because I get a sense at a lot of points that he doesn't really have a handle on the details

28:32.800 --> 28:36.080
of things and he can't really weaponize the story correctly

28:36.080 --> 28:37.840
He's treading water a whole lot

28:37.840 --> 28:40.320
and that's one of the things that I find incredibly frustrating

28:40.320 --> 28:45.120
Like this video, this podcast interview was months old

28:45.120 --> 28:46.240
It's maybe a year old

28:46.240 --> 28:46.800
Of course

28:46.800 --> 28:50.480
I think it was from March 2020, I believe

28:50.480 --> 28:52.880
and if you go and look at it on YouTube months back

28:52.880 --> 28:56.480
people are commenting on it like, oh my God, the smoking gun

28:56.480 --> 29:00.160
of, you know, so it's something that's been in that space for a while

29:00.160 --> 29:02.080
Alex has no rush to report this

29:02.080 --> 29:04.640
It's just that Tucker brought it up the night before

29:04.640 --> 29:09.040
So Alex needs to make a bombshell out of it without actually knowing the story at all

29:09.040 --> 29:12.320
And so he just kind of rushes to air and it's stupid

29:12.320 --> 29:17.120
I just, I find myself just incredibly uninspired

29:17.120 --> 29:21.840
And at the same time, I think it's incredibly funny that Ted Nugent probably got COVID

29:21.840 --> 29:23.760
by going to this guy's grocery store

29:23.760 --> 29:26.480
and they're both guests on the show today

29:26.480 --> 29:26.880
Yeah

29:26.880 --> 29:27.920
That's weird

29:27.920 --> 29:31.520
Yeah, that's, I don't even know how to deal with that

29:31.520 --> 29:34.880
Honestly, in like a real universe where you believe in reality

29:34.880 --> 29:37.280
like where you accept reality as a thing

29:37.920 --> 29:42.880
I can't be in the headspace of somebody who thinks any of what happened is okay

29:42.880 --> 29:45.200
It's funny, but it's not great

29:45.200 --> 29:46.400
No, no

29:46.400 --> 29:48.320
It's not the kind of funny I'm looking for

29:48.320 --> 29:48.640
No

29:48.640 --> 29:50.640
And this is why I'm going to be in the past for a little bit

29:50.640 --> 29:53.760
No, it's, I'm going to scream, I told you so funny

29:53.760 --> 29:54.400
Yeah

29:54.400 --> 29:58.400
So anyway, Fauci, that guy, Tony Fauci

29:58.400 --> 30:01.360
who Alex actually looked into like at the beginning of the pandemic

30:01.360 --> 30:03.120
and he's an all-star, he's a legend

30:03.120 --> 30:06.880
and Dr. Steve Pacanik said that he's one of the best who's ever existed

30:06.880 --> 30:07.840
One of the best there's ever been

30:07.840 --> 30:09.440
But then all that went away really fast

30:09.440 --> 30:11.040
Hey, wow, that's because he's evil

30:11.040 --> 30:12.480
Anyway, he's got to be executed

30:12.480 --> 30:15.440
Well, I'm going to tell you Fauci and Gates and all of them

30:15.440 --> 30:17.920
are going to be lucky if they just spend all that rest of their lives in prison

30:17.920 --> 30:19.040
after we have Nuremberg trials

30:20.720 --> 30:21.680
A lot of them

30:21.680 --> 30:23.200
If justice is done through the courts

30:23.200 --> 30:25.600
I'm not calling for outside the courts of vigilante stuff

30:25.600 --> 30:29.440
but I believe they should be tried for treason and biological warfare

30:29.440 --> 30:30.560
under the Nuremberg code

30:30.560 --> 30:33.600
And I believe just like Nazi scientists, they should be executed

30:34.400 --> 30:36.560
Oh, I thought you meant hired to work for us

30:36.560 --> 30:38.320
I stand for justice against these criminals

30:38.880 --> 30:40.480
And we'll see who wins in the end of this

30:40.480 --> 30:42.000
But I know this, I'm with God

30:42.000 --> 30:42.960
And that's what really matters

30:42.960 --> 30:46.720
God watches over our battlefields, over our lives, over our children

30:46.720 --> 30:47.680
and over our destiny

30:47.680 --> 30:50.880
And I put my hands into Jesus Christ's hands

30:50.880 --> 30:53.920
I put my soul into Christ's orbit

30:53.920 --> 30:56.080
And I commit myself to God

30:56.640 --> 30:57.920
All right, I got to go to break

30:57.920 --> 31:00.320
We got Alfie Oakes coming on

31:00.320 --> 31:02.640
One of the biggest food producers on the East Coast

31:02.640 --> 31:04.080
to tell you what's really going on

31:04.080 --> 31:06.400
with the giant food price increases that are already here and coming

31:06.400 --> 31:10.080
Don't forget, you have until tomorrow night at midnight

31:10.080 --> 31:13.680
that it's got to end to get last year's prices on high quality, affordable food

31:13.680 --> 31:15.520
ready to ship to you within days

31:15.520 --> 31:16.480
They ship it out the next day

31:16.480 --> 31:17.360
That's convenient

31:17.360 --> 31:18.400
It's May

31:18.400 --> 31:18.640
Yeah

31:20.080 --> 31:23.280
You're going to have another chance to get last year's prices today

31:23.280 --> 31:24.400
I think so, yeah

31:25.440 --> 31:27.760
December, you'll have a chance to get last year's prices

31:27.760 --> 31:28.880
You're going to be all right

31:28.880 --> 31:29.760
It's not going to be it

31:29.760 --> 31:32.080
The Easter sale is going to be going in December

31:32.080 --> 31:32.320
Yeah

31:32.880 --> 31:38.800
So yeah, I just, I found that to be like, just, right?

31:38.800 --> 31:39.920
This is how it goes

31:39.920 --> 31:40.400
Yeah

31:40.400 --> 31:43.040
Intense, violent fantasies towards his enemies

31:43.040 --> 31:43.520
Yeah

31:43.520 --> 31:45.520
Blah, blah, blah, I love God

31:45.520 --> 31:48.080
Food guy's coming on to scare you, I sell food

31:48.080 --> 31:48.320
Yeah

31:49.520 --> 31:51.200
It's cookie cutter, cut and paste

31:51.200 --> 31:53.840
That is really, really lazy

31:53.840 --> 31:55.200
It's just really lazy

31:55.200 --> 31:55.600
It is

31:55.600 --> 31:59.840
And we all have our bad days, but for Infowars, this is just unacceptable

31:59.840 --> 32:05.760
And it's such a stark contrast between the bad day that surrounded the middle-aged mice

32:05.760 --> 32:09.120
Because at least that's funny as hell

32:09.120 --> 32:09.680
Yeah

32:09.680 --> 32:12.480
That's lazy, that's bad, but there's a funniness to it

32:12.480 --> 32:13.760
There's an energy to it

32:13.760 --> 32:17.760
This is a 35-minute podcast interview with a guy from a year ago

32:17.760 --> 32:18.240
Yeah

32:18.240 --> 32:23.680
That is interesting, but Alex doesn't have a handle on it and can't really do much with it

32:23.680 --> 32:24.480
It's just, I don't know

32:24.480 --> 32:27.680
And your guests are a grocery store guy and a

32:27.680 --> 32:28.240
A perv

32:28.240 --> 32:32.560
A perv, a former, yeah

32:32.560 --> 32:34.000
Fuck both of these guys

32:34.000 --> 32:35.840
So there's other news in the world though

32:35.840 --> 32:36.240
Sure

32:36.240 --> 32:37.520
Of course, that pipeline

32:37.520 --> 32:38.240
Naturally

32:38.240 --> 32:38.480
Yes

32:38.480 --> 32:39.360
Mm-hmm

32:39.360 --> 32:39.920
Yeah

32:39.920 --> 32:44.000
I heard this clip and my response to it was, okay, Alex, fine

32:44.880 --> 32:50.560
Then you've got the Keystone XL Pipeline that was opening a few months ago

32:50.560 --> 32:55.120
It got closed to bring in all the oil from Canada and around the Midwest down to Houston

32:55.120 --> 32:58.880
To be refined and then sent up the Colonial Pipeline to the East Coast

32:58.880 --> 33:00.160
So Biden shut that down

33:01.280 --> 33:03.120
They say some shadowy hacker group did it

33:03.120 --> 33:04.640
They say they want to post-industrial America

33:04.640 --> 33:05.840
He said he would kill fossil fuels

33:05.840 --> 33:08.560
I believe the main suspect is Biden now blaming Russia

33:08.560 --> 33:11.600
That's just where the historical evidence is

33:11.600 --> 33:13.840
And, you know, if he already shut down our main other pipeline

33:13.840 --> 33:15.120
Well, why wouldn't he shut down the other?

33:15.120 --> 33:19.840
I have made up that Biden is the prime suspect in the Colonial Pipeline

33:20.720 --> 33:23.680
And now I'm reporting it as the most likely possibility

33:23.680 --> 33:24.320
Interesting

33:24.320 --> 33:24.720
Yeah

33:24.720 --> 33:26.560
Interesting if true

33:26.560 --> 33:27.920
Historical analysis

33:27.920 --> 33:30.160
If true, that would be

33:30.160 --> 33:33.280
That's a way bigger bombshell than anything else

33:33.280 --> 33:37.600
Bombshell President Hacks' Own Pipeline

33:37.600 --> 33:38.560
That's a bombshell

33:38.560 --> 33:39.200
That'd be crazy

33:39.200 --> 33:39.760
Right there

33:42.720 --> 33:48.720
Yeah, and also I can't help but, like, now that I know that Alex, you know, back in the past

33:48.720 --> 33:51.680
Would say that his prediction of 9-11 was based on historical analysis

33:51.680 --> 33:52.400
Sure, sure

33:52.400 --> 33:52.960
And research

33:52.960 --> 33:54.320
And then it turns out it was just a dream

33:54.320 --> 33:55.360
Bill Cooper said that

33:55.360 --> 33:56.560
But he also just had a dream

33:56.560 --> 33:57.920
Well, it was a good dream

33:57.920 --> 34:01.040
I can't help but hear him say stuff is based on, like, research and analysis

34:01.040 --> 34:03.840
And be like, you're probably lying and you probably had a dream

34:03.840 --> 34:11.040
Yeah, you watched the net the night before and then transposed Biden's face onto Sandra Bullock

34:11.040 --> 34:12.480
Which is a nightmare, I agree

34:12.480 --> 34:18.560
You fell asleep watching Tucker and now you had a little bit of the Nyquil and you're fucked up

34:18.560 --> 34:22.560
Man, I still can't get my head around the idea that the whole family, like,

34:22.560 --> 34:26.480
gathers around a dinner table and they have Tucker Carlson on

34:26.480 --> 34:27.920
I bet they don't

34:27.920 --> 34:29.120
Of course they don't

34:29.120 --> 34:32.160
That would be a, that's the worst thing I can think of

34:32.160 --> 34:33.440
Yeah, I bet they don't do that

34:33.440 --> 34:36.160
I bet Alex sits alone and eats dinner watching Tucker Carlson

34:36.160 --> 34:39.760
Yeah, I imagine Alex spends a lot of time alone watching Tucker Carlson

34:39.760 --> 34:40.480
Gotta take notes

34:41.360 --> 34:47.680
So Alfie Oakes is on and it's mostly just about fear, spreading fear about food and stuff

34:47.680 --> 34:48.400
Sure

34:48.400 --> 34:52.000
But you also should know that if you want to take that seriously

34:52.000 --> 34:54.080
You should know what else Alfie believes

34:54.080 --> 34:59.280
We know that Biden, the Biden White House agenda is lockstep with every single thing that these

34:59.280 --> 35:03.760
globalists want to do to ruin our country, to have their takeover

35:03.760 --> 35:09.600
We're the last beacon and I do feel, with all this doom that we see

35:09.600 --> 35:14.640
I do feel very confident that we're going to get the country back this time

35:14.640 --> 35:17.760
It's not going to be easy, it's not going to be as fast as everybody wants

35:17.760 --> 35:19.920
But our American spirit is still there

35:19.920 --> 35:25.280
I feel firmly that there was 80 million people that voted for Trump

35:25.280 --> 35:28.080
And somewhere in the 61 million that voted for Biden

35:28.080 --> 35:31.280
And the majority of Americans even in the national polls do not agree

35:31.280 --> 35:35.360
70% of Republicans, 31% of Democrats in the numbers higher know it was a fraud

35:35.360 --> 35:37.120
Stay there, let's talk about solutions

35:37.120 --> 35:41.760
Yeah, so Trump actually won in 2020 and we're going to get the country back?

35:42.640 --> 35:42.960
Huh

35:44.000 --> 35:48.640
So does he seem like a really credible source, the kind of guy you want to hang out with?

35:48.640 --> 35:53.360
What is it about white man and undeserved confidence?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.720
Where does it come from, Dan?

35:57.440 --> 35:59.360
He says looking into a mirror

35:59.360 --> 36:04.720
I don't know if this confidence that Alfie's got is undeserved

36:04.720 --> 36:05.840
Because I think he's a sleuth

36:05.840 --> 36:07.200
That's possible?

36:07.200 --> 36:08.160
I think he's a sleuth

36:08.160 --> 36:14.400
And I base that on this next clip where he lays out a conspiracy that is almost certainly true

36:14.400 --> 36:20.080
He can probably not come close to proving it

36:20.080 --> 36:23.280
And he might also tip his hand a little bit too much at the end of this one

36:23.280 --> 36:24.880
Will he give me a discount on eggs?

36:24.880 --> 36:25.280
Maybe

36:25.280 --> 36:25.920
Okay

36:25.920 --> 36:29.840
These companies like Monsanto in particular owned by Bayer

36:30.400 --> 36:33.040
Think about this and this scam has been going on for a long time

36:33.040 --> 36:36.160
And it used to be maybe thought of as a conspiracy theory

36:36.160 --> 36:37.360
But we're watching it play out

36:37.360 --> 36:37.920
Used to be

36:38.800 --> 36:41.520
We disrupted like putting real fertilizer in the ground

36:41.520 --> 36:42.880
Like real organic fertilizer

36:42.880 --> 36:47.200
They're putting this chemical MPK that Bayer will sell these farmers

36:47.200 --> 36:49.360
Universities are telling them it's okay to use

36:49.360 --> 36:52.160
Then because it's not nutrient rich

36:52.160 --> 36:57.360
It grows an inferior product and most of it's GMO stuff

36:57.360 --> 36:58.800
So then that product grows

36:58.800 --> 36:59.920
We put it in our bodies

36:59.920 --> 37:01.920
Our bodies are starving to death

37:01.920 --> 37:03.360
We fill up our guts with stuff

37:03.360 --> 37:08.080
But we're starving because the food that we're eating is not nutrient rich

37:08.080 --> 37:09.200
And then guess what?

37:09.200 --> 37:10.000
We get ill

37:10.000 --> 37:15.840
And guess what company is selling you the pharmaceutical drugs

37:15.840 --> 37:17.520
That supposedly make you better

37:17.520 --> 37:18.240
It's Bayer

37:18.240 --> 37:19.440
It's the same company

37:19.440 --> 37:21.360
So it's a vicious cycle

37:21.360 --> 37:22.400
And it's really

37:22.400 --> 37:24.080
I don't know if they were that genius to create it

37:24.080 --> 37:25.200
Or if they've just been

37:26.000 --> 37:27.040
Let it go along the way

37:27.040 --> 37:27.920
But this

37:27.920 --> 37:32.000
Oh we actually have documents where they give us the illnesses to then give us the treatments

37:32.880 --> 37:33.360
Exactly

37:33.360 --> 37:35.440
It's 100% what's happening

37:36.480 --> 37:37.600
And this is why

37:37.600 --> 37:42.000
I'm not saying it because I have local farms and we grow the stuff the right way

37:42.000 --> 37:44.240
But go out there and support your local farms

37:44.240 --> 37:49.680
Oh it's good that you're not saying that because you run competing business interests

37:49.680 --> 37:50.240
Well

37:50.240 --> 37:52.160
Because I might have been worried that

37:52.160 --> 37:53.040
There's that

37:53.040 --> 37:54.720
Look I'm no fan of Monsanto

37:54.720 --> 37:56.160
No I think we've all

37:56.160 --> 38:00.640
I think that's the only thing that unites all Americans except for the ones who work high up in

38:00.640 --> 38:06.560
Monsanto is that I think everybody's gotten high and yelled about Monsanto to each other at one point or another

38:06.560 --> 38:10.640
Yeah I think that some of the practices that they have are disreputable and I'm not a fan

38:12.080 --> 38:17.840
But I don't think it's sensible to speculate that they are making everyone sick

38:17.840 --> 38:20.080
So Bayer can sell prescriptions

38:20.080 --> 38:20.800
Or whatever

38:20.800 --> 38:27.120
And then for Alex to say we have the documents that they get us in order to sell us cures

38:27.120 --> 38:28.560
But I mean you don't need

38:28.560 --> 38:29.760
That's so not specific

38:29.760 --> 38:37.920
You don't need any conspiracy theories because a business trying to monopolize food is bad

38:37.920 --> 38:38.420
Yeah

38:38.880 --> 38:44.400
Before you go any their entire existence is now based around trying to control food

38:44.400 --> 38:45.840
And everybody needs food

38:45.840 --> 38:52.720
Yeah the idea I think ever of making terminal seeds you know that don't

38:52.720 --> 38:58.000
That that's just so fucking evil I'm like real downright

38:58.000 --> 38:58.400
I'm not

38:58.400 --> 38:58.960
God damn

38:58.960 --> 39:03.520
I'm not sure what you do to legislate it but any company that would be interested in doing that

39:03.520 --> 39:05.200
I find to be abhorrent

39:05.200 --> 39:05.700
Yeah

39:07.120 --> 39:10.880
And I understand why the profit motivation would lead you to that idea

39:10.880 --> 39:12.000
Yeah no of course

39:12.000 --> 39:13.920
But it's it's no good

39:13.920 --> 39:15.280
Yeah no absolutely

39:15.280 --> 39:18.880
So anyway I don't like Alfie much I think that conspiracy that he's got is really stupid

39:19.520 --> 39:26.480
But he did contribute to one thing I can get behind and that is probably giving Ted Nugent COVID

39:26.480 --> 39:28.000
That is good that is good

39:28.000 --> 39:29.280
Uh so

39:29.280 --> 39:30.960
Not all heroes wear capes dad

39:30.960 --> 39:33.440
Well Ted Nugent's back and better than ever

39:33.440 --> 39:33.840
Damn it

39:33.840 --> 39:34.720
He's fine

39:34.720 --> 39:35.200
Shit

39:35.200 --> 39:36.480
But he still rambles a lot

39:36.480 --> 39:36.960
Okay

39:36.960 --> 39:40.960
So right now as I face you Alex I couldn't be healthier

39:40.960 --> 39:46.000
I couldn't be more cocked locked and ready to rock the glock around the cock Mr. Spock

39:46.000 --> 39:49.120
And I killed two black pup with my bow and arrow

39:49.120 --> 39:56.400
I'm literally tooth picking my teeth right now in an in an immeasurable joyous celebration of medicine

39:56.400 --> 40:00.720
It sounds like he always sounds like he's on coke but talks all the time about how sober he is

40:00.720 --> 40:01.280
Yeah I know

40:01.280 --> 40:02.160
It's really frustrating

40:02.160 --> 40:03.280
That's so annoying

40:03.280 --> 40:04.640
So anyway a lot of this

40:04.640 --> 40:05.840
I hate him so much

40:05.840 --> 40:14.560
A lot of this appearance on uh the show is about how excited Ted Nugent is that people celebrated

40:14.560 --> 40:20.320
him getting COVID because because it validates him because all these bad people are against him

40:20.320 --> 40:24.400
And I would say that it's just because he's been a dick for a really long time and no one likes him

40:24.400 --> 40:25.040
Yeah

40:25.040 --> 40:29.920
Yeah but some of my other musician friends from around the country got hit real hard

40:29.920 --> 40:32.080
Now you never heard those stories

40:32.080 --> 40:32.880
Yes you did

40:32.880 --> 40:40.000
And no devils wrote journalistic hate hoping that my friends and other bands die

40:40.000 --> 40:40.800
They weren't shitty

40:40.800 --> 40:42.720
For the Chinese virus but they did that about me

40:42.720 --> 40:43.840
Because you're shitty

40:43.840 --> 40:46.800
I know you love me I feel the love I celebrate the love

40:46.800 --> 40:51.920
But do you realize as as bad of a mofo as I think I am

40:51.920 --> 40:59.280
I couldn't possibly be as wonderful of a human being to deserve the hate from the Satanists

40:59.280 --> 41:04.480
That they've trended a global article celebrating my sickness and suffering

41:04.480 --> 41:10.960
Is proof that they're scared to death of me and it makes me so happy and so strong

41:10.960 --> 41:12.320
Oh man that's cute

41:13.280 --> 41:17.760
No no one is scared to death of you we were all just kind of hoping you'd finally go away

41:17.760 --> 41:23.360
I do think that there's something probably unhealthy about people being happy about or

41:23.360 --> 41:28.000
laughing at or celebrating when some tragedy befalls someone who is an asshole

41:28.000 --> 41:28.560
Sure sure

41:28.560 --> 41:34.560
But I would be an idiot to not think that the reason is because Ted Nugent's a fucking idiot

41:34.560 --> 41:34.960
Yeah

41:34.960 --> 41:36.000
Alright he's a fucking asshole

41:36.000 --> 41:36.400
Yeah

41:36.400 --> 41:39.040
It's not because anybody's afraid of him or his ideas

41:39.040 --> 41:43.360
He's ready to rock around the clock like Spock or whatever the fuck cares

41:43.360 --> 41:51.200
Yeah this is all your fault it's all his fault personally like that's that's the thing it's

41:51.200 --> 41:57.440
it's not necessarily schadenfreude so much as it is when somebody spends so long telling you that

41:57.440 --> 42:05.520
this thing isn't even fucking real and all of this shit everybody's celebrating because fucking now

42:05.520 --> 42:10.320
do you get it do you get it now and they won't and they won't so that's why the only thing you

42:10.320 --> 42:14.560
have left to do is be like well I guess I just hope he dies or goes away

42:14.560 --> 42:18.640
You laugh you know you laugh at Ted Nugent getting COVID after going to a

42:18.640 --> 42:24.320
COVID is a hoax grocery store and having a whole long period of time where you're yelling about

42:24.320 --> 42:30.640
oh you know it's not that bad it's all wow in the same way that like you laugh when Ted Nugent

42:30.640 --> 42:34.960
bans guns at his concert right you know it's the same yeah kind of like oh that's interesting

42:34.960 --> 42:42.240
no it's a it's a physical real world example of the you know me reaping versus me sewing meme

42:42.240 --> 42:46.880
you know like that kind of thing so now Ted Nugent has an interesting metaphor here that

42:46.880 --> 42:51.920
I was very confused by I want to see if you can make sense of this okay well I consider myself a

42:51.920 --> 42:59.840
Schindler and my list of Jews that I'm saving is growing so quickly and so voluminously and they're

42:59.840 --> 43:05.040
all white brown shirts hate everything I stand for now that's some metaphor that I think the Alex

43:05.040 --> 43:11.360
Jones viewers will understand but some people will completely miss my point is that I have

43:11.360 --> 43:20.720
dedicated myself to being in the asset column to be productive so I I do think he's right that some

43:20.720 --> 43:25.520
people will get that metaphor confused because even when he's trying to explain it he's just

43:25.520 --> 43:30.800
he's explaining it that he's put himself in the asset column of life he's productive yeah that's

43:30.800 --> 43:37.600
what he's talking about and the way he's explaining that is he's Oscar Schindler right saving Jews

43:37.600 --> 43:43.600
who's on he what does he mean does he have a physical list of people that he's acting like

43:43.600 --> 43:49.360
Schindler about or is it just that the brown shirts don't like him well I mean based on what

43:49.360 --> 43:54.880
he's describing like being productive yeah in the asset column yeah the only way that that really

43:54.880 --> 44:02.640
helps other people is by example I guess sure so I don't know I don't understand this no I don't

44:02.640 --> 44:07.200
understand that metaphor I don't think it's offensive I don't see him actively saving anyone

44:08.000 --> 44:17.120
and I see him stealing the valor of an actual hero in order to prop himself up and boost his

44:17.120 --> 44:22.880
ego and confidence yep it was offensive yeah very offensive so uh there's a solution to the problems

44:22.880 --> 44:28.400
in the world and of course it's guns but there's another solution uh that Ted Nugent has it's more

44:28.400 --> 44:35.200
Alex's ah what do we do when the country's awake uh but they've stolen the election and are really

44:35.200 --> 44:41.680
trying to start a civil war well Alex number one uh we need more Alex Jones that are willing to

44:41.680 --> 44:46.960
put their literally their lives on the line spotlighting the cockroaches that have metastasized

44:46.960 --> 44:54.160
into every orifice every every element of America the media our government uh Hollywood uh academia

44:54.160 --> 45:01.440
it's literally at their best moment they're marxists more often than not they're literally

45:01.440 --> 45:06.880
rock solid in this in the Satan column if you look what they're doing that the economy it's

45:06.880 --> 45:12.720
all artificial we're selling pork bellies and orange futures that there are no groves of orange

45:12.720 --> 45:16.960
to represent and the pigs won't have enough babies to produce the pork bellies that they're selling

45:16.960 --> 45:22.320
I mean I'm just the entire player but I understand economics 101 but the most important thing is to

45:22.320 --> 45:27.440
support the Alex Jones to watch Tucker Carlson and look at the evidence and share it with our

45:27.440 --> 45:32.320
dumb friends and our dumb family members with all due respect I don't have any dumb family members

45:32.320 --> 45:37.200
and I don't have any wrong friends but I see them wearing masks on their motorcycle so I know there's

45:37.200 --> 45:42.560
some really dumb people out there that have turned into walking breathing mouth breathing zombies

45:42.560 --> 45:49.200
so there's something that I that stuck out to me when I was hearing that and it's just he's angry

45:49.200 --> 45:55.280
yeah he's really really really angry he's trying to come off with this laughing like I'm just a

45:55.280 --> 46:03.040
guitar player but yeah but he's fucking so mad there is there is an effect of rage underneath

46:03.040 --> 46:08.640
everything that he's saying that is really unsettling yeah yeah he's a he's a real psycho

46:08.640 --> 46:14.800
yeah it's a real psychopath kind of thing to do it feels it it feels scary let's call John Ronson

46:14.800 --> 46:21.440
and uh see what he has to say about the psychopath test for I just love I just love to go from one

46:21.440 --> 46:26.720
clip where he describes himself as Schindler and then to the next clip where he describes his

46:26.720 --> 46:33.680
political enemies the same way the Nazis described the Jews boy it's not glaring it sure seems like

46:33.680 --> 46:40.720
a strange thing for someone like Schindler to do yeah awkward yeah weird awkward is not the word

46:40.720 --> 46:47.120
I would use almost like all Nazis now want to describe themselves as the Jews despite the fact

46:47.120 --> 46:54.800
that they are still trying to exterminate them weird great so um they have uh Alex and uh Ted

46:54.800 --> 47:01.840
they have uh some commonalities uh some less complimentary than others um one of them that

47:01.840 --> 47:08.400
is a little bit maybe neutral is an interest in the outdoors and hunting sure um and so Alex

47:08.400 --> 47:13.680
believes that the most effective way to convert liberals over to their side is to go hunting and

47:13.680 --> 47:19.040
then Ted Nugent says something that I find a problem getting back to hunting I found with

47:19.040 --> 47:23.840
leftists and liberals I've taken a lot of Hollywood people out over the years my judge and I did a few

47:23.840 --> 47:28.960
times in Texas they convert to shooting and hunting instantly and and don't know why they

47:28.960 --> 47:33.040
were taught to hate it so I found the most successful way to convert leftists is if you

47:33.040 --> 47:37.520
can get them hunting or fishing there's no question about I've had such a success with

47:37.520 --> 47:41.440
that from the rock and roll world that I'm in where they've been brainwashed that somehow

47:41.440 --> 47:48.240
animals have rights in between the barbecue the brain dead propaganda mushy goofness that exists

47:48.240 --> 47:54.080
out there but to the man and the woman and mostly the Ted Nugent camp for kids children we baptized

47:54.080 --> 47:59.360
tens of thousands of people who were animal rights inclined because of the propaganda

47:59.360 --> 48:05.680
and then they realize you want grass-fed natural organic renewable ultimate healthy protein it's

48:05.680 --> 48:10.160
called venison I don't know if he actually has a camp for kids but if he does I'm gonna guess

48:10.160 --> 48:16.320
he's not all that hands on that should be illegal that should be illegal but I think that just from

48:16.320 --> 48:22.400
from like a you know umbrellaing out from that clip sure he believes that animals don't have

48:22.400 --> 48:28.960
rights yeah no he absolutely believes that anything that is an animal is subject to man's

48:29.680 --> 48:36.000
domain over earth he's a dominionist I think that there's there's an interesting argument to be had

48:36.000 --> 48:42.560
that animals have more rights than we ascribe to them right I think because they have less agency

48:42.560 --> 48:49.360
I am not fully conversant on some of the arguments in favor of vegetarianism or veganism from

48:49.360 --> 48:53.760
ethical perspective sure but I think that there are some interesting uh things that can be

48:53.760 --> 49:00.880
discussed along those lines right and and I just look at it as like I live with a cat Selene is

49:00.880 --> 49:07.520
like a friend to me yeah and I believe that she has many rights now if I were Ted Nugent

49:08.080 --> 49:15.120
I should only be mad if you killed Selene because she was my property right the only thing there is

49:15.120 --> 49:19.680
a property right that's been violated as opposed to something really fucked up you've taken the

49:19.680 --> 49:26.240
like life of this this uh this companion animal what that also means though is that you have the

49:26.240 --> 49:33.280
right to kill Ted Nugent if he attacks Selene in any way because property rights are sacrosanct

49:33.280 --> 49:39.760
yeah it is it is strange too to imagine the way he would distinguish between humans and animals

49:39.760 --> 49:48.080
in terms of where do rights begin yeah um I think that's really troubling I I think I think you

49:48.080 --> 49:55.520
could go too far with it maybe I would say that if you think animals have no rights you are probably

49:55.520 --> 50:01.440
of the opinion that uh many people are also animals who don't have rights or cockroaches

50:01.440 --> 50:08.720
exactly so uh I would uh I would not enjoy anybody who's like no rights that's not good

50:08.720 --> 50:15.840
and I think typically it's best to to err on the side of uh being more sensitive sensitive to uh

50:15.840 --> 50:22.800
ascribing rights to to animals I mean they can't communicate but they're clearly having a like a

50:22.800 --> 50:28.560
conscious experience absolutely there's no way that you can have not figured out that animals

50:28.560 --> 50:35.920
have personalities by now it's it's pretty pretty messed up yeah Ted yeah Ted anyway again there

50:35.920 --> 50:40.880
should be a restraining order keeping him away from any children if somebody writes his songs

50:40.880 --> 50:45.120
that's an immediate restraining order away from children I'm choosing to believe that that was

50:45.120 --> 50:50.720
a metaphorical flourish like rock around the clock with a sock on my head sure sure glock

50:50.720 --> 50:57.520
bock bock yeah that's a chicken doesn't have rights that's true anyway uh Alex gets uh Ted

50:57.520 --> 51:02.960
out of there and uh it's because he's got the biggest news in the world to break which I mean

51:02.960 --> 51:09.040
he's had a bit of time to do that already decided to talk to Alfie Oakes and Ted Nugent oh my god

51:09.040 --> 51:16.720
ladies and gentlemen I'm about to break the most important news in my 27 years on air

51:18.240 --> 51:24.880
Reagan breaks union strike absolutely incredible and if this information does

51:24.880 --> 51:30.000
not bring the criminals to justice if it does not reverse the operations that they've launched

51:30.000 --> 51:35.360
then things are going to get a lot darker a lot quicker let me give you a summation before I go

51:35.360 --> 51:39.600
through the evidence so when Alex says something like if this doesn't bring down the globalist

51:39.600 --> 51:43.840
things are going to get dark fast it's essentially him saying I can't make up anything more

51:43.840 --> 51:49.440
sensational or antagonizing than this like the next step from this is me telling you to kill

51:49.440 --> 51:56.960
people yeah I can't make it more clear I already know this is impotent so you guys better

51:56.960 --> 52:03.600
glean my actual meaning from this because I'm making it very obvious yeah so anyway you get

52:03.600 --> 52:09.120
to the big news emergency alert Fauci project manager confesses to creating COVID-19

52:10.880 --> 52:15.520
Tucker Carlson began to break this last night I told you on the war room we'd be breaking it today

52:15.520 --> 52:22.400
he broke it that's great but he didn't get to the last part where he admits the project manager

52:22.400 --> 52:27.600
because legally they couldn't get to that last five get the five viruses that they combined them

52:27.600 --> 52:32.720
for a vaccine but to make the vaccine you got to make the pathogen of something that never existed

52:32.720 --> 52:36.720
that no one would ever make yeah I think Tucker didn't cover that because it's not in the interview

52:36.720 --> 52:41.840
yeah so this next clip I thought was really funny because he's talking about Tucker's segment about

52:41.840 --> 52:48.080
this yeah and while he's talking Alex is kind of being a little wishy-washy about whether or not

52:48.080 --> 52:54.160
Tucker segments being censored sure and I think it is this like all right I'm posting a 15-minute

52:54.160 --> 53:00.880
long video that's clearly owned by another media organization yeah I better come up with a good

53:00.880 --> 53:08.000
reason why that's okay something and now Tucker Carlson has come out the 14-minute report last

53:08.000 --> 53:14.160
night that they're not posting the YouTube so we posted the Bandaw video and exposed this

53:14.160 --> 53:20.880
so we posted the Bandaw video and exposed this the censored Tucker Carlson report Anthony Fauci

53:20.880 --> 53:25.360
let the coronavirus pandemic happen why isn't there a criminal investigation that's the Fox

53:26.000 --> 53:32.400
news headline and Fox has the report but it's not on YouTube there it is censored see the

53:32.400 --> 53:38.960
Tucker Carlson Wuhan lab report Fox News won't let you see and that's the crew's great I didn't

53:38.960 --> 53:43.360
give him a headline this I did say the headline this morning I actually said say see the censored

53:43.360 --> 53:48.880
report see the censored Tucker Carlson Anthony Fauci so just change the headline please to

53:48.880 --> 53:55.120
censored and then this headline overhead shot please this headline right here this headline

53:55.120 --> 53:59.600
Tucker Carlson Anthony Fauci let the coronavirus pandemic happen why isn't there a criminal

53:59.600 --> 54:07.200
investigation okay this is the censored report in the sub headline you explain that Fox isn't

54:07.200 --> 54:12.400
posting this online they may have changed that since I went live oh well maybe okay maybe they

54:12.400 --> 54:20.160
posted it okay okay all right all right get at it again jerk off motion in the picture in picture

54:20.160 --> 54:26.400
a hundred percent Jesus so Alex ends up talking a little bit about this story about the

54:26.960 --> 54:33.600
interview on the This Week in Virology it's just this is tragic so here it is

54:33.600 --> 54:46.240
Peter Daska president of EcoHealth Alliance starting in 14 with project lead on six NIH

54:46.240 --> 54:53.600
projects would focus on the emergence of novel zoonetic coronaviruses COVID with bad origins

54:53.600 --> 54:58.400
some of the project's work was performed at the Wuhan Institute of Virology now we're going to

54:58.400 --> 55:02.880
show you him saying that it's an hour-long interview oh Alex is just stumbling over

55:02.880 --> 55:07.280
everything yeah it's not an hour-long interview it's a 35-minute interview it's not good just

55:07.280 --> 55:12.960
everything is is just it's even by the rules of rounding up you're going to 40 it feels like a

55:12.960 --> 55:18.000
guy trying to climb a rock but it's just covered in slime or something yeah it's just not working

55:18.000 --> 55:24.960
no it is very much like he doesn't understand at all what he's talking about and so they're just

55:24.960 --> 55:31.200
like we don't have much else on the show today clearly all we could get is fucking Alfie and a

55:31.200 --> 55:38.000
disgusting Ted Nugent so fuck it let's air tucker stuff and I'll just kind of riff through it

55:38.000 --> 55:44.160
yeah and like really oversell it yeah so he talks a little bit more about some details and it's

55:44.160 --> 55:49.600
again not accurate the six project received a total funding of three million seven hundred

55:49.600 --> 55:53.520
forty eight thousand seven hundred fifteen dollars from the National Institute of Allergy

55:53.520 --> 55:58.960
and Infectious Disease that's what Fauci is the head of and we've got all the grants and all that

55:58.960 --> 56:02.720
all the grants and all that right here so Alex is reading some information here but he doesn't

56:02.720 --> 56:07.360
really understand any of it the amount that he's talking about that three million plus dollars

56:07.360 --> 56:13.040
that's the amount of grant funding that EcoHealth Alliance has received since 2014 from the NIAID

56:13.040 --> 56:17.520
for a project that was meant to assess the risk of bat coronaviruses spurred on by the SARS and

56:17.520 --> 56:22.080
MERS outbreaks and the need to prepare right right right right one of the findings that this research

56:22.080 --> 56:27.600
that was funded by this grant arrived at was they found a number of bat-borne SARS-like coronaviruses

56:27.600 --> 56:32.720
and interestingly they also found quote serological evidence of human exposure among people living

56:32.720 --> 56:37.840
nearby this is something that tends in the direction of the natural origin theory for SARS

56:37.840 --> 56:43.280
coronavirus 2 people who are researching naturally occurring coronaviruses had found a number of them

56:43.280 --> 56:48.720
and discovered evidence of previous spillover of viruses that had previously gone unnoticed if the

56:48.720 --> 56:52.960
particular virus had been different in any of those cases or something had gone slightly

56:52.960 --> 56:58.000
differently people had interacted differently any of those instances could have been the start

56:58.000 --> 57:03.680
of an outbreak yeah Alex's main piece of evidence he's presenting here these these grants and this

57:03.680 --> 57:09.680
study it actually makes me think the opposite of what his conclusion is I'm I'm blown away

57:10.320 --> 57:15.200
like this is this goes back to that hospital this goes back to the COVID payments from Medicare

57:15.200 --> 57:21.760
where it's like they get 16 grand like I'm blown away that you think you can make me worried about

57:21.760 --> 57:28.480
a conspiracy theory where it's like it cost the globalists and the devil three million to kill

57:28.480 --> 57:33.680
everyone on earth if that's how much it costs to kill us why do I have to deal with all these

57:33.680 --> 57:39.200
fucking billionaires they don't need that money they could kill me with a few million yeah nothing

57:39.200 --> 57:46.640
yeah yeah it's I don't know it it's that it's that part of your brain that just doesn't quite

57:46.640 --> 57:50.800
you know three million dollars is a whole lot of money it seems like an insane amount of like I

57:50.800 --> 57:55.520
would I will never see three million dollars but yeah that's nothing in terms of a research grant

57:55.520 --> 58:03.520
that was over the course of 2014 to seven years yeah it's not that it's not that much in terms of

58:03.520 --> 58:08.800
what research actually costs yeah absolutely I mean for a business if you want to say if you

58:08.800 --> 58:16.080
want to say that a conspiracy theory about this is a huge deal over seven years a business would

58:16.080 --> 58:21.680
probably be disappointed with revenues if they were only at that amount Alex would be disappointed

58:21.680 --> 58:27.280
Alex would be furious with revenues if he didn't get a three million in five years in seven years

58:27.280 --> 58:32.320
or whatever yeah so anyway I just found myself incredibly uninspired by this conspiracy but I

58:32.320 --> 58:36.800
was inspired by this which we've heard before but I got to thinking about it a little more

58:37.520 --> 58:41.680
I was talking to Dave Mustaine one time I'm not name dropping he said I want you to help me write

58:41.680 --> 58:47.280
a new album with songs like Four Horsemen I wrote and I just looked at him right along my car here

58:47.280 --> 58:51.600
in Austin I said dude this is a very surreal day we just had dinner with Willie Nelson

58:52.400 --> 58:58.000
and I said I said I think that's up to you to write that album and he did write that album

58:58.000 --> 59:05.680
so I what a great story that was that was a great story that was on par with I was walking down on

59:05.680 --> 59:12.160
uh New York City Avenue and I saw Ben Affleck and I was like hey Ben and he was like hey

59:12.880 --> 59:19.840
Dave Mustaine was really drunk around me one time exactly it's the same story that sucks yeah I

59:21.200 --> 59:28.000
kind of disappointed because I it sounds kind of like Alex is trying to claim that Dave Mustaine

59:28.000 --> 59:34.080
wanted him to help so so respects Alex as a songwriter but he wants him to help write

59:34.080 --> 59:39.200
songs that would be on the album right that had Four Horsemen on it and that was Kill Em All

59:39.200 --> 59:43.760
by Metallica which came out in 1983 when Alex was nine yeah I wish I wish that was what he

59:43.760 --> 59:47.440
was actually claiming yeah but it's like no I want you to help me write songs that are like that

59:49.840 --> 59:57.360
let's get a burrito yeah I can't imagine I can't imagine anybody turning and looking at Alex sober

59:57.360 --> 01:00:04.480
and being like hey I want you in an enclosed space with me uh writing songs together Alex

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:12.640
Alex you're basically the Jim Steinman of your generation I need you to bring this song to life

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:19.360
come on get uh get Taylor Swift's producers out here get those Swedes get the Matrix yeah get

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:26.160
them going where's the dream would you need them for Alex's next album so I I think we've been

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.000
talking a little bit uh along the way through this episode that it just feels like Alex doesn't have

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.560
anything to grab on to no just it it feels really in terms of the conspiracy here's two and a half

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.400
minutes of Alex saying nothing okay basically just kind of dancing around but he doesn't know

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:50.480
anything to to latch on to terrible this is hands down the biggest crop of awakening the the the

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:57.760
biggest hall of truth the biggest wound to the globalists the biggest opportunity to deal a

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:04.800
death blow to these people politically to their agenda to kill their agenda and I mean the domino

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.040
starts falling you're gonna have Nuremberg trials I mean there's gonna be people getting hung sure

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.800
because that's what happens when you launch a bio attack is you get marched up there and they pull

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:21.600
a switch and a trap door opens up and you fall about you're a fan of Assad that's what happens

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.080
and your legs start kicking you take a dump down the side of your leg what I don't like death I

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.400
don't like killing people I don't like starting to fight with these murderers but they started

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:35.440
to fight with us and and I'm just telling you like I said in the first hour that we don't

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:44.320
want any violence against Fauci or Bill Gates or the New World Order from vigilantes you want to

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.320
take our governments and our countries back and we want to have them indicted with all the evidence

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.480
and we want to see them up on Nuremberg too and that's what last weekend I had the weekend before

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.120
last I had Dr. Francis Boyle on and he laid all that as well then the punishment for what they've

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.000
done is death and so I don't say that to be dramatic I don't say that to stick my head in

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.840
the mouth of a lion these guys are hyenas but still they can what stop it because I will not be

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:18.160
a coward coward and I want to thank God for your prayers listeners and I want to thank God for

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:26.400
God taking action this is devastating devastating devastating

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:35.200
there's no way to describe how much trouble they're in and I can tell you this they're

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:42.800
never going to get out of this now one way or another this is a political death blow to what

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.760
these guys did they're megalomaniacs though they were mad at Trump they were mad at Bolsonaro

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.280
they were mad at Boris Johnson who's a follower but thought he was winning Brexit and could do

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.720
what he wanted they launched this to bankrupt the small economy to bankrupt the hard-working people

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.320
to let the global banks and big box stores take over with big tech and they had it cooked up and

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.360
they had it ready and they did it in China so they could release it so they had plausible

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.400
deniability and so it was an attack on humanity none of that has anything to do with any of the

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:16.960
bombshell stories nothing just rambling and ranting about nothing yeah assuming the conclusion

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:24.000
has already been made it's it's it's time filler it's nothing yeah that's brutal yeah that's brutal

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.040
also if Alex says megalomaniac if he calls somebody a megalomaniac and doesn't say it takes

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.520
one to no one then it's disqualified it doesn't count if you do say it takes one to no one maybe

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:43.120
i'll listen to you because you are number absolutely one of them yeah but i think i think

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.680
what's going on generally speaking is that alex doesn't have a good handle on this story he knows

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.760
a few details he's already spent those um so you spend a bunch of time rambling about uh you know

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:59.280
like Fauci will hang and uh oh we've all proven it it's all this great sure because i think what's

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.720
really interesting to the audience isn't it really the nitty-gritty details or anything like that

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.840
it's an emotional experience yeah and alex is giving them an emotional experience and that is

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:16.720
the this is the end that we have details are bad whenever but we've won there's no way they're

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.360
going to get out of this one it doesn't sound like the duke boys they're in trouble i don't know the

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.640
duke boys tended to get out of them not the globalists oh that's fair this is a big deal

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.240
and i'm here to tell you that i have never felt so much fulfillment and i wouldn't call it

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.240
satisfaction this is a horrible thing we're in a global war the globalists are at war with

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.680
humanity this is a terrible thing happening but i've been around 47 years and i have never

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:50.480
never felt so much satisfaction in my life except maybe a few times where i was getting my ass

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:59.920
absolutely beat uh and i dug down deep and turned on the turned on the ben grim power and you know

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.160
broke that guy's jaw and saw his head at the ground and i wasn't happy i'd hurt him bad but

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.440
i was happy that i'd won the fight it was just a it's a feeling of just satisfaction that you just

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:17.280
you did it and you reached down and you turned it on ed risking my life you risking your life

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:22.080
everything we've done together man the satisfaction right now because i can tell

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:29.760
you they're not going to survive this and everything they've done to all these people

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.520
these millions they've killed all the people they starved to death with the lockdowns they're gonna

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:42.160
get retribution they're gonna be avenged so alex is basically like on this tip where he's like the

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.760
nuremberg trials will start in june yeah like you might as well be like planning them and getting

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.880
like a twitch stream ready for the nuremberg trials yeah this really does seem like uh

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:58.640
army building that's supposed to no it's not it's it's given the good news of the the victory

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:07.600
we have won yeah the globalists are done now that this video from a year ago has been talked about

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.400
that doesn't sound true to me no it doesn't no that's the emotional experience that alex is

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.400
wishing to create and convey because he's got nothing else yeah he's got nothing else and this

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:25.520
news doesn't really lend itself all that well to like uh be very scared yeah it is interesting the

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:34.960
oh the like there is a ratio between emotional manipulation and actual details for right-wing

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:40.000
people because they you can't just give them information that that that doesn't work you

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.560
have to have emotional manipulation and you can't let information get in the way of that emotional

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:51.040
manipulation but you also can't have nothing like this is nothing it's a lot of nothing yeah nothing

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.840
you know it's it's uh it was infuriating to listen to in the in the sense that it was

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:02.960
um kind of like i would describe it as being like eating a cinnamon twist from taco bell

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:08.240
but without any of the flavor i was about to say empty calories no taste yeah it was exactly

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:13.920
cinnamon sugar on it but it's that same you get you got the texture of what you were supposed to

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.600
eat but there's nothing to it it's just mush yeah yeah and and as somebody who you know really does

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:25.680
get excited when there's uh middle-aged mice studies to look into of course uh whenever there's

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.240
something like the spars document to look into totally i find this to be a little bit unsatisfying

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:39.120
and i take it personally yeah i i resent it yeah yeah i don't think that alex's quarterly uh

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:47.280
job evaluation is going to go well just just from my perspective having uh information about how

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:55.040
uh the boss feels uh which is springsteen of course q3 is gonna be rough it's gonna be terrible

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.960
he's gonna have to get his numbers up if you want a sense of how real a piece of news is to alex

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.520
i think one of the things you should take uh stock of is how much of the time of the

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:11.120
show is actually spent talking about that bombshell yeah yeah is this such a bombshell

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:17.760
that you don't go away and talk to alvie oaks and ted nugent forever yeah is this such a bombshell

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:24.800
that you don't uh i don't know spend the end of your show just talking about nothing and then

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.080
cover this for a little while i want to play a short clip from the war room not

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:37.280
owen schroyer three to six p.m but steve bannon's war room and i know steve bannon

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.120
and roger stone have had their fights uh i i don't want to be in a fight with anybody

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.880
i've had my issues with bannon but he's obviously a smart guy but he and his

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.120
host co-host made a statement about alex jones people used to think was crazy

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.840
but now he's improving right well that that's how it is when you're ahead of your time but

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.480
it's not about me being ahead of my time it's about people realizing that we don't make this

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.760
stuff up we really tirelessly research and we have a wide spectrum understanding of the world we're

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:12.880
not specialist generalist in that we really study how the globalists operate and we know how they

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:18.720
do things so we know how to counter them and and we know how to beat them everything should be

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.520
about the globalist because they're the ones in control of civilization taking us to a very bad

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:29.440
place and so that's what i'm getting at here but it is good to see it trend yesterday alex jones

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:35.280
trended on twitter again that alex jones was right and uh you can just type in my name or you can do

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:42.640
it all over many other places sure sure so so a little bit of alex jones uh media attention gets

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.400
some get some coverage here i i just feel like he's such an insecure dick yeah like it's it's

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:55.200
so sad like uh how many times has have we heard him talk about hating steve bannon he's a fucking

01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.440
worm the worst he's the devil he's part he's gone to the globalist he's part of their team

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.920
he was so pissed off when steve bannon named his show war room it was an attack on info

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.400
force trying to take away all their hey but look he's a smart guy because he said something nice

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.880
about me and let's spend 10 minutes on my show talking about how someone said something about me

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:23.040
what an asshole not hard today alex isn't a bad guy well i wish i hadn't screamed that everybody

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.320
should kill him uh it turns out that you know he said i wasn't a bad guy so yeah he's a pretty

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:34.880
cool dude he gets it he gets it have you ever seen uh uh bill mar's basically secret tucker

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:42.240
have you ever have you ever seen like a a breaking news story uh or a bombshell report

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.520
and then all the news organizations who normally have like live blogs and there's constant media

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.720
coverage just kind of stop and they're like can we just ramble around a little bit we just got

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.440
to have a little fun you know this bombshell story is fine but you know i'm just gonna talk

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:03.040
a little shit with my buddy over here right wolf blitzer guy derails the show situation room

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:09.280
for a while because someone tweeted about it yeah so brian stelter is just all of a sudden like

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.840
hey guys you know uh i met willie nelson one time yeah yeah we went out for dinner one night

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:19.600
uh you know he's like hey you pretty good songwriter yeah brian stelter is like oh one

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.080
time i was hanging out with uh uh jumbo wumba and they wanted me to write an album

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:31.600
oh boy yeah and even just like let's let's think of it even closer analog imagine brian stelter

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:38.000
taking time to yell about alex jones's appearance totally totally so look at how big

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.400
look at how big fat alex's neck is isn't that great isn't this great content that everybody

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:52.000
tuned in to see yeah so uh i feel like the job has not been done and alex doubles down on not doing

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.840
his job all right folks um i meant to take calls today i did and paul watson's coming up i got a

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.400
lot to hit before the show's over in 22 minutes or before my part of the broadcast is over

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:09.920
but let me do this because it's so powerful i aired it during a little no man's land first five

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.360
of the second hour but this is really an important report he's playing a special report for the second

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:22.560
time in this show he's replaying a special report that that's how little he cares about the story

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:29.680
that he's covering this is this is kind of amazing yeah this is a complete abdication of any even

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.360
pretense of work yeah yeah yeah to me to me every indication is like i don't know enough to

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.560
competently even riff on this yeah yeah yeah uh but i do want to cover it because tucker

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.360
covered it last night and i'll be way behind if i wait until tomorrow this is the bullshit that you

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:51.200
get from a shitty boss where he's always any mistake you make like perhaps not being able

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.400
to figure out how the phone system works for 20 years he's always screaming at you but then

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.120
whenever he comes to work with this bullshit you don't get to yell back at him that he's wasting

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.160
everybody's fucking time somebody should drive like a button where they get to scream hey screw

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.960
you you suck at this job i think that's what our podcast is oh that's fair so we don't have a

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:17.360
button though alex uh spent some more time uh talking about the pipeline hack and uh i want

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.440
to remind you that he's always right his gut is very strong this is not gonna sound good this

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:27.840
ain't hard oh i'd give it about a 95 chance the globalist did the pipeline shutdown

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.720
five percent chance somebody got pissed they shut down keystone inside and it's doing that to show

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.240
everybody the dependence on pipelines 95 it's globalist five percent chance that i'm wrong

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.480
it was done by people pissed off uh with the keystone being shut down to show people how

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.640
dependent we are but see that's in a logical world you do that and then maybe we'll understand but

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:55.120
no there's no logic here yeah so wait what 95 chance globalist false flag five percent chance

01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.400
false flag carried out by people trying to remind us that pipelines are important okay so it's an

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.280
educational false flag so if i understand correctly there's a zero percent chance it

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:12.720
was hackers the logical in a logical world yes naturally somebody on the inside would be furious

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.600
about people shutting down the keystone pipeline yeah so it only makes sense that they would then

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:23.120
shut down a different pipeline as an educational lesson yeah yeah yeah like hey be careful what you

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.440
wish for right that's exactly what's going on call that terrorism that would be technically

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.920
terrorism yes yes there might be attacking infrastructure to teach a lesson to let's say

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:40.400
spread fear yeah i think i think it's interesting to see the way that alex's brain kind of like

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.920
comes up with possibilities yeah he's just a terrorist you know anything has to be fake

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.720
everything has to be everything has to be fake what kind of fake is it yep it's very stupid what

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:58.000
a dick yep so alex is uh ranting because again just filling time the left want to be homeless

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.760
they want their children brain damage they want to be dead everybody i know the one got the vaccine

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.600

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:22.640

it's how i operate and so you got 2020 price parasitic would be better until tomorrow night

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.600
and then it's gonna go to its regular price it's still a great deal and they've told me in the next

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.360
two weeks or so they're gonna have to go up in price so you're not just gonna not get to sale

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:39.200
it's gonna have to go to price because the whole thing's shutting down and the supply chains are

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.560
breaking down and the pipelines are being turned off because we're under attack be afraid wow

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.880
you see you see the transition generally from like scary narrative into ad but then you saw

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.680
the reverse where it's the ad leads into terrorizing the audience of course that's uh

01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:00.560
that's nice i have all this food for you and the price is good now but hey tomorrow price is gonna

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.040
go to regular and actually i know that in two weeks prices are going up even more and also

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.920
everything is going down because we're under attack get your food now or die listen all i'm

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:16.880
saying is that i am going to take you hostage with fear and then you will give me money yeah

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.120
and that's why you should be afraid yep very very afraid very afraid i'm getting more storeable food

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:28.080
for the office i'm getting more at my house i ordered more last week i i told my wife go get

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.080
all the little delectable canned goods and things that save and some of the gourmet storeable foods

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:39.040
as well just get ready and my parents have got a trailer out a little ranch i've got a solar and

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.800
all the stuff that's gone in and i gotta get a little shack or something for me too because

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:49.760
it's gonna be like road warrior if we don't turn this around and there's not much time left what's

01:17:49.760 --> 01:18:00.160
the shack for so info war store.com it's a funky little shack um look i am sick and tired of

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:06.400
schrodinger's bug out location i know right i'm so sick of it i don't care for this nonsense of i

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.040
have a compound or maybe i should make one because the world's so dangerous and scary now yeah

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.560
ugh it's a will they won't they that uh is infuriating yeah let's get together with rachel

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.520
ross come on buddy also here's the thing that i want to bring attention to at the end of this

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:26.240
episode alex is talking about how we need to be really scared you gotta buy that food yeah got

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:32.240
a bug out location and all this course half an hour earlier he was laughing about how fulfilled

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.640
he feels because the globalists aren't done for right thanks to this bombshell that he can't quite

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:43.040
get himself to really cover it in any detail absolutely that is incongruent it's nonsense

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:49.040
and the reason is because the emotional experience of defeating the globalists is something that he

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.200
wants you to you know it's yeah it keeps people having fun yeah and then at the end you gotta

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.960
scare people because that's how the money comes in yeah no one makes money off defeating the

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:05.280
globalists yeah yeah it's terrorist edging yes so annoying yeah i would like some sort of

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.920
man you just get caught up in that you know it just rewires your your ability to process if

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:20.320
you're just so emotionally overstimulated all the time with no actual release it just drives you

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:28.560
insane like it's it's insane it's it's borderline solitary confinement you know yeah it's awful

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.680
yeah and i think i think that's the i don't know yeah i don't know what else to say but yeah it's

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.720
a mess it's kind of weird how you can sell stuff because of that isn't that a weird uh aspect of

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:45.040
our biology is that somehow all the way along the line evolution has led to people being like

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:50.480
be afraid and buy my shit well i mean i think that's the american dream snake oil salesman

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:55.600
and what have you there is a certain american aspect of the snake oil it's very americana

01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.800
the way alex is uh it kind of manipulating people in order to sell them bullshit yeah it's hard to

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:06.000
it's hard not to think if we ever did eradicate these type of snake oil salesmen that we wouldn't

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.720
also have like writers and and different people making nostalgic stories about when you the snake

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.720
oil con man going from town to town you know just to be clear when you say eradicate you're talking

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.000
about like regulate out of existence yes yeah yeah no no no no no this is not a this is not

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.640
a cockroach system i mean like we don't have the snake oil salesman anymore it's some long

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.280
distant point in the future right people will feel nostalgic for them yeah of course yeah of

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:38.320
course because we're insane yep yep oh well yeah anyway um hey i look forward to going back to the

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:44.800
past because i find myself incredibly frustrated by this asshole yeah and i don't want to hear

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.440
about another goddamn bombshell that's disappointing i want to go back to the past

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:56.800
when news was measured and uh sometimes guests were combative sure and uh everything was what

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:03.760
it was yeah and uh not this overly dramatic nonsense uh every single day yeah it's just

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:08.960
