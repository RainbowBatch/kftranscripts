Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,360
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for knowledgefight

knowledgefight

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,880
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys

I need, I need money

Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,320
Andy and Kansas

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
Andy and, Andy, stop it

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
Andy and, Andy and Kansas

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,040
Andy and, Andy, it's time to pray

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding me

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller, I'm a huge fan

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,880
I love your world

I love you

23

Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm Jordan

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,680
We're a couple dudes, I like to sit around, worship at the cult of Selene's altar and

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,560
talk about Alex Jeff

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,080
Indeed we are Dan

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
Not as smooth as the first time I got it right

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,200
I know, it was, but you're getting there, we're getting there

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,720
It's practice, it's work

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,680
You know what, a lot of people need to see the process of becoming good

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,120
instead of just seeing the finished product

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,120
No, definitely, and I consider this part of my 10,000 hours towards getting that introduction

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Absolutely, absolutely

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Also part of your 10,000 hours towards telling Malcolm Gladwell he's a moron

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I consider that my community service

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,240
Good stuff

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,600
Hey Jordan

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,520
Hey Dan, I have a question for you

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,320
What's up?

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,360
What's your bright spot today?

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,760
My bright spot today is actually, maybe you should go first

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,480
Maybe I should go first

44
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,600
Mine might be a little extended

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
Alright, okay, mine's just loud

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
Well, preemptively, neighbors

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,160
Neighbors, fair enough

48
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,800
My bright spot, Dan, is Shohei Ohtani

49
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,680
Today just hit his 12th home run to win

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,400
Congratulations

51
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,800
It's incredible, and he has a

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,840
Is he on the Cubs?

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
No, absolutely not, no, he's on the Angels

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,560
He hit his 12th home run, and he has an ERA around 2

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,240
And he has several, I mean this dude, here's why he's my bright spot

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,800
So he's a pitcher

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,840
He's everything, Dan

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
He is the only baseball player on this planet that has ever lived

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Who can reliably throw a 100 mile an hour fastball and hit 450 foot dingers on the regular

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,720
And I have thought about that, and here's why it's my bright spot

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,160
Is because unlike so many other achievements, right now is the only time in history that

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,040
anyone has ever done what Shohei Ohtani is doing

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,760
And maybe he's the only person who has ever lived out of the 50 billion people estimated

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
He's the only one who can do this

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
That's really, really insane to me

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
For some of our international wonks in baseball

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,080
It's very rare for a pitcher to be able to hit well

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
No, no, no, no, that's not what it's rare

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
But you can hit well

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
It is rare for a pitcher to hit well

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,160
Yeah

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,960
It is not rare for a pitcher to hit what is he's on pace for over 40 home runs in a season

73
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,600
That is crazy

74
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,640
That's not rare

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,240
That's never happened

76
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,840
Anybody who wants to talk to me about Babe Ruth can shove it up their ass

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Babe Ruth hit home runs off of people who threw slower than I do

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,400
Sure

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
Babe Ruth is shit

80
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,400
Babe Ruth is garbage

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,520
He was a garbage human being who played against garbage baseball players

82
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,000
Understood

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,080
For some context, one half of Major League Baseball as an organization doesn't make pitchers hit

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
That's how not good at hitting generally pitchers are

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,520
Part of the game was like, these guys are so bad at hitting, we have to change it

87
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,480
Yeah, let's not bog it down

88
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
I was going to make a joke about Jeff Supon

89
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,480
I believe famously hit a home run in the World Series for the Cardinals

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,960
He did

91
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,240
No, there was the Cubs reliever, I can't remember his name off the top of my head

92
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,920
But he was one of the last people to hit a home run in a playoff game as a relief pitcher

93
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,480
Hell yeah

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Rare

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,960
Very rare

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,080
But the point is

98
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,720
You get to see him play

99
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
There's only one

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,440
There's only one

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
Like, how insane is that?

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
There's only one person

103
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,640
But I also think about this, you're saying he's on pace for that

104
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,120
Sure

105
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
That to me, I just imagine being in that position, being in those shoes

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Like, I don't know how you would handle that pressure

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,840
Yeah, no, totally

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,240
I don't know how he could, you know, I don't know

109
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,880
But he grew up in the Japanese Baseball Leagues, which if you've never

110
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,840
Like in the Japanese Baseball Leagues, if you're eight playing for your team

111
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,920
You have the same amount of pressure as a Major Leaguer in the United States

112
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
I don't know if you know anything about it

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,080
I don't, I have not looked into this at all

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
But they are fucking intense

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,080
So Jordan, my bright spot is I made a little trip

118
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,760
Long overdue trip down to the box, the mailbox

119
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,240
Yes, indeed

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
And I have some stuff to take out of the bag

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Yep

122
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
Excellent

123
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,800
One thing I realized, I didn't mention this when it was my birthday

124
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
Because it also included a gift for your birthday

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,760
And I forgot when your birthday came around

126
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,960
But our Black Dragon Queen Christie sent a very nice care package

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh yes, of course

128
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,760
So thank you so much for that

129
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,640
Oh, absolutely

130
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,640
And then I went to the mailbag and there was some other stuff that was a bit birthday related

131
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,720
Bex sent in some young ginger ale, which I don't know what that is

132
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,440
Me neither

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,600
Young ginger, could be a wrap name

134
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,840
It could be Carl Jung's specific ginger line

135
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,240
Sure

136
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,760
Also, I believe Bex sent a pink ukulele

137
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Which I'm a little confused by

138
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
But I'm excited to try to learn

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,160
I was trying to learn a couple chords last night while I was playing around with it

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,440
And my fingers are too fat

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
So I don't know if it's gonna work out

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
But what happened to those knowledge fight guys?

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
They turned into a weird ukulele band, I don't know

144
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
But we could do some cover songs

145
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
Yeah, why not?

146
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,440
Absolutely

147
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,320
Also

148
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,000
You Belong in the City is ripe for a ukulele parody

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Also in this was the Sega Mega Drive Classics for the Switch

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,840
All right

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,040
And I've been used to seeing these kinds of collections of old games

152
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Sure, sure, sure

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
And typically they end up not having the license to have like actually good games on it

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,360
But this is pretty solid

155
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
You got Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine

156
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,080
Sure

157
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,640
Classic

158
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
Gotta have that

159
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,120
Sonic, Sonic 2, Toejam and Earl, Vector Man

160
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,720
Are you reading them in chronological order?

161
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Comic Zone

162
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,280
Oh shit, I do remember Comic Zone

163
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,240
Wow, the past is far away

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
The entire Streets of Rage trilogy

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay, well that we haven't had in a long time

166
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,600
There's a whole lot of stuff on there and it's very nice

167
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,120
It's been a long time since I've moved from left to right and punched things

168
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,640
Yeah, there are a couple games that are entirely that

169
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,200
So then I got another thing here

170
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
And this was a little bit weird, Jordan

171
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I feel like I'm gonna need your help because I think this might have actually been for you

172
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,120
Okay, okay

173
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
So here, this card came

174
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
And look at the front, look at the front

175
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,760
Alright, alright

176
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:32,960
Okay, there is a dog resting his, well there's a puppy resting his very cute, very lovable face

177
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,080
On top of a kitten who is staring cute and lovable

178
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,840
Now look at this, look at this on the inside

179
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,640
It says, yeah, we listen and we have feelings too, comma, Jordan

180
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:44,880
Right

181
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,040
Love, comma, nothing

182
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,760
Nothing

183
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,400
Okay

184
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
Now, this came inside a box

185
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay

186
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
That had two mugs and this is one of them

187
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Okay, alright, you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free, alright

188
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,280
Central Intelligence Agency, sure, sure

189
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,760
Now, there is a sticker on the bottom that implies that this came from a gift shop

190
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,800
Yes indeed

191
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,360
So, either the CIA is trying to fuck with you and let you know, Jordan, that they're listening

192
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
And you have hurt their feelings

193
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,240
I don't understand

194
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,200
Either the CIA is very sensitive

195
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,480
Or it's somebody fucking with us, I'm not entirely sure

196
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,280
Alright, yeah, dot, dot, dot, yeah, we, but who's we?

197
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,480
CIA, man

198
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,000
It's the CIA, but I mean, why would they send me a cute little puppy?

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,760
It was from a nondescript address in Virginia

200
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,400
Oh, well, that would kind of make sense then, wouldn't it?

201
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,680
I don't know, it's entirely possible, but I mean,

202
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
Occam's Razor tells me that it's someone fucking with you

203
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
But I still appreciate a mug

204
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,040
Sure

205
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,000
I like a nice mug

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Admit how ironic it would be for Alex to constantly claim that the CIA and all important heads

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,840
of state listen to him and yet we get very kind, almost downright cute cards from the CIA

208
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
Letting us know that they are listening

209
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
And that you are being too mean

210
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,960
I apologize to the CIA, I guess

211
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,440
Wow

212
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,280
Is that what I do? Is that all it takes? It takes a cute kitten and a cute puppy

213
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Jordan has issued an apology to the CIA

214
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
See now, what they don't realize, it does take both

215
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,840
For all of our leftist listeners out there that really look at Jordan as this kind of like,

216
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,080
oh yeah, he gets it, he's on the edge, man

217
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,800
He just apologized to the CIA

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,680
I would be surprised

219
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
Centrist Jordan

220
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,400
Honestly, I would be surprised to know too many leftists who,

221
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,160
upon receiving a cute puppy or kitten card, wouldn't be like

222
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,960
I mean, it softens me a little bit just to know that cute puppies

223
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
Oh, damn it, they got me again

224
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
Oh man, I had the CIA all wrong

225
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
Oh, damn it

226
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
So Jordan, today we got an episode from the past

227
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
We are talking about May 8th and 9th, 2003

228
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,840
Ooh, fun

229
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,880
Continuing our march

230
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,360
One of the things I wanted to try to do was I wanted to try to keep pace

231
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,000
Sure

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
With 2003, I don't think we're going to be able to do that

233
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,360
That's going to be tough

234
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
With two episodes a week, it's a little tough

235
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
It's going to be a hard fight

236
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,040
But here we are, May 8th and 9th

237
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
Got some interesting stuff to go over

238
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
Some weird parallels with the present, as per usual

239
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:19,760
Naturally

240
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,720
Due to my witchcraft

241
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
You are a witch

242
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,400
But before we get into this, let's take a little moment to say hello to some wonks

243
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,280
Ooh, that's a good idea

244
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,120
So first, Andrew Buchholt, thank you so much

245
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,400
You are now a policy wonk

246
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm a policy wonk

247
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,080
Thanks, Andrew

248
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,560
Thank you

249
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,080
Next, ZZ Pop, thank you so much

250
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
You are now a policy wonk

251
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm a policy wonk

252
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
Thanks, ZZ Pop

253
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,920
Next, All Hail the Cult Leader, Selene

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,400
Thank you so much

256
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,680
You are now a policy wonk

257
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm a policy wonk

258
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
Thank you very much

259
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,560
Uh, thank you

260
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Next, Good Good Muscle, Nate

261
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,720
Thank you so much

262
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
You are now a policy wonk

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,880
I'm a policy wonk

264
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
Thanks, Good Good Muscle, Nate

265
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,560
Thank you

266
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
Next, Jordan's Banshee, Laugh Is My Bright Spot

267
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,280
Thank you so much

268
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
You are now a policy wonk

269
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm a policy wonk

270
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,040
Thank you very much

271
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,760
Thank you

272
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
Next, Gon AFK

273
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,520
Thank you so much

274
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,720
You are now a policy wonk

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,760
I'm a policy wonk

276
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,280
Thank you very much, Gon AFK

277
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,760
Thank you

278
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,520
And we've got a technocrat

279
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,200
To give a little tip of the cap too

280
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
So Mr. Mac Mackington, thank you so much.

281
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,320
You are now a technocrat.

282
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,480
I'm a policy wonk.

283
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

284
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
Have yourself a brew.

285
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,240
How's your 401k doing, bro?

286
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,880
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

287
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,040
Let's just get down to business.

288
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,160
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

289
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,120
Why are you pimps so good?

290
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,840
My neck is freakishly large.

291
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,320
I declare info war on you.

292
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,480
Thank you, Mr. Mac Mackington.

293
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Mac Mackington.

294
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,760
Also, before we get into this, this show business,

295
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,960
the sexual business of the show.

296
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,840
Not show business.

297
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,160
No.

298
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,840
Certainly not.

299
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,280
We've never been in show business.

300
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,320
We have mics we're holding in our hands.

301
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,480
We are not in show business.

302
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,760
No.

303
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,840
I got a message from a Jeff, character named Jeff.

304
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,440
And Jeff wanted to get a message out.

305
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,000
And that is, apparently, they have a friend named Alex,

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,840
who's opposed to the spider leadership.

307
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,880
And this is relevant, because you're

308
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
wearing the spider leadership t-shirt right now.

309
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,520
Perfect.

310
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,480
So this friend of Jeff's is opposed to you.

311
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,560
OK.

312
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,800
Also, apparently, Jeff's brother, Evan,

313
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,160
just got into the show.

314
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,680
So what up, Evan?

315
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,640
Hi, Evan.

316
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
Welcome to the Wonkaree.

317
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,560
What are we doing?

318
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,520
I have no idea.

319
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
This is just what we've become, I guess.

320
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,840
Welcoming new listeners individually?

321
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,360
Why?

322
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,680
Why are we doing this?

323
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,320
I don't know.

324
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,400
Don't you realize what can of worms you've opened up again?

325
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,280
Every time you add another thing, it never ends.

326
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,120
Oh, god.

327
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,240
Oh, boy.

328
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,200
So here are a couple out of context drops.

329
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,700
OK.

330
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,800
The first is a little, it's actually

331
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
a little game I want to play.

332
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,320
And that is, Alex or Bill Clinton?

333
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,840
OK.

334
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,280
I love this country.

335
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,680
Was that Alex, or was that Bill Clinton?

336
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you need to hear that again?

337
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,760
Yes, one more time.

338
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,680
OK, here we go.

339
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,160
I love this country.

340
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,800
OK, we can't do, this is a stolen news radio bit

341
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,960
from four years prior to this show airing.

342
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,720
When Phil Hartman went on as Bill McNeil

343
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,680
and did long interviews with himself as Bill Clinton.

344
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,840
We can't say that it's that.

345
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
I will say that it's definitely not that.

346
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,520
It's definitely not that.

347
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,920
It is either Alex Jones sounding a lot like Bill Clinton.

348
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,520
Sure.

349
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,920
Or Bill Clinton with Alex's going

350
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,520
to break music playing in the background.

351
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,080
I'm going to go with Alex on this one.

352
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,600
You're right.

353
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Oh, wait.

354
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
So here's Alex doing an impression

355
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,720
of a dude smoking pot.

356
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,880
Yeah, you ever seen the artwork in the Denver airport?

357
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Yeah, man.

358
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,440
It's good to know that the Denver airport will never die.

359
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,720
No, and finally, third out of context drop,

360
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,000
unprecedented, Alex doing an impression of himself.

361
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,080
The valedictorian of the school today

362
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,000
doesn't hold a candle to my father.

363
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,960
OK.

364
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,560
Wait.

365
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,840
A little sad.

366
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,480
Your father today?

367
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,760
No, back in his dad's day.

368
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,440
That's when people were smart.

369
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,960
I really don't know if that's how anything works, especially

370
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,640
not education or knowledge.

371
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,280
Nope.

372
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,800
So we start here on the 8th.

373
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,720
And Alex actually begins the show

374
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,360
with a story that there's some mirror

375
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,640
parallels to the present day.

376
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,560
It's now coming out that what may have killed that NBC

377
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,120
reporter was his small pox injection.

378
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
So see, it's mainstream.

379
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,840
These vaccines are deadly.

380
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,880
You don't have to take them.

381
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,800
But the government's trying to set a precedent that you do

382
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,080
by saying, oh, you're crazy if you don't.

383
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,760
Well, I guess then 99-plus percent of doctors, police,

384
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,600
and firemen are crazy because 99-plus

385
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,160
have refused to take it.

386
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,040
But David Bloom didn't.

387
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
And he's bye-bye.

388
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,200
And many others that are taking it are bye-bye.

389
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,600
It looks like more than one out of 1,000 die that take it.

390
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
Those are now official numbers, by the way.

391
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,560
First things first, Alex, not the last stat

392
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
that he cited there, that's a little outlandish,

393
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,880
but he's not off on some of this stuff.

394
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,760
But the story that he's telling about this

395
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
is missing some points.

396
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,080
I was able to find a CBS News article from May 2003, which

397
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,600
discussed a proposed plan to vaccinate half a million

398
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,680
health care workers against smallpox, of which, quote,

399
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,400
only 35,000 of the targeted workers had been inoculated.

400
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,640
There's not good evidence that I can find that anyone was

401
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,240
refusing the vaccine, just that the program may have only

402
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,040
vaccinated about 7% of the stated goal population.

403
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,080
So Alex is saying 99% are refusing the vaccine.

404
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,440
So real decent chance they weren't refusing it,

405
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,480
but one in seven is closer than I'm used to him being.

406
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,880
Sure, sure.

407
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,320
93% of the targeted population that they

409
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,760
meant to get a smallpox vaccination did not get it.

410
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,280
Sure.

411
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,360
Alex is making up that they all refused.

412
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,400
Right, we don't know how the not getting it went down.

413
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,480
It wasn't like we know for a fact.

414
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,920
No, instead, actually 7%.

415
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,240
There's a real decent chance that most of that

416
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,360
was just due to structural problems with how the rollout

417
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,440
of the campaign was.

418
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,480
Yeah, not enough people even knew about it.

419
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

420
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,400
And part of it is most people do not

421
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,320
need to get vaccinated against smallpox nowadays.

422
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,760
The reason is because thanks to vaccination efforts made

423
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,040
by the people who came before us,

424
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,160
smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980.

425
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,840
After 9-11, there was a concern about a terrorist group

426
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,040
or a hostile government using smallpox as a weapon.

427
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,640
And as such, the US government stockpiled massive amounts

428
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,600
of smallpox vaccine in order to be prepared

429
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,960
for that kind of possibility.

430
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,600
But typically speaking, most people won't need that vaccine.

431
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,560
The people who do, according to the CDC,

432
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,120
are typically lab workers who might

433
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,520
be in contact with any viruses similar to smallpox.

434
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,280
The push to vaccinate in 2003 was

435
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,800
based on fears of this potential terrorist attack.

436
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,720
And what was ultimately decided was

437
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,280
that it wasn't worth the risk.

438
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,800
And vaccines could still be effective after someone

439
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,120
was exposed to the virus, so there wasn't

440
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,880
much of a need for this.

441
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,080
The program was ended early, and only a total of about 39,000

442
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,960
people were ultimately vaccinated.

443
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
A large part of the resistance to this program

444
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,320
was that people didn't buy that there was a real threat,

445
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,160
since Bush had been pretty clear that there

446
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,240
was no information of an imminent attack,

447
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,840
and hospitals were reluctant to participate.

448
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,400
In the end, however, through this program's failure,

449
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
public health preparedness was improved.

450
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,400
And even critics of the smallpox campaign

451
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,480
credited with helping us be more ready for the later

452
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,400
outbreak of SARS.

453
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,520
Sure, sure.

454
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,160
David Bloom was a 39-year-old combat reporter

455
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,960
working with NBC.

456
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,120
He passed away on April 6, 2003, while on assignment,

457
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,640
reporting from Iraq.

458
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,920
It's pretty well understood that the cause of death

459
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,720
was that Bloom had developed a blood clot in his leg

460
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,760
from spending days on end crammed into an armored vehicle

461
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,080
and having deep vein thrombosis.

462
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,120
This clot made its way to his lungs

463
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,920
and caused a pulmonary embolism, which resulted in his death.

464
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,600
In the days after he passed away,

465
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,520
a doctor named Brian Strom made a number

466
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,480
of comments to the media about the possibility

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
that Bloom's death was related to the smallpox vaccination

468
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
he'd gotten several weeks prior to his passing.

469
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,360
There's no direct evidence to support this conclusion,

470
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,080
and Alex is kind of just making stuff up,

471
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,640
riffing and jumping to conclusions here.

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,360
That said, no medication is fully without some risk,

473
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,000
and the smallpox vaccine is no exception.

474
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,680
Compared to the horror of having smallpox come back, though,

475
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,360
the risk is very minimal.

476
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,800
Isn't it so fucking, it's just so indicative

477
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,680
of how stupid people are that the government was like,

478
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,960
okay, now, despite not having any idea whether or not

479
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,840
they could have weaponized polio,

480
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,200
or smallpox would weaponize smallpox,

481
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
or even have some way of delivering it,

482
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,800
we're just going to go out of our way

483
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,080
and protect ourselves against the possibility

484
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,760
of a smallpox attack, despite the fact

485
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,800
that the overwhelming number of humans

486
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,440
have died of diseases that have occurred regularly,

487
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,680
and at no point in time have they been like,

488
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,240
let's put a lot of effort into preemptive, yeah.

489
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,080
I mean, they have.

490
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
I mean, they have, but not like, yeah.

491
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,120
You know what my point is.

492
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,280
It's not like the Bush administration

493
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,640
wasn't also getting tetanus shots.

494
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,480
Sure, sure.

495
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,600
I don't know what you're even saying.

496
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,240
Sure, but my, fine, fine, fine, whatever.

497
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,600
I feel like you're just looking for a way to attack.

498
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm not looking for a way to, I don't need to look.

499
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,440
Sure.

500
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,120
I think when you look at this,

501
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,400
it's like, it's a terrifying prospect,

502
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,600
and I think that maybe there was some chatter of some sort.

503
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,040
I would believe possibly that like,

504
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,840
oh, this is something we should be concerned about.

505
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,680
Sure.

506
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,360
Somebody might have a sample

507
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,360
of some laboratory smallpox that could really fuck things up.

508
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
Totally.

509
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,840
And I think that maybe if you escalate in your head

510
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,880
what the possible threat is,

511
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,480
then the idea of a campaign

512
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,040
of vaccinating healthcare workers

513
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,120
who might be in the front lines or soldiers,

514
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,480
that makes a certain amount of sense.

515
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,320
Right.

516
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Looking back, we obviously have the gift of hindsight

517
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
knowing that this didn't happen.

518
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,240
Right.

519
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,080
And it can look a lot more silly.

520
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,920
Right.

521
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,800
But, and even back then,

522
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,840
you could probably make a pretty decent argument

523
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,160
that it was excessive.

524
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,000
Right.

525
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,600
You kinda understand where the thought process comes from.

526
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,000
No, naturally, but it's just,

527
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,640
we've had too many examples of this type of paranoia

528
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,240
being the excuse for action

529
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,120
when it's paranoia that inherently devalues

530
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
the life of other people,

531
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
as opposed to paranoia that's like,

532
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,480
hey, diseases just come out of nowhere

533
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,800
from shit all the time.

534
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,960
That's infinitely more important.

535
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Instead, it's like,

536
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,400
we've always gotta be preparing for a war

537
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,800
or an attack or someone to try and kill us.

538
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,640
You know what I'm saying?

539
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,480
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
I think I might've misunderstood your point.

541
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,680
Yeah.

542
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
And I think your point is fine.

543
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,760
And definitely, I think it was indicative

544
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,720
of a lot of the public mentality.

545
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,560
Especially in 2003, when everything is an attack.

546
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,400
Yeah.

547
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,040
But I also think that you can do both.

548
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,880
Yeah.

549
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,720
I think that,

550
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,040
and that might be where my head misunderstood

551
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,880
what you were saying.

552
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,320
No, no, no, totally.

553
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,360
If it were a one or the other choice,

554
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,720
then yeah, focus on.

555
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,080
No, no, no, totally, totally.

556
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,000
But I think everybody was kind of,

557
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,560
ideally, had their head on swivel, looking around.

558
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,920
No, my point isn't invalid,

559
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,560
but it's not necessarily the best way to go

560
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,800
about talking about stuff.

561
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,920
I don't think you broke new ground.

562
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,160
No, I didn't start a revolution, Dan.

563
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Anyway, this clip, I thought,

564
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,400
was a really good instance to illustrate

565
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,640
why you can't take vaccine-related stories seriously

566
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,960
when they come from Alex.

567
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,760
No matter what the reality of the story is,

568
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,840
Alex is always going to take the story

569
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
about the possibility of danger,

570
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
and he's gonna report that as definitive,

571
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,320
and then he's gonna exaggerate it out,

572
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,760
and it's like, oh, it's been proven.

573
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,160
They've shown it, you know?

574
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,800
And it's the same thing that he does

575
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,680
with the COVID-19 vaccine stories in the present day.

576
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,200
This behavior is consistent,

577
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,840
because he is staunchly opposed to vaccines,

578
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,640
not based on the science of it.

579
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,920
Absolutely, and you can argue,

580
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,440
and the problem with it is that the argument of like,

581
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,360
look, 20 years ago, this asshole was saying the same lies

582
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,280
about different vaccines,

583
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,440
and you can see that those didn't come true,

584
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
so why would you believe him now?

585
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,960
And the argument will always be like,

586
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,400
yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's a Black Swan event, you know?

587
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,240
Sure, this one was a fake.

588
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,200
They wanna make you comfortable with their vaccines

589
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,800
until they do it, they wanna lull you into,

590
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,600
and you're like, fine, we'll never win.

591
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,440
No. That's it.

592
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
You can't really beat back that thinking.

593
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,080
No, no.

594
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,440
And I think that if you are able to get yourself

595
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,320
to a point where you recognize that like,

596
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,320
oh, he does do this over and over and over again,

597
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,280
regardless of the circumstances,

598
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,120
you have to start to ask yourself why,

599
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,600
and what is it exactly that is the opposition to vaccines?

600
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,520
What is that about?

601
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,360
Right.

602
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,200
And I think you could probably come up

603
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
with a couple of possibilities.

604
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,320
One is a sort of inclination towards divine science.

605
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,840
Sure, sure.

606
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,920
I guess the idea of medical intervention is against God.

607
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,760
Right.

608
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,800
And I'm not sure if I believe that Alex is there,

609
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,280
because he's gotten surgery.

610
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,120
Yeah.

611
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,960
You know?

612
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
Yeah, no, but it is that kind of like,

613
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,040
when it happens to someone else,

614
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,600
it's very much the will of God.

615
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
And when it happens to you,

616
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,000
the will of God is to save yourself.

617
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
You know, the Lord helps those who help themselves.

618
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,800
But when other people die, it's because it was their time.

619
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,160
It was their time to go, Dan.

620
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,280
You can't deny them that.

621
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,120
Sure.

622
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm saying that's a slightly unsatisfying explanation

623
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,280
for Alex.

624
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,200
The other one that I come up with is the notion

625
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,960
and understanding that like vaccines

626
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,960
have drastically improved the lives of poor people

627
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,800
and people in developing countries around the world.

628
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,920
And I don't know, a whole lot of Alex's policy positions

629
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,920
seem to be about not doing that, cutting off foreign aid.

630
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,880
Those sorts of things are things that seem to be

631
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,120
kind of overlap of a lot of his beliefs.

632
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,960
Yeah.

633
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,680
I don't know if that's where the opposition comes from,

634
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,640
but it certainly makes more sense

635
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
than legitimate scientific concerns.

636
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,480
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,360
When you think about when typhoid spread

638
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,280
through wealthy neighborhoods,

639
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,880
there was far less like anti-medicine spread around

640
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,720
about that shit.

641
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
It was very much everybody needs to clean their hands.

642
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,160
Everybody needs to stay safe.

643
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,440
You know, that kind of thing.

644
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,280
Yeah.

645
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,160
So Alex gives a little bit of a spiel

646
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,400
at the beginning of this episode.

647
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,240
And he talks about like, you know, hey man,

648
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,000
sometimes the world doesn't make sense.

649
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,720
And that's when you need a little bit of Infowars.

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
That's true.

651
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,080
Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.

652
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,680
The websites are infowars.com, infowars.net,

653
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,480
and prisonplanet.com.

654
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,160
If the world doesn't make sense to you,

655
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,040
if you wonder why you keep losing your liberties

656
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,360
and more and more factories are shutting down

657
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,480
and why the borders are still wide open,

658
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,480
as the government tells you to give up liberty for security,

659
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,800
you'll find the answers right here.

660
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,880
You wonder why our government creates Saddam Hussein's

661
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,280
and creates bin Laden's and arms North Korea's

662
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,520
and then engages the American people

663
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,120
in these costly and dangerous wars.

664
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,240
You'll find the answers right here.

665
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,360
You're wondering why police are running checkpoints

666
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,800
and why there's cameras everywhere

667
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
and why your children are being trained

668
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,920
how to turn you in for owning guns

669
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,240
when your guns aren't even illegal.

670
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,000
You'll find the answers right here on this show.

671
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,240
Is it the devil?

672
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,400
It's gotta be the devil.

673
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,240
Is it the devil?

674
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
Is it secretly the devil?

675
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,760
It's gotta be something like that.

676
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
I'm confused.

677
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,560
I mean, I understand.

678
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,760
No, I think we were all wondering that.

679
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,120
Those are correct wonders.

680
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,960
Sure.

681
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,120
There's some of them are more valid than others.

682
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,960
True.

683
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,080
Yeah, certainly there are.

684
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,480
Hey, it is confusing.

685
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,280
Militarization of police is confusing.

686
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,760
It's wrong.

687
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,880
What's going on here?

688
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,160
Why is this happening?

689
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,880
I don't get answers from Infowars.

690
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,720
No.

691
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,880
And knowing what he turns into

692
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,560
and that the devil is actually behind the globalists,

693
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,400
I wonder if he's just not telling the audience

694
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,920
at this point that this is secretly

695
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
just a big religious campaign.

696
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,640
Is this part of God's plan for him in fighting the devil

697
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,720
to lie to these people early on in his career

698
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,040
so he can kind of like slowly trick them

699
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,760
into being the holy warriors that God needs?

700
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,600
Right.

701
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,000
A saint isn't going to bring these sinners in.

702
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,840
Exactly.

703
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,680
That kind of idea.

704
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,640
That might've been a quote from Red Dead Redemption.

706
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,600
God was talking to Saul

707
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,480
when Saul was like nine or 10 in his dreams.

708
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,320
And he was like, listen,

709
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,480
you got to lie to everybody right up until the good time.

710
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,320
Yeah, I don't know.

711
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,160
I don't know.

712
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,200
It's really strange to me.

713
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,760
And like I've said in these 2003 episodes,

714
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,560
one of the things that I'm trying to keep my eye on

715
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,400
is this idea of how much of the devil

716
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,800
does he think he's fighting the devil in 2003?

717
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Right, right, right.

718
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,800
And you know, if he does, then that clip is abusive.

719
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,960
And if he doesn't, then his worldview doesn't make sense.

720
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,000
I would appreciate it if that clue, yeah.

721
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So Alex has got a headline that's not a headline.

722
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,160
Coming up in the next hour,

723
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,240
Eugene police illegally raid homes

724
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,080
with a tank prompts federal lawsuit.

725
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,760
Eugene police illegally raid homes with a tank

726
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,400
prompts federal lawsuit.

727
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,360
And wild stuff comes out of Oregon,

728
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,320
but it's happening all over the country.

729
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,760
This headline that Alex is reading

730
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,200
is not from a news story or any kind of journalistic source.

731
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,040
It's actually the title of a press release

732
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,480
that was put out by the office of Lauren Regan,

733
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,880
the lawyer representing the people

734
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,320
who were the subject of this raid.

735
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Yeah.

736
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,560
I can understand how this is still a source of information

737
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,080
and it's entirely possible that a lawyer's press release

738
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,680
could have stuff worth conveying,

739
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,520
but it seems like something that shouldn't be treated

740
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,920
as the same as an article in an actual news outlet.

741
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,240
Incidentally, this case resulted in the city of Eugene

742
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,800
paying one couple $30,000 and another $92,000

743
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,040
to settle their cases,

744
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,480
which claimed unreasonable search and seizure,

745
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,600
excessive use of force, assault, and false imprisonment.

746
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,120
The police contended that it was an instance

747
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,560
of them having bad information

748
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,600
and believing that they were raiding a drug house,

749
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,680
whereas the couples believed

750
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
that the police got a warrant by lying.

751
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,520
Whatever the case, it's not good policing.

752
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,560
And even if the intel had all been good,

753
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,360
seems like their actions would have been excessive

754
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,800
for a drug raid.

755
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,120
Anyway, the point here is that in terms of the big picture,

756
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,080
that this kind of police action is wrong,

757
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,200
Alex and I are in complete agreement.

758
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,040
Not hard.

759
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,320
I still don't support how he pushes the message though,

760
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,880
however, given that he's presenting this biased information

761
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,000
from the lawyers of people involved in the story

762
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,680
as a neutral headline.

763
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,840
It's not necessarily the way you would wanna go

764
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,840
about framing your case,

765
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
even if your case is something that I agree with.

766
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

767
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,840
I mean, it would be hard to be on the wrong side

768
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,720
of strangers destroy your home for no good reason

769
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,240
and face no punishment for it.

770
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,080
Sure, sure.

771
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,480
You know, like that seems obvious.

772
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,360
Yeah, and Alex spends a large portion of this episode

773
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,360
talking about this couple's houses that were searched

774
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
and they were, you know, held.

775
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
Right.

776
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,840
And it does

777
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,560
become hard to take seriously.

778
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah.

779
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,120
Knowing the present.

780
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,720
Like I do care for these people

781
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,640
who had this police intervention in their lives

782
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,720
unnecessarily and they were treated poorly.

783
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,520
I just don't consider Alex a legitimate person

784
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,640
to make those points.

785
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,480
Absolutely.

786
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,320
Anymore.

787
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,160
Yeah.

788
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,000
Anyway.

789
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,360
That is also a really good question about the,

790
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,920
I mean, as far as the fighting the devil

791
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,880
in the past and the present goes,

792
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,240
another like question that that raises is,

793
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,240
is this guy that guy or does he change into this guy?

794
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,120
And what does that mean?

795
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,160
You know, like, are there,

796
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,880
is it possible that Alex and I

797
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,240
could have had a conversation in 2003

798
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,440
that wouldn't have wound up with me

799
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,040
trying to throw something into his face?

800
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,880
Probably, I bet it is.

801
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,720
I bet you would.

802
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
You might not really enjoy it all that much.

803
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,560
Right.

804
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,400
But yeah.

805
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,520
And is that because he's lying to me

806
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,920
or is that because he was a different person?

807
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,760
Yeah.

808
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,720
And does that raise the possibility

809
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,840
that I could eventually change into this very monster?

810
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,280
That's actually why we're doing this.

811
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
Isn't this terrifying?

812
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,800
It's truly a nightmare.

813
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,560
That's really the thing

814
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,400
that this is all about is like-

815
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,120
But what do we turn into?

816
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,440
Yes.

817
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,120
Looking at this and being like,

818
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,680
what do we have to be afraid of?

819
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,800
What are the signs?

820
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,920
What's the, yeah, yeah.

821
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,160
Can we get, somebody get a whiteboard up

822
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,480
with a checklist. This is a cautionary thing.

823
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,320
Yes, absolutely.

824
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,400
So Alex starts to read this article

825
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,080
and it's interesting that you bring up this,

826
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,400
the differences between present

827
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,720
and like is this the same person?

828
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,560
Sure.

829
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,840
Because he starts to bring up this article

830
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,920
and you can see in this clip,

831
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,440
similarities and differences.

832
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,200
Like, okay, one of the big similarities,

833
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,080
he starts reading and everything he reads,

834
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,000
he editorializes on.

835
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,840
Sure, sure.

836
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,640
He adds a whole bunch of stuff

837
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,360
that's not in the article to the article.

838
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,240
But a big difference,

839
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,840
he says that this was written by a lawyer.

840
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,760
He doesn't clarify that it's the lawyer

841
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,080
of the people who were in the story.

842
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,920
Sure.

843
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,200
But he does give a clarification

844
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,840
that I didn't expect from him.

845
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,960
Let me just read part of this powerful article

846
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,240
and we're gonna talk to the lawyer

847
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
who wrote the story

848
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,280
and got some of the other mainstream articles about it.

849
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,920
Lauren Regan,

850
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,640
Eugene police illegally raid homes

851
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
with tank prompts federal lawsuit.

852
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,520
And in the pre-dawn of October 17, 2002,

853
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,000
approximately 50 police officers

854
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,840
that see this every day

855
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,400
from multiple police agencies

856
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,240
that are federalized

857
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,040
under multi-jurisdictional task force,

858
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,600
swarmed residential neighborhood,

859
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,720
we saw this in Austin.

860
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,600
You can hear the difference in his voice

861
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,040
when he's editorializing.

862
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,720
Yup, yup.

863
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,840
That's, it's,

864
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,920
it's almost courteous in a way.

865
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,360
You can feel him almost telling you

866
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,160
when he's not.

867
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,560
There is a slight bit of that,

868
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,480
but it's still like,

869
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,200
okay, I'm gonna set out to read this article

870
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,040
then I'm gonna interrupt myself constantly

871
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,400
with stuff that's not in the article.

872
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,240
No, there's definitely that.

873
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,080
It's a little bit dicey,

874
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,080
but yeah, it's slightly more responsible feeling

875
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,240
because if you are actively listening,

876
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,520
you can tell when it's like,

877
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,880
these are the words of Alex.

878
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,720
Right.

879
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,560
This is his reading voice.

880
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,400
Right.

881
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,240
And I don't know.

882
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,880
And you know why that's a more compelling show

883
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,160
than just reading the news

884
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
because this is very similar

885
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,080
to how some asshole might be reading an article

886
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,960
as he's reading it.

887
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,760
You know, like if I'm reading a dumb article,

888
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,000
sometimes I'll read a sentence

889
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,280
and be like, these motherfuckers are stupid.

890
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,520
And then I'll read the next sentence.

891
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,200
You know, this is an engaging way

892
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,560
of almost reading the news with your buddy.

893
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,040
I don't fully disagree.

894
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

895
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,520
So Alex gets to talking about other places

896
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,920
that have been raided.

897
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,800
Now it's raiding neighborhoods.

898
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,160
In a town in Missouri two years ago,

899
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,000
AP headline, town searched in drug raid.

900
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,000
Folks, this is as bad as it gets.

901
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
This was a case from early 2002

902
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,320
where a 27 month long investigation

903
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,520
into an international gun and drug smuggling operation

904
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,400
culminated in arrests in a town called Carthage in Missouri.

905
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,480
This is a real headline from an AP story,

906
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,680
but the use of the words town searched

907
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,600
isn't meant to be taken completely literally.

908
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,120
The multi-agency task force

909
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,040
that was working on this extended operation

910
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,440
set up some checkpoints to make sure

911
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,760
the subjects of their investigation couldn't flee,

912
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,400
and then they made their arrests.

913
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,360
Again, I'm not justifying this policing necessarily.

914
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,520
I'm just saying that the image that Alex wants to create

915
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,360
of cops kicking in every door in this town in Missouri,

916
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,160
looking for wrongdoing to jam someone up,

917
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,600
that's not accurate.

918
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,640
No, I mean admittedly- That's the image he wants to create

919
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
and it's not real.

920
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,920
Admittedly, when they marched those elephants

921
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,960
across the Rockies to get there,

922
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,680
I felt like that might've been a terrible idea,

923
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,240
but Carthage.

924
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,360
Right, I got it. Carthage, Dan.

925
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,320
I got it. Carthage, because of-

926
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,480
I was trying to think of a way

927
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,440
if there was a like a Fitzcarraldo joke I could make.

928
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,840
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

929
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,440
The elephants and the carrying a boat.

930
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,600
Sure, sure, that could've-

931
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,000
It wasn't worth it. I feel like my Hannibal reference

932
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,440
was better than you gave it credit for it.

933
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,000
It was, but I think I probably would've enjoyed it more

934
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,200
if I wasn't trying to make a Fitzcarraldo joke and failing.

935
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,320
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,520
We were working at cross purposes on that riff.

937
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
Yeah. So I can see that.

938
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,760
I apologize, I should be there for you more.

939
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,600
That was on me.

940
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,960
Anyway, the point of this though

941
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,360
is that Alex is completely just fudging this.

942
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,200
Yeah, yeah.

943
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,760
But it's a good headline for him, meh.

944
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,640
Anyway, he gets to talking to this lawyer

945
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,600
and I guess if you put the pieces together yourself,

946
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,080
you can kind of make sense of the fact

947
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,400
that this isn't a headline.

948
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,000
This is, the press release word is never used,

949
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
but you can put the pieces together

950
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,200
that this is a lawyer representing the people.

951
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,440
Sure, sure, sure.

952
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,000
A not unbiased actor in this circumstance, if you will.

953
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,800
Yeah, and I think that this lawyer

954
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,640
seems fairly straight up.

955
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,200
I think she's distracted and maybe a little bit bemused

956
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,840
by Alex's constant-

957
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,960
Right.

958
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
detractions.

959
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,640
That her name was Roberta Barnes gave me some pause,

960
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,120
but once I found out there was no relation,

961
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,520
I felt more comfortable.

962
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,760
So Alex knows how to arrest people.

963
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,600
You should know that.

964
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,440
Okay.

965
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,320
And how you arrest somebody is you park down the street

966
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,120
when the perp leaves in the morning,

967
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,960
you do a little work, you surveil them for a couple of days.

968
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,600
When they go to work, you pull them over,

969
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,880
you pull them out of the car,

970
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,400
you take them back to the house with a warrant,

971
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,600
you go in the house, nobody gets hurt.

972
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,960
But see, that's not fun to suit up at 3 a.m.

973
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,000
in black uniforms and feel all tough

974
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,320
and go rumbling down the road in your tank.

975
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,920
These are all wannabes who probably

976
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,560
washed out in the special forces.

977
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,040
Now they get to pick on women.

978
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,880
Right.

979
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,480
I mean, this show is a really abusive, psychotic nature

980
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,920
to drag a naked woman outside with a black hood on.

981
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,760
Go ahead.

982
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,480
So I don't, you can tell kind of there

983
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
that she's trying to respond to stuff.

984
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,080
She's trying to say anything edgewise, yes, yes.

985
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,480
That kind of is how I would characterize the interview.

986
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,600
It's not hostile by any stretch.

987
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,560
She has a point, I don't know if she necessarily

988
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,760
knows who Alex is.

989
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,480
And Alex certainly isn't as toxic an entity in 2003

990
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,320
as he is in the present.

991
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
Right, right, right.

992
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
You might not think twice about an invitation

993
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,160
to come and talk about this case

994
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,880
that you're passionate about

995
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,280
and you want to get attention for.

996
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,920
And you don't know going in that it is going to be

997
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,640
a life or death struggle to finish a sentence.

998
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,680
You didn't know that.

999
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,800
And you don't know that Alex is going to be constantly

1000
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,240
trying to drive the image of a naked woman

1001
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,520
being dragged out of her house to his audience

1002
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,200
because that's visceral for them.

1003
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,320
Correct, yeah.

1004
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,080
Whereas you maybe want to talk about.

1005
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,120
I have things to say.

1006
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,160
You want to talk about rights.

1007
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,000
You want to talk about infringement of citizen civil rights.

1008
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,840
Totally.

1009
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,680
Yep.

1010
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,200
So anyway, the interview is not that great

1011
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,920
or all that interesting, especially I think partially

1012
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,360
because I mean, I agree with Alex.

1013
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,920
I don't agree with his tactics.

1014
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Sure, sure.

1015
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,720
I don't agree with him sensationalizing the story.

1016
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,560
Right.

1017
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,080
But in terms, like I looked at the story in normal outlets

1018
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,480
and the conclusion of the police shouldn't have done this.

1019
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,320
Yeah, it's not hard.

1020
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,160
I agree.

1021
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1022
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,240
And I know because we're in the future

1023
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,400
that the police and the city of Eugene

1024
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,520
did pay out a settlement.

1025
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,360
Yeah.

1026
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,920
And that doesn't take away whatever these people experience

1027
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,840
but it certainly is some sign.

1028
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,440
No, no five figures is restitution for the cops

1029
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,920
destroying your home, you know, and your sense of safety

1030
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,720
forever.

1031
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Yeah, there's going to be psychological things

1032
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,920
that remain.

1033
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,840
Yeah, absolutely.

1034
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,040
You know, there's a modicum of justice in a settlement.

1035
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,360
Sure, sure.

1036
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,240
And no one died.

1037
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,960
So that's great.

1038
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,440
No one died, yeah.

1039
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,480
Anyway, the interview ends and Alex says this

1040
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,680
and I just rolled my eyes.

1041
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,320
All right, the third hour will be an absolute news overload

1042
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,640
blitz.

1043
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,840
I've got 50 articles I haven't gotten to.

1044
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,000
I will get to them.

1045
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,440
I will get to your calls.

1046
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,160
1-800-259-9231.

1047
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,040
He's the same guy.

1048
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,640
Oh boy, oh boy.

1049
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,560
He's setting himself up for failure.

1050
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Like if he plans to get to 50 stories plus calls in one hour,

1051
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,360
that's just not possible.

1052
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,760
If you factor in commercials, he's

1053
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,400
giving himself like 20 seconds per story.

1054
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,640
That's not even enough to get through the headlines.

1055
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,760
He should be more realistic about what he can and can't

1056
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,680
cover in the time he has and then focus

1057
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,480
on what he has the time to cover.

1058
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,960
Sure.

1059
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,880
It would make for better content.

1060
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,440
Sure.

1061
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,680
It wouldn't be so dumb.

1062
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,880
It does make it, I don't know, what would I say?

1063
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,560
It does make it far more reasonable to just ignore

1064
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,840
that in the present, though.

1065
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,440
You know, it's like a long running joke on a sitcom.

1066
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,920
Like a Simpsons bit, it's been going on for 30 years.

1067
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,480
What are you going to complain now?

1068
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,040
If Alex says he's going to get to the stories

1069
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,960
and you've listened in 2003, you know damn well

1070
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,800
he's not going to get to the story.

1071
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,960
So who gives a shit, you know?

1072
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,040
Because for me, I'm looking at this like Dr. House.

1073
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,400
Sure.

1074
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,000
You know what I'm saying?

1075
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,760
Sure, sure.

1076
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,840
In the present day, Alex has this list of symptoms, right?

1077
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,600
Right, right.

1078
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,400
And we go back to 2003, and he's got the same symptom.

1079
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,480
It's like, all right, that's not part of the condition.

1080
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,280
That's not part of the disease, yes.

1081
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,800
I got you.

1082
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,600
I got you.

1083
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm playing diagnostic games here.

1084
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,120
Understood.

1085
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,520
Cough is not part of it.

1086
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,080
Understood.

1087
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,040
So Alex has trouble with quotes, and it extends

1088
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,160
far beyond Thomas Jefferson.

1089
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,120
The globalists' mind controllers say

1090
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,880
that perception is reality.

1091
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,840
I am mental.

1092
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,520
They create the perception that the military and the police

1093
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,400
on our streets is good, when if you investigate,

1094
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,640
you'll find out it's bad.

1095
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,640
So Alex saying that, you know, claiming

1096
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,840
that the globalists use that quote,

1097
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,280
perception is reality, that's interesting,

1098
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,480
because that's a quote most famously attributed

1099
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,840
to Republican strategist Lee Atwater.

1100
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,320
Yeah.

1101
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,360
A man notable for his intense use of racism

1102
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,440
as a political tool.

1103
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,880
Oh, yeah.

1104
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Name one big strategy that he helped institute.

1105
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,400
It's on the compass.

1106
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,120
Also, he's associated with the Willie Horton ad.

1107
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,720
Sure, sure.

1108
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,320
Also, he's pretty notable that in 1984,

1109
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,840
he became a senior partner at Black Manafort Stone

1110
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,640
and Kelly, the consulting firm run

1111
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,040
by Alex's future good buddy Roger Stone.

1112
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,520
Wow.

1113
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Perception is reality.

1114
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,960
Perception is reality.

1115
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,080
Woo.

1116
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,720
Man, Jesus.

1117
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,960
Yep.

1118
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,560
1984, good old Roger Stone looking to his left,

1119
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,440
seeing Lee Atwater thinking, I got

1120
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,040
a bright future in front of me.

1121
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,120
Paul, we're going to do great things.

1122
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,520
You and I definitely aren't going

1123
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,160
to get charged with crimes in 36 years.

1124
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,200
Oh, boy, we're definitely not laying the groundwork

1125
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,840
for all the crimes we're going to do.

1126
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
Yep.

1127
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,360
So this was interesting to me.

1128
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,840
Sure.

1129
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,400
I'm going to stop saying interesting.

1130
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,800
But this was weird.

1131
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,480
Fascinating.

1132
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,000
Sure.

1133
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,720
OK.

1134
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,480
Alex has an intense news blitz he needs to get through.

1135
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,920
Yes, we're in a full hour of news blitz.

1136
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,800
I forgot about that.

1137
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,480
Listen to this.

1138
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,160
OK.

1139
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,840
And I'm sad for our troops that are being

1140
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,320
used for the new world order and are

1141
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,080
being injected with deadly vaccines,

1142
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,360
are being brought back here and turned

1143
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,760
into militarized police.

1144
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,600
We need to remember what America is about.

1145
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,040
What makes America America is because it was a free country.

1146
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,880
Now we're beginning to lose that.

1147
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,280
We're seeing the shift rapidly.

1148
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,760
And patriots everywhere need to be veterans

1149
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
in the second American revolution,

1150
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,880
or I should say, restoration.

1151
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,400
For all the veterans that really gave all,

1152
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,760
we've had requests for this song.

1153
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,720
We'll air it.

1154
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,800
Then I'll come back and talk to John in Indiana,

1155
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,200
or John in Missouri, and others that are patiently holding.

1156
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,200
And I'll launch into a bunch of geopolitical news

1157
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,160
and information.

1158
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,240
So again, stay with us.

1159
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,840
I think this song says it all.

1160
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,640
It's not sappy.

1161
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,960
A lot of people die to defend liberty.

1162
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,880
That's what that flag symbolizes, is our republic,

1163
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,160
not a unit of a world empire.

1164
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,200
And then Alex plays the entire song of Billy Ray Cyrus'

1165
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,080
Sun Gable.

1166
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,240
I was worried it was going to be what I heard it being.

1167
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,600
And then it was that.

1168
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,080
And now I'm unhappy.

1169
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,400
I would give anything to go back to that moment in time

1170
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,720
and tell Alex about Miley.

1171
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,200
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

1172
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,960
Oh my god, it's so weird.

1173
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,280
It's so weird.

1174
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,520
He plays a full song as like a shout out to the troops.

1175
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,240
And he doesn't sing along with it or editorialize over it?

1176
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,040
He just leaves.

1177
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,760
Oh.

1178
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,240
Yeah.

1179
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,040
Well, you know, he couldn't eat a sandwich as easily back then.

1180
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
That's probably true.

1181
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,080
Yeah, that was bizarre.

1182
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,840
The format is very strange.

1183
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,880
Yeah, that's very weird.

1184
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,400
That makes me feel deeply uncomfortable.

1185
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,960
A lot of people have been wanting me to play Billy Cyrus.

1186
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,760
No, no, no.

1187
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,520
A lot of people have been wanting me to play Billy Cyrus.

1188
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,600
And I say to them, no, again.

1189
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,840
From everything I understand about Alex's format,

1190
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,640
song requests are not right.

1191
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,920
You can request songs.

1192
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,200
He doesn't play songs.

1193
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,920
No, he's not a song player.

1194
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,560
No.

1195
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,360
What a weird, yeah, OK.

1196
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,160
Very strange.

1197
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,640
All right.

1198
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,560
So the news blitz doesn't really happen.

1199
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,520
But Alex does take some calls.

1200
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,760
And one guy, this guy is interesting.

1201
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,080
He seems to believe that spam messages.

1202
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,720
Oh.

1203
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,320
Right?

1204
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,400
Yeah, not the food.

1205
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,360
Spam messages need to be clearly delineated as something

1206
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,960
with a commercial purpose.

1207
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,080
Because he got accused of spamming somebody.

1208
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,680
And he was just trying to harass them.

1209
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,120
OK, two things if I can get to them.

1210
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,240
One is the supremacy clause in the Constitution.

1211
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,760
And the other is this law of attempted legislation to make

1212
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,760
spam a felony on the internet.

1213
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,400
I tried to.

1214
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,000
Spam is commercial.

1215
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,280
It's got to be defined as commercial gain

1216
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,840
and that kind of stuff, not forcing

1217
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,800
complicit media to see the pictures.

1218
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,560
Well, sir, the White Paper Doctor Two was written.

1219
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,320
If your email goes to somebody wrong,

1220
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,280
you get live in prison in a labor camp, OK?

1221
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,760
Right.

1222
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,240
What?

1223
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
I was accused of spamming people many times

1224
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,400
right after 9-11, Iraqi war.

1225
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,800
They leave their email addresses in the newspaper articles.

1226
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,600
And one guy, he shifts his email address

1227
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,080
so he doesn't have to receive these

1228
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,720
because he knows that he would be guilty of mispresient

1229
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,120
if he's alerted to the treason that's going on.

1230
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,960
Yeah, so apparently this guy goes and finds

1231
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,360
email addresses in newspapers and then harasses the people.

1232
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,600
He's worried about a law against spam.

1233
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,960
Yeah.

1234
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,840
Yeah.

1235
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,760
That's a fundamental misunderstanding

1236
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,880
of all of the problems with what you're doing.

1237
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,520
You bet.

1238
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,040
You bet.

1239
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,120
But it's fun.

1240
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,960
I can't believe you got the point that wrong.

1241
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,480
Yeah.

1242
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,120
It's a fun call, though, because you

1243
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,080
can see the dynamics that are going on.

1244
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,360
And like, I don't know, that sounds like an Alex Jones

1245
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,000
listener to me.

1246
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,440
They're trying to make a law making it illegal for me

1247
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,720
to send chain emails to my family.

1248
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,960
And that's going to really get in the way of me

1249
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,440
kneecapping this reporter over here.

1250
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,000
So we've got to stop this chain email law.

1251
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,200
It is not spam when I email a journalist 100 times in a day

1252
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,400
and tell him he's going to go to jail for treason.

1253
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
It's not spam.

1254
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
I'm not a bot.

1255
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,160
I'm an asshole.

1256
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,360
I sent every one of those messages by hand.

1257
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,520
I clicked the button.

1258
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,880
I'm proud of being an asshole.

1259
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,520
So Alex has one more caller that we're

1260
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
going to hear a little bit of.

1261
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,120
This person's talking about, so you've

1262
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,040
got the new money coming in, the new bills in the US.

1263
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,840
And a lot of people have a lot of theories about that.

1264
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,920
And this caller believes.

1265
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,960
We'll never have Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.

1266
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,640
This caller believes that there's like metal strips

1267
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,800
and stuff in the money.

1268
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,880
Sure, sure.

1269
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,440
If you hold on to the money for more than a month,

1270
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,760
it'll be able to time that.

1271
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,280
I like this.

1272
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,520
This money will know when it's changed hands.

1273
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,320
This is a good conspiracy.

1274
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,120
I like this.

1275
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,120
And if you hold on to it too long, it'll auto-tax.

1276
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,880
Oh, no.

1277
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,880
Real quick, what that man was talking about on the money,

1278
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,760
this was on a program the other day.

1279
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,200
One of the things with the money,

1280
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,880
with the strip when you get it, if you don't pass it

1281
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,320
on within a month, you'll be taxed on it.

1282
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,120
Oh, it'll be valued, I reported that three years ago,

1283
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,280
from the Federal Reserve Board of Virginia's website.

1284
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,120
A real good person to have on would

1285
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,880
be Donald McIlvaney, intelligence advisor.

1286
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,960
If you could get him on and interview him.

1287
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,960
He's very well versed on all of this.

1288
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,080
I have no idea how the timer of a month

1289
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,040
would start.

1290
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,000
I love it.

1291
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,880
If I were to buy something with a bill, this is ridiculous.

1292
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,520
I like it.

1293
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,440
Anyway, I don't know anything about this Donald McIlvaney

1294
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,640
guy, but I did look into him a little bit.

1295
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,440
And I did find that his main website is just

1296
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,080
a portal to a gold sales outlet.

1297
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,800
How's he doing?

1298
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,400
I don't know.

1299
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,440
Oh, so he's saying that maybe you shouldn't get paper money,

1300
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,000
and instead you should get gold.

1301
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,160
So then he, of course, sells gold.

1302
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,200
That's very strange how that works.

1303
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,200
It's so strange.

1304
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,840
It's almost like these people with these completely nutty

1305
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,200
conspiracy theories about paper money

1306
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,600
always tend to sell gold.

1307
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,000
It's super weird.

1308
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,760
Super weird how people who hate the Fed and paper currency

1309
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,440
love and also sell and profit off of gold.

1310
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,280
They have a weird financial motivation.

1311
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,240
Super strange.

1312
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,080
So we go to the ninth.

1313
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,880
OK.

1314
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,000
And I didn't find that episode all that satisfying.

1315
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,440
A lot of it was about talking to that lawyer

1316
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,320
and just kind of spinning his wheels.

1317
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,360
Sure.

1318
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,960
Then I got in on the ninth, and I found myself very excited.

1319
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,040
Is that the right word?

1320
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,960
Interesting.

1321
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,280
Coming up in about, I don't know, 16, 17 minutes,

1322
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,480
we'll be joined by Jeff Singer and Dave Moore, who

1323
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,200
are on a local country FM in Colorado Springs.

1324
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,320
We're on, of course, on KWYD 1580 in Colorado Springs.

1325
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,320
But we're going to have them on because, of course,

1326
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,240
you heard last week they got suspended

1327
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,080
for criticizing the Bixie Chicks.

1328
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,960
And maybe you heard on the news that they got

1329
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,280
suspended for playing them.

1330
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,920
But we'll get to the bottom of it.

1331
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,400
Alex just.

1332
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,440
Oh, would you say they got canceled, if you will?

1333
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,200
Alex just misspoke there, and he tried

1334
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,320
to cover it by insinuating that the media had gotten

1335
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,240
this story wrong by making you think that the two DJs got

1336
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,800
in trouble for playing Dixie Chicks

1337
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,440
when maybe they got in trouble for criticizing them.

1338
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,560
Only Alex can get to the bottom of it when he misspeaks.

1339
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,800
How could you know?

1340
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,560
So these two guys worked for KKCS 102 FM in Colorado Springs.

1341
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,220
Sure.

1342
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,160
It's a station.

1343
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,680
They had to put in place a boycott

1344
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,120
on playing the Dixie Chicks songs

1345
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,440
after Natalie Maines had some comments at a concert

1346
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
that were seen as being anti-troop when she said

1347
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,560
that she was ashamed that President Bush was

1348
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,440
from the same state as her in Texas.

1349
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,880
Good for the Dixie Chicks for being ahead of their time,

1350
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,680
you know?

1351
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,560
Now we're all ashamed of the United States,

1352
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,120
but they really got there first.

1353
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,920
Obviously, this was an instance of everyone losing the damn

1354
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,680
mind and the right wing shitheads doing

1355
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,120
a dog pile on the Dixie Chicks.

1356
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,000
But some of the details of the story,

1357
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,100
particularly about this DJ situation,

1358
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,880
might not be what you remember.

1359
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,680
OK, is this a clown sending a, what's it, poison again?

1360
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,040
No, no, this isn't a ricin.

1361
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,800
This isn't a ricin situation.

1362
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,200
Dueling Elvis in person winners?

1363
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,660
I was going to say, this isn't that?

1364
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,160
Not quite.

1365
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,680
Oh, OK.

1366
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,680
So in terms of these actual two DJs,

1367
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,720
the story that I remembered was that they dared

1368
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,640
to play a couple songs from the Dixie Chicks,

1369
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,060
and that was enough to get them in trouble.

1370
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:50,960
Sure.

1371
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,640
An article from the Times Herald Record has some other details.

1372
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,760
Quote, KKCS had instituted a ban on the Dixie Chicks, who

1373
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,720
at the time had two songs on the charts.

1374
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,480
But two DJs at the station, Dave Moore and Jeff Singer,

1375
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,960
decided that two months was punishment enough.

1376
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,220
They broke the ban.

1377
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,360
At 6.15 AM on Monday, May 5, 2003,

1378
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,560
they locked themselves in the DJ booth.

1379
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,280
They started with long time gone,

1380
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,040
and they didn't stop playing Dixie Chicks tunes until noon.

1381
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,560
Was Adam Sandler and Brendan Fazier there?

1382
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,240
What in God's name happened?

1383
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,600
Yeah, I didn't remember that was part of the story.

1384
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,080
I don't remember airheads being real life.

1385
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,040
Yeah, even though I agree with the point of what they're

1386
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,280
doing, I totally understand that that's

1387
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,960
a brazen act of insubordination.

1388
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,240
Listen, you guys are heroes, but we can't just

1389
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,880
not do anything about this.

1390
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,600
Ultimately, what happened is that the station manager, Jerry

1391
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,040
Grant, gave the two a choice to either continue playing

1392
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,520
Dixie Chicks songs and get fired or stop, unlock the studio,

1393
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,200
and be suspended for a few days.

1394
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,360
And they chose to end the occupation of the station.

1395
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,400
So courageous.

1396
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,060
I have a huge problem with everything

1397
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,840
surrounding this story, but I'm not

1398
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,880
sure I disagree with these two DJs getting

1399
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,960
a slap on the wrist for essentially, like you said,

1400
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,080
living the movie airheads.

1401
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,640
Yeah, yeah, I mean, come on.

1402
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,760
You can't live the movie.

1403
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,440
You can't live the movie airheads.

1404
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
You just can't do it.

1405
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,560
It's like what they did.

1406
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,240
Even in the movie airheads, they couldn't

1407
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,440
live the movie airheads.

1408
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,600
What they did was for a good cause, sort of,

1409
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,840
as we learn later.

1410
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,520
And I support the statement of playing their music.

1411
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,040
Censorship is dumb no matter what.

1412
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,200
Absolutely.

1413
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,500
And so I wouldn't want them to be punished too harshly,

1414
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,560
but you can't lock yourself in a radio booth

1415
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,360
and pirate the transmission and expect nothing to happen.

1416
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,560
There is that.

1417
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,040
There is that.

1418
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,920
If I were your boss.

1419
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,640
But the protest is there's consequences.

1420
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,400
I think that is actually a pretty restrained response

1421
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,520
from the boss.

1422
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,040
Couple days suspension, whatever.

1423
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,480
Almost wise too.

1424
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,260
Because if he'd overreacted, everybody

1425
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,680
would have turned it into a cause.

1426
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,100
But giving them a slap on the wrist

1427
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,160
is almost insulting to them.

1428
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,480
Like, your protest was worth nothing more

1429
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,760
than take a day off.

1430
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,360
And from some of the articles that I found,

1431
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,720
it seems like Grant, the station manager guy, was like, yeah,

1432
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,280
we were getting ready to start playing their music again

1433
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,600
anyway, but we wanted to do it on our terms.

1434
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,640
And this wasn't the way we wanted to do it.

1435
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,720
Right, right, right.

1436
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,080
You guys stole our thunder.

1437
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,240
I could see how this would be like, eh, you know what?

1438
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,160
It's ultimately the audience and the people.

1439
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,560
It's been two months.

1440
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,200
The audience is kind of over it.

1441
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,120
The rage cycle has run its course.

1442
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,560
We got it.

1443
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,360
Freedom fries.

1444
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,160
Let's move on.

1445
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:22,840
It's stupid.

1446
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,880
And so the station's getting ready to be like,

1447
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,000
let's go back to normal.

1448
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,640
Let's just pretend this is happening.

1449
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,520
Landslide.

1450
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,480
People like that song.

1451
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,480
Yeah, everybody's fine.

1452
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,680
Everybody's fine.

1453
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,400
Yeah.

1454
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,680
And these guys just jump the gun.

1455
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,840
Yeah, which is also interesting, and maybe probably

1456
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,400
for the best, I bet they got a shit ton of free press

1457
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,560
out of that.

1458
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,760
He even suspended them, and then they came back,

1459
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,400
and everybody was like, yeah, you guys are back on that.

1460
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:45,960
I don't know.

1461
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,920
I don't know if you remember those dudes' names.

1462
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,520
Oh, no.

1463
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,440
They're titans of the industry now.

1464
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,040
I just said their names.

1465
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,960
You don't remember them.

1466
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,480
Dave Grohl.

1467
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,120
I mean, it's a story that you kind of remember in as much as

1468
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,000
I do remember that there were some DJs who got in trouble

1469
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
for playing Dixie Chicks.

1470
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,840
Sure, sure.

1471
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,720
I don't remember those details.

1472
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,080
I don't remember their names.

1473
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,680
No.

1474
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,240
I don't think that they're Kevin and Bean.

1475
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,440
Or have not gone on to live echoing throughout history.

1476
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,960
That's true.

1477
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah, so I don't know if the publicity stunt angle of it

1478
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,080
worked out as well as you imagine.

1479
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,720
But yeah.

1480
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,680
Yeah, good for that.

1481
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,760
Anyway, when I heard that they were going to be on,

1482
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,720
I thought, OK, here we go.

1483
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,200
Yeah.

1484
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,480
This is nonsense.

1485
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,200
This should be fun.

1486
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,600
This is exactly the kind of thing

1487
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,360
that I think is really fun about going back to 2003.

1488
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:35,880
Totally.

1489
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,160
These long-forgotten sort of, I don't want to call it trivial,

1490
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,240
because what happened to the Dixie Chicks was so unfair.

1491
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,600
And I'm not going to minimize that at all.

1492
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,120
Of course.

1493
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,920
But in terms of Alex's world, this

1494
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,520
is trivial compared to we're all going to die.

1495
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,400
Right, right, right.

1496
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,800
We're fighting the literal devil.

1497
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,560
Also, these two guys got suspended

1498
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,240
for playing the Dixie Chicks.

1499
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,160
So there's a little bit of a disconnect in stakes,

1500
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,920
if you will.

1501
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,480
And it's a time when these guys are probably

1502
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,040
not super political.

1503
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,920
But they don't know who Alex Jones is.

1504
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,440
He has a nationally syndicated show.

1505
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,000
Right, right, right, right.

1506
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,760
Why not go on it?

1507
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,000
Right, right, right, right.

1508
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,800
So you get this weird intersection

1509
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,760
of things that would never happen nowadays.

1510
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,840
And I think it's amazing.

1511
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,400
Yeah.

1512
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,080
Anyway, just to check in on where Alex is at with the NRA.

1513
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,320
How are they doing?

1514
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,120
They would then deny that S-22 even existed,

1515
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,880
the gun registration bill.

1516
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,600
But now it's come out that it does.

1517
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,000
And they weren't going to warn you about it.

1518
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,080
So they're loyal opposition.

1519
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,920
And it makes sense.

1520
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,560
When the NRA gets more members, when

1521
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,320
things are going badly for the Second Amendment,

1522
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,120
they get more signups.

1523
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,880
Yeah, so Alex doesn't like the NRA at all.

1524
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,680
He hates them.

1525
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,320
I don't like this.

1526
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,760
I don't like going into the past as much as you do.

1527
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,280
Because I find that his behavior is less egregious.

1528
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,080
And thus makes me feel more like I'm saying stuff

1529
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,840
where I'm like, I mean, yeah, that's a good point.

1530
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,520
I don't like it.

1531
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,160
I don't like it.

1532
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,960
Because his behavior is still egregious.

1533
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,200
It's just under the surface.

1534
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,080
No, no, no.

1535
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,840
But also, here's the thing that we

1536
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,040
need to really finally delineate.

1537
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,120
It's like, yes, opposition to the NRA is great.

1538
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,960
Opposition to Bush is great.

1539
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,800
We can agree with those things as sentences

1540
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,680
on a piece of paper.

1541
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,200
Correct.

1542
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,560
Now, the motivation for why Alex is against both of those things

1543
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,000
is different than what we think.

1544
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,600
Totally.

1545
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,120
And so I actually think that you can be,

1546
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,160
what you're experiencing is exactly

1547
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,360
what lured a lot of people who wouldn't agree

1548
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,960
with Alex's radical politics.

1549
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,840
Exactly.

1550
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,120
Into thinking he was more in the center than he actually is.

1551
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,720
Totally.

1552
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,040
You know, you think like, oh, this guy doesn't like the NRA.

1553
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,200
Right.

1554
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,840
Maybe he's one of these people who's kind of conservative

1555
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,120
but kind of gets it.

1556
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,600
No, he's more extreme than the NRA.

1557
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,160
Totally.

1558
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,880
I know.

1559
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,880
That's so frustrating.

1560
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,480
He's attacking from way far to the right.

1561
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:55,960
I know.

1562
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,840
It's so frustrating that he could get away

1563
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,720
with it conceivably.

1564
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,200
Yeah.

1565
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,800
And he does.

1566
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,280
He does.

1567
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,680
And he does, as we're talking about him now.

1568
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,960
So obviously got away with it.

1569
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,440
And I think it worked really well for him at this era.

1570
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,280
Yeah, he nailed it.

1571
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,120
Yeah.

1572
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,880
And I think one of the things that is really good for him,

1573
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,080
too, is this branding.

1574
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,440
And we're talking about this attacking the NRA

1575
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,320
from the right, because he is a extreme right wing person.

1576
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,200
Right, right, right.

1577
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,000
And attacking Bush because he's extremely

1578
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,280
far to the right of Bush, not because he's to the left

1579
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,440
or he's in the center.

1580
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,240
People could get that impression.

1581
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,440
And Alex plays into that impression.

1582
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,040
Totally.

1583
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,440
And in this next clip, he's talking

1584
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,560
about how people call him a commie

1585
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,880
because he's against Bush.

1586
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,760
Again, I will make the admission here.

1587
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,360
I'm pro-gun 110%.

1588
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,600
It's an absolute right.

1589
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,720
I'm pro-sovereignty.

1590
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,640
I'm pro-family.

1591
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,680
I'm for low taxes.

1592
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,920
I'm for abolishing the Federal Reserve.

1593
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,040
That means in today's dialectic that I am a ultra communist.

1594
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,800
Now, if you're a neocon who's an admitted Trotskyite,

1595
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,600
if you're a beatnik who has a national talk show

1596
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,160
and who's an admitted communist, you are now a conservative.

1597
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,480
And I'm not being sarcastic.

1598
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,160
I am now a communist because I'm pro-America.

1599
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,080
They, the communists, learned how to flap American flags

1600
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,040
in our face and talk about how conservative they are.

1601
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,720
They are now the conservatives.

1602
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,720
See, Alex has this superficial defining himself

1603
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,360
by opposition to things that actually

1604
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,600
does fool a lot of people.

1605
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,600
I'm opposed to Bush.

1606
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,120
And now everyone calls me a commie.

1607
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,120
When I was against Clinton, they called

1608
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,880
me a hard-right extremist.

1609
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,640
You were, and you still are.

1610
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,440
Right.

1611
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,520
Yeah.

1612
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,920
I don't know if I ever had anybody who I heard say,

1613
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,640
like, Alex is a communist because he's against Bush.

1614
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,120
No.

1615
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,520
I just think that people thought he was more sensible

1616
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,200
than you might think on first blush.

1617
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,680
Right.

1618
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,760
And if you are an enemy of any part of the right wing,

1619
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,680
you will be called a communist, regardless

1620
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,560
of anything you may or may not have ever said or believed.

1621
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,520
Possibly by other people in the right wing.

1622
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,080
Yeah.

1623
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,040
No, definitely.

1624
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,440
Like Alex is calling Michael Savage a communist.

1625
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:09,960
Exactly.

1626
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,360
No, definitely that.

1627
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:11,360
That's what I'm saying.

1628
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,520
This is just bickering.

1629
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,040
Yeah.

1630
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,080
It's just whining.

1631
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,600
Yeah.

1632
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,840
Yeah.

1633
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,960
So I think that there is a pretty key problem there, too.

1634
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,360
And I do think that it's something

1635
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,080
that I notice about Alex.

1636
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,200
And that is the defining self by opposition

1637
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,760
or by others' response.

1638
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,240
Yeah.

1639
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,560
When he talks all the time about knowing that he's right

1640
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,520
because people are attacking him and stuff,

1641
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,720
it's like, that's not a reliable metric of, you know,

1642
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,920
oh, I'm right because everybody hates me.

1643
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,680
It's like, wow.

1644
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,240
Yeah.

1645
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,280
Does that mean that ISIS is right?

1646
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:46,960
Yeah.

1647
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,880
No.

1648
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,560
If he goes to therapy one time, the first question

1649
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,920
is just going to be like, how do you define yourself?

1650
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,120
And he's going to talk about everybody but himself.

1651
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:58,200
And he's going to be like, no, but like from the inside.

1652
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,720
And it's going to be six years of constant talking

1653
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,720
to just even figure out where he starts.

1654
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,120
Yeah.

1655
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:04,640
Yeah.

1656
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,720
So these DJs come on.

1657
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,600
And I got to say, there's a little bit

1658
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,440
of a different style for Alex.

1659
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,240
He opens the interview by asking a tough question.

1660
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:13,960
OK.

1661
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,800
Let me just get this out of the way up front.

1662
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,040
Was this a stunt you guys pulled with management?

1663
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:18,920
Absolutely not.

1664
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,600
No.

1665
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,400
Nope.

1666
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,360
All right.

1667
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,040
Well, we did it.

1668
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,200
Good journalism, everybody.

1669
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:23,760
Let's go.

1670
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,080
Let's wrap it up and go home.

1671
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,680
That's certainly better journalism

1672
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,680
than he normally does.

1673
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,200
It is.

1674
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,760
It is.

1675
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,040
It is very much better than a leading question like, so,

1676
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,800
how long has your management been evil

1677
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,480
and in the pocket of the devil and the globalists

1678
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,000
that have been trying to oppress you?

1679
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,480
I think Alex's bedside manner leaves a little bit

1680
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,520
to be desired there in terms of like, was this a stunt?

1681
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,400
No.

1682
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,760
Shit.

1683
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,880
No follow-up questions.

1684
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,320
I was going to say, that does have the feel of like,

1685
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,400
maybe if I just surprise them aggressively,

1686
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,400
they'll be tricked into answering honestly.

1687
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,760
So one of the things that I think Alex had been presenting,

1688
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,400
and I think it's what a lot of people felt,

1689
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,400
was that this was a principled stand

1690
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,120
that these DJs were making.

1691
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,560
That it was, they were opposed to the band,

1692
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,480
and they played this music as a way of being like, no.

1693
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,720
We believe in free speech.

1694
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,240
Pirate radio.

1695
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,520
Vietnam War.

1696
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,000
We're doing it all over again.

1697
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,320
If you listen to them, it's very clear

1698
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,400
that that's not the case.

1699
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,120
OK.

1700
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,880
They did not agree with what Natalie said.

1701
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,400
They agreed with the band.

1702
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,680
They just thought it had run its course.

1703
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,240
Due to a majority of, not all of our listeners,

1704
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,040
a couple of months ago saying they did not

1705
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,160
want to hear the Dixie Chicks on our radio station because

1706
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,680
of what Natalie Main said about our president over in London.

1707
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,240
So it was starting to turn the other way,

1708
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,000
like can you start playing the Chicks?

1709
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,120
Yeah, we had requests for them and everything.

1710
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,000
But we decided we are, for our troops, 100%,

1711
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,120
we're for the president 100%, but we're also

1712
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,920
for the First Amendment 100%.

1713
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,120
Should Natalie Main, the Dixie Chicks, say what she said?

1714
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,160
Absolutely not.

1715
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,800
Well, America, I mean, in America,

1716
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,040
you've got the First Amendment.

1717
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,760
That's what the military is for, is

1718
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,440
to defend our constitutional republic.

1719
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,800
And just this whole blacklisting, this whole demonization

1720
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,880
of the Dixie Chicks over this has sent shockwaves

1721
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,480
across the country, a giant chilling effect,

1722
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,880
and America's going in the wrong direction here.

1723
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,560
Well, but they were fine with this for two months.

1724
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,360
Yeah.

1725
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,160
They were fine.

1726
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:26,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1727
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,360
Until the tide started to turn and people were like,

1728
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,800
eh, we want to listen to the Dixie Chicks.

1729
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,240
Ed, didn't you read the First Amendment?

1730
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,360
It has an expiration date of two months.

1731
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,160
I don't know.

1732
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,040
I mean, I don't know how I feel about this

1733
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,320
from a station management perspective.

1734
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,920
Do they have the right to just say,

1735
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,040
I don't want to play this person's songs?

1736
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,440
If they don't have a contract that they have to play,

1737
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,040
maybe it's shitty if you're not playing someone's music because

1738
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,760
of a political reason.

1739
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,560
But if you're a metal station, you're

1740
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,800
not required to play reggae, right?

1741
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:10,280
Unless, I don't know, Wyclef says something anti-Bush,

1742
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,840
then you have to play it.

1743
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,760
And so it is a protest to not play it.

1744
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,800
What if this is, like, we're talking mid, late 90s,

1745
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,480
you've got an alternative station,

1746
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,800
but you hate Peanut, just personally.

1747
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,560
Just personally.

1748
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,720
Do you have to play 311?

1749
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,320
I assume not.

1750
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,960
If you're a station manager and you just

1751
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,320
have a personal problem with Nick Hexum,

1752
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,760
do you have to play 311?

1753
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,320
I don't think so.

1754
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:37,960
I don't know.

1755
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,720
It's weird.

1756
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,400
And certainly, I'm opposed to politically just saying,

1757
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,200
no, your politics are such that I'm not

1758
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,200
going to play your songs.

1759
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,360
But I mean, if I was going to be impressed by these DJs having

1760
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,880
any interest in the First Amendment,

1761
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,800
then their actions would have probably come earlier.

1762
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,480
No, it is a little bit like a.

1763
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,120
This is just, I've decided that it is no longer popular for me

1764
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,440
to suppress this speech.

1765
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,880
Yeah, I mean, it's like if Barnes and Noble was like,

1766
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,640
eh, we're not going to carry Jane Austen.

1767
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,680
We're just not doing it.

1768
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,800
I remember her comments about Bush.

1769
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,160
And so we don't carry it anymore.

1770
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,600
And then two months later, they're like, eh,

1771
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,840
we'll put Jane Austen back in there.

1772
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,360
No big deal.

1773
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,600
Yeah, this new Jane Austen novel is pretty hot.

1774
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,920
People like it.

1775
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,040
So yeah, this is pretty much exactly what they say.

1776
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,560
They're just like, oh, the listeners

1777
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,400
wanted them to come back.

1778
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,760
We listened to our listeners.

1779
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,800
And the listeners said they didn't want to play it,

1780
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,600
so we listened.

1781
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,840
Well, that's good, but I do want you guys

1782
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,040
to go back and get on the radio and go,

1783
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,960
you can tune into Alex Jones at 1580.

1784
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,040
Will you do that for me?

1785
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,640
No, seriously, guys.

1786
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,400
Was that a joke?

1787
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:38,840
No.

1788
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,360
No.

1789
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,040
He said no.

1790
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,080
Seriously, guys.

1791
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,280
I think that was not a joke.

1792
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,520
That was very much not a joke.

1793
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,480
Guys, please give me a plug, please.

1794
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,600
That wasn't even like one of those jokes where you laugh,

1795
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,880
but you're hoping they'll be like, no, no, no.

1796
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,400
We're totally going to do that.

1797
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,000
You'll be like, no, that wasn't what I was trying to do.

1798
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,240
I was just making a joke.

1799
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:56,920
It wasn't that.

1800
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,520
It was like, hey, plug me on your show.

1801
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,800
No, seriously.

1802
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,480
Hey, guys, you made a lot of news with that suspension,

1803
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,400
and you might have more listeners right now.

1804
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,840
And could you please plug me?

1805
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,280
Yeah, it is nice to know that clout chasing, still

1806
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,920
strong back in 2003.

1807
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,240
Oh, yeah, he was an early adopter.

1808
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,800
So Alex has, it's fucking clear.

1809
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,680
He doesn't really spell it out, but it's really clear

1810
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,480
that he thinks that there's a conspiracy afoot.

1811
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,360
So here's the conspiracy.

1812
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,920
Clear channel on a bunch of radio stations.

1813
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,040
I already believe it.

1814
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:31,540
Right?

1815
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,040
Yeah.

1816
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,040
So Clear Channel own a bunch of radio stations

1817
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,680
and also a bunch of concert venues.

1818
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,160
True.

1819
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,320
So what they have done.

1820
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,080
And billboards?

1821
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,280
They have manufactured a whole crisis

1822
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,120
where the Dixie Chicks get kicked off these stations that

1823
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,480
are owned by Clear Channel.

1824
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,460
And then they go on tour, and they sell out all their shows

1825
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,280
at these venues that are owned by Clear Channel.

1826
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,600
Now, I would suggest that the Dixie Chicks don't

1827
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,800
need to sell more tickets.

1828
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,400
No, they were doing all right.

1829
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,060
They were huge.

1830
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,480
They were about at the peak of their power.

1831
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,240
They were huge.

1832
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,760
Yeah.

1833
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1834
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,960
They were huge.

1835
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,920
One of the reasons that it was so nuts

1836
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,160
that they were almost piling on them in the right way

1837
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,040
was because they were in the top three, top four country music

1838
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,200
acts in the world.

1839
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,080
They were killing it.

1840
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,960
They were killing it.

1841
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,560
Yeah, yeah.

1842
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,880
That's why they had to be taken down,

1843
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,220
because they had too large of a platform to criticize Bush

1844
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:20,720
with.

1845
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,220
Yes.

1846
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:26,360
So Alex tries to lay out this conspiracy to the DJs.

1847
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,440
Now, for this conspiracy to make sense,

1848
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,520
there's two things that need to be true.

1849
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,000
One, this needs to be a Clear Channel station.

1850
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,680
True.

1851
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,320
Two, the venue where the Dixie Chicks are playing

1852
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,200
needs to be owned by Clear Channel.

1853
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,400
Both of those must be true for this conspiracy

1854
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,480
to have any effect on them.

1855
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,480
Now, I have read that is your station Clear Channel?

1856
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,060
No.

1857
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:50,560
OK.

1858
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,800
I mean, I have some on there.

1859
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,000
They said that simultaneously?

1860
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,200
I actually read this piece of history.

1861
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,560
They've been asked that a lot.

1862
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,480
Clear Channel, a big part of their business

1863
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,640
isn't just playing music.

1864
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,840
It's putting on concerts.

1865
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,440
Is it true, from what you know, that Clear Channel was actually

1866
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,140
involved in promoting Dixie Chicks concerts?

1867
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,080
I don't know if they are the promoter behind the Dixie

1868
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,120
Chicks concerts or not.

1869
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:14,400
I know they have several venues across the country,

1870
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,320
including a couple in Colorado.

1871
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,820
And they have Clear Channel Entertainment,

1872
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,280
which promotes concerts.

1873
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,680
But I'm not sure if they're one of the promoters for the Chicks

1874
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,200
or not.

1875
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,000
Have the Dixie Chicks played at their venues?

1876
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,200
They, not at their, well, their venue in Colorado

1877
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,320
is fairly small.

1878
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,860
The Dixie Chicks will be playing at the Pepsi Center, which

1879
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,080
is a large venue.

1880
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,720
That's where the Nuggets and the Avalanche play.

1881
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,080
Yeah, well, I have read that they've been involved.

1882
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,640
So could it be a larger publicity stunt?

1883
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,160
Boy, they get all this attention.

1884
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,080
I guess we won't know.

1885
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,240
But you know, on radio, people do pull stunts.

1886
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,320
And we're trying to find that out.

1887
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,880
People do pull stunts.

1888
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,640
True.

1889
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,320
But this has fallen apart.

1890
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:58,240
Usually, it's more like payola or something like that.

1891
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,160
Sure.

1892
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,160
Not necessarily this.

1893
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,000
I think that this interview has fascinatingly fallen apart.

1894
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,760
Because these DJs are not free speech crusaders in the way

1895
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,040
that Alex maybe would have liked them to be.

1896
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,080
It would have been great.

1897
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:17,120
And now, they have refuted twice in the span of about a minute

1898
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,040
pillars of his conspiracy that Clear Channel is trying

1899
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,040
to boost their live ticket sales for one of the most popular

1900
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,560
acts in the world by pulling a stunt where they get

1901
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,720
kicked off radio stations.

1902
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,320
Yeah, yeah.

1903
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,680
If you were Alex, and you had a top three of things

1904
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,320
that you hoped were true, at least one of those

1905
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,800
should have been true.

1906
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,440
Man.

1907
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:38,960
None of those.

1908
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,520
No.

1909
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,360
Oh, that's not good.

1910
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:40,760
Nope.

1911
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,600
At the very least, you're not a data point

1912
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,400
for the Clear Channel conspiracy.

1913
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,120
So I think Alex is recognizing some of the similar things

1914
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,160
that I am, and that is that this has fallen apart.

1915
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,680
Sure.

1916
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,200
And so he decides to retreat to attacking these guys.

1917
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,480
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1918
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,640
We support Natalie Maine's right to say whatever she wants.

1919
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,920
So since you said it, we don't agree with what you said

1920
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,600
by any means.

1921
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,680
Let me ask you a question.

1922
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,800
You guys supported, then, the takeover of Iraq.

1923
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,520
Well, you know, we support our troops.

1924
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,000
And it's hard to say whether we're there,

1925
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
because I don't know personally whether or not

1926
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,520
there are weapons of mass destruction

1927
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,360
and whether there's a necessity to do what is being done.

1928
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,480
I'm not an expert on that.

1929
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,800
But you're supporting the troops end to end.

1930
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,640
We understand that, but wouldn't you

1931
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,880
say it supports the troops, not to sell Saddam, VX, and sarin,

1932
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,240
and then order our troops to blow up the bunkers,

1933
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,640
and then when they breathe that stuff in 91,

1934
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,840
to not give them treatment?

1935
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,300
Because that's a big deal.

1936
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,520
That really hurt the troops right there.

1937
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,320
Well, that's true.

1938
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,480
Of course, we're just country DJs,

1939
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,720
and for us, it's about the music, mainly.

1940
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,160
Yeah.

1941
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,040
They are just country DJs.

1942
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,840
This is unfair.

1943
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,640
This is a writ.

1944
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,800
I like that defense.

1945
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,600
Yeah.

1946
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,640
I would like to use that.

1947
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,400
Yeah, OK.

1948
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,760
So my position is that I support the troops.

1949
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,680
And your rebuttal to that is making

1950
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,040
me own literally everything the government has ever done?

1951
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,000
Great.

1952
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,240
How about I tell you that I'm a country DJ,

1953
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,400
and we move the fuck along, because I'm not

1954
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,160
going to litigate every decision the government has ever made.

1955
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,200
What a great comeback.

1956
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,320
Because what do you expect from a country DJ?

1957
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,600
I'll tell you what.

1958
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,640
Complicated and clear-eyed views of global international

1959
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,000
politics?

1960
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,200
No.

1961
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,920
And they even express.

1962
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,200
We have some fun on our show.

1963
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,320
We play music.

1964
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,760
We're not all that political.

1965
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:49,360
Certainly, coming on a show, you certainly confuse us.

1966
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,240
Why did you say all those words?

1967
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,400
I think that that is Alex just trying to take something

1968
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,160
from the interview, because it went so poorly.

1969
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,200
Clear channel conspiracy didn't work out.

1970
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,080
These guys aren't heroes.

1971
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,600
They're kind of just morning zoo dicks.

1972
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,320
Yeah.

1973
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:04,840
Yeah.

1974
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,840
If you have been deflated so completely by these assholes,

1975
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:15,080
then there's also that little bit of Alex's resentment

1976
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,520
coming out of like, you didn't give me what I want,

1977
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,320
so I will take it from you.

1978
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,680
That kind of feel, yeah.

1979
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,800
So I think that there's a little bit of a codependency

1980
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,960
with the audience.

1981
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,360
And this caller who calls in after the interview

1982
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,880
wants to make Alex feel better and try and help him

1983
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,920
with that clear channel conspiracy.

1984
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,640
First of all, the name of the promotions company

1985
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,120
is SFX Entertainment is promoting the Dixie Chicks concert.

1986
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,960
You go to the website, it comes up Clear Channel Entertainment.

1987
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,640
Yeah, that's what I've seen that actually, who was it?

1988
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,560
It was Reuters ran an article like two weeks ago on that.

1989
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,200
Yeah, SFX, and it's Clear Channel.

1990
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,680
And then they start the ban, which then

1991
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,840
makes it all go down.

1992
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,640
Everybody suddenly wants it.

1993
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,320
Then they make more money off of it.

1994
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,240
But here's the big scam.

1995
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,160
It doesn't matter.

1996
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,920
It still creates a chilling effect for everybody else.

1997
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:10,080
Ooh, you better not speak out, because then you'll be banned,

1998
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,040
and people never even know it was a scam.

1999
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,520
Yeah, second thing, I just kind of wanted to gloss over that.

2000
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,720
Does that make you mad?

2001
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,200
Yeah, it does.

2002
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:17,960
It really does.

2003
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:18,560
It should.

2004
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,080
It does.

2005
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,400
It really does make me mad.

2006
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,840
SFX Entertainment is Live Nation that

2007
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,400
was bought by Clear Channel and then got spun off

2008
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,280
into its own thing again.

2009
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,040
Yeah, I don't know.

2010
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,640
I couldn't go back and figure out if the Dixie Chicks,

2011
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,960
all of their events were run through Live Nation.

2012
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,600
Sure.

2013
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,360
I don't know.

2014
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,360
I don't think.

2015
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,360
And I also don't care.

2016
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,840
It doesn't prove any conspiracy here.

2017
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,120
Yeah, I was going to say, on the list of, again, I believe

2018
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,080
we are at this moment fighting the literal devil who

2019
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,600
is destroying all of Iraq in order,

2020
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,040
in service of destroying all of the United States.

2021
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,560
So what Clear Channel's doing about the Dixie Chicks

2022
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,280
promotions?

2023
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,240
Trying to make a few extra bucks on tickets?

2024
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,080
I mean, yeah.

2025
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,640
Whatever.

2026
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,880
Go for it, Clear Channel.

2027
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,760
I would say that I'd be willing to stipulate, and not

2028
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,040
accept as true, but I'll just go ahead and not even fight it,

2029
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,720
that Clear Channel, by virtue of Alive Nation,

2030
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,480
is doing ticketing for all of the Dixie Chicks.

2031
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,000
Sure.

2032
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,040
Sure, why not?

2033
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,760
That still doesn't prove the conspiracy.

2034
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,880
And now it's just acting like hearing that is like,

2035
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,880
a-ha-ha, slim dunk.

2036
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,400
True.

2037
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,160
Now, I won't put it past the recording industry.

2038
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,120
They pull off some bullshit all the time.

2039
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,000
Yeah, man.

2040
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,320
I saw Josie and the Pussycats.

2041
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,640
Yeah, the whole industry's bullshit.

2042
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,360
That movie was fraught with scandal.

2043
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,200
I get it, all of these conspiracies.

2044
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,520
So a caller calls in, another one, and he's got a theory.

2045
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,600
But sometimes, Alex's show is being blocked out by waves.

2046
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,800
OK.

2047
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,520
I think sometimes when you come on air,

2048
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,920
they try to block you out, too, because you

2049
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,760
hit so much truthful points.

2050
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,520
What do you mean they try to block a show?

2051
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,520
Well, I know frequencies, I know other listeners

2052
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,640
in the area who listen to you at the same hours.

2053
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,640
If they're going to listen to you late at night,

2054
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,040
they can't get you in, too.

2055
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,360
And it'd be a frequency, and you can hear it,

2056
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,240
but I don't know if they're trying to block you out or what,

2057
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,240
but sometimes, I call other people,

2058
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,040
and they get in the same thing, too.

2059
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,520
But you can hear us fine during the day, though.

2060
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,360
Fine during the day, but at nighttime, when people are home

2061
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,440
and want to listen to the radio, yeah, everybody

2062
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,720
wants to get the same block out.

2063
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:30,640
They can't get you in.

2064
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,480
Yeah, well, that's probably just because AMs

2065
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,520
aren't as strong at night.

2066
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,600
Listen, thank you for the call.

2067
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,400
I appreciate it.

2068
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,000
Great, great.

2069
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,520
What a bad job by Alex.

2070
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,520
What a bad job.

2071
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,440
I just wrote down, what do you mean they block us out?

2072
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,240
Like, Alex said, what do you mean they block us out?

2073
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,280
Not, obviously, they block us out.

2074
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,840
They're always trying to block us out.

2075
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,560
They've been trying to block us out since I started,

2076
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,600
because I know too much.

2077
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,320
Well, I think Alex realizes there's not

2078
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,160
money in that, probably.

2079
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,240
And the only action you might end up precipitating

2080
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,160
is harassment of the stations that do play him.

2081
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:07,720
That's true.

2082
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,520
And you might end up cutting in.

2083
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,280
You might bite the hand that feeds there.

2084
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:11,800
Sure, sure.

2085
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,400
Can't do that.

2086
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,360
So this might actually just be something like,

2087
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,800
it's not even worth it to try and convince people.

2088
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,920
Spin this into, yeah.

2089
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,880
We're under attack.

2090
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,640
Like, what are you going to do?

2091
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,800
You're going to end up fucking with the affiliates.

2092
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,400
Right, right, right, right, right.

2093
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,440
No good.

2094
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:29,720
So Alex gets down to describing his enemies.

2095
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,680
See if you hear the devil in here.

2096
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,520
It's not a dictatorship of Bill Clinton or George Bush.

2097
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,320
They're just puppets.

2098
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,400
It's a dictatorship of the military industrial complex

2099
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,120
was bankrolled and founded to run this country

2100
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,120
by the private European banks.

2101
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,640
There's no fight between the EU and the UN in America.

2102
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,920
It's all owned by the same private shareholders,

2103
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,880
the Warbirds, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,

2104
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,920
the Dutch Royal Family, the British Royal Family,

2105
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,360
the Bilderberg Group, the people that meet and publicly call

2106
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,400
for open world dictatorship.

2107
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,960
So that sounds astoundingly terrestrial.

2108
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,720
Yeah.

2109
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,640
That sounds like business interests

2110
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,520
who have an idea of working together

2111
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,960
to create a worldwide dictatorship tyranny.

2112
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,440
Yeah.

2113
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,080
It does not seem like it's people

2114
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,360
who are in the employ of the devil who has contacted them

2115
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,840
via transdimensional demons and offered them life extension

2116
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,880
technology if they carry out an elaborate and hyper complicated

2117
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,040
plan to slowly and orderly kill off humanity.

2118
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,720
Should they fail to do that, they

2119
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,360
have a backup plan to just really super bio weapons

2120
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,640
and kill everybody off.

2121
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,280
It seems like this is a guy who wants

2122
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:44,440
to at least be taken seriously as a not science fiction

2123
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,880
writer.

2124
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,600
Yeah.

2125
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,560
His improvised storytelling is much more like Grisham

2126
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,280
at this point as opposed to Philip K. Dick.

2127
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,480
This is the firm.

2128
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,400
That's what this is.

2129
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,160
It's fighting against powerful lawyers,

2130
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,240
taking over everything.

2131
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:00,840
No, I got it.

2132
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,560
It's not magical realism.

2133
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,840
No, no.

2134
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,320
Indeed, in fact, it seems like his biggest problem

2135
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,120
is ultimately what the end result of capitalism

2136
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,680
always seems to be, which is staggering wealth and inequality

2137
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,560
leading to an aristocratic business class.

2138
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,880
I'd love for you to go back in time

2139
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,800
and talk to him about that.

2140
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,920
That would be interesting.

2141
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,200
So that caller who's talking about Alex being under attack

2142
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,440
through waves, right?

2143
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,600
Sure.

2144
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,960
Man, I thought he was nuts.

2145
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,200
Oh, have we changed our mind already?

2146
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,840
US terror plan called Cuban invasion pretext.

2147
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,080
US military leaders proposed in 62 a secret plan

2148
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,000
to commit terrorist acts against Americans

2149
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,160
and blame Cuba to create a pretext for invasion

2150
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,480
and ouster of communist leader Fidel Castro who they put in.

2151
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,320
No, they use the war against the communists

2152
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,600
as a way to warp the minds of our military men and our CIA

2153
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,640
and get them to do evil things and set up

2154
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,960
a culture of evil, which is now used for narcotics trafficking

2155
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,080
and money laundering and white slavery,

2156
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,200
every other evil you can imagine.

2157
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:58,960
And it goes on.

2158
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,280
It's a scalar attack.

2159
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,560
Too much truth.

2160
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,880
Now, Alex, he plays a song and then he comes back

2161
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:18,200
from break and is like, yeah, we're in Texas

2162
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,760
and the satellites in Minnesota, so sometimes there's problems.

2163
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,400
He's very just like, eh, it happens.

2164
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,320
It happens.

2165
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,760
It's part of the gig.

2166
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,200
That's fair, but could be an attack

2167
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,080
because he's telling too much truth.

2168
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,200
Possible.

2169
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,840
So Alex has an article in the LA Times

2170
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,920
that he's been bringing up a little bit,

2171
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,520
and this has to do with our old boy Joseph McCarthy.

2172
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,840
Oh, boy.

2173
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,760
Continuing with the news, despite McCarthy,

2174
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,360
red peril really was.

2175
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,600
John Maroney, LA Times.

2176
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,840
And it goes on.

2177
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,200
It says the document shouldn't be

2178
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,240
allowed to undermine the important historical fact

2179
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,920
that Soviet communism was a very real threat to US defense

2180
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,520
and freedom, and the anti-communist fight waged

2181
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,960
in the country was a moral one, even though the Communist

2182
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,760
Party succeeded in seducing an estimated 230,000

2183
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,160
Americans to its ranks over the course of 40 years.

2184
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,040
And it now says that the documents released

2185
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,600
show that McCarthy was right.

2186
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,160
This article from the LA Times is an opinion piece,

2187
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,800
and Alex is actually lying about the main thrust of the article.

2188
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,600
The author, John Maroney, is arguing

2189
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,520
that there was a point to opposing communism

2190
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,560
during the Cold War, but the actions of people

2191
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,360
like Joseph McCarthy gave that opposition a really bad name.

2192
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,560
Because McCarthy was an opportunist, fraud,

2193
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,120
and demagogue. Even in that sentence,

2194
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,600
Alex reads the words, quote, the documents

2195
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,040
shouldn't be allowed to undermine

2196
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,760
the important historical fact that the Soviet communism was

2197
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,880
a very real threat.

2198
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,680
Like, those words don't make sense.

2199
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,600
Sure.

2200
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,320
Aren't his listeners curious why this article is arguing

2201
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,080
that documents would possibly undermine

2202
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,560
that notion if this article is about vindicating McCarthy?

2203
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,240
Possible.

2204
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:03,000
The headline literally starts, quote, despite McCarthy.

2205
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,840
Yeah.

2206
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,440
Anyway.

2207
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,160
Yeah.

2208
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,200
Those things are in the headline and everything,

2209
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,760
because these documents that got released in 2003

2210
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,080
were a record of secret hearings that McCarthy held

2211
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,760
with witnesses prior to them making public appearances,

2212
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,520
and he was attempting to intimidate them.

2213
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah.

2214
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,600
Yeah.

2215
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,600
From an article about the documents from the BBC, quote,

2216
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,080
many had only tenuous connections with communists

2217
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,920
through family members or book clubs where Marx was read

2218
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,200
or unions with left wing leaders.

2219
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,600
The new documents paint a picture

2220
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,040
of a senator out of control, summoning witnesses

2221
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,640
at short notice and brow beating them

2222
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,160
with the threat of imprisonment or public disgrace.

2223
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,400
But it was noticeable that those he could not

2224
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,880
intimidate in private were often not called in public session.

2225
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,240
How shitty is our government press

2226
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,760
that they're like, these documents show

2227
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,280
Joseph McCarthy was unhinged.

2228
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,360
Like, I don't know if you were alive when he was around?

2229
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,800
They reveal a new level of artifice and craft.

2230
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,520
Sure.

2231
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,800
Sure.

2232
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,160
The articles that I was reading about this really

2233
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:06,040
laid out how different he behaved in the public hearings

2234
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,360
and these private ones.

2235
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:07,840
Sure.

2236
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,160
And there was kind of, it almost feels

2237
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,440
like a feeling out process.

2238
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,960
Like that last sentence there, you

2239
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,560
know, the people that wouldn't back down to him

2240
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,440
typically weren't called for the public ones

2241
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,040
because that doesn't create the public perception that he

2242
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,280
is looking to grandstand with.

2243
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:23,680
Sure.

2244
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,080
Sure.

2245
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,920
Also from the article, quote, according

2246
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,600
to Senate historian David Ritchie,

2247
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,480
the private hearings were more of an inquisition

2248
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,960
using circumstantial evidence, hearsay, and intimidation

2249
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,960
to force people to acknowledge his point of view.

2250
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,760
The documents that came out in 2003 paint

2251
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,200
Joseph McCarthy as an out of control lunatic

2252
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,640
trying to run a witch hunt.

2253
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,400
And this LA Times editorial is an attempt

2254
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,680
to remind readers that just because McCarthy really

2255
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:49,080
sucked, that doesn't mean that Soviet communism didn't exist.

2256
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,680
Hey, Torquemada, what do you say to the inquisition?

2257
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,120
If you were really someone who was opposed to communism

2258
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,880
and you'd read this article, you couldn't come away from it,

2259
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,000
honestly, with the position that it vindicated McCarthy.

2260
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,680
The article literally says, quote,

2261
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,640
many seem to have forgotten that the Communist

2262
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,840
Party was dedicated to replacing our democratic form

2263
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,600
of government with a totalitarian state

2264
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,000
similar to what existed in the Soviet Union.

2265
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,480
McCarthy and those who exploited his excesses

2266
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,000
are largely to blame for this.

2267
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,360
According to Moroni, McCarthy is a detriment

2268
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,480
to the opposition of communism.

2269
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,200
Essentially, the only two conclusions

2270
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,600
I can come to about Alex's coverage of this article

2271
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,680
are the following.

2272
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,720
One, he didn't read the article and he

2273
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,120
thinks it actually says that McCarthy was totally cool

2274
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,480
and he's just making up what the body of the text says.

2275
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,520
Two, defending McCarthyism and the tactics of witch hunting

2276
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,080
is more important to Alex than actually being opposed

2277
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,000
to communism, which makes his anti-communism essentially

2278
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,600
tactical as opposed to something that's based on principle.

2279
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,200
Yeah, I was going to say.

2280
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,720
I'm not entirely sure what I think.

2281
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,200
I was going to say, you just read

2282
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,440
Alex is also a detriment to anti-communism

2283
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,080
in the exact same fashion that Joseph McCarthy was.

2284
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,800
So naturally, he would want to defend McCarthy as well.

2285
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,760
Yeah, it seems like.

2286
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,720
Nobody's like, hey, you know what's great?

2287
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,080
It's the John Birch Society fighting communism.

2288
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,120
I think they really did a great job.

2289
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,200
I think they really got to the points

2290
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,520
and they really hammered it on.

2291
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,840
It seems like he is, you know, like idealistically

2292
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,640
and ideologically opposed to communism and all this.

2293
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,520
Sure.

2294
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:22,320
But if he can't do it like McCarthy did it,

2295
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,320
he doesn't want to do it.

2296
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,960
Exactly, exactly.

2297
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,120
Yes, if I can't defeat sex trafficking

2298
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,800
with a daring sunlight raid, then I

2299
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,920
don't want to deal with that.

2300
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,400
I just want to make everybody else angry about it.

2301
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:40,080
Yeah, I get the sense that he would not

2302
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,920
be so opposed to communism if his route to do it

2303
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:48,840
was to be an economics professor or a researcher who

2304
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,920
got no fanfare and didn't get to do

2305
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,040
these bombastic public hearings like McCarthy, which

2306
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,800
is Alex's radio show.

2307
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,280
If he wasn't able to make a show out of it,

2308
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,320
I don't know if he would be as interested.

2309
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,080
If leftists weren't as academic and more just shithead

2310
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,520
screaming, we might have Alex on our side

2311
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,480
is basically what we're talking about here.

2312
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:11,960
Maybe.

2313
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,680
Yeah, it's possible.

2314
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,880
He just hates theory so much, Dan.

2315
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,960
He hates it whenever they get into theory.

2316
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:18,800
Yeah.

2317
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,400
So Alex takes another call.

2318
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,280
And this guy has a decent point, and Alex

2319
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,520
has a terrible answer to it.

2320
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,160
And that is, why are we even talking

2321
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,920
about the assault weapons ban?

2322
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,200
It doesn't even come up until next year.

2323
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:34,480
2004 is when it's up for renewal or let it lap.

2324
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,200
Sure, sure.

2325
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,160
And so Alex has an interesting answer

2326
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:41,000
that I think is totally wrong and on brand.

2327
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,640
Hi, Alex.

2328
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,360
How are you doing?

2329
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,520
I've reflected on some things over the last 24 hours,

2330
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,440
and there's several different points.

2331
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,680
First off, something dawned upon me.

2332
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,880
Why is the administration dealing with the assault weapons

2333
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:57,880
ban 15 months before the issue even comes due in the middle

2334
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,280
of this climate with so many concerns about the war

2335
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,400
and so forth?

2336
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,560
Why even deal with that out of the blue so far in advance?

2337
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,480
That's strange.

2338
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,480
Because they want to act like they're right when they

2339
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,080
activate some mind control fruitcake.

2340
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,560
You know, The Matrix is coming out,

2341
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,320
which they say is a big trigger.

2342
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,320
Yeah.

2343
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,440
Tend to agree.

2344
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,360
So he tends to agree that there's probably

2345
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,200
going to be a shooting at the second Matrix opening

2346
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,640
or second Matrix movie, because it's going to be a trigger.

2347
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,960
And then they're talking about the assault weapons ban stuff

2348
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,760
so they can be right in advance for this thing that

2349
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:30,400
didn't happen.

2350
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,200
Right.

2351
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:31,720
Cool.

2352
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:36,120
And this is a precedent to the way

2353
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,640
he engages with shootings in the future.

2354
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,400
Like, this pattern of thinking is there all along.

2355
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,280
Yeah.

2356
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,120
That almost sounds like Norm Pattis, doesn't it?

2357
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,280
The caller?

2358
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,160
Doesn't that voice almost sound like him?

2359
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:49,720
I'm not sure.

2360
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,800
Through a phone, I can kind of hear it,

2361
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,840
and I would love to find out that that was actually

2362
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,080
a young Norm.

2363
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:56,600
No way.

2364
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,160
Like, developing their relationship.

2365
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:58,920
No way.

2366
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,440
Oh, man.

2367
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,280
The vibe that I get from Norm from those early appearances

2368
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,120
is either someone who legitimately doesn't really

2369
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,480
understand what Alex does or somebody

2370
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,520
who really, really wants people to think

2371
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,040
he doesn't understand what he does.

2372
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,720
I don't know.

2373
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,680
It just sounds like we're in a TV show in our eighth season,

2374
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,200
and we start doing all the flashbacks.

2375
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,800
And it turns out our main characters all coincidentally

2376
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,320
met 20 years ago.

2377
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,760
We've already done that, though, and in the 2015 episodes,

2378
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,120
we heard Owen Troyer call in as a fan.

2379
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,040
That's true.

2380
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,280
What a weird world.

2381
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:32,760
Yeah.

2382
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,360
So here, Alex is wrong about things

2383
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,440
that will happen in the future.

2384
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,520
In Boston, Logan Airport, and four other airports,

2385
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,000
they put NASA brain scanners in to, quote,

2386
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,560
tell if you're agitated.

2387
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,560
In 1984, they didn't scan your brain.

2388
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,120
This is total information awareness, worse than 1984.

2389
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,160
Then they say, oh, but it's to keep you safe.

2390
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,240
It's to keep you safe, America.

2391
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:00,960
We just want to keep you safe.

2392
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,360
The borders stay wide open, and they're putting the Bathys

2393
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,920
back in power in Iraq because they're

2394
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,560
good thugs trained by the CIA in the 70s and 80s.

2395
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,880
I'm really interested.

2396
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,840
I know this is getting repetitive in these 2003

2397
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,400
episodes, but I'm really, really interested in what's

2398
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,720
going to happen when de-Bathification comes around.

2399
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,480
Because he's hitting this note so consistently.

2400
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,240
On every show, he's bringing up how the Bathys are in charge.

2401
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,600
And it's because that's who the US government

2402
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,280
and the globalists want to be in charge.

2403
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,240
Right, right, right.

2404
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,000
He's so insistent about something

2405
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,240
that we know for a fact to be 100% diametrically

2406
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,560
the opposite.

2407
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,000
And he is going to eventually run into that brick wall,

2408
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,520
driving at 60 miles an hour.

2409
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,160
Exactly.

2410
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,320
And that's what I'm so interested to see.

2411
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,600
Does he hit the brakes at a certain point?

2412
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,200
Or does he just go straight through?

2413
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,240
Yeah, I don't know.

2414
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,960
So we'll see.

2415
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,280
So another caller calls in.

2416
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,800
Is he like the Road Runner where he paints the wall,

2417
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,120
he paints the tunnel on there, and he goes through it.

2418
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,680
You're like, what the fuck?

2419
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,400
I feel like that metaphorically is

2420
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:09,800
what he does a lot of the time, just create a fake tunnel.

2421
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,600
Drive through it.

2422
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,240
So a caller calls in, wants to know about underground prisons

2423
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,720
that are being built.

2424
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,360
I wanted to ask you if you had any information on underground

2425
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,040
prison camps that they're developing.

2426
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,200
Yes, I have mainstream news articles.

2427
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,520
INS Kentucky poured concrete for two years

2428
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,320
under a giant underground old coal mine

2429
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,720
and built a supermax on top of it with airfields

2430
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,600
and everything.

2431
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,320
They're building giant prisons everywhere.

2432
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,040
It's the new economy, a giant prison economy

2433
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,240
where they literally own us, where torture

2434
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,840
is the order of the day and is a virtue.

2435
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,440
That's very interesting because down here in Trinidad,

2436
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,520
we're having seismographic readings.

2437
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,680
And in Trinidad was a site of an old Japanese internment camp,

2438
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,520
and it has old mines, but they're

2439
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,320
getting seismographic readings, but there's no faults there.

2440
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,800
And so I'm going to collect as much heart as I can.

2441
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,600
Sir, your Denver International Airport

2442
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,760
has pictures of Nazis machine gunning piles of dead bodies,

2443
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,480
satanic art everywhere, a giant FEMA camp on it publicly.

2444
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:07,960
Sure.

2445
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,200
Really?

2446
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,320
Yeah, you ever seen the artwork in the Denver airport?

2447
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,160
Bro?

2448
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:12,960
Yeah, so cool.

2449
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,040
This is very strange.

2450
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,720
This is very strange to listen to Alex

2451
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,480
be like, the prison pipeline or the prison industrial complex

2452
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,360
is going to eventually become what it is.

2453
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,760
Like, he's right on about the prison complex.

2454
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,200
And then to hear the crazier conspiracy theory

2455
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,360
from his caller.

2456
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,720
Like, that weirds me out.

2457
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,200
We're living in a complete topsy-turvy world

2458
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,480
because normally, nowadays, he would come out with something

2459
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,960
like, you know, the devil's killing everybody,

2460
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,000
and they're like, yeah, but maybe the devil

2461
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,120
is just trying to raise the corporate tax rate.

2462
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,120
Like, you know, it's a very weird inversion

2463
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,840
of the way this goes.

2464
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,080
Yeah, it is true.

2465
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,920
And speaking of, like, an inversion of the present,

2466
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,040
this next call is fucked up, if you

2467
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,280
consider Alex in the present.

2468
01:28:59,280 --> 01:28:59,960
OK.

2469
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,120
Now, that's what I'm saying.

2470
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,840
We need to increase, you know, demanding that they bring

2471
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,080
these people to justice, the whole Bush administration

2472
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:12,440
and all these surf minions and bootlickers.

2473
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,720
Well, let me ask you a question.

2474
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,880
You certainly know that Bush is just a puppet, though, right?

2475
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:16,680
Right.

2476
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,480
We need to get his puppet mask.

2477
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,880
Well, I would agree that the Rothschilds and others

2478
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,800
need to be exposed.

2479
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,120
We've got a person exposing them.

2480
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:24,760
They need to be exterminated like they

2481
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,760
had a plan for everybody else.

2482
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,320
If it's good enough for everybody else,

2483
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,880
it's probably good enough for them.

2484
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,440
Well, I'm not sure my audio's cutting out,

2485
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:36,240
but I appreciate your call, Omar.

2486
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:36,840
Right.

2487
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,840
Your audio is cutting out.

2488
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,440
Wow.

2489
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:38,920
Sure.

2490
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:39,520
Wow.

2491
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,480
His caller said that they need to exterminate their enemies.

2492
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:47,840
And the puppet masters of the globalist puppets like Bush.

2493
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,440
Jesus.

2494
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:52,360
And Alex pretends that he didn't hear him and goes to break.

2495
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,320
When he comes back from the break,

2496
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,440
he makes a point to bring this back up.

2497
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,200
I talked to the folks running the show.

2498
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,840
I wanted to, because I wasn't sure.

2499
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,800
I heard what I heard from Curtis.

2500
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,880
Or no, it wasn't Curtis.

2501
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,080
Curtis is coming up.

2502
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,720
That was, I was talking to Omar last segment

2503
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:12,880
from Michigan, and so I did hear what I thought I heard.

2504
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,360
My audio was low.

2505
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,760
Omar, let me explain something to you, OK?

2506
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,680
I'm sure you're a nice person and mean well,

2507
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,760
and I appreciate your hard work, and you

2508
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,880
say you're waking folks up.

2509
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,440
But look, I've tried to make this clear,

2510
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,360
and this is what I truly believe and know,

2511
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,040
and I know what I'm talking about.

2512
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:33,960
I work on this probably harder than anybody else.

2513
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,120
Fighting the new world order, defending my family,

2514
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:39,800
standing against crime, standing against evil.

2515
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,600
Have you not learned what I've said here, what history shows?

2516
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,800
The globalists carry out violent acts

2517
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,480
against their own institutions as a way

2518
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:54,440
to legitimize power and control and domination

2519
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,160
and the destruction of liberty.

2520
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:00,040
Violence is not the way to go.

2521
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,960
I will say it over and over and over again.

2522
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,080
Now, I know that Alex says politically,

2523
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,440
I want to kill you in the future or whatever.

2524
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,120
He'll give lip service to the idea of nonviolence.

2525
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,080
This is an instance where he clearly

2526
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,640
was caught off guard by this caller saying,

2527
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,360
we need to exterminate these folks,

2528
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,520
and then went to break and decided to come back,

2529
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:27,880
re-bring it up to stress that violence is not the way to go.

2530
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,120
Dan, haven't you heard the old adage?

2531
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:34,920
If you're not a liberal at 20, you have no heart.

2532
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,400
And if you don't want to exterminate the poor at 40,

2533
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,240
you have no brain.

2534
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,480
Everybody knows this.

2535
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,960
There's a real sense that I get that Alex might be a little bit

2536
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:51,320
more keenly aware of how dangerous some

2537
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,800
of the people who are drawn to his world view may be.

2538
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,200
Possible.

2539
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,520
I don't know, though.

2540
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,960
It's foreign as hell.

2541
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,480
Maybe he just doesn't have the, I mean,

2542
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,680
he's just more in a vulnerable position, you know?

2543
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,000
He's still got bosses at this time.

2544
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,240
He doesn't have complete autocratic, yeah, well,

2545
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,120
that's fair.

2546
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,160
But I mean, he still has to answer to someone.

2547
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,520
There is still someone above him.

2548
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,960
And now there is no one above him.

2549
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,280
Well, his dad is HR.

2550
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,840
I don't know if his dad is still alive.

2551
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,920
I think this is a psycho situation where his dad is

2552
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,040
actually in his attic a skeleton.

2553
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,880
I just think it's very interesting that Alex is,

2554
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,920
I mean, it's still, like, obviously this broadcast is

2555
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,720
still incredibly irresponsible, but there

2556
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:44,040
is a complete world of difference

2557
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:49,920
between taking a step back to calmly and emphatically stress

2558
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,600
that there's no violence.

2559
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,560
Violence is no good.

2560
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,720
It's not the answer.

2561
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:57,280
And Alex's long pornographic rants

2562
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,800
about slitting people's throats and talking

2563
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,440
about how all the globalists are already dead and all

2564
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,880
this in the present day.

2565
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,880
Yeah, I mean, if you want to, that's such a bullshit

2566
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,240
argument, cancel culture.

2567
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:14,480
Look at how people act when there are possible consequences.

2568
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,760
Look at how people act whenever you just

2569
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:21,320
know that consequences are available versus when you act

2570
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,600
when there are absolutely none.

2571
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,400
To be done.

2572
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,440
There's something to be said for that.

2573
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,640
You know, it's there.

2574
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,440
It's there.

2575
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,360
You act better.

2576
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,560
So I think that this leads Alex into.

2577
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,920
Or at least psychos do.

2578
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,400
Alex, for the rest of the episode,

2579
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,880
he gets into a bit of a headspace

2580
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,960
where he's saying things that, like, a lot of it

2581
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,880
sounds pretty good.

2582
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,760
I don't believe him.

2583
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,120
And obviously, because I know where his show goes.

2584
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:45,920
Sure, sure.

2585
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,720
Certainly don't.

2586
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,080
Living in the future is tough.

2587
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,080
Don't think that he means it, but.

2588
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:55,200
We have just got to continue to be bold, to be loving,

2589
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,120
to stand against this evil.

2590
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,920
Hate is not going to power us.

2591
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,520
Hate is not going to get the job done.

2592
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,600
Now, certainly, you have a right to defend yourself

2593
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,800
against criminals and against people that are assaulting you

2594
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,640
and assaulting your family.

2595
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:14,080
But offensively, offensively, it is

2596
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:19,880
wrong to go after the illegitimate government

2597
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,120
because they want that.

2598
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,960
That's the reason?

2599
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,320
I guess?

2600
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,120
It's really interesting for Alex to say

2601
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,520
that hate can't power their movement or whatever.

2602
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,560
Because, I mean, I would say that that's

2603
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,360
one of the major problems with the right wing

2604
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,840
as it exists today.

2605
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,560
Yeah, yeah.

2606
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,680
Because hate fuels their worldview.

2607
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,840
And I think it did, too, for Alex in 2003.

2608
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,360
Totally.

2609
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,360
Maybe he wasn't even as aware of it.

2610
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,360
It's not as overt.

2611
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,240
Yeah.

2612
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,680
Or he just casts such a wide net,

2613
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,080
he doesn't even know the difference

2614
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,920
between hate and not hate.

2615
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,040
And so, you know, you got this head space

2616
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,840
where you don't want to exterminate your enemies.

2617
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:03,720
No, that would be bad.

2618
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,600
Alex just wants them to back off.

2619
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,160
Sure.

2620
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,160
Back off, globalists.

2621
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,040
Sure.

2622
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,680
We are not revolutionaries.

2623
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,840
We are restorationists.

2624
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,200
We want America, the republic, back.

2625
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,960
Back.

2626
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,400
We just want the globalists to stop what they're doing

2627
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,200
and to back off.

2628
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:25,080
And we know that when they see weakness, they attack.

2629
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,280
We know when they see ignorance, they move forward.

2630
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,640
And I want to advise the globalists right now,

2631
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,440
I want to give you some really good advice.

2632
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,600
And you can check.

2633
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:37,080
I've done 800 radio interviews since 9-1-1.

2634
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,920
800 now.

2635
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,280
I've done my own syndicated show on AM and FM's

2636
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,240
all over the country.

2637
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,800
That doesn't count as an interview.

2638
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,080
I have a website that gets millions of hits a month.

2639
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,440
Definitely doesn't count as an interview.

2640
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,600
Let me tell you, for every 500 positive emails,

2641
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,680
I get one negative.

2642
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:55,160
And the people are so incoherent,

2643
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:58,480
they are probably going to be IQs or lower.

2644
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,000
I have done 800 interviews.

2645
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,160
And one out of 30 callers disagrees with me.

2646
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,040
Folks, let me tell you something, globalists.

2647
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,040
You're in a lot of trouble.

2648
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,360
They're in so much trouble.

2649
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,760
Alex has good reviews.

2650
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:13,040
And people often don't find it worth their time

2651
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,120
to argue with them, I guess.

2652
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,720
But yeah, they just need to back off.

2653
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,480
And hey, there's good news.

2654
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,360
I've got some advice for Alex.

2655
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,920
Back off.

2656
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,160
Why would he?

2657
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,520
They're winning or something.

2658
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,720
Sure.

2659
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,880
I would say that if the globalists, when they see

2660
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,880
weakness, they attack.

2661
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,560
And when they see dumbness, they move forward.

2662
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,160
Sure.

2663
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,640
The preceding eight years after this

2664
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,760
indicate that Alex and all of his friends are dumb and weak.

2665
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:43,720
Yes, correct.

2666
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,960
Because the globalists didn't stop anything

2667
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:46,800
according to Alex.

2668
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,680
That is exactly what they proved.

2669
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,960
That's interesting.

2670
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,680
In 2003, it turns out there's not many globalists.

2671
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,040
You know what's going on.

2672
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:59,760
And if you sit there and shake and coward and sit there,

2673
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,440
you're delivering your children into a living hell,

2674
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,520
a hell on Earth, Hades on Earth.

2675
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,320
And I'm here to tell you that it's a handful.

2676
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,360
A few thousand globalist managers,

2677
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:16,440
a few dozen families that own this thing,

2678
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,080
they're counting on you being ignorant.

2679
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,280
If you find out they're counting on you being afraid

2680
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:23,200
and being cowardly, you have got to be men.

2681
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,960
You have got to be women.

2682
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,840
You have got to be strong.

2683
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:30,920
You have got to do whatever it takes

2684
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,600
to stand up against this evil and to speak out

2685
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,240
and to not be violent and to tell the truth

2686
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,000
and let them burn us at the stake

2687
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,440
if they want to in the arena, I'm ready.

2688
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,600
I believe what Jesus Christ said.

2689
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,160
I believe in decency.

2690
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,880
I believe in wholesomeness.

2691
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,960
Wholesomeness.

2692
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:50,800
Wholesome.

2693
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,920
That's how I would describe his show in the present day.

2694
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:53,760
Wholesome.

2695
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,600
Very wholesome.

2696
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,440
Wholesome.

2697
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,680
Reminds me of the Buttercream Gang.

2698
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,240
That's what it reminds me of.

2699
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,080
Yeah.

2700
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:04,640
That's who I think of when I think of Alex, Owen,

2701
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,400
Harrison, whites are the best Smith.

2702
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,920
I think of the Buttercream Gang.

2703
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,680
Yeah, this was just really weird.

2704
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,840
Cause it was, I mean, it's fill in time

2705
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,560
and it's just a long rant more or less

2706
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,040
just about how like we gotta be peaceful.

2707
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:22,880
Yeah.

2708
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,720
We can't be hateful.

2709
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,560
Sure.

2710
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,640
The globalists are in trouble cause we're so popular

2711
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:30,600
and you have to be strong and we believe in wholesomeness.

2712
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,640
It's all goodness.

2713
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,480
Oh yeah.

2714
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,880
And it all seems to be in response

2715
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,880
to that caller bringing up extermination

2716
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:37,800
of the enemies.

2717
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,040
It does seem like it's genuine too.

2718
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:40,880
I wonder if-

2719
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,080
I mean in a certain sense.

2720
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,120
I wonder if it's also in part because Alex

2721
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,640
was probably pretty excited about getting these DJs on

2722
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:47,640
and it didn't go well.

2723
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,480
Sure.

2724
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,800
I wonder if that plays into his mood a little bit.

2725
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2726
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,520
Since we know that generally speaking

2727
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,240
what comes out of his mouth is the result

2728
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,080
of how he's feeling.

2729
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:57,920
Yeah.

2730
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,360
As opposed to what's going on.

2731
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,200
Yeah, yeah.

2732
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,920
And I think that maybe the fact that that didn't

2733
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,720
wasn't something he could build on at all

2734
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:05,640
and he's just gonna have to pretend

2735
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,600
that interview never happened.

2736
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,400
Yeah, that's basically what he's doing, yes.

2737
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,240
Yeah.

2738
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,520
It's a mulligan or whatever.

2739
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,360
Yeah, yeah.

2740
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:13,920
Yeah, I wonder.

2741
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,760
That'd be interesting.

2742
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,000
Anyway, one of the things that we discovered

2743
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,640
through every period of time that we've looked through

2744
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,040
at least the last few years.

2745
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:23,880
Sure.

2746
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:24,960
Going back into 2015.

2747
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:25,800
Right.

2748
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,680
Even prior to Trump's candidacy, Alex loves Putin.

2749
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,520
True.

2750
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,360
And Russia.

2751
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,440
Loves him.

2752
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:34,800
Big strong man, I think he saw him on that horse

2753
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:35,640
without his shirt on.

2754
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,200
Well, he had a stretch where he was like,

2755
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,280
it was bad that Putin kills journalists.

2756
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,520
Yeah, that was a little farther back.

2757
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,160
That was a little bit farther back, yeah.

2758
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,000
True, true, true.

2759
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,040
That was what, 2013?

2760
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,280
Well, here's 2003.

2761
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,120
Okay.

2762
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:52,240
Look folks, Putin got caught.

2763
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:56,040
Moscow police arrested FSB, the new KGB,

2764
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,160
planning bombs in a fourth Moscow apartment building.

2765
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,120
They took him to jail, they had him.

2766
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,640
Putin's police raided it, arrested the cops,

2767
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,400
took the bombs, that's a fact.

2768
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,240
You know, government has to blow up its own stuff

2769
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,760
as an excuse to crack down on you.

2770
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,080
Figure that out.

2771
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,680
In the present day, Alex does not believe this.

2772
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,400
Oh no, absolutely not.

2773
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,600
He does not believe that Putin was behind the bombings

2774
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,120
that were blamed on the Chechen rebels.

2775
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:26,040
No longer an expedient truth to know about.

2776
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,960
Now, I think that there's something interesting about this,

2777
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,640
and that is, when was the lie?

2778
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,880
Was he lying about it being a fact in 2003?

2779
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:38,720
Yeah.

2780
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,560
Or is he lying now?

2781
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,400
Yeah.

2782
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,080
You gotta...

2783
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,120
Or does he just not care?

2784
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:44,960
I think he doesn't care.

2785
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,400
Yeah, I mean, I think to a certain extent,

2786
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,080
like when you think about a lie,

2787
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,400
you do think about somebody with malicious intent

2788
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:56,640
or at the very least, like desire to hide information

2789
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,920
or something like that.

2790
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:02,080
And to me, what I'm seeing from all of this totality now

2791
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,800
is just a man who just doesn't give a fuck

2792
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,280
if it's true or not or whatever.

2793
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,280
He's not lying, he just doesn't care.

2794
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,640
You know, he's just beyond lying or not lying.

2795
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:16,440
He's just making up his own reality that he exists in

2796
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:19,080
from a moment to moment point of view.

2797
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,440
Yeah, and there's some things

2798
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,360
that seem pretty consistently important.

2799
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:23,200
Yeah.

2800
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,280
Like him being left alone, Christian supremacy,

2801
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,520
whiteness and guns. Totally, yeah.

2802
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:31,680
And then he's figured out some sort of routines

2803
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:35,000
that work pretty well, like the vaccine lies

2804
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
and stuff that you just see him doing consistently.

2805
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,320
Yeah, anyway, Alex has another caller.

2806
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:42,320
Oh, jeez.

2807
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,160
I just keep this in

2808
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,640
because I think it makes Alex look like a dick.

2809
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,680
Yeah, I want you to take 50 copies of Road to Tyranny

2810
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:49,520
and hand it out to everybody.

2811
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,640
I can't, I only have one VCR.

2812
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,040
I can't copy it yet.

2813
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,680
Need to buy another one, pay the 50 bucks,

2814
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,160
buy the blank tapes and do it.

2815
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,680
I guess, yeah, I know, but I don't even have 50 bucks.

2816
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,520
I'm doing what I can.

2817
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,360
Well, go to your neighbor, get it,

2818
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,880
whenever you have to.

2819
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:04,720
All right.

2820
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,560
What?

2821
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:09,760
Wow, that is presaging his televangelism right there.

2822
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,600
Yeah.

2823
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,040
He doesn't get more televangelist then.

2824
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,560
Oh, sell your home, sell your home.

2825
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,320
Give me, ask your kids for money to give it to me.

2826
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,160
Go to your neighbor.

2827
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,000
I need a private jet.

2828
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,920
Go to your neighbor to go get money to buy a second VCR

2829
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,960
so you can make copies of my movies.

2830
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,120
Which you will give to your neighbor.

2831
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,280
Yeah.

2832
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:29,640
Wow.

2833
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,480
Oh boy.

2834
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,800
Anyway, I thought that was asshole-ish.

2835
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,040
That's real dick-ish.

2836
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:37,360
Yeah, I can't imagine the level of narcissistic

2837
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,520
you have to be to have multiple follow-ups

2838
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,200
when someone's explaining why they can't copy your tapes.

2839
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,520
No, I mean, it's sales, you know?

2840
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:50,680
That's that like, Bill, rich dad, poor dad,

2841
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:52,280
like don't take no for an answer shit.

2842
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:55,160
And you're like, no, that's psychopathic, you nutbag.

2843
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:57,720
Back when I worked in telemarketing,

2844
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,520
if your calls were monitored, like you would get in trouble

2845
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:01,960
if you didn't have two rebuttals.

2846
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:02,800
Yeah, exactly.

2847
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,680
And that seems like what Alex is doing there,

2848
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:08,200
but it's not sales, you're talking to a person.

2849
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,520
Yeah, exactly.

2850
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,360
But I guess it is sales.

2851
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,680
About bullshit.

2852
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,680
So we have one last clip here from May 9th.

2853
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:18,040
And again, it's Alex talking about his enemies.

2854
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,360
There's no mention of the devil.

2855
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,200
Are you sure it's not the devil?

2856
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,800
It's like Monday's Night Ritter headline,

2857
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,360
Night Ritter newspapers.

2858
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,960
Neocons call for New World Order.

2859
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,200
Well, it's not the Neocons.

2860
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,400
They're just the puppets of the day.

2861
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,760
When they say Ashcroft wants Patriot Act Two,

2862
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,080
no, the globalists want Patriot Act Two.

2863
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,760
Don't be diverted by just these low level puppet nobodies.

2864
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:40,480
Be focused on the real power, the New World Order bankers.

2865
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,320
God bless you all.

2866
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,160
Have a good weekend.

2867
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,360
See you back at nine, nine to midnight.

2868
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,320
Yeah, so it's New World Order bankers.

2869
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:49,280
I mean,

2870
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,640
I guess.

2871
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,640
Multiple times in these two days,

2872
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:01,240
he clearly expresses who he feels he's up against.

2873
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:02,160
Yeah.

2874
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,200
And it's all terrestrial concerns.

2875
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:07,720
It's not an elaborate conspiracy of dimensions.

2876
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:08,560
It's not.

2877
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,400
No.

2878
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:10,240
It's not metaphysical.

2879
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,960
He didn't get any dreams when he was 10.

2880
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,800
Nothing.

2881
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,920
He wasn't a Satanist.

2882
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,760
No.

2883
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:15,600
Nope.

2884
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,960
And I mean like this doesn't prove

2885
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,000
that he never talks about any of this stuff,

2886
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,160
but like a lot of the themes that you would think

2887
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:25,560
might have been important are not important.

2888
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,880
And if they normally come up now,

2889
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,880
if he brings up something similar to these topics,

2890
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:34,400
there's always that personal element of like,

2891
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,560
you know, I was a Satanist.

2892
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,400
You know, like that.

2893
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:37,240
None of that shit.

2894
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:38,060
None of that.

2895
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:38,900
None of it.

2896
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:39,720
Brutal.

2897
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,560
No talk about Epstein.

2898
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,400
No talk about cabals of secret child trading,

2899
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,240
blood drinking.

2900
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:47,240
Not even any Bill Gates.

2901
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,320
Oh, he does mention Bill Gates at one point.

2902
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,160
Oh, does he?

2903
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,000
Yeah.

2904
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,400
But Gates isn't in there with the Rothschilds

2905
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,800
and the Bilderbergs at Citra.

2906
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,240
No, this is a side mention of Bill Gates,

2907
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,360
but I mean, of course he's been relevant for a long time

2908
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,840
and a philanthropist.

2909
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,320
And a piece of shit.

2910
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,280
Alex hates that because it works counter

2911
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,960
to his political positions of doing everything he can

2912
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,960
to hurt the developing world.

2913
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,800
Right.

2914
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,800
Anyway, I enjoyed a little bit of this

2915
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:17,000
in as much as, you know, the Dixie chick deejays.

2916
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,840
Yeah.

2917
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,720
We're interviewed.

2918
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,440
What a bunch of dicks.

2919
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:23,660
But, and I think that it's certainly,

2920
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:25,680
I don't even want to know what Alex is doing

2921
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,280
in the present day, quite frankly.

2922
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,120
Oh no.

2923
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,120
Good God, no.

2924
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:34,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2925
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,120
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2926
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,800
I'm conflicted about whether or not

2927
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,040
there's a need to cover present day.

2928
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:41,880
Oh my God.

2929
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,700
We will see.

2930
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:43,540
We'll see.

2931
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:44,380
Oh, sweet Jesus.

2932
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,840
Anyway, whatever ends up happening, we'll be back.

2933
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:47,880
Yes, we will.

2934
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:48,980
But until then, we have a website.

2935
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:49,820
We do have a website.

2936
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:50,720
It's knowledgefight.com.

2937
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,600
Yes, we're also on Twitter.

2938
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,800
We are on Twitter.

2939
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,920
It's at knowledgefight.com.

2940
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:55,760
Go to bed, Jordan.

2941
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,580
We're also on Facebook.

2942
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:58,420
We are on Facebook.

2943
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:59,360
I too said if you could,

2944
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,520
please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

2945
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,160
to help out people doing God's work right now.

2946
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,000
Yep, we'll be back.

2947
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,440
But until then, I'm Neo.

2948
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,260
I'm Leo.

2949
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:08,100
I'm DZX Clark.

2950
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:09,640
I'm Daryl Rundes.

2951
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:12,600
This podcast is secretly brought to you by Clear Channel

2952
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:15,320
and an elaborate conspiracy to sell tickets

2953
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:19,200
to Alex Jones's live cabaret review.

2954
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,600
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

2955
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,560
Thanks for holding.

2956
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:24,100
Hello, Alex.

2957
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:24,940
I'm a first time caller.

2958
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:25,760
I'm a huge fan.

2959
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,600
I love your work.

2960
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:49,600
I love you.
