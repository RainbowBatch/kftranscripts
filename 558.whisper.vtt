00:12.960 --> 00:18.080
Damn, Ed, Jordan, I am SWEATING

00:18.080 --> 00:21.360
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.360 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:23.920 --> 00:25.040
knowledgefight

00:25.040 --> 00:28.880
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys

00:28.880 --> 00:29.920
knowledgefight

00:29.920 --> 00:30.960
Dan and Jordan

Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:34.480 --> 00:36.320
I need, I need money

00:36.320 --> 00:39.280
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:39.280 --> 00:40.320
Andy and Kansas

00:40.320 --> 00:42.800
Andy and, Andy, stop it

00:42.800 --> 00:44.480
Andy and, Andy and Kansas

00:44.480 --> 00:47.040
Andy and, Andy, it's time to pray

00:47.040 --> 00:49.280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding me

00:49.280 --> 00:51.680
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:51.680 --> 00:52.880
I love your world

00:56.800 --> 00:59.280
I love you

00:59.280 --> 01:01.280
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight, I'm Dan

01:01.280 --> 01:01.920
I'm Jordan

01:01.920 --> 01:05.680
We're a couple dudes, I like to sit around, worship at the cult of Selene's altar and

01:05.680 --> 01:06.560
talk about Alex Jeff

01:06.560 --> 01:08.080
Indeed we are Dan

01:08.080 --> 01:10.240
Not as smooth as the first time I got it right

01:10.240 --> 01:13.200
I know, it was, but you're getting there, we're getting there

01:13.200 --> 01:14.720
It's practice, it's work

01:15.600 --> 01:19.680
You know what, a lot of people need to see the process of becoming good

01:19.680 --> 01:21.120
instead of just seeing the finished product

01:21.120 --> 01:25.120
No, definitely, and I consider this part of my 10,000 hours towards getting that introduction

01:25.120 --> 01:27.120
Absolutely, absolutely

01:27.120 --> 01:31.120
Also part of your 10,000 hours towards telling Malcolm Gladwell he's a moron

01:31.680 --> 01:33.680
I consider that my community service

01:33.680 --> 01:34.240
Good stuff

01:34.960 --> 01:35.600
Hey Jordan

01:35.600 --> 01:37.520
Hey Dan, I have a question for you

01:37.520 --> 01:38.320
What's up?

01:38.320 --> 01:39.360
What's your bright spot today?

01:39.360 --> 01:43.760
My bright spot today is actually, maybe you should go first

01:43.760 --> 01:44.480
Maybe I should go first

01:44.480 --> 01:45.600
Mine might be a little extended

01:45.600 --> 01:47.920
Alright, okay, mine's just loud

01:49.920 --> 01:51.360
Well, preemptively, neighbors

01:51.360 --> 01:52.160
Neighbors, fair enough

01:52.160 --> 01:56.800
My bright spot, Dan, is Shohei Ohtani

01:57.440 --> 01:59.680
Today just hit his 12th home run to win

01:59.680 --> 02:00.400
Congratulations

02:00.400 --> 02:02.800
It's incredible, and he has a

02:02.800 --> 02:03.840
Is he on the Cubs?

02:03.840 --> 02:06.000
No, absolutely not, no, he's on the Angels

02:06.000 --> 02:10.560
He hit his 12th home run, and he has an ERA around 2

02:10.560 --> 02:14.240
And he has several, I mean this dude, here's why he's my bright spot

02:14.240 --> 02:14.800
So he's a pitcher

02:16.000 --> 02:17.840
He's everything, Dan

02:17.840 --> 02:23.120
He is the only baseball player on this planet that has ever lived

02:23.120 --> 02:30.000
Who can reliably throw a 100 mile an hour fastball and hit 450 foot dingers on the regular

02:30.000 --> 02:32.720
And I have thought about that, and here's why it's my bright spot

02:32.720 --> 02:40.160
Is because unlike so many other achievements, right now is the only time in history that

02:40.160 --> 02:43.040
anyone has ever done what Shohei Ohtani is doing

02:43.040 --> 02:49.760
And maybe he's the only person who has ever lived out of the 50 billion people estimated

02:50.560 --> 02:52.000
He's the only one who can do this

02:52.000 --> 02:54.720
That's really, really insane to me

02:54.720 --> 02:58.480
For some of our international wonks in baseball

02:58.480 --> 03:02.080
It's very rare for a pitcher to be able to hit well

03:02.080 --> 03:04.640
No, no, no, no, that's not what it's rare

03:04.640 --> 03:05.760
But you can hit well

03:05.760 --> 03:07.760
It is rare for a pitcher to hit well

03:07.760 --> 03:08.160
Yeah

03:08.160 --> 03:14.960
It is not rare for a pitcher to hit what is he's on pace for over 40 home runs in a season

03:14.960 --> 03:15.600
That is crazy

03:15.600 --> 03:16.640
That's not rare

03:16.640 --> 03:18.240
That's never happened

03:18.240 --> 03:21.840
Anybody who wants to talk to me about Babe Ruth can shove it up their ass

03:21.840 --> 03:25.840
Babe Ruth hit home runs off of people who threw slower than I do

03:25.840 --> 03:26.400
Sure

03:26.400 --> 03:28.080
Babe Ruth is shit

03:28.720 --> 03:30.400
Babe Ruth is garbage

03:30.400 --> 03:33.520
He was a garbage human being who played against garbage baseball players

03:33.520 --> 03:34.000
Understood

03:34.000 --> 03:42.080
For some context, one half of Major League Baseball as an organization doesn't make pitchers hit

03:42.080 --> 03:45.760
That's how not good at hitting generally pitchers are

03:45.760 --> 03:46.000
Yes

03:47.440 --> 03:51.520
Part of the game was like, these guys are so bad at hitting, we have to change it

03:51.520 --> 03:52.480
Yeah, let's not bog it down

03:52.480 --> 03:54.720
I was going to make a joke about Jeff Supon

03:56.880 --> 04:00.480
I believe famously hit a home run in the World Series for the Cardinals

04:00.480 --> 04:00.960
He did

04:00.960 --> 04:06.240
No, there was the Cubs reliever, I can't remember his name off the top of my head

04:06.240 --> 04:11.920
But he was one of the last people to hit a home run in a playoff game as a relief pitcher

04:11.920 --> 04:12.480
Hell yeah

04:12.480 --> 04:13.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah

04:13.360 --> 04:13.680
Rare

04:14.400 --> 04:14.960
Very rare

04:17.280 --> 04:18.080
But the point is

04:18.080 --> 04:18.720
You get to see him play

04:18.720 --> 04:20.160
There's only one

04:20.160 --> 04:21.440
There's only one

04:21.440 --> 04:24.000
Like, how insane is that?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.200
There's only one person

04:25.200 --> 04:28.640
But I also think about this, you're saying he's on pace for that

04:28.640 --> 04:29.120
Sure

04:29.120 --> 04:32.720
That to me, I just imagine being in that position, being in those shoes

04:32.720 --> 04:34.560
Like, I don't know how you would handle that pressure

04:34.560 --> 04:35.840
Yeah, no, totally

04:35.840 --> 04:38.240
I don't know how he could, you know, I don't know

04:38.800 --> 04:42.880
But he grew up in the Japanese Baseball Leagues, which if you've never

04:42.880 --> 04:47.840
Like in the Japanese Baseball Leagues, if you're eight playing for your team

04:47.840 --> 04:51.920
You have the same amount of pressure as a Major Leaguer in the United States

04:51.920 --> 04:53.440
I don't know if you know anything about it

04:53.440 --> 04:54.080
I don't, I have not looked into this at all

04:54.080 --> 04:55.600
But they are fucking intense

04:55.600 --> 04:56.000
Okay

04:56.000 --> 04:56.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah

04:56.720 --> 05:00.080
So Jordan, my bright spot is I made a little trip

05:00.080 --> 05:03.760
Long overdue trip down to the box, the mailbox

05:03.760 --> 05:04.240
Yes, indeed

05:04.240 --> 05:06.160
And I have some stuff to take out of the bag

05:06.160 --> 05:06.560
Yep

05:06.560 --> 05:07.280
Excellent

05:07.280 --> 05:12.800
One thing I realized, I didn't mention this when it was my birthday

05:12.800 --> 05:15.280
Because it also included a gift for your birthday

05:15.280 --> 05:17.760
And I forgot when your birthday came around

05:17.760 --> 05:20.960
But our Black Dragon Queen Christie sent a very nice care package

05:20.960 --> 05:21.920
Oh yes, of course

05:21.920 --> 05:23.760
So thank you so much for that

05:23.760 --> 05:24.640
Oh, absolutely

05:24.640 --> 05:30.640
And then I went to the mailbag and there was some other stuff that was a bit birthday related

05:31.760 --> 05:36.720
Bex sent in some young ginger ale, which I don't know what that is

05:36.720 --> 05:37.440
Me neither

05:37.440 --> 05:39.600
Young ginger, could be a wrap name

05:40.480 --> 05:43.840
It could be Carl Jung's specific ginger line

05:43.840 --> 05:44.240
Sure

05:44.240 --> 05:47.760
Also, I believe Bex sent a pink ukulele

05:48.640 --> 05:50.480
Which I'm a little confused by

05:51.280 --> 05:53.360
But I'm excited to try to learn

05:53.360 --> 05:58.160
I was trying to learn a couple chords last night while I was playing around with it

05:58.160 --> 05:59.440
And my fingers are too fat

06:00.000 --> 06:01.600
So I don't know if it's gonna work out

06:01.600 --> 06:03.680
But what happened to those knowledge fight guys?

06:03.680 --> 06:06.160
They turned into a weird ukulele band, I don't know

06:06.160 --> 06:07.680
But we could do some cover songs

06:07.680 --> 06:08.640
Yeah, why not?

06:08.640 --> 06:09.440
Absolutely

06:09.440 --> 06:10.320
Also

06:10.320 --> 06:14.000
You Belong in the City is ripe for a ukulele parody

06:14.000 --> 06:18.800
Also in this was the Sega Mega Drive Classics for the Switch

06:18.800 --> 06:19.840
All right

06:19.840 --> 06:25.040
And I've been used to seeing these kinds of collections of old games

06:25.040 --> 06:25.680
Sure, sure, sure

06:25.680 --> 06:29.680
And typically they end up not having the license to have like actually good games on it

06:30.400 --> 06:31.360
But this is pretty solid

06:31.360 --> 06:33.520
You got Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine

06:33.520 --> 06:34.080
Sure

06:34.080 --> 06:34.640
Classic

06:34.640 --> 06:35.440
Gotta have that

06:35.440 --> 06:41.120
Sonic, Sonic 2, Toejam and Earl, Vector Man

06:42.320 --> 06:44.720
Are you reading them in chronological order?

06:44.720 --> 06:45.680
Comic Zone

06:47.200 --> 06:49.280
Oh shit, I do remember Comic Zone

06:49.280 --> 06:52.240
Wow, the past is far away

06:52.240 --> 06:54.400
The entire Streets of Rage trilogy

06:54.400 --> 06:56.560
Okay, well that we haven't had in a long time

06:56.560 --> 06:59.600
There's a whole lot of stuff on there and it's very nice

06:59.600 --> 07:03.120
It's been a long time since I've moved from left to right and punched things

07:03.120 --> 07:06.640
Yeah, there are a couple games that are entirely that

07:07.920 --> 07:11.200
So then I got another thing here

07:11.920 --> 07:13.760
And this was a little bit weird, Jordan

07:13.760 --> 07:17.760
I feel like I'm gonna need your help because I think this might have actually been for you

07:17.760 --> 07:19.120
Okay, okay

07:19.120 --> 07:21.280
So here, this card came

07:21.280 --> 07:23.120
And look at the front, look at the front

07:23.120 --> 07:23.760
Alright, alright

07:24.480 --> 07:32.960
Okay, there is a dog resting his, well there's a puppy resting his very cute, very lovable face

07:32.960 --> 07:38.080
On top of a kitten who is staring cute and lovable

07:38.080 --> 07:39.840
Now look at this, look at this on the inside

07:39.840 --> 07:44.640
It says, yeah, we listen and we have feelings too, comma, Jordan

07:44.640 --> 07:44.880
Right

07:44.880 --> 07:47.040
Love, comma, nothing

07:47.040 --> 07:47.760
Nothing

07:47.760 --> 07:48.400
Okay

07:48.400 --> 07:51.360
Now, this came inside a box

07:51.360 --> 07:52.080
Okay

07:52.080 --> 07:54.960
That had two mugs and this is one of them

07:54.960 --> 07:59.840
Okay, alright, you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free, alright

07:59.840 --> 08:03.280
Central Intelligence Agency, sure, sure

08:03.280 --> 08:07.760
Now, there is a sticker on the bottom that implies that this came from a gift shop

08:07.760 --> 08:08.800
Yes indeed

08:08.800 --> 08:17.360
So, either the CIA is trying to fuck with you and let you know, Jordan, that they're listening

08:17.360 --> 08:18.720
And you have hurt their feelings

08:18.720 --> 08:20.240
I don't understand

08:20.960 --> 08:23.200
Either the CIA is very sensitive

08:26.080 --> 08:28.480
Or it's somebody fucking with us, I'm not entirely sure

08:28.480 --> 08:33.280
Alright, yeah, dot, dot, dot, yeah, we, but who's we?

08:33.840 --> 08:34.480
CIA, man

08:34.480 --> 08:38.000
It's the CIA, but I mean, why would they send me a cute little puppy?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.760
It was from a nondescript address in Virginia

08:41.760 --> 08:44.400
Oh, well, that would kind of make sense then, wouldn't it?

08:44.400 --> 08:47.680
I don't know, it's entirely possible, but I mean,

08:47.680 --> 08:50.000
Occam's Razor tells me that it's someone fucking with you

08:51.040 --> 08:52.640
But I still appreciate a mug

08:52.640 --> 08:53.040
Sure

08:53.040 --> 08:54.000
I like a nice mug

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
Admit how ironic it would be for Alex to constantly claim that the CIA and all important heads

09:00.000 --> 09:05.840
of state listen to him and yet we get very kind, almost downright cute cards from the CIA

09:05.840 --> 09:07.600
Letting us know that they are listening

09:08.160 --> 09:09.520
And that you are being too mean

09:09.520 --> 09:12.960
I apologize to the CIA, I guess

09:12.960 --> 09:13.440
Wow

09:13.440 --> 09:17.280
Is that what I do? Is that all it takes? It takes a cute kitten and a cute puppy

09:17.280 --> 09:19.600
Jordan has issued an apology to the CIA

09:19.600 --> 09:22.640
See now, what they don't realize, it does take both

09:22.640 --> 09:27.840
For all of our leftist listeners out there that really look at Jordan as this kind of like,

09:27.840 --> 09:30.080
oh yeah, he gets it, he's on the edge, man

09:30.720 --> 09:32.800
He just apologized to the CIA

09:34.560 --> 09:35.680
I would be surprised

09:35.680 --> 09:36.720
Centrist Jordan

09:36.720 --> 09:40.400
Honestly, I would be surprised to know too many leftists who,

09:40.400 --> 09:44.160
upon receiving a cute puppy or kitten card, wouldn't be like

09:45.360 --> 09:48.960
I mean, it softens me a little bit just to know that cute puppies

09:48.960 --> 09:50.720
Oh, damn it, they got me again

09:50.720 --> 09:52.560
Oh man, I had the CIA all wrong

09:52.560 --> 09:53.280
Oh, damn it

09:54.080 --> 09:56.240
So Jordan, today we got an episode from the past

09:56.240 --> 09:59.200
We are talking about May 8th and 9th, 2003

09:59.200 --> 09:59.840
Ooh, fun

09:59.840 --> 10:00.880
Continuing our march

10:00.880 --> 10:05.360
One of the things I wanted to try to do was I wanted to try to keep pace

10:05.360 --> 10:06.000
Sure

10:06.000 --> 10:08.640
With 2003, I don't think we're going to be able to do that

10:08.640 --> 10:09.360
That's going to be tough

10:09.360 --> 10:11.440
With two episodes a week, it's a little tough

10:11.440 --> 10:12.480
It's going to be a hard fight

10:12.480 --> 10:15.040
But here we are, May 8th and 9th

10:15.680 --> 10:17.040
Got some interesting stuff to go over

10:17.040 --> 10:19.680
Some weird parallels with the present, as per usual

10:19.680 --> 10:19.760
Naturally

10:19.760 --> 10:20.720
Due to my witchcraft

10:20.720 --> 10:21.760
You are a witch

10:21.760 --> 10:26.400
But before we get into this, let's take a little moment to say hello to some wonks

10:26.400 --> 10:27.280
Ooh, that's a good idea

10:27.280 --> 10:29.120
So first, Andrew Buchholt, thank you so much

10:29.120 --> 10:30.400
You are now a policy wonk

10:30.400 --> 10:31.440
I'm a policy wonk

10:31.440 --> 10:32.080
Thanks, Andrew

10:32.080 --> 10:32.560
Thank you

10:32.560 --> 10:34.080
Next, ZZ Pop, thank you so much

10:34.080 --> 10:35.520
You are now a policy wonk

10:35.520 --> 10:36.480
I'm a policy wonk

10:36.480 --> 10:37.360
Thanks, ZZ Pop

10:37.360 --> 10:38.000
Thank you

10:38.000 --> 10:39.920
Next, All Hail the Cult Leader, Selene

10:39.920 --> 10:40.400
Thank you so much

10:40.400 --> 10:41.680
You are now a policy wonk

10:41.680 --> 10:42.720
I'm a policy wonk

10:42.720 --> 10:43.920
Thank you very much

10:43.920 --> 10:44.560
Uh, thank you

10:44.560 --> 10:46.160
Next, Good Good Muscle, Nate

10:46.160 --> 10:46.720
Thank you so much

10:46.720 --> 10:48.000
You are now a policy wonk

10:48.000 --> 10:48.880
I'm a policy wonk

10:48.880 --> 10:50.160
Thanks, Good Good Muscle, Nate

10:50.160 --> 10:50.560
Thank you

10:50.560 --> 10:52.800
Next, Jordan's Banshee, Laugh Is My Bright Spot

10:52.800 --> 10:53.280
Thank you so much

10:53.280 --> 10:54.480
You are now a policy wonk

10:54.480 --> 10:55.840
I'm a policy wonk

10:55.840 --> 10:57.040
Thank you very much

10:57.040 --> 10:57.760
Thank you

10:57.760 --> 10:59.040
Next, Gon AFK

10:59.040 --> 10:59.520
Thank you so much

10:59.520 --> 11:00.720
You are now a policy wonk

11:00.720 --> 11:01.760
I'm a policy wonk

11:01.760 --> 11:03.280
Thank you very much, Gon AFK

11:03.280 --> 11:03.760
Thank you

11:03.760 --> 11:05.520
And we've got a technocrat

11:05.520 --> 11:07.200
To give a little tip of the cap too

11:07.200 --> 11:09.600
So Mr. Mac Mackington, thank you so much.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.320
You are now a technocrat.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.480
I'm a policy wonk.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.240
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.600
Have yourself a brew.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.240
How's your 401k doing, bro?

11:17.240 --> 11:19.880
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.040
Let's just get down to business.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.160
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.120
Why are you pimps so good?

11:25.120 --> 11:26.840
My neck is freakishly large.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.320
I declare info war on you.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.480
Thank you, Mr. Mac Mackington.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.800
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Mac Mackington.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.760
Also, before we get into this, this show business,

11:35.760 --> 11:37.960
the sexual business of the show.

11:37.960 --> 11:38.840
Not show business.

11:38.840 --> 11:39.160
No.

11:39.160 --> 11:39.840
Certainly not.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.280
We've never been in show business.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.320
We have mics we're holding in our hands.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.480
We are not in show business.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.760
No.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.840
I got a message from a Jeff, character named Jeff.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.440
And Jeff wanted to get a message out.

11:50.440 --> 11:54.000
And that is, apparently, they have a friend named Alex,

11:54.000 --> 11:55.840
who's opposed to the spider leadership.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.880
And this is relevant, because you're

11:56.880 --> 11:59.040
wearing the spider leadership t-shirt right now.

11:59.040 --> 11:59.520
Perfect.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.480
So this friend of Jeff's is opposed to you.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.560
OK.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.800
Also, apparently, Jeff's brother, Evan,

12:05.800 --> 12:07.160
just got into the show.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.680
So what up, Evan?

12:08.680 --> 12:09.640
Hi, Evan.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.760
Welcome to the Wonkaree.

12:10.760 --> 12:11.560
What are we doing?

12:11.560 --> 12:12.520
I have no idea.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.320
This is just what we've become, I guess.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.840
Welcoming new listeners individually?

12:16.840 --> 12:17.360
Why?

12:17.360 --> 12:18.680
Why are we doing this?

12:18.680 --> 12:19.320
I don't know.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.400
Don't you realize what can of worms you've opened up again?

12:22.400 --> 12:25.280
Every time you add another thing, it never ends.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.120
Oh, god.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.240
Oh, boy.

12:28.240 --> 12:33.200
So here are a couple out of context drops.

12:33.200 --> 12:33.700
OK.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.800
The first is a little, it's actually

12:35.800 --> 12:37.040
a little game I want to play.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.320
And that is, Alex or Bill Clinton?

12:40.320 --> 12:41.840
OK.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.280
I love this country.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.680
Was that Alex, or was that Bill Clinton?

12:45.680 --> 12:47.000
Do you need to hear that again?

12:47.000 --> 12:47.760
Yes, one more time.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.680
OK, here we go.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.160
I love this country.

12:52.160 --> 12:57.800
OK, we can't do, this is a stolen news radio bit

12:57.800 --> 13:00.960
from four years prior to this show airing.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.720
When Phil Hartman went on as Bill McNeil

13:03.720 --> 13:06.680
and did long interviews with himself as Bill Clinton.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.840
We can't say that it's that.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.440
I will say that it's definitely not that.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.520
It's definitely not that.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.920
It is either Alex Jones sounding a lot like Bill Clinton.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.520
Sure.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.920
Or Bill Clinton with Alex's going

13:16.920 --> 13:18.520
to break music playing in the background.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.080
I'm going to go with Alex on this one.

13:20.080 --> 13:20.600
You're right.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.600
Oh, wait.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.400
So here's Alex doing an impression

13:23.400 --> 13:26.720
of a dude smoking pot.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.880
Yeah, you ever seen the artwork in the Denver airport?

13:28.880 --> 13:31.880
Yeah, man.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.440
It's good to know that the Denver airport will never die.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.720
No, and finally, third out of context drop,

13:36.720 --> 13:41.000
unprecedented, Alex doing an impression of himself.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.080
The valedictorian of the school today

13:45.080 --> 13:47.000
doesn't hold a candle to my father.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.960
OK.

13:48.960 --> 13:49.560
Wait.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.840
A little sad.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.480
Your father today?

13:52.480 --> 13:54.760
No, back in his dad's day.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.440
That's when people were smart.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.960
I really don't know if that's how anything works, especially

13:59.960 --> 14:01.640
not education or knowledge.

14:01.640 --> 14:02.280
Nope.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.800
So we start here on the 8th.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.720
And Alex actually begins the show

14:05.720 --> 14:09.360
with a story that there's some mirror

14:09.360 --> 14:11.640
parallels to the present day.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.560
It's now coming out that what may have killed that NBC

14:14.560 --> 14:19.120
reporter was his small pox injection.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.120
So see, it's mainstream.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.840
These vaccines are deadly.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.880
You don't have to take them.

14:26.880 --> 14:31.800
But the government's trying to set a precedent that you do

14:31.800 --> 14:34.080
by saying, oh, you're crazy if you don't.

14:34.080 --> 14:39.760
Well, I guess then 99-plus percent of doctors, police,

14:39.760 --> 14:43.600
and firemen are crazy because 99-plus

14:43.600 --> 14:45.160
have refused to take it.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.040
But David Bloom didn't.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.040
And he's bye-bye.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.200
And many others that are taking it are bye-bye.

14:52.200 --> 14:57.600
It looks like more than one out of 1,000 die that take it.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.920
Those are now official numbers, by the way.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.560
First things first, Alex, not the last stat

15:03.560 --> 15:05.600
that he cited there, that's a little outlandish,

15:05.600 --> 15:07.880
but he's not off on some of this stuff.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.760
But the story that he's telling about this

15:09.760 --> 15:11.600
is missing some points.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.080
I was able to find a CBS News article from May 2003, which

15:15.080 --> 15:17.600
discussed a proposed plan to vaccinate half a million

15:17.600 --> 15:20.680
health care workers against smallpox, of which, quote,

15:20.680 --> 15:24.400
only 35,000 of the targeted workers had been inoculated.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.640
There's not good evidence that I can find that anyone was

15:26.640 --> 15:29.240
refusing the vaccine, just that the program may have only

15:29.240 --> 15:33.040
vaccinated about 7% of the stated goal population.

15:33.040 --> 15:36.080
So Alex is saying 99% are refusing the vaccine.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.440
So real decent chance they weren't refusing it,

15:38.440 --> 15:41.480
but one in seven is closer than I'm used to him being.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.880
Sure, sure.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.320
93% of the targeted population that they

15:47.320 --> 15:50.760
meant to get a smallpox vaccination did not get it.

15:50.760 --> 15:51.280
Sure.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.360
Alex is making up that they all refused.

15:53.360 --> 15:58.400
Right, we don't know how the not getting it went down.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.480
It wasn't like we know for a fact.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.920
No, instead, actually 7%.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.240
There's a real decent chance that most of that

16:05.240 --> 16:08.360
was just due to structural problems with how the rollout

16:08.360 --> 16:09.440
of the campaign was.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.480
Yeah, not enough people even knew about it.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.400
And part of it is most people do not

16:14.400 --> 16:17.320
need to get vaccinated against smallpox nowadays.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.760
The reason is because thanks to vaccination efforts made

16:19.760 --> 16:21.040
by the people who came before us,

16:21.040 --> 16:24.160
smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.840
After 9-11, there was a concern about a terrorist group

16:26.840 --> 16:30.040
or a hostile government using smallpox as a weapon.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.640
And as such, the US government stockpiled massive amounts

16:32.640 --> 16:34.600
of smallpox vaccine in order to be prepared

16:34.600 --> 16:35.960
for that kind of possibility.

16:35.960 --> 16:39.600
But typically speaking, most people won't need that vaccine.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.560
The people who do, according to the CDC,

16:41.560 --> 16:43.120
are typically lab workers who might

16:43.120 --> 16:46.520
be in contact with any viruses similar to smallpox.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.280
The push to vaccinate in 2003 was

16:48.280 --> 16:51.800
based on fears of this potential terrorist attack.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.720
And what was ultimately decided was

16:53.720 --> 16:55.280
that it wasn't worth the risk.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.800
And vaccines could still be effective after someone

16:57.800 --> 17:00.120
was exposed to the virus, so there wasn't

17:00.120 --> 17:01.880
much of a need for this.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.080
The program was ended early, and only a total of about 39,000

17:05.080 --> 17:06.960
people were ultimately vaccinated.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.960
A large part of the resistance to this program

17:08.960 --> 17:11.320
was that people didn't buy that there was a real threat,

17:11.320 --> 17:13.160
since Bush had been pretty clear that there

17:13.160 --> 17:15.240
was no information of an imminent attack,

17:15.240 --> 17:17.840
and hospitals were reluctant to participate.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.400
In the end, however, through this program's failure,

17:20.400 --> 17:22.200
public health preparedness was improved.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.400
And even critics of the smallpox campaign

17:24.400 --> 17:27.480
credited with helping us be more ready for the later

17:27.480 --> 17:28.400
outbreak of SARS.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.520
Sure, sure.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.160
David Bloom was a 39-year-old combat reporter

17:32.160 --> 17:33.960
working with NBC.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.120
He passed away on April 6, 2003, while on assignment,

17:37.120 --> 17:38.640
reporting from Iraq.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.920
It's pretty well understood that the cause of death

17:40.920 --> 17:43.720
was that Bloom had developed a blood clot in his leg

17:43.720 --> 17:46.760
from spending days on end crammed into an armored vehicle

17:46.760 --> 17:49.080
and having deep vein thrombosis.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.120
This clot made its way to his lungs

17:51.120 --> 17:54.920
and caused a pulmonary embolism, which resulted in his death.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.600
In the days after he passed away,

17:56.600 --> 17:58.520
a doctor named Brian Strom made a number

17:58.520 --> 18:00.480
of comments to the media about the possibility

18:00.480 --> 18:03.480
that Bloom's death was related to the smallpox vaccination

18:03.480 --> 18:06.120
he'd gotten several weeks prior to his passing.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.360
There's no direct evidence to support this conclusion,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.080
and Alex is kind of just making stuff up,

18:10.080 --> 18:12.640
riffing and jumping to conclusions here.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.360
That said, no medication is fully without some risk,

18:15.360 --> 18:18.000
and the smallpox vaccine is no exception.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.680
Compared to the horror of having smallpox come back, though,

18:20.680 --> 18:22.360
the risk is very minimal.

18:22.360 --> 18:26.800
Isn't it so fucking, it's just so indicative

18:26.800 --> 18:30.680
of how stupid people are that the government was like,

18:30.680 --> 18:34.960
okay, now, despite not having any idea whether or not

18:34.960 --> 18:36.840
they could have weaponized polio,

18:36.840 --> 18:41.200
or smallpox would weaponize smallpox,

18:41.200 --> 18:45.600
or even have some way of delivering it,

18:45.600 --> 18:47.800
we're just going to go out of our way

18:47.800 --> 18:50.080
and protect ourselves against the possibility

18:50.080 --> 18:52.760
of a smallpox attack, despite the fact

18:52.760 --> 18:55.800
that the overwhelming number of humans

18:55.800 --> 18:58.440
have died of diseases that have occurred regularly,

18:58.440 --> 19:00.680
and at no point in time have they been like,

19:00.680 --> 19:05.240
let's put a lot of effort into preemptive, yeah.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.080
I mean, they have.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.480
I mean, they have, but not like, yeah.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.120
You know what my point is.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.280
It's not like the Bush administration

19:12.280 --> 19:14.640
wasn't also getting tetanus shots.

19:14.640 --> 19:15.480
Sure, sure.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.600
I don't know what you're even saying.

19:16.600 --> 19:20.240
Sure, but my, fine, fine, fine, whatever.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.600
I feel like you're just looking for a way to attack.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.600
I'm not looking for a way to, I don't need to look.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.440
Sure.

19:26.440 --> 19:30.120
I think when you look at this,

19:30.120 --> 19:33.400
it's like, it's a terrifying prospect,

19:33.400 --> 19:37.600
and I think that maybe there was some chatter of some sort.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.040
I would believe possibly that like,

19:40.040 --> 19:41.840
oh, this is something we should be concerned about.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.680
Sure.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.360
Somebody might have a sample

19:44.360 --> 19:49.360
of some laboratory smallpox that could really fuck things up.

19:50.040 --> 19:50.880
Totally.

19:50.880 --> 19:55.840
And I think that maybe if you escalate in your head

19:55.840 --> 19:57.880
what the possible threat is,

19:57.880 --> 19:59.480
then the idea of a campaign

19:59.480 --> 20:03.040
of vaccinating healthcare workers

20:03.040 --> 20:06.120
who might be in the front lines or soldiers,

20:06.120 --> 20:08.480
that makes a certain amount of sense.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.320
Right.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.160
Looking back, we obviously have the gift of hindsight

20:11.160 --> 20:12.400
knowing that this didn't happen.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.240
Right.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.080
And it can look a lot more silly.

20:14.080 --> 20:14.920
Right.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.800
But, and even back then,

20:16.800 --> 20:18.840
you could probably make a pretty decent argument

20:18.840 --> 20:20.160
that it was excessive.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.000
Right.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.600
You kinda understand where the thought process comes from.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.000
No, naturally, but it's just,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.640
we've had too many examples of this type of paranoia

20:27.640 --> 20:31.240
being the excuse for action

20:31.240 --> 20:34.120
when it's paranoia that inherently devalues

20:34.120 --> 20:35.720
the life of other people,

20:35.720 --> 20:37.720
as opposed to paranoia that's like,

20:37.720 --> 20:40.480
hey, diseases just come out of nowhere

20:40.480 --> 20:42.800
from shit all the time.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.960
That's infinitely more important.

20:44.960 --> 20:45.960
Instead, it's like,

20:45.960 --> 20:48.400
we've always gotta be preparing for a war

20:48.400 --> 20:50.800
or an attack or someone to try and kill us.

20:50.800 --> 20:51.640
You know what I'm saying?

20:51.640 --> 20:52.480
Yeah, yeah.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.840
I think I might've misunderstood your point.

20:53.840 --> 20:54.680
Yeah.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.680
And I think your point is fine.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.760
And definitely, I think it was indicative

20:58.760 --> 21:01.720
of a lot of the public mentality.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.560
Especially in 2003, when everything is an attack.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.400
Yeah.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.040
But I also think that you can do both.

21:07.040 --> 21:07.880
Yeah.

21:07.880 --> 21:08.720
I think that,

21:08.720 --> 21:11.040
and that might be where my head misunderstood

21:11.040 --> 21:11.880
what you were saying.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.320
No, no, no, totally.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.360
If it were a one or the other choice,

21:16.360 --> 21:17.720
then yeah, focus on.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.080
No, no, no, totally, totally.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.000
But I think everybody was kind of,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.560
ideally, had their head on swivel, looking around.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.920
No, my point isn't invalid,

21:25.920 --> 21:28.560
but it's not necessarily the best way to go

21:28.560 --> 21:29.800
about talking about stuff.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.920
I don't think you broke new ground.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.160
No, I didn't start a revolution, Dan.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.160
Anyway, this clip, I thought,

21:35.160 --> 21:37.400
was a really good instance to illustrate

21:37.400 --> 21:40.640
why you can't take vaccine-related stories seriously

21:40.640 --> 21:41.960
when they come from Alex.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.760
No matter what the reality of the story is,

21:43.760 --> 21:45.840
Alex is always going to take the story

21:45.840 --> 21:47.600
about the possibility of danger,

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
and he's gonna report that as definitive,

21:49.600 --> 21:51.320
and then he's gonna exaggerate it out,

21:51.320 --> 21:52.760
and it's like, oh, it's been proven.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.160
They've shown it, you know?

21:54.160 --> 21:55.800
And it's the same thing that he does

21:55.800 --> 22:00.680
with the COVID-19 vaccine stories in the present day.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.200
This behavior is consistent,

22:03.200 --> 22:06.840
because he is staunchly opposed to vaccines,

22:06.840 --> 22:08.640
not based on the science of it.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.920
Absolutely, and you can argue,

22:10.920 --> 22:13.440
and the problem with it is that the argument of like,

22:13.440 --> 22:18.360
look, 20 years ago, this asshole was saying the same lies

22:18.360 --> 22:20.280
about different vaccines,

22:20.280 --> 22:22.440
and you can see that those didn't come true,

22:22.440 --> 22:24.440
so why would you believe him now?

22:24.440 --> 22:26.960
And the argument will always be like,

22:26.960 --> 22:29.400
yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's a Black Swan event, you know?

22:29.400 --> 22:31.240
Sure, this one was a fake.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.200
They wanna make you comfortable with their vaccines

22:34.200 --> 22:36.800
until they do it, they wanna lull you into,

22:36.800 --> 22:38.600
and you're like, fine, we'll never win.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.440
No. That's it.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.200
You can't really beat back that thinking.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.080
No, no.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.440
And I think that if you are able to get yourself

22:45.440 --> 22:47.320
to a point where you recognize that like,

22:47.320 --> 22:50.320
oh, he does do this over and over and over again,

22:50.320 --> 22:52.280
regardless of the circumstances,

22:52.280 --> 22:54.120
you have to start to ask yourself why,

22:54.120 --> 22:58.600
and what is it exactly that is the opposition to vaccines?

22:58.600 --> 22:59.520
What is that about?

22:59.520 --> 23:00.360
Right.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.200
And I think you could probably come up

23:01.200 --> 23:02.320
with a couple of possibilities.

23:02.320 --> 23:07.320
One is a sort of inclination towards divine science.

23:08.000 --> 23:08.840
Sure, sure.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.920
I guess the idea of medical intervention is against God.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.760
Right.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.800
And I'm not sure if I believe that Alex is there,

23:14.800 --> 23:17.280
because he's gotten surgery.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.120
Yeah.

23:18.120 --> 23:18.960
You know?

23:18.960 --> 23:20.880
Yeah, no, but it is that kind of like,

23:20.880 --> 23:23.040
when it happens to someone else,

23:23.040 --> 23:25.600
it's very much the will of God.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.440
And when it happens to you,

23:27.440 --> 23:30.000
the will of God is to save yourself.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.400
You know, the Lord helps those who help themselves.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.800
But when other people die, it's because it was their time.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.160
It was their time to go, Dan.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.280
You can't deny them that.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.120
Sure.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.400
I'm saying that's a slightly unsatisfying explanation

23:41.400 --> 23:42.280
for Alex.

23:42.280 --> 23:46.200
The other one that I come up with is the notion

23:46.200 --> 23:48.960
and understanding that like vaccines

23:48.960 --> 23:53.960
have drastically improved the lives of poor people

23:54.200 --> 23:56.800
and people in developing countries around the world.

23:56.800 --> 24:00.920
And I don't know, a whole lot of Alex's policy positions

24:00.920 --> 24:05.920
seem to be about not doing that, cutting off foreign aid.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.880
Those sorts of things are things that seem to be

24:10.880 --> 24:14.120
kind of overlap of a lot of his beliefs.

24:14.120 --> 24:14.960
Yeah.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.680
I don't know if that's where the opposition comes from,

24:17.680 --> 24:19.640
but it certainly makes more sense

24:19.640 --> 24:21.640
than legitimate scientific concerns.

24:21.640 --> 24:22.480
Yeah, yeah.

24:22.480 --> 24:26.360
When you think about when typhoid spread

24:26.360 --> 24:28.280
through wealthy neighborhoods,

24:28.280 --> 24:31.880
there was far less like anti-medicine spread around

24:31.880 --> 24:32.720
about that shit.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.120
It was very much everybody needs to clean their hands.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.160
Everybody needs to stay safe.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.440
You know, that kind of thing.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.280
Yeah.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.160
So Alex gives a little bit of a spiel

24:41.160 --> 24:42.400
at the beginning of this episode.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.240
And he talks about like, you know, hey man,

24:45.240 --> 24:47.000
sometimes the world doesn't make sense.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.720
And that's when you need a little bit of Infowars.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.560
That's true.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.080
Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.

24:52.080 --> 24:56.680
The websites are infowars.com, infowars.net,

24:56.680 --> 24:58.480
and prisonplanet.com.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.160
If the world doesn't make sense to you,

25:00.160 --> 25:02.040
if you wonder why you keep losing your liberties

25:02.040 --> 25:04.360
and more and more factories are shutting down

25:04.360 --> 25:06.480
and why the borders are still wide open,

25:06.480 --> 25:09.480
as the government tells you to give up liberty for security,

25:09.480 --> 25:11.800
you'll find the answers right here.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.880
You wonder why our government creates Saddam Hussein's

25:14.880 --> 25:18.280
and creates bin Laden's and arms North Korea's

25:18.280 --> 25:20.520
and then engages the American people

25:20.520 --> 25:23.120
in these costly and dangerous wars.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.240
You'll find the answers right here.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.360
You're wondering why police are running checkpoints

25:27.360 --> 25:28.800
and why there's cameras everywhere

25:28.800 --> 25:30.800
and why your children are being trained

25:30.800 --> 25:32.920
how to turn you in for owning guns

25:32.920 --> 25:35.240
when your guns aren't even illegal.

25:35.240 --> 25:39.000
You'll find the answers right here on this show.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.240
Is it the devil?

25:40.240 --> 25:41.400
It's gotta be the devil.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.240
Is it the devil?

25:42.240 --> 25:43.800
Is it secretly the devil?

25:43.800 --> 25:45.760
It's gotta be something like that.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.120
I'm confused.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.560
I mean, I understand.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.760
No, I think we were all wondering that.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.120
Those are correct wonders.

25:54.120 --> 25:54.960
Sure.

25:54.960 --> 25:58.120
There's some of them are more valid than others.

25:58.120 --> 25:58.960
True.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.080
Yeah, certainly there are.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.480
Hey, it is confusing.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.280
Militarization of police is confusing.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.760
It's wrong.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.880
What's going on here?

26:06.880 --> 26:08.160
Why is this happening?

26:08.160 --> 26:09.880
I don't get answers from Infowars.

26:09.880 --> 26:10.720
No.

26:10.720 --> 26:11.880
And knowing what he turns into

26:11.880 --> 26:15.560
and that the devil is actually behind the globalists,

26:15.560 --> 26:18.400
I wonder if he's just not telling the audience

26:18.400 --> 26:20.920
at this point that this is secretly

26:20.920 --> 26:22.320
just a big religious campaign.

26:22.320 --> 26:25.640
Is this part of God's plan for him in fighting the devil

26:25.640 --> 26:28.720
to lie to these people early on in his career

26:28.720 --> 26:31.040
so he can kind of like slowly trick them

26:31.040 --> 26:33.760
into being the holy warriors that God needs?

26:33.760 --> 26:34.600
Right.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.000
A saint isn't going to bring these sinners in.

26:37.000 --> 26:37.840
Exactly.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.680
That kind of idea.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.640
That might've been a quote from Red Dead Redemption.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.600
God was talking to Saul

26:43.600 --> 26:45.480
when Saul was like nine or 10 in his dreams.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.320
And he was like, listen,

26:46.320 --> 26:49.480
you got to lie to everybody right up until the good time.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.320
Yeah, I don't know.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.160
I don't know.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.200
It's really strange to me.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.760
And like I've said in these 2003 episodes,

26:54.760 --> 26:56.560
one of the things that I'm trying to keep my eye on

26:56.560 --> 26:58.400
is this idea of how much of the devil

26:58.400 --> 27:00.800
does he think he's fighting the devil in 2003?

27:00.800 --> 27:01.800
Right, right, right.

27:01.800 --> 27:06.800
And you know, if he does, then that clip is abusive.

27:06.800 --> 27:10.960
And if he doesn't, then his worldview doesn't make sense.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.000
I would appreciate it if that clue, yeah.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
So Alex has got a headline that's not a headline.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.160
Coming up in the next hour,

27:18.160 --> 27:20.240
Eugene police illegally raid homes

27:20.240 --> 27:23.080
with a tank prompts federal lawsuit.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.760
Eugene police illegally raid homes with a tank

27:26.760 --> 27:28.400
prompts federal lawsuit.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.360
And wild stuff comes out of Oregon,

27:31.360 --> 27:33.320
but it's happening all over the country.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.760
This headline that Alex is reading

27:34.760 --> 27:38.200
is not from a news story or any kind of journalistic source.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.040
It's actually the title of a press release

27:40.040 --> 27:42.480
that was put out by the office of Lauren Regan,

27:42.480 --> 27:43.880
the lawyer representing the people

27:43.880 --> 27:45.320
who were the subject of this raid.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.160
Yeah.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.560
I can understand how this is still a source of information

27:48.560 --> 27:51.080
and it's entirely possible that a lawyer's press release

27:51.080 --> 27:52.680
could have stuff worth conveying,

27:52.680 --> 27:54.520
but it seems like something that shouldn't be treated

27:54.520 --> 27:57.920
as the same as an article in an actual news outlet.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.240
Incidentally, this case resulted in the city of Eugene

28:00.240 --> 28:03.800
paying one couple $30,000 and another $92,000

28:03.800 --> 28:05.040
to settle their cases,

28:05.040 --> 28:07.480
which claimed unreasonable search and seizure,

28:07.480 --> 28:10.600
excessive use of force, assault, and false imprisonment.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.120
The police contended that it was an instance

28:13.120 --> 28:14.560
of them having bad information

28:14.560 --> 28:16.600
and believing that they were raiding a drug house,

28:16.600 --> 28:17.680
whereas the couples believed

28:17.680 --> 28:19.680
that the police got a warrant by lying.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.520
Whatever the case, it's not good policing.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.560
And even if the intel had all been good,

28:23.560 --> 28:25.360
seems like their actions would have been excessive

28:25.360 --> 28:26.800
for a drug raid.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.120
Anyway, the point here is that in terms of the big picture,

28:29.120 --> 28:31.080
that this kind of police action is wrong,

28:31.080 --> 28:33.200
Alex and I are in complete agreement.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.040
Not hard.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.320
I still don't support how he pushes the message though,

28:36.320 --> 28:39.880
however, given that he's presenting this biased information

28:39.880 --> 28:43.000
from the lawyers of people involved in the story

28:43.000 --> 28:44.680
as a neutral headline.

28:44.680 --> 28:47.840
It's not necessarily the way you would wanna go

28:47.840 --> 28:49.840
about framing your case,

28:49.840 --> 28:51.840
even if your case is something that I agree with.

28:51.840 --> 28:52.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.840
I mean, it would be hard to be on the wrong side

28:55.840 --> 29:00.720
of strangers destroy your home for no good reason

29:00.720 --> 29:02.240
and face no punishment for it.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.080
Sure, sure.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.480
You know, like that seems obvious.

29:04.480 --> 29:08.360
Yeah, and Alex spends a large portion of this episode

29:08.360 --> 29:13.360
talking about this couple's houses that were searched

29:13.440 --> 29:15.360
and they were, you know, held.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.200
Right.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.840
And it does

29:21.120 --> 29:23.560
become hard to take seriously.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.000
Yeah.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.120
Knowing the present.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.720
Like I do care for these people

29:30.720 --> 29:33.640
who had this police intervention in their lives

29:33.640 --> 29:36.720
unnecessarily and they were treated poorly.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.520
I just don't consider Alex a legitimate person

29:40.520 --> 29:41.640
to make those points.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.480
Absolutely.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.320
Anymore.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.160
Yeah.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.000
Anyway.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.360
That is also a really good question about the,

29:48.360 --> 29:49.920
I mean, as far as the fighting the devil

29:49.920 --> 29:51.880
in the past and the present goes,

29:51.880 --> 29:56.240
another like question that that raises is,

29:56.240 --> 30:01.240
is this guy that guy or does he change into this guy?

30:01.640 --> 30:03.120
And what does that mean?

30:03.120 --> 30:04.160
You know, like, are there,

30:04.160 --> 30:06.880
is it possible that Alex and I

30:06.880 --> 30:09.240
could have had a conversation in 2003

30:09.240 --> 30:10.440
that wouldn't have wound up with me

30:10.440 --> 30:12.040
trying to throw something into his face?

30:12.040 --> 30:13.880
Probably, I bet it is.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.720
I bet you would.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.720
You might not really enjoy it all that much.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.560
Right.

30:17.560 --> 30:18.400
But yeah.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.520
And is that because he's lying to me

30:19.520 --> 30:21.920
or is that because he was a different person?

30:21.920 --> 30:22.760
Yeah.

30:22.760 --> 30:23.720
And does that raise the possibility

30:23.720 --> 30:26.840
that I could eventually change into this very monster?

30:26.840 --> 30:28.280
That's actually why we're doing this.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.440
Isn't this terrifying?

30:29.440 --> 30:30.800
It's truly a nightmare.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.560
That's really the thing

30:32.560 --> 30:33.400
that this is all about is like-

30:33.400 --> 30:35.120
But what do we turn into?

30:35.120 --> 30:36.440
Yes.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.120
Looking at this and being like,

30:38.120 --> 30:39.680
what do we have to be afraid of?

30:39.680 --> 30:40.800
What are the signs?

30:40.800 --> 30:41.920
What's the, yeah, yeah.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.160
Can we get, somebody get a whiteboard up

30:44.160 --> 30:45.480
with a checklist. This is a cautionary thing.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.320
Yes, absolutely.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.400
So Alex starts to read this article

30:49.400 --> 30:52.080
and it's interesting that you bring up this,

30:52.080 --> 30:53.400
the differences between present

30:53.400 --> 30:54.720
and like is this the same person?

30:54.720 --> 30:55.560
Sure.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.840
Because he starts to bring up this article

30:57.840 --> 30:59.920
and you can see in this clip,

30:59.920 --> 31:02.440
similarities and differences.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.200
Like, okay, one of the big similarities,

31:05.200 --> 31:08.080
he starts reading and everything he reads,

31:08.080 --> 31:09.000
he editorializes on.

31:09.000 --> 31:09.840
Sure, sure.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.640
He adds a whole bunch of stuff

31:11.640 --> 31:14.360
that's not in the article to the article.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.240
But a big difference,

31:16.240 --> 31:18.840
he says that this was written by a lawyer.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.760
He doesn't clarify that it's the lawyer

31:20.760 --> 31:23.080
of the people who were in the story.

31:23.080 --> 31:23.920
Sure.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.200
But he does give a clarification

31:26.200 --> 31:27.840
that I didn't expect from him.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.960
Let me just read part of this powerful article

31:29.960 --> 31:31.240
and we're gonna talk to the lawyer

31:31.240 --> 31:32.240
who wrote the story

31:32.240 --> 31:35.280
and got some of the other mainstream articles about it.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.920
Lauren Regan,

31:36.920 --> 31:39.640
Eugene police illegally raid homes

31:39.640 --> 31:42.640
with tank prompts federal lawsuit.

31:43.880 --> 31:47.520
And in the pre-dawn of October 17, 2002,

31:47.520 --> 31:49.000
approximately 50 police officers

31:49.000 --> 31:50.840
that see this every day

31:50.840 --> 31:52.400
from multiple police agencies

31:52.400 --> 31:53.240
that are federalized

31:53.240 --> 31:55.040
under multi-jurisdictional task force,

31:55.040 --> 31:56.600
swarmed residential neighborhood,

31:56.600 --> 31:57.720
we saw this in Austin.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.600
You can hear the difference in his voice

31:59.600 --> 32:01.040
when he's editorializing.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.720
Yup, yup.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.840
That's, it's,

32:04.840 --> 32:06.920
it's almost courteous in a way.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.360
You can feel him almost telling you

32:10.360 --> 32:12.160
when he's not.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.560
There is a slight bit of that,

32:14.560 --> 32:16.480
but it's still like,

32:16.480 --> 32:18.200
okay, I'm gonna set out to read this article

32:18.200 --> 32:20.040
then I'm gonna interrupt myself constantly

32:20.040 --> 32:21.400
with stuff that's not in the article.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.240
No, there's definitely that.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.080
It's a little bit dicey,

32:23.080 --> 32:27.080
but yeah, it's slightly more responsible feeling

32:27.080 --> 32:29.240
because if you are actively listening,

32:29.240 --> 32:30.520
you can tell when it's like,

32:30.520 --> 32:31.880
these are the words of Alex.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.720
Right.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.560
This is his reading voice.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.400
Right.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.240
And I don't know.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.880
And you know why that's a more compelling show

32:36.880 --> 32:38.160
than just reading the news

32:38.160 --> 32:40.160
because this is very similar

32:40.160 --> 32:43.080
to how some asshole might be reading an article

32:43.080 --> 32:43.960
as he's reading it.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.760
You know, like if I'm reading a dumb article,

32:46.760 --> 32:48.000
sometimes I'll read a sentence

32:48.000 --> 32:50.280
and be like, these motherfuckers are stupid.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.520
And then I'll read the next sentence.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.200
You know, this is an engaging way

32:53.200 --> 32:55.560
of almost reading the news with your buddy.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.040
I don't fully disagree.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.520
So Alex gets to talking about other places

33:00.520 --> 33:01.920
that have been raided.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.800
Now it's raiding neighborhoods.

33:03.800 --> 33:07.160
In a town in Missouri two years ago,

33:07.160 --> 33:10.000
AP headline, town searched in drug raid.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.000
Folks, this is as bad as it gets.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
This was a case from early 2002

33:16.000 --> 33:18.320
where a 27 month long investigation

33:18.320 --> 33:21.520
into an international gun and drug smuggling operation

33:21.520 --> 33:25.400
culminated in arrests in a town called Carthage in Missouri.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.480
This is a real headline from an AP story,

33:27.480 --> 33:29.680
but the use of the words town searched

33:29.680 --> 33:32.600
isn't meant to be taken completely literally.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.120
The multi-agency task force

33:34.120 --> 33:36.040
that was working on this extended operation

33:36.040 --> 33:37.440
set up some checkpoints to make sure

33:37.440 --> 33:39.760
the subjects of their investigation couldn't flee,

33:39.760 --> 33:41.400
and then they made their arrests.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.360
Again, I'm not justifying this policing necessarily.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.520
I'm just saying that the image that Alex wants to create

33:48.520 --> 33:51.360
of cops kicking in every door in this town in Missouri,

33:51.360 --> 33:54.160
looking for wrongdoing to jam someone up,

33:54.160 --> 33:55.600
that's not accurate.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.640
No, I mean admittedly- That's the image he wants to create

33:57.640 --> 33:58.480
and it's not real.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.920
Admittedly, when they marched those elephants

34:00.920 --> 34:02.960
across the Rockies to get there,

34:02.960 --> 34:05.680
I felt like that might've been a terrible idea,

34:05.680 --> 34:09.240
but Carthage.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.360
Right, I got it. Carthage, Dan.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.320
I got it. Carthage, because of-

34:12.320 --> 34:14.480
I was trying to think of a way

34:14.480 --> 34:17.440
if there was a like a Fitzcarraldo joke I could make.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.840
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.440
The elephants and the carrying a boat.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.600
Sure, sure, that could've-

34:22.600 --> 34:24.000
It wasn't worth it. I feel like my Hannibal reference

34:24.000 --> 34:25.440
was better than you gave it credit for it.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.000
It was, but I think I probably would've enjoyed it more

34:28.000 --> 34:32.200
if I wasn't trying to make a Fitzcarraldo joke and failing.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.320
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.520
We were working at cross purposes on that riff.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.800
Yeah. So I can see that.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.760
I apologize, I should be there for you more.

34:38.760 --> 34:39.600
That was on me.

34:40.760 --> 34:41.960
Anyway, the point of this though

34:41.960 --> 34:45.360
is that Alex is completely just fudging this.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.200
Yeah, yeah.

34:46.200 --> 34:48.760
But it's a good headline for him, meh.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.640
Anyway, he gets to talking to this lawyer

34:50.640 --> 34:53.600
and I guess if you put the pieces together yourself,

34:53.600 --> 34:56.080
you can kind of make sense of the fact

34:56.080 --> 34:57.400
that this isn't a headline.

34:57.400 --> 35:02.000
This is, the press release word is never used,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.360
but you can put the pieces together

35:03.360 --> 35:06.200
that this is a lawyer representing the people.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.440
Sure, sure, sure.

35:07.440 --> 35:11.000
A not unbiased actor in this circumstance, if you will.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.800
Yeah, and I think that this lawyer

35:13.800 --> 35:17.640
seems fairly straight up.

35:17.640 --> 35:21.200
I think she's distracted and maybe a little bit bemused

35:21.200 --> 35:22.840
by Alex's constant-

35:22.840 --> 35:23.960
Right.

35:23.960 --> 35:24.800
detractions.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.640
That her name was Roberta Barnes gave me some pause,

35:27.640 --> 35:30.120
but once I found out there was no relation,

35:30.120 --> 35:31.520
I felt more comfortable.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.760
So Alex knows how to arrest people.

35:33.760 --> 35:34.600
You should know that.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.440
Okay.

35:35.440 --> 35:38.320
And how you arrest somebody is you park down the street

35:38.320 --> 35:40.120
when the perp leaves in the morning,

35:40.120 --> 35:42.960
you do a little work, you surveil them for a couple of days.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.600
When they go to work, you pull them over,

35:44.600 --> 35:45.880
you pull them out of the car,

35:45.880 --> 35:47.400
you take them back to the house with a warrant,

35:47.400 --> 35:49.600
you go in the house, nobody gets hurt.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.960
But see, that's not fun to suit up at 3 a.m.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.000
in black uniforms and feel all tough

35:55.000 --> 35:57.320
and go rumbling down the road in your tank.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.920
These are all wannabes who probably

35:58.920 --> 36:00.560
washed out in the special forces.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.040
Now they get to pick on women.

36:02.040 --> 36:02.880
Right.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.480
I mean, this show is a really abusive, psychotic nature

36:05.480 --> 36:07.920
to drag a naked woman outside with a black hood on.

36:07.920 --> 36:08.760
Go ahead.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.480
So I don't, you can tell kind of there

36:10.480 --> 36:12.240
that she's trying to respond to stuff.

36:12.240 --> 36:16.080
She's trying to say anything edgewise, yes, yes.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.480
That kind of is how I would characterize the interview.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.600
It's not hostile by any stretch.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.560
She has a point, I don't know if she necessarily

36:24.560 --> 36:26.760
knows who Alex is.

36:26.760 --> 36:30.480
And Alex certainly isn't as toxic an entity in 2003

36:30.480 --> 36:31.320
as he is in the present.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.560
Right, right, right.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.560
You might not think twice about an invitation

36:34.560 --> 36:36.160
to come and talk about this case

36:36.160 --> 36:37.880
that you're passionate about

36:37.880 --> 36:39.280
and you want to get attention for.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.920
And you don't know going in that it is going to be

36:42.920 --> 36:45.640
a life or death struggle to finish a sentence.

36:45.640 --> 36:46.680
You didn't know that.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.800
And you don't know that Alex is going to be constantly

36:48.800 --> 36:51.240
trying to drive the image of a naked woman

36:51.240 --> 36:54.520
being dragged out of her house to his audience

36:54.520 --> 36:56.200
because that's visceral for them.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.320
Correct, yeah.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.080
Whereas you maybe want to talk about.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.120
I have things to say.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.160
You want to talk about rights.

37:01.160 --> 37:06.000
You want to talk about infringement of citizen civil rights.

37:06.000 --> 37:06.840
Totally.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.680
Yep.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.200
So anyway, the interview is not that great

37:09.200 --> 37:11.920
or all that interesting, especially I think partially

37:11.920 --> 37:15.360
because I mean, I agree with Alex.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.920
I don't agree with his tactics.

37:16.920 --> 37:17.760
Sure, sure.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.720
I don't agree with him sensationalizing the story.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.560
Right.

37:20.560 --> 37:24.080
But in terms, like I looked at the story in normal outlets

37:24.080 --> 37:26.480
and the conclusion of the police shouldn't have done this.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.320
Yeah, it's not hard.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.160
I agree.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.240
And I know because we're in the future

37:31.240 --> 37:33.400
that the police and the city of Eugene

37:33.400 --> 37:35.520
did pay out a settlement.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.360
Yeah.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.920
And that doesn't take away whatever these people experience

37:38.920 --> 37:41.840
but it certainly is some sign.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.440
No, no five figures is restitution for the cops

37:45.440 --> 37:48.920
destroying your home, you know, and your sense of safety

37:48.920 --> 37:49.720
forever.

37:49.720 --> 37:52.720
Yeah, there's going to be psychological things

37:52.720 --> 37:53.920
that remain.

37:53.920 --> 37:54.840
Yeah, absolutely.

37:54.840 --> 37:58.040
You know, there's a modicum of justice in a settlement.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.360
Sure, sure.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.240
And no one died.

38:00.240 --> 38:00.960
So that's great.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.440
No one died, yeah.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.480
Anyway, the interview ends and Alex says this

38:05.480 --> 38:07.680
and I just rolled my eyes.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.320
All right, the third hour will be an absolute news overload

38:10.320 --> 38:10.640
blitz.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.840
I've got 50 articles I haven't gotten to.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.000
I will get to them.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.440
I will get to your calls.

38:15.440 --> 38:18.160
1-800-259-9231.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.040
He's the same guy.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.640
Oh boy, oh boy.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.560
He's setting himself up for failure.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.560
Like if he plans to get to 50 stories plus calls in one hour,

38:25.560 --> 38:27.360
that's just not possible.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.760
If you factor in commercials, he's

38:28.760 --> 38:31.400
giving himself like 20 seconds per story.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.640
That's not even enough to get through the headlines.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.760
He should be more realistic about what he can and can't

38:35.760 --> 38:37.680
cover in the time he has and then focus

38:37.680 --> 38:39.480
on what he has the time to cover.

38:39.480 --> 38:39.960
Sure.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.880
It would make for better content.

38:41.880 --> 38:42.440
Sure.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.680
It wouldn't be so dumb.

38:44.680 --> 38:48.880
It does make it, I don't know, what would I say?

38:48.880 --> 38:51.560
It does make it far more reasonable to just ignore

38:51.560 --> 38:52.840
that in the present, though.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.440
You know, it's like a long running joke on a sitcom.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.920
Like a Simpsons bit, it's been going on for 30 years.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.480
What are you going to complain now?

39:00.480 --> 39:03.040
If Alex says he's going to get to the stories

39:03.040 --> 39:05.960
and you've listened in 2003, you know damn well

39:05.960 --> 39:07.800
he's not going to get to the story.

39:07.800 --> 39:08.960
So who gives a shit, you know?

39:08.960 --> 39:11.040
Because for me, I'm looking at this like Dr. House.

39:11.040 --> 39:11.400
Sure.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.000
You know what I'm saying?

39:12.000 --> 39:12.760
Sure, sure.

39:12.760 --> 39:16.840
In the present day, Alex has this list of symptoms, right?

39:16.840 --> 39:17.600
Right, right.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.400
And we go back to 2003, and he's got the same symptom.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.480
It's like, all right, that's not part of the condition.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.280
That's not part of the disease, yes.

39:23.280 --> 39:23.800
I got you.

39:23.800 --> 39:24.600
I got you.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.400
I'm playing diagnostic games here.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.120
Understood.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.520
Cough is not part of it.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.080
Understood.

39:32.080 --> 39:37.040
So Alex has trouble with quotes, and it extends

39:37.040 --> 39:39.160
far beyond Thomas Jefferson.

39:39.160 --> 39:42.120
The globalists' mind controllers say

39:42.120 --> 39:44.880
that perception is reality.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.840
I am mental.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.520
They create the perception that the military and the police

39:48.520 --> 39:52.400
on our streets is good, when if you investigate,

39:52.400 --> 39:54.640
you'll find out it's bad.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.640
So Alex saying that, you know, claiming

39:57.640 --> 39:59.840
that the globalists use that quote,

39:59.840 --> 40:02.280
perception is reality, that's interesting,

40:02.280 --> 40:04.480
because that's a quote most famously attributed

40:04.480 --> 40:06.840
to Republican strategist Lee Atwater.

40:06.840 --> 40:07.320
Yeah.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.360
A man notable for his intense use of racism

40:09.360 --> 40:10.440
as a political tool.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.880
Oh, yeah.

40:11.880 --> 40:15.880
Name one big strategy that he helped institute.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.400
It's on the compass.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.120
Also, he's associated with the Willie Horton ad.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.720
Sure, sure.

40:22.720 --> 40:27.320
Also, he's pretty notable that in 1984,

40:27.320 --> 40:29.840
he became a senior partner at Black Manafort Stone

40:29.840 --> 40:31.640
and Kelly, the consulting firm run

40:31.640 --> 40:34.040
by Alex's future good buddy Roger Stone.

40:34.040 --> 40:34.520
Wow.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.520
Perception is reality.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.960
Perception is reality.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.080
Woo.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.720
Man, Jesus.

40:40.720 --> 40:41.960
Yep.

40:41.960 --> 40:45.560
1984, good old Roger Stone looking to his left,

40:45.560 --> 40:47.440
seeing Lee Atwater thinking, I got

40:47.440 --> 40:49.040
a bright future in front of me.

40:49.040 --> 40:53.120
Paul, we're going to do great things.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.520
You and I definitely aren't going

40:54.520 --> 40:57.160
to get charged with crimes in 36 years.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.200
Oh, boy, we're definitely not laying the groundwork

41:00.200 --> 41:01.840
for all the crimes we're going to do.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.360
Yep.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.360
So this was interesting to me.

41:05.360 --> 41:05.840
Sure.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.400
I'm going to stop saying interesting.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.800
But this was weird.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.480
Fascinating.

41:09.480 --> 41:10.000
Sure.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.720
OK.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.480
Alex has an intense news blitz he needs to get through.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.920
Yes, we're in a full hour of news blitz.

41:18.920 --> 41:19.800
I forgot about that.

41:19.800 --> 41:20.480
Listen to this.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.160
OK.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.840
And I'm sad for our troops that are being

41:23.840 --> 41:26.320
used for the new world order and are

41:26.320 --> 41:28.080
being injected with deadly vaccines,

41:28.080 --> 41:30.360
are being brought back here and turned

41:30.360 --> 41:33.760
into militarized police.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.600
We need to remember what America is about.

41:35.600 --> 41:39.040
What makes America America is because it was a free country.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.880
Now we're beginning to lose that.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.280
We're seeing the shift rapidly.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.760
And patriots everywhere need to be veterans

41:45.760 --> 41:48.400
in the second American revolution,

41:48.400 --> 41:50.880
or I should say, restoration.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.400
For all the veterans that really gave all,

41:53.400 --> 41:54.760
we've had requests for this song.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.720
We'll air it.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.800
Then I'll come back and talk to John in Indiana,

41:57.800 --> 42:01.200
or John in Missouri, and others that are patiently holding.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.200
And I'll launch into a bunch of geopolitical news

42:04.200 --> 42:06.160
and information.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.240
So again, stay with us.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.840
I think this song says it all.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.640
It's not sappy.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.960
A lot of people die to defend liberty.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.880
That's what that flag symbolizes, is our republic,

42:15.880 --> 42:18.160
not a unit of a world empire.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.200
And then Alex plays the entire song of Billy Ray Cyrus'

42:21.200 --> 42:22.080
Sun Gable.

42:22.080 --> 42:25.240
I was worried it was going to be what I heard it being.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.600
And then it was that.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.080
And now I'm unhappy.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.400
I would give anything to go back to that moment in time

42:30.400 --> 42:31.720
and tell Alex about Miley.

42:31.720 --> 42:37.200
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.960
Oh my god, it's so weird.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.280
It's so weird.

42:40.280 --> 42:43.520
He plays a full song as like a shout out to the troops.

42:43.520 --> 42:47.240
And he doesn't sing along with it or editorialize over it?

42:47.240 --> 42:48.040
He just leaves.

42:48.040 --> 42:48.760
Oh.

42:48.760 --> 42:49.240
Yeah.

42:49.240 --> 42:52.040
Well, you know, he couldn't eat a sandwich as easily back then.

42:52.040 --> 42:54.040
That's probably true.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.080
Yeah, that was bizarre.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.840
The format is very strange.

42:56.840 --> 42:57.880
Yeah, that's very weird.

42:57.880 --> 42:59.400
That makes me feel deeply uncomfortable.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.960
A lot of people have been wanting me to play Billy Cyrus.

43:01.960 --> 43:03.760
No, no, no.

43:03.760 --> 43:06.520
A lot of people have been wanting me to play Billy Cyrus.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.600
And I say to them, no, again.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.840
From everything I understand about Alex's format,

43:11.840 --> 43:14.640
song requests are not right.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.920
You can request songs.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.200
He doesn't play songs.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.920
No, he's not a song player.

43:18.920 --> 43:19.560
No.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.360
What a weird, yeah, OK.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.160
Very strange.

43:22.160 --> 43:22.640
All right.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.560
So the news blitz doesn't really happen.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.520
But Alex does take some calls.

43:26.520 --> 43:29.760
And one guy, this guy is interesting.

43:29.760 --> 43:37.080
He seems to believe that spam messages.

43:37.080 --> 43:37.720
Oh.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.320
Right?

43:38.320 --> 43:39.400
Yeah, not the food.

43:39.400 --> 43:43.360
Spam messages need to be clearly delineated as something

43:43.360 --> 43:44.960
with a commercial purpose.

43:44.960 --> 43:47.080
Because he got accused of spamming somebody.

43:47.080 --> 43:49.680
And he was just trying to harass them.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.120
OK, two things if I can get to them.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.240
One is the supremacy clause in the Constitution.

43:53.240 --> 43:56.760
And the other is this law of attempted legislation to make

43:56.760 --> 44:00.760
spam a felony on the internet.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.400
I tried to.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.000
Spam is commercial.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.280
It's got to be defined as commercial gain

44:06.280 --> 44:09.840
and that kind of stuff, not forcing

44:09.840 --> 44:12.800
complicit media to see the pictures.

44:12.800 --> 44:15.560
Well, sir, the White Paper Doctor Two was written.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.320
If your email goes to somebody wrong,

44:17.320 --> 44:19.280
you get live in prison in a labor camp, OK?

44:19.280 --> 44:19.760
Right.

44:19.760 --> 44:20.240
What?

44:20.240 --> 44:22.240
I was accused of spamming people many times

44:22.240 --> 44:24.400
right after 9-11, Iraqi war.

44:24.400 --> 44:27.800
They leave their email addresses in the newspaper articles.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.600
And one guy, he shifts his email address

44:29.600 --> 44:31.080
so he doesn't have to receive these

44:31.080 --> 44:35.720
because he knows that he would be guilty of mispresient

44:35.720 --> 44:38.120
if he's alerted to the treason that's going on.

44:38.120 --> 44:40.960
Yeah, so apparently this guy goes and finds

44:40.960 --> 44:45.360
email addresses in newspapers and then harasses the people.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.600
He's worried about a law against spam.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.960
Yeah.

44:48.960 --> 44:49.840
Yeah.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.760
That's a fundamental misunderstanding

44:51.760 --> 44:53.880
of all of the problems with what you're doing.

44:53.880 --> 44:54.520
You bet.

44:54.520 --> 44:55.040
You bet.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.120
But it's fun.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.960
I can't believe you got the point that wrong.

44:58.960 --> 44:59.480
Yeah.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.120
It's a fun call, though, because you

45:01.120 --> 45:03.080
can see the dynamics that are going on.

45:03.080 --> 45:07.360
And like, I don't know, that sounds like an Alex Jones

45:07.360 --> 45:08.000
listener to me.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.440
They're trying to make a law making it illegal for me

45:12.440 --> 45:15.720
to send chain emails to my family.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.960
And that's going to really get in the way of me

45:17.960 --> 45:20.440
kneecapping this reporter over here.

45:20.440 --> 45:23.000
So we've got to stop this chain email law.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.200
It is not spam when I email a journalist 100 times in a day

45:29.200 --> 45:31.400
and tell him he's going to go to jail for treason.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.400
It's not spam.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.400
I'm not a bot.

45:33.400 --> 45:34.160
I'm an asshole.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.360
I sent every one of those messages by hand.

45:36.360 --> 45:37.520
I clicked the button.

45:37.520 --> 45:39.880
I'm proud of being an asshole.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.520
So Alex has one more caller that we're

45:41.520 --> 45:43.200
going to hear a little bit of.

45:43.200 --> 45:45.120
This person's talking about, so you've

45:45.120 --> 45:49.040
got the new money coming in, the new bills in the US.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.840
And a lot of people have a lot of theories about that.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.920
And this caller believes.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.960
We'll never have Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.

45:56.960 --> 45:59.640
This caller believes that there's like metal strips

45:59.640 --> 46:00.800
and stuff in the money.

46:00.800 --> 46:01.880
Sure, sure.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.440
If you hold on to the money for more than a month,

46:04.440 --> 46:05.760
it'll be able to time that.

46:05.760 --> 46:06.280
I like this.

46:06.280 --> 46:08.520
This money will know when it's changed hands.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.320
This is a good conspiracy.

46:10.320 --> 46:11.120
I like this.

46:11.120 --> 46:14.120
And if you hold on to it too long, it'll auto-tax.

46:14.120 --> 46:14.880
Oh, no.

46:14.880 --> 46:18.880
Real quick, what that man was talking about on the money,

46:18.880 --> 46:20.760
this was on a program the other day.

46:20.760 --> 46:22.200
One of the things with the money,

46:22.200 --> 46:25.880
with the strip when you get it, if you don't pass it

46:25.880 --> 46:28.320
on within a month, you'll be taxed on it.

46:28.320 --> 46:31.120
Oh, it'll be valued, I reported that three years ago,

46:31.120 --> 46:34.280
from the Federal Reserve Board of Virginia's website.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.120
A real good person to have on would

46:36.120 --> 46:39.880
be Donald McIlvaney, intelligence advisor.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.960
If you could get him on and interview him.

46:41.960 --> 46:44.960
He's very well versed on all of this.

46:44.960 --> 46:48.080
I have no idea how the timer of a month

46:48.080 --> 46:49.040
would start.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.000
I love it.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.880
If I were to buy something with a bill, this is ridiculous.

46:55.880 --> 46:56.520
I like it.

46:56.520 --> 46:59.440
Anyway, I don't know anything about this Donald McIlvaney

46:59.440 --> 47:01.640
guy, but I did look into him a little bit.

47:01.640 --> 47:03.440
And I did find that his main website is just

47:03.440 --> 47:06.080
a portal to a gold sales outlet.

47:06.080 --> 47:06.800
How's he doing?

47:06.800 --> 47:07.400
I don't know.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.440
Oh, so he's saying that maybe you shouldn't get paper money,

47:10.440 --> 47:13.000
and instead you should get gold.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.160
So then he, of course, sells gold.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.200
That's very strange how that works.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.200
It's so strange.

47:19.200 --> 47:22.840
It's almost like these people with these completely nutty

47:22.840 --> 47:25.200
conspiracy theories about paper money

47:25.200 --> 47:27.600
always tend to sell gold.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.000
It's super weird.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.760
Super weird how people who hate the Fed and paper currency

47:32.760 --> 47:35.440
love and also sell and profit off of gold.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.280
They have a weird financial motivation.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.240
Super strange.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.080
So we go to the ninth.

47:40.080 --> 47:40.880
OK.

47:40.880 --> 47:44.000
And I didn't find that episode all that satisfying.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.440
A lot of it was about talking to that lawyer

47:46.440 --> 47:49.320
and just kind of spinning his wheels.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.360
Sure.

47:50.360 --> 47:55.960
Then I got in on the ninth, and I found myself very excited.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.040
Is that the right word?

47:57.040 --> 47:57.960
Interesting.

47:57.960 --> 48:01.280
Coming up in about, I don't know, 16, 17 minutes,

48:01.280 --> 48:04.480
we'll be joined by Jeff Singer and Dave Moore, who

48:04.480 --> 48:09.200
are on a local country FM in Colorado Springs.

48:09.200 --> 48:15.320
We're on, of course, on KWYD 1580 in Colorado Springs.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.320
But we're going to have them on because, of course,

48:17.320 --> 48:20.240
you heard last week they got suspended

48:20.240 --> 48:23.080
for criticizing the Bixie Chicks.

48:26.560 --> 48:30.960
And maybe you heard on the news that they got

48:30.960 --> 48:33.280
suspended for playing them.

48:33.280 --> 48:35.920
But we'll get to the bottom of it.

48:35.920 --> 48:36.400
Alex just.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.440
Oh, would you say they got canceled, if you will?

48:38.440 --> 48:40.200
Alex just misspoke there, and he tried

48:40.200 --> 48:42.320
to cover it by insinuating that the media had gotten

48:42.320 --> 48:45.240
this story wrong by making you think that the two DJs got

48:45.240 --> 48:46.800
in trouble for playing Dixie Chicks

48:46.800 --> 48:49.440
when maybe they got in trouble for criticizing them.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.560
Only Alex can get to the bottom of it when he misspeaks.

48:52.560 --> 48:53.800
How could you know?

48:53.800 --> 48:59.560
So these two guys worked for KKCS 102 FM in Colorado Springs.

48:59.560 --> 49:00.220
Sure.

49:00.220 --> 49:01.160
It's a station.

49:01.160 --> 49:02.680
They had to put in place a boycott

49:02.680 --> 49:04.120
on playing the Dixie Chicks songs

49:04.120 --> 49:07.440
after Natalie Maines had some comments at a concert

49:07.440 --> 49:09.440
that were seen as being anti-troop when she said

49:09.440 --> 49:11.560
that she was ashamed that President Bush was

49:11.560 --> 49:13.440
from the same state as her in Texas.

49:13.440 --> 49:15.880
Good for the Dixie Chicks for being ahead of their time,

49:15.880 --> 49:16.680
you know?

49:16.680 --> 49:18.560
Now we're all ashamed of the United States,

49:18.560 --> 49:20.120
but they really got there first.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.920
Obviously, this was an instance of everyone losing the damn

49:22.920 --> 49:24.680
mind and the right wing shitheads doing

49:24.680 --> 49:26.120
a dog pile on the Dixie Chicks.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.000
But some of the details of the story,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.100
particularly about this DJ situation,

49:30.100 --> 49:31.880
might not be what you remember.

49:31.880 --> 49:35.680
OK, is this a clown sending a, what's it, poison again?

49:35.680 --> 49:37.040
No, no, this isn't a ricin.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.800
This isn't a ricin situation.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.200
Dueling Elvis in person winners?

49:40.200 --> 49:41.660
I was going to say, this isn't that?

49:41.660 --> 49:42.160
Not quite.

49:42.160 --> 49:42.680
Oh, OK.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.680
So in terms of these actual two DJs,

49:44.680 --> 49:46.720
the story that I remembered was that they dared

49:46.720 --> 49:48.640
to play a couple songs from the Dixie Chicks,

49:48.640 --> 49:50.060
and that was enough to get them in trouble.

49:50.060 --> 49:50.960
Sure.

49:50.960 --> 49:54.640
An article from the Times Herald Record has some other details.

49:54.640 --> 49:58.760
Quote, KKCS had instituted a ban on the Dixie Chicks, who

49:58.760 --> 50:00.720
at the time had two songs on the charts.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.480
But two DJs at the station, Dave Moore and Jeff Singer,

50:03.480 --> 50:05.960
decided that two months was punishment enough.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.220
They broke the ban.

50:07.220 --> 50:10.360
At 6.15 AM on Monday, May 5, 2003,

50:10.360 --> 50:12.560
they locked themselves in the DJ booth.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.280
They started with long time gone,

50:14.280 --> 50:17.040
and they didn't stop playing Dixie Chicks tunes until noon.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.560
Was Adam Sandler and Brendan Fazier there?

50:20.560 --> 50:22.240
What in God's name happened?

50:22.240 --> 50:24.600
Yeah, I didn't remember that was part of the story.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.080
I don't remember airheads being real life.

50:27.080 --> 50:30.040
Yeah, even though I agree with the point of what they're

50:30.040 --> 50:32.280
doing, I totally understand that that's

50:32.280 --> 50:34.960
a brazen act of insubordination.

50:34.960 --> 50:37.240
Listen, you guys are heroes, but we can't just

50:37.240 --> 50:38.880
not do anything about this.

50:38.880 --> 50:41.600
Ultimately, what happened is that the station manager, Jerry

50:41.600 --> 50:44.040
Grant, gave the two a choice to either continue playing

50:44.040 --> 50:47.520
Dixie Chicks songs and get fired or stop, unlock the studio,

50:47.520 --> 50:49.200
and be suspended for a few days.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.360
And they chose to end the occupation of the station.

50:52.360 --> 50:53.400
So courageous.

50:53.400 --> 50:55.060
I have a huge problem with everything

50:55.060 --> 50:56.840
surrounding this story, but I'm not

50:56.840 --> 50:58.880
sure I disagree with these two DJs getting

50:58.880 --> 51:00.960
a slap on the wrist for essentially, like you said,

51:00.960 --> 51:02.080
living the movie airheads.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.640
Yeah, yeah, I mean, come on.

51:03.640 --> 51:04.760
You can't live the movie.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.440
You can't live the movie airheads.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.440
You just can't do it.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.560
It's like what they did.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.240
Even in the movie airheads, they couldn't

51:10.240 --> 51:11.440
live the movie airheads.

51:11.440 --> 51:14.600
What they did was for a good cause, sort of,

51:14.600 --> 51:15.840
as we learn later.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.520
And I support the statement of playing their music.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.040
Censorship is dumb no matter what.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.200
Absolutely.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.500
And so I wouldn't want them to be punished too harshly,

51:23.500 --> 51:25.560
but you can't lock yourself in a radio booth

51:25.560 --> 51:28.360
and pirate the transmission and expect nothing to happen.

51:28.360 --> 51:29.560
There is that.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.040
There is that.

51:31.040 --> 51:31.920
If I were your boss.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.640
But the protest is there's consequences.

51:33.640 --> 51:36.400
I think that is actually a pretty restrained response

51:36.400 --> 51:37.520
from the boss.

51:37.520 --> 51:40.040
Couple days suspension, whatever.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.480
Almost wise too.

51:41.480 --> 51:43.260
Because if he'd overreacted, everybody

51:43.260 --> 51:44.680
would have turned it into a cause.

51:44.680 --> 51:46.100
But giving them a slap on the wrist

51:46.100 --> 51:48.160
is almost insulting to them.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.480
Like, your protest was worth nothing more

51:50.480 --> 51:51.760
than take a day off.

51:51.760 --> 51:54.360
And from some of the articles that I found,

51:54.360 --> 51:57.720
it seems like Grant, the station manager guy, was like, yeah,

51:57.720 --> 52:00.280
we were getting ready to start playing their music again

52:00.280 --> 52:03.600
anyway, but we wanted to do it on our terms.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.640
And this wasn't the way we wanted to do it.

52:05.640 --> 52:06.720
Right, right, right.

52:06.720 --> 52:08.080
You guys stole our thunder.

52:08.080 --> 52:12.240
I could see how this would be like, eh, you know what?

52:12.240 --> 52:15.160
It's ultimately the audience and the people.

52:15.160 --> 52:16.560
It's been two months.

52:16.560 --> 52:18.200
The audience is kind of over it.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.120
The rage cycle has run its course.

52:20.120 --> 52:20.560
We got it.

52:20.560 --> 52:21.360
Freedom fries.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.160
Let's move on.

52:22.160 --> 52:22.840
It's stupid.

52:22.840 --> 52:24.880
And so the station's getting ready to be like,

52:24.880 --> 52:26.000
let's go back to normal.

52:26.000 --> 52:26.640
Let's just pretend this is happening.

52:26.640 --> 52:27.520
Landslide.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.480
People like that song.

52:28.480 --> 52:29.480
Yeah, everybody's fine.

52:29.480 --> 52:30.680
Everybody's fine.

52:30.680 --> 52:31.400
Yeah.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.680
And these guys just jump the gun.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.840
Yeah, which is also interesting, and maybe probably

52:36.840 --> 52:39.400
for the best, I bet they got a shit ton of free press

52:39.400 --> 52:40.560
out of that.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.760
He even suspended them, and then they came back,

52:42.760 --> 52:45.400
and everybody was like, yeah, you guys are back on that.

52:45.400 --> 52:45.960
I don't know.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.920
I don't know if you remember those dudes' names.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.520
Oh, no.

52:48.520 --> 52:50.440
They're titans of the industry now.

52:50.440 --> 52:52.040
I just said their names.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.960
You don't remember them.

52:53.960 --> 52:56.480
Dave Grohl.

52:56.480 --> 53:00.120
I mean, it's a story that you kind of remember in as much as

53:00.120 --> 53:03.000
I do remember that there were some DJs who got in trouble

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
for playing Dixie Chicks.

53:04.000 --> 53:04.840
Sure, sure.

53:04.840 --> 53:06.720
I don't remember those details.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.080
I don't remember their names.

53:08.080 --> 53:08.680
No.

53:08.680 --> 53:11.240
I don't think that they're Kevin and Bean.

53:11.240 --> 53:15.440
Or have not gone on to live echoing throughout history.

53:15.440 --> 53:15.960
That's true.

53:15.960 --> 53:19.000
Yeah, so I don't know if the publicity stunt angle of it

53:19.000 --> 53:22.080
worked out as well as you imagine.

53:22.080 --> 53:22.720
But yeah.

53:22.720 --> 53:23.680
Yeah, good for that.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.760
Anyway, when I heard that they were going to be on,

53:25.760 --> 53:27.720
I thought, OK, here we go.

53:27.720 --> 53:28.200
Yeah.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.480
This is nonsense.

53:29.480 --> 53:30.200
This should be fun.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.600
This is exactly the kind of thing

53:31.600 --> 53:35.360
that I think is really fun about going back to 2003.

53:35.360 --> 53:35.880
Totally.

53:35.880 --> 53:41.160
These long-forgotten sort of, I don't want to call it trivial,

53:41.160 --> 53:44.240
because what happened to the Dixie Chicks was so unfair.

53:44.240 --> 53:47.600
And I'm not going to minimize that at all.

53:47.600 --> 53:48.120
Of course.

53:48.120 --> 53:50.920
But in terms of Alex's world, this

53:50.920 --> 53:55.520
is trivial compared to we're all going to die.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.400
Right, right, right.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.800
We're fighting the literal devil.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.560
Also, these two guys got suspended

53:59.560 --> 54:01.240
for playing the Dixie Chicks.

54:01.240 --> 54:05.160
So there's a little bit of a disconnect in stakes,

54:05.160 --> 54:05.920
if you will.

54:05.920 --> 54:08.480
And it's a time when these guys are probably

54:08.480 --> 54:10.040
not super political.

54:10.040 --> 54:11.920
But they don't know who Alex Jones is.

54:11.920 --> 54:13.440
He has a nationally syndicated show.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.000
Right, right, right, right.

54:14.000 --> 54:14.760
Why not go on it?

54:14.760 --> 54:16.000
Right, right, right, right.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.800
So you get this weird intersection

54:17.800 --> 54:19.760
of things that would never happen nowadays.

54:19.760 --> 54:20.840
And I think it's amazing.

54:20.840 --> 54:21.400
Yeah.

54:21.400 --> 54:25.080
Anyway, just to check in on where Alex is at with the NRA.

54:25.080 --> 54:26.320
How are they doing?

54:26.320 --> 54:29.120
They would then deny that S-22 even existed,

54:29.120 --> 54:30.880
the gun registration bill.

54:30.880 --> 54:32.600
But now it's come out that it does.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.000
And they weren't going to warn you about it.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.080
So they're loyal opposition.

54:37.080 --> 54:37.920
And it makes sense.

54:37.920 --> 54:39.560
When the NRA gets more members, when

54:39.560 --> 54:42.320
things are going badly for the Second Amendment,

54:42.320 --> 54:44.120
they get more signups.

54:44.120 --> 54:46.880
Yeah, so Alex doesn't like the NRA at all.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.680
He hates them.

54:47.680 --> 54:49.320
I don't like this.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.760
I don't like going into the past as much as you do.

54:51.760 --> 54:56.280
Because I find that his behavior is less egregious.

54:56.280 --> 54:59.080
And thus makes me feel more like I'm saying stuff

54:59.080 --> 55:02.840
where I'm like, I mean, yeah, that's a good point.

55:02.840 --> 55:03.520
I don't like it.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.160
I don't like it.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.960
Because his behavior is still egregious.

55:05.960 --> 55:07.200
It's just under the surface.

55:07.200 --> 55:08.080
No, no, no.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.840
But also, here's the thing that we

55:09.840 --> 55:12.040
need to really finally delineate.

55:12.040 --> 55:15.120
It's like, yes, opposition to the NRA is great.

55:15.120 --> 55:16.960
Opposition to Bush is great.

55:16.960 --> 55:19.800
We can agree with those things as sentences

55:19.800 --> 55:20.680
on a piece of paper.

55:20.680 --> 55:21.200
Correct.

55:21.200 --> 55:25.560
Now, the motivation for why Alex is against both of those things

55:25.560 --> 55:27.000
is different than what we think.

55:27.000 --> 55:27.600
Totally.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.120
And so I actually think that you can be,

55:30.120 --> 55:32.160
what you're experiencing is exactly

55:32.160 --> 55:34.360
what lured a lot of people who wouldn't agree

55:34.360 --> 55:35.960
with Alex's radical politics.

55:35.960 --> 55:36.840
Exactly.

55:36.840 --> 55:40.120
Into thinking he was more in the center than he actually is.

55:40.120 --> 55:40.720
Totally.

55:40.720 --> 55:43.040
You know, you think like, oh, this guy doesn't like the NRA.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.200
Right.

55:44.200 --> 55:46.840
Maybe he's one of these people who's kind of conservative

55:46.840 --> 55:48.120
but kind of gets it.

55:48.120 --> 55:50.600
No, he's more extreme than the NRA.

55:50.600 --> 55:51.160
Totally.

55:51.160 --> 55:51.880
I know.

55:51.880 --> 55:52.880
That's so frustrating.

55:52.880 --> 55:55.480
He's attacking from way far to the right.

55:55.480 --> 55:55.960
I know.

55:55.960 --> 55:58.840
It's so frustrating that he could get away

55:58.840 --> 55:59.720
with it conceivably.

55:59.720 --> 56:00.200
Yeah.

56:00.200 --> 56:00.800
And he does.

56:00.800 --> 56:01.280
He does.

56:01.280 --> 56:03.680
And he does, as we're talking about him now.

56:03.680 --> 56:04.960
So obviously got away with it.

56:04.960 --> 56:08.440
And I think it worked really well for him at this era.

56:08.440 --> 56:09.280
Yeah, he nailed it.

56:09.280 --> 56:10.120
Yeah.

56:10.120 --> 56:12.880
And I think one of the things that is really good for him,

56:12.880 --> 56:15.080
too, is this branding.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.440
And we're talking about this attacking the NRA

56:17.440 --> 56:21.320
from the right, because he is a extreme right wing person.

56:21.320 --> 56:22.200
Right, right, right.

56:22.200 --> 56:25.000
And attacking Bush because he's extremely

56:25.000 --> 56:28.280
far to the right of Bush, not because he's to the left

56:28.280 --> 56:29.440
or he's in the center.

56:29.440 --> 56:31.240
People could get that impression.

56:31.240 --> 56:33.440
And Alex plays into that impression.

56:33.440 --> 56:34.040
Totally.

56:34.040 --> 56:35.440
And in this next clip, he's talking

56:35.440 --> 56:37.560
about how people call him a commie

56:37.560 --> 56:39.880
because he's against Bush.

56:39.880 --> 56:42.760
Again, I will make the admission here.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.360
I'm pro-gun 110%.

56:44.360 --> 56:46.600
It's an absolute right.

56:46.600 --> 56:47.720
I'm pro-sovereignty.

56:47.720 --> 56:48.640
I'm pro-family.

56:48.640 --> 56:49.680
I'm for low taxes.

56:49.680 --> 56:51.920
I'm for abolishing the Federal Reserve.

56:51.920 --> 56:58.040
That means in today's dialectic that I am a ultra communist.

56:58.040 --> 57:01.800
Now, if you're a neocon who's an admitted Trotskyite,

57:01.800 --> 57:05.600
if you're a beatnik who has a national talk show

57:05.600 --> 57:08.160
and who's an admitted communist, you are now a conservative.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.480
And I'm not being sarcastic.

57:09.480 --> 57:12.160
I am now a communist because I'm pro-America.

57:12.160 --> 57:15.080
They, the communists, learned how to flap American flags

57:15.080 --> 57:18.040
in our face and talk about how conservative they are.

57:18.040 --> 57:19.720
They are now the conservatives.

57:19.720 --> 57:24.720
See, Alex has this superficial defining himself

57:24.720 --> 57:28.360
by opposition to things that actually

57:28.360 --> 57:30.600
does fool a lot of people.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.600
I'm opposed to Bush.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.120
And now everyone calls me a commie.

57:33.120 --> 57:36.120
When I was against Clinton, they called

57:36.120 --> 57:37.880
me a hard-right extremist.

57:37.880 --> 57:39.640
You were, and you still are.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.440
Right.

57:40.440 --> 57:41.520
Yeah.

57:41.520 --> 57:46.920
I don't know if I ever had anybody who I heard say,

57:46.920 --> 57:49.640
like, Alex is a communist because he's against Bush.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.120
No.

57:50.120 --> 57:52.520
I just think that people thought he was more sensible

57:52.520 --> 57:55.200
than you might think on first blush.

57:55.200 --> 57:55.680
Right.

57:55.680 --> 57:58.760
And if you are an enemy of any part of the right wing,

57:58.760 --> 58:01.680
you will be called a communist, regardless

58:01.680 --> 58:04.560
of anything you may or may not have ever said or believed.

58:04.560 --> 58:06.520
Possibly by other people in the right wing.

58:06.520 --> 58:07.080
Yeah.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.040
No, definitely.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.440
Like Alex is calling Michael Savage a communist.

58:09.440 --> 58:09.960
Exactly.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.360
No, definitely that.

58:11.360 --> 58:11.360
That's what I'm saying.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.520
This is just bickering.

58:12.520 --> 58:13.040
Yeah.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.080
It's just whining.

58:14.080 --> 58:14.600
Yeah.

58:14.600 --> 58:15.840
Yeah.

58:15.840 --> 58:19.960
So I think that there is a pretty key problem there, too.

58:19.960 --> 58:22.360
And I do think that it's something

58:22.360 --> 58:24.080
that I notice about Alex.

58:24.080 --> 58:29.200
And that is the defining self by opposition

58:29.200 --> 58:30.760
or by others' response.

58:30.760 --> 58:31.240
Yeah.

58:31.240 --> 58:33.560
When he talks all the time about knowing that he's right

58:33.560 --> 58:35.520
because people are attacking him and stuff,

58:35.520 --> 58:40.720
it's like, that's not a reliable metric of, you know,

58:40.720 --> 58:42.920
oh, I'm right because everybody hates me.

58:42.920 --> 58:43.680
It's like, wow.

58:43.680 --> 58:44.240
Yeah.

58:44.240 --> 58:46.280
Does that mean that ISIS is right?

58:46.280 --> 58:46.960
Yeah.

58:46.960 --> 58:47.880
No.

58:47.880 --> 58:50.560
If he goes to therapy one time, the first question

58:50.560 --> 58:52.920
is just going to be like, how do you define yourself?

58:52.920 --> 58:55.120
And he's going to talk about everybody but himself.

58:55.120 --> 58:58.200
And he's going to be like, no, but like from the inside.

58:58.200 --> 59:01.720
And it's going to be six years of constant talking

59:01.720 --> 59:03.720
to just even figure out where he starts.

59:03.720 --> 59:04.120
Yeah.

59:04.120 --> 59:04.640
Yeah.

59:04.640 --> 59:06.720
So these DJs come on.

59:06.720 --> 59:08.600
And I got to say, there's a little bit

59:08.600 --> 59:10.440
of a different style for Alex.

59:10.440 --> 59:13.240
He opens the interview by asking a tough question.

59:13.240 --> 59:13.960
OK.

59:13.960 --> 59:15.800
Let me just get this out of the way up front.

59:15.800 --> 59:18.040
Was this a stunt you guys pulled with management?

59:18.040 --> 59:18.920
Absolutely not.

59:18.920 --> 59:19.600
No.

59:19.600 --> 59:20.400
Nope.

59:20.400 --> 59:21.360
All right.

59:21.360 --> 59:22.040
Well, we did it.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.200
Good journalism, everybody.

59:23.200 --> 59:23.760
Let's go.

59:23.760 --> 59:25.080
Let's wrap it up and go home.

59:25.080 --> 59:26.680
That's certainly better journalism

59:26.680 --> 59:27.680
than he normally does.

59:27.680 --> 59:28.200
It is.

59:28.200 --> 59:28.760
It is.

59:28.760 --> 59:32.040
It is very much better than a leading question like, so,

59:32.040 --> 59:33.800
how long has your management been evil

59:33.800 --> 59:36.480
and in the pocket of the devil and the globalists

59:36.480 --> 59:38.000
that have been trying to oppress you?

59:38.000 --> 59:40.480
I think Alex's bedside manner leaves a little bit

59:40.480 --> 59:43.520
to be desired there in terms of like, was this a stunt?

59:43.520 --> 59:44.400
No.

59:44.400 --> 59:45.760
Shit.

59:45.760 --> 59:46.880
No follow-up questions.

59:46.880 --> 59:49.320
I was going to say, that does have the feel of like,

59:49.320 --> 59:51.400
maybe if I just surprise them aggressively,

59:51.400 --> 59:54.400
they'll be tricked into answering honestly.

59:54.400 --> 59:58.760
So one of the things that I think Alex had been presenting,

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.400
and I think it's what a lot of people felt,

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.400
was that this was a principled stand

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.120
that these DJs were making.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.560
That it was, they were opposed to the band,

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.480
and they played this music as a way of being like, no.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.720
We believe in free speech.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.240
Pirate radio.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.520
Vietnam War.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.000
We're doing it all over again.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.320
If you listen to them, it's very clear

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.400
that that's not the case.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.120
OK.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.880
They did not agree with what Natalie said.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.400
They agreed with the band.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.680
They just thought it had run its course.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.240
Due to a majority of, not all of our listeners,

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.040
a couple of months ago saying they did not

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.160
want to hear the Dixie Chicks on our radio station because

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.680
of what Natalie Main said about our president over in London.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.240
So it was starting to turn the other way,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.000
like can you start playing the Chicks?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.120
Yeah, we had requests for them and everything.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.000
But we decided we are, for our troops, 100%,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.120
we're for the president 100%, but we're also

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.920
for the First Amendment 100%.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.120
Should Natalie Main, the Dixie Chicks, say what she said?

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.160
Absolutely not.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.800
Well, America, I mean, in America,

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.040
you've got the First Amendment.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.760
That's what the military is for, is

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.440
to defend our constitutional republic.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.800
And just this whole blacklisting, this whole demonization

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.880
of the Dixie Chicks over this has sent shockwaves

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.480
across the country, a giant chilling effect,

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.880
and America's going in the wrong direction here.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.560
Well, but they were fine with this for two months.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.360
Yeah.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.160
They were fine.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:26.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.360
Until the tide started to turn and people were like,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.800
eh, we want to listen to the Dixie Chicks.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.240
Ed, didn't you read the First Amendment?

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.360
It has an expiration date of two months.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.160
I don't know.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.040
I mean, I don't know how I feel about this

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.320
from a station management perspective.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.920
Do they have the right to just say,

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.040
I don't want to play this person's songs?

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.440
If they don't have a contract that they have to play,

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.040
maybe it's shitty if you're not playing someone's music because

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.760
of a political reason.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.560
But if you're a metal station, you're

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.800
not required to play reggae, right?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:10.280
Unless, I don't know, Wyclef says something anti-Bush,

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.840
then you have to play it.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.760
And so it is a protest to not play it.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.800
What if this is, like, we're talking mid, late 90s,

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.480
you've got an alternative station,

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.800
but you hate Peanut, just personally.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.560
Just personally.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.720
Do you have to play 311?

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.320
I assume not.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.960
If you're a station manager and you just

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.320
have a personal problem with Nick Hexum,

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.760
do you have to play 311?

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.320
I don't think so.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:37.960
I don't know.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.720
It's weird.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.400
And certainly, I'm opposed to politically just saying,

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.200
no, your politics are such that I'm not

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.200
going to play your songs.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.360
But I mean, if I was going to be impressed by these DJs having

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.880
any interest in the First Amendment,

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.800
then their actions would have probably come earlier.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.480
No, it is a little bit like a.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.120
This is just, I've decided that it is no longer popular for me

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.440
to suppress this speech.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.880
Yeah, I mean, it's like if Barnes and Noble was like,

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.640
eh, we're not going to carry Jane Austen.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.680
We're just not doing it.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.800
I remember her comments about Bush.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.160
And so we don't carry it anymore.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.600
And then two months later, they're like, eh,

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.840
we'll put Jane Austen back in there.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.360
No big deal.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.600
Yeah, this new Jane Austen novel is pretty hot.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.920
People like it.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.040
So yeah, this is pretty much exactly what they say.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.560
They're just like, oh, the listeners

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.400
wanted them to come back.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.760
We listened to our listeners.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.800
And the listeners said they didn't want to play it,

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.600
so we listened.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.840
Well, that's good, but I do want you guys

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.040
to go back and get on the radio and go,

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.960
you can tune into Alex Jones at 1580.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.040
Will you do that for me?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.640
No, seriously, guys.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.400
Was that a joke?

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:38.840
No.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.360
No.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.040
He said no.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.080
Seriously, guys.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.280
I think that was not a joke.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.520
That was very much not a joke.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.480
Guys, please give me a plug, please.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.600
That wasn't even like one of those jokes where you laugh,

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.880
but you're hoping they'll be like, no, no, no.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.400
We're totally going to do that.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.000
You'll be like, no, that wasn't what I was trying to do.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.240
I was just making a joke.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:56.920
It wasn't that.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.520
It was like, hey, plug me on your show.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.800
No, seriously.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.480
Hey, guys, you made a lot of news with that suspension,

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.400
and you might have more listeners right now.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.840
And could you please plug me?

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.280
Yeah, it is nice to know that clout chasing, still

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.920
strong back in 2003.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.240
Oh, yeah, he was an early adopter.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.800
So Alex has, it's fucking clear.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.680
He doesn't really spell it out, but it's really clear

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.480
that he thinks that there's a conspiracy afoot.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.360
So here's the conspiracy.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.920
Clear channel on a bunch of radio stations.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.040
I already believe it.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:31.540
Right?

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.040
Yeah.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.040
So Clear Channel own a bunch of radio stations

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.680
and also a bunch of concert venues.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.160
True.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.320
So what they have done.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.080
And billboards?

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.280
They have manufactured a whole crisis

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.120
where the Dixie Chicks get kicked off these stations that

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.480
are owned by Clear Channel.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.460
And then they go on tour, and they sell out all their shows

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.280
at these venues that are owned by Clear Channel.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.600
Now, I would suggest that the Dixie Chicks don't

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.800
need to sell more tickets.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.400
No, they were doing all right.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.060
They were huge.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.480
They were about at the peak of their power.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.240
They were huge.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:02.760
Yeah.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.960
They were huge.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.920
One of the reasons that it was so nuts

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.160
that they were almost piling on them in the right way

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.040
was because they were in the top three, top four country music

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.200
acts in the world.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.080
They were killing it.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:15.960
They were killing it.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.880
That's why they had to be taken down,

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.220
because they had too large of a platform to criticize Bush

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:20.720
with.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.220
Yes.

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:26.360
So Alex tries to lay out this conspiracy to the DJs.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.440
Now, for this conspiracy to make sense,

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.520
there's two things that need to be true.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.000
One, this needs to be a Clear Channel station.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.680
True.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.320
Two, the venue where the Dixie Chicks are playing

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.200
needs to be owned by Clear Channel.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.400
Both of those must be true for this conspiracy

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.480
to have any effect on them.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.480
Now, I have read that is your station Clear Channel?

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.060
No.

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:50.560
OK.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.800
I mean, I have some on there.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.000
They said that simultaneously?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.200
I actually read this piece of history.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.560
They've been asked that a lot.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.480
Clear Channel, a big part of their business

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.640
isn't just playing music.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.840
It's putting on concerts.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.440
Is it true, from what you know, that Clear Channel was actually

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.140
involved in promoting Dixie Chicks concerts?

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:10.080
I don't know if they are the promoter behind the Dixie

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.120
Chicks concerts or not.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:14.400
I know they have several venues across the country,

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.320
including a couple in Colorado.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.820
And they have Clear Channel Entertainment,

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.280
which promotes concerts.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.680
But I'm not sure if they're one of the promoters for the Chicks

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.200
or not.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.000
Have the Dixie Chicks played at their venues?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.200
They, not at their, well, their venue in Colorado

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.320
is fairly small.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.860
The Dixie Chicks will be playing at the Pepsi Center, which

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.080
is a large venue.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.720
That's where the Nuggets and the Avalanche play.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.080
Yeah, well, I have read that they've been involved.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.640
So could it be a larger publicity stunt?

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.160
Boy, they get all this attention.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.080
I guess we won't know.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.240
But you know, on radio, people do pull stunts.

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.320
And we're trying to find that out.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.880
People do pull stunts.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.640
True.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.320
But this has fallen apart.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.240
Usually, it's more like payola or something like that.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.160
Sure.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160
Not necessarily this.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.000
I think that this interview has fascinatingly fallen apart.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.760
Because these DJs are not free speech crusaders in the way

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.040
that Alex maybe would have liked them to be.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.080
It would have been great.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:17.120
And now, they have refuted twice in the span of about a minute

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.040
pillars of his conspiracy that Clear Channel is trying

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:24.040
to boost their live ticket sales for one of the most popular

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.560
acts in the world by pulling a stunt where they get

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.720
kicked off radio stations.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.680
If you were Alex, and you had a top three of things

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.320
that you hoped were true, at least one of those

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.800
should have been true.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.440
Man.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:38.960
None of those.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.520
No.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.360
Oh, that's not good.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:40.760
Nope.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.600
At the very least, you're not a data point

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.400
for the Clear Channel conspiracy.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.120
So I think Alex is recognizing some of the similar things

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.160
that I am, and that is that this has fallen apart.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:50.680
Sure.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.200
And so he decides to retreat to attacking these guys.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.480
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.640
We support Natalie Maine's right to say whatever she wants.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.920
So since you said it, we don't agree with what you said

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.600
by any means.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.680
Let me ask you a question.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.800
You guys supported, then, the takeover of Iraq.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.520
Well, you know, we support our troops.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.000
And it's hard to say whether we're there,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
because I don't know personally whether or not

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.520
there are weapons of mass destruction

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.360
and whether there's a necessity to do what is being done.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.480
I'm not an expert on that.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.800
But you're supporting the troops end to end.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.640
We understand that, but wouldn't you

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.880
say it supports the troops, not to sell Saddam, VX, and sarin,

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.240
and then order our troops to blow up the bunkers,

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.640
and then when they breathe that stuff in 91,

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.840
to not give them treatment?

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.300
Because that's a big deal.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.520
That really hurt the troops right there.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.320
Well, that's true.

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.480
Of course, we're just country DJs,

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.720
and for us, it's about the music, mainly.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.160
Yeah.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.040
They are just country DJs.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.840
This is unfair.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.640
This is a writ.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.800
I like that defense.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.600
Yeah.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.640
I would like to use that.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.400
Yeah, OK.

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.760
So my position is that I support the troops.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.680
And your rebuttal to that is making

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.040
me own literally everything the government has ever done?

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.000
Great.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.240
How about I tell you that I'm a country DJ,

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.400
and we move the fuck along, because I'm not

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.160
going to litigate every decision the government has ever made.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.200
What a great comeback.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.320
Because what do you expect from a country DJ?

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.600
I'll tell you what.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.640
Complicated and clear-eyed views of global international

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.000
politics?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.200
No.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.920
And they even express.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.200
We have some fun on our show.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.320
We play music.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.760
We're not all that political.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.360
Certainly, coming on a show, you certainly confuse us.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.240
Why did you say all those words?

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.400
I think that that is Alex just trying to take something

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.160
from the interview, because it went so poorly.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.200
Clear channel conspiracy didn't work out.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.080
These guys aren't heroes.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.600
They're kind of just morning zoo dicks.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.320
Yeah.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:04.840
Yeah.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.840
If you have been deflated so completely by these assholes,

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:15.080
then there's also that little bit of Alex's resentment

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.520
coming out of like, you didn't give me what I want,

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.320
so I will take it from you.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.680
That kind of feel, yeah.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.800
So I think that there's a little bit of a codependency

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.960
with the audience.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.360
And this caller who calls in after the interview

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.880
wants to make Alex feel better and try and help him

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.920
with that clear channel conspiracy.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.640
First of all, the name of the promotions company

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.120
is SFX Entertainment is promoting the Dixie Chicks concert.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.960
You go to the website, it comes up Clear Channel Entertainment.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.640
Yeah, that's what I've seen that actually, who was it?

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.560
It was Reuters ran an article like two weeks ago on that.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.200
Yeah, SFX, and it's Clear Channel.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.680
And then they start the ban, which then

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.840
makes it all go down.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.640
Everybody suddenly wants it.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.320
Then they make more money off of it.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.240
But here's the big scam.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.160
It doesn't matter.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.920
It still creates a chilling effect for everybody else.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.080
Ooh, you better not speak out, because then you'll be banned,

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.040
and people never even know it was a scam.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.520
Yeah, second thing, I just kind of wanted to gloss over that.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.720
Does that make you mad?

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.200
Yeah, it does.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:17.960
It really does.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.560
It should.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.080
It does.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.400
It really does make me mad.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.840
SFX Entertainment is Live Nation that

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.400
was bought by Clear Channel and then got spun off

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.280
into its own thing again.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.040
Yeah, I don't know.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.640
I couldn't go back and figure out if the Dixie Chicks,

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.960
all of their events were run through Live Nation.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.600
Sure.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.360
I don't know.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360
I don't think.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.360
And I also don't care.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.840
It doesn't prove any conspiracy here.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.120
Yeah, I was going to say, on the list of, again, I believe

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.080
we are at this moment fighting the literal devil who

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.600
is destroying all of Iraq in order,

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.040
in service of destroying all of the United States.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.560
So what Clear Channel's doing about the Dixie Chicks

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.280
promotions?

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.240
Trying to make a few extra bucks on tickets?

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.080
I mean, yeah.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.640
Whatever.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.880
Go for it, Clear Channel.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.760
I would say that I'd be willing to stipulate, and not

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.040
accept as true, but I'll just go ahead and not even fight it,

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.720
that Clear Channel, by virtue of Alive Nation,

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.480
is doing ticketing for all of the Dixie Chicks.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.000
Sure.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.040
Sure, why not?

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.760
That still doesn't prove the conspiracy.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.880
And now it's just acting like hearing that is like,

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880
a-ha-ha, slim dunk.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.400
True.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.160
Now, I won't put it past the recording industry.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.120
They pull off some bullshit all the time.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.000
Yeah, man.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.320
I saw Josie and the Pussycats.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.640
Yeah, the whole industry's bullshit.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.360
That movie was fraught with scandal.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.200
I get it, all of these conspiracies.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.520
So a caller calls in, another one, and he's got a theory.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:51.600
But sometimes, Alex's show is being blocked out by waves.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.800
OK.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.520
I think sometimes when you come on air,

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.920
they try to block you out, too, because you

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.760
hit so much truthful points.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.520
What do you mean they try to block a show?

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.520
Well, I know frequencies, I know other listeners

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.640
in the area who listen to you at the same hours.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.640
If they're going to listen to you late at night,

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.040
they can't get you in, too.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.360
And it'd be a frequency, and you can hear it,

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.240
but I don't know if they're trying to block you out or what,

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.240
but sometimes, I call other people,

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.040
and they get in the same thing, too.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.520
But you can hear us fine during the day, though.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.360
Fine during the day, but at nighttime, when people are home

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.440
and want to listen to the radio, yeah, everybody

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.720
wants to get the same block out.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.640
They can't get you in.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.480
Yeah, well, that's probably just because AMs

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.520
aren't as strong at night.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.600
Listen, thank you for the call.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.400
I appreciate it.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.000
Great, great.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.520
What a bad job by Alex.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.520
What a bad job.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.440
I just wrote down, what do you mean they block us out?

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.240
Like, Alex said, what do you mean they block us out?

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.280
Not, obviously, they block us out.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.840
They're always trying to block us out.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.560
They've been trying to block us out since I started,

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.600
because I know too much.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.320
Well, I think Alex realizes there's not

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.160
money in that, probably.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.240
And the only action you might end up precipitating

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.160
is harassment of the stations that do play him.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:07.720
That's true.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.520
And you might end up cutting in.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.280
You might bite the hand that feeds there.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:11.800
Sure, sure.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.400
Can't do that.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.360
So this might actually just be something like,

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.800
it's not even worth it to try and convince people.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.920
Spin this into, yeah.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.880
We're under attack.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.640
Like, what are you going to do?

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.800
You're going to end up fucking with the affiliates.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.400
Right, right, right, right, right.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.440
No good.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.720
So Alex gets down to describing his enemies.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.680
See if you hear the devil in here.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.520
It's not a dictatorship of Bill Clinton or George Bush.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.320
They're just puppets.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.400
It's a dictatorship of the military industrial complex

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:42.120
was bankrolled and founded to run this country

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.120
by the private European banks.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.640
There's no fight between the EU and the UN in America.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.920
It's all owned by the same private shareholders,

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.880
the Warbirds, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.920
the Dutch Royal Family, the British Royal Family,

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.360
the Bilderberg Group, the people that meet and publicly call

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.400
for open world dictatorship.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.960
So that sounds astoundingly terrestrial.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.720
Yeah.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.640
That sounds like business interests

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.520
who have an idea of working together

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.960
to create a worldwide dictatorship tyranny.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.440
Yeah.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.080
It does not seem like it's people

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.360
who are in the employ of the devil who has contacted them

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.840
via transdimensional demons and offered them life extension

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.880
technology if they carry out an elaborate and hyper complicated

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.040
plan to slowly and orderly kill off humanity.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.720
Should they fail to do that, they

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.360
have a backup plan to just really super bio weapons

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.640
and kill everybody off.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.280
It seems like this is a guy who wants

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.440
to at least be taken seriously as a not science fiction

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.880
writer.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.600
Yeah.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.560
His improvised storytelling is much more like Grisham

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:53.280
at this point as opposed to Philip K. Dick.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.480
This is the firm.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.400
That's what this is.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.160
It's fighting against powerful lawyers,

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.240
taking over everything.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:00.840
No, I got it.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.560
It's not magical realism.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.840
No, no.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.320
Indeed, in fact, it seems like his biggest problem

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.120
is ultimately what the end result of capitalism

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.680
always seems to be, which is staggering wealth and inequality

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.560
leading to an aristocratic business class.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.880
I'd love for you to go back in time

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.800
and talk to him about that.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:18.920
That would be interesting.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.200
So that caller who's talking about Alex being under attack

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.440
through waves, right?

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.600
Sure.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.960
Man, I thought he was nuts.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.200
Oh, have we changed our mind already?

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.840
US terror plan called Cuban invasion pretext.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.080
US military leaders proposed in 62 a secret plan

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.000
to commit terrorist acts against Americans

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.160
and blame Cuba to create a pretext for invasion

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.480
and ouster of communist leader Fidel Castro who they put in.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.320
No, they use the war against the communists

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.600
as a way to warp the minds of our military men and our CIA

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.640
and get them to do evil things and set up

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.960
a culture of evil, which is now used for narcotics trafficking

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.080
and money laundering and white slavery,

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.200
every other evil you can imagine.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:58.960
And it goes on.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.280
It's a scalar attack.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.560
Too much truth.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.880
Now, Alex, he plays a song and then he comes back

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.200
from break and is like, yeah, we're in Texas

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.760
and the satellites in Minnesota, so sometimes there's problems.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.400
He's very just like, eh, it happens.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.320
It happens.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.760
It's part of the gig.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:29.200
That's fair, but could be an attack

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.080
because he's telling too much truth.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.200
Possible.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.840
So Alex has an article in the LA Times

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.920
that he's been bringing up a little bit,

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.520
and this has to do with our old boy Joseph McCarthy.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.840
Oh, boy.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.760
Continuing with the news, despite McCarthy,

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.360
red peril really was.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.600
John Maroney, LA Times.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.840
And it goes on.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.200
It says the document shouldn't be

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.240
allowed to undermine the important historical fact

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.920
that Soviet communism was a very real threat to US defense

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.520
and freedom, and the anti-communist fight waged

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.960
in the country was a moral one, even though the Communist

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.760
Party succeeded in seducing an estimated 230,000

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.160
Americans to its ranks over the course of 40 years.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.040
And it now says that the documents released

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.600
show that McCarthy was right.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.160
This article from the LA Times is an opinion piece,

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.800
and Alex is actually lying about the main thrust of the article.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.600
The author, John Maroney, is arguing

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.520
that there was a point to opposing communism

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.560
during the Cold War, but the actions of people

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.360
like Joseph McCarthy gave that opposition a really bad name.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.560
Because McCarthy was an opportunist, fraud,

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.120
and demagogue. Even in that sentence,

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.600
Alex reads the words, quote, the documents

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.040
shouldn't be allowed to undermine

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.760
the important historical fact that the Soviet communism was

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.880
a very real threat.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.680
Like, those words don't make sense.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.600
Sure.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.320
Aren't his listeners curious why this article is arguing

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.080
that documents would possibly undermine

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.560
that notion if this article is about vindicating McCarthy?

01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.240
Possible.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.000
The headline literally starts, quote, despite McCarthy.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:03.840
Yeah.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.440
Anyway.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.160
Yeah.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.200
Those things are in the headline and everything,

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.760
because these documents that got released in 2003

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.080
were a record of secret hearings that McCarthy held

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.760
with witnesses prior to them making public appearances,

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.520
and he was attempting to intimidate them.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.000
Yeah.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:18.600
Yeah.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.600
From an article about the documents from the BBC, quote,

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.080
many had only tenuous connections with communists

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.920
through family members or book clubs where Marx was read

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.200
or unions with left wing leaders.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.600
The new documents paint a picture

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:33.040
of a senator out of control, summoning witnesses

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.640
at short notice and brow beating them

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.160
with the threat of imprisonment or public disgrace.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.400
But it was noticeable that those he could not

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.880
intimidate in private were often not called in public session.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.240
How shitty is our government press

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.760
that they're like, these documents show

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.280
Joseph McCarthy was unhinged.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.360
Like, I don't know if you were alive when he was around?

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:57.800
They reveal a new level of artifice and craft.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.520
Sure.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.800
Sure.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.160
The articles that I was reading about this really

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:06.040
laid out how different he behaved in the public hearings

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.360
and these private ones.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:07.840
Sure.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.160
And there was kind of, it almost feels

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.440
like a feeling out process.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.960
Like that last sentence there, you

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.560
know, the people that wouldn't back down to him

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.440
typically weren't called for the public ones

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.040
because that doesn't create the public perception that he

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.280
is looking to grandstand with.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:23.680
Sure.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.080
Sure.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.920
Also from the article, quote, according

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.600
to Senate historian David Ritchie,

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.480
the private hearings were more of an inquisition

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.960
using circumstantial evidence, hearsay, and intimidation

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.960
to force people to acknowledge his point of view.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.760
The documents that came out in 2003 paint

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.200
Joseph McCarthy as an out of control lunatic

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.640
trying to run a witch hunt.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.400
And this LA Times editorial is an attempt

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.680
to remind readers that just because McCarthy really

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.080
sucked, that doesn't mean that Soviet communism didn't exist.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.680
Hey, Torquemada, what do you say to the inquisition?

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.120
If you were really someone who was opposed to communism

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.880
and you'd read this article, you couldn't come away from it,

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.000
honestly, with the position that it vindicated McCarthy.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.680
The article literally says, quote,

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.640
many seem to have forgotten that the Communist

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.840
Party was dedicated to replacing our democratic form

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.600
of government with a totalitarian state

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.000
similar to what existed in the Soviet Union.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.480
McCarthy and those who exploited his excesses

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:17.000
are largely to blame for this.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.360
According to Moroni, McCarthy is a detriment

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.480
to the opposition of communism.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.200
Essentially, the only two conclusions

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.600
I can come to about Alex's coverage of this article

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:26.680
are the following.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.720
One, he didn't read the article and he

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.120
thinks it actually says that McCarthy was totally cool

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.480
and he's just making up what the body of the text says.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.520
Two, defending McCarthyism and the tactics of witch hunting

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.080
is more important to Alex than actually being opposed

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.000
to communism, which makes his anti-communism essentially

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.600
tactical as opposed to something that's based on principle.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.200
Yeah, I was going to say.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.720
I'm not entirely sure what I think.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.200
I was going to say, you just read

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.440
Alex is also a detriment to anti-communism

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.080
in the exact same fashion that Joseph McCarthy was.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:59.800
So naturally, he would want to defend McCarthy as well.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.760
Yeah, it seems like.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.720
Nobody's like, hey, you know what's great?

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.080
It's the John Birch Society fighting communism.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.120
I think they really did a great job.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.200
I think they really got to the points

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.520
and they really hammered it on.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.840
It seems like he is, you know, like idealistically

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.640
and ideologically opposed to communism and all this.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.520
Sure.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.320
But if he can't do it like McCarthy did it,

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320
he doesn't want to do it.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.960
Exactly, exactly.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.120
Yes, if I can't defeat sex trafficking

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.800
with a daring sunlight raid, then I

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.920
don't want to deal with that.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.400
I just want to make everybody else angry about it.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:40.080
Yeah, I get the sense that he would not

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.920
be so opposed to communism if his route to do it

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.840
was to be an economics professor or a researcher who

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.920
got no fanfare and didn't get to do

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.040
these bombastic public hearings like McCarthy, which

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.800
is Alex's radio show.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.280
If he wasn't able to make a show out of it,

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.320
I don't know if he would be as interested.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:06.080
If leftists weren't as academic and more just shithead

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.520
screaming, we might have Alex on our side

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.480
is basically what we're talking about here.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:11.960
Maybe.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.680
Yeah, it's possible.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.880
He just hates theory so much, Dan.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.960
He hates it whenever they get into theory.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:18.800
Yeah.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.400
So Alex takes another call.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.280
And this guy has a decent point, and Alex

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.520
has a terrible answer to it.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.160
And that is, why are we even talking

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.920
about the assault weapons ban?

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.200
It doesn't even come up until next year.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.480
2004 is when it's up for renewal or let it lap.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.200
Sure, sure.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.160
And so Alex has an interesting answer

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.000
that I think is totally wrong and on brand.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:41.640
Hi, Alex.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.360
How are you doing?

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.520
I've reflected on some things over the last 24 hours,

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.440
and there's several different points.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.680
First off, something dawned upon me.

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.880
Why is the administration dealing with the assault weapons

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.880
ban 15 months before the issue even comes due in the middle

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:00.280
of this climate with so many concerns about the war

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.400
and so forth?

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.560
Why even deal with that out of the blue so far in advance?

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.480
That's strange.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.480
Because they want to act like they're right when they

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.080
activate some mind control fruitcake.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.560
You know, The Matrix is coming out,

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.320
which they say is a big trigger.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.320
Yeah.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.440
Tend to agree.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.360
So he tends to agree that there's probably

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.200
going to be a shooting at the second Matrix opening

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.640
or second Matrix movie, because it's going to be a trigger.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.960
And then they're talking about the assault weapons ban stuff

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.760
so they can be right in advance for this thing that

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.400
didn't happen.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.200
Right.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:31.720
Cool.

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:36.120
And this is a precedent to the way

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.640
he engages with shootings in the future.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.400
Like, this pattern of thinking is there all along.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.280
Yeah.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.120
That almost sounds like Norm Pattis, doesn't it?

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.280
The caller?

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.160
Doesn't that voice almost sound like him?

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:49.720
I'm not sure.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.800
Through a phone, I can kind of hear it,

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.840
and I would love to find out that that was actually

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.080
a young Norm.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:56.600
No way.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.160
Like, developing their relationship.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:58.920
No way.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:24:59.440
Oh, man.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.280
The vibe that I get from Norm from those early appearances

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.120
is either someone who legitimately doesn't really

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.480
understand what Alex does or somebody

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.520
who really, really wants people to think

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.040
he doesn't understand what he does.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:14.720
I don't know.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.680
It just sounds like we're in a TV show in our eighth season,

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.200
and we start doing all the flashbacks.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.800
And it turns out our main characters all coincidentally

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.320
met 20 years ago.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.760
We've already done that, though, and in the 2015 episodes,

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.120
we heard Owen Troyer call in as a fan.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.040
That's true.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.280
What a weird world.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:32.760
Yeah.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.360
So here, Alex is wrong about things

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.440
that will happen in the future.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.520
In Boston, Logan Airport, and four other airports,

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.000
they put NASA brain scanners in to, quote,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.560
tell if you're agitated.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:46.560
In 1984, they didn't scan your brain.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.120
This is total information awareness, worse than 1984.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.160
Then they say, oh, but it's to keep you safe.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.240
It's to keep you safe, America.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.960
We just want to keep you safe.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.360
The borders stay wide open, and they're putting the Bathys

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.920
back in power in Iraq because they're

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.560
good thugs trained by the CIA in the 70s and 80s.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.880
I'm really interested.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.840
I know this is getting repetitive in these 2003

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.400
episodes, but I'm really, really interested in what's

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:18.720
going to happen when de-Bathification comes around.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.480
Because he's hitting this note so consistently.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.240
On every show, he's bringing up how the Bathys are in charge.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.600
And it's because that's who the US government

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.280
and the globalists want to be in charge.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.240
Right, right, right.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.000
He's so insistent about something

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.240
that we know for a fact to be 100% diametrically

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.560
the opposite.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.000
And he is going to eventually run into that brick wall,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.520
driving at 60 miles an hour.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.160
Exactly.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.320
And that's what I'm so interested to see.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.600
Does he hit the brakes at a certain point?

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.200
Or does he just go straight through?

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.240
Yeah, I don't know.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.960
So we'll see.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.280
So another caller calls in.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.800
Is he like the Road Runner where he paints the wall,

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.120
he paints the tunnel on there, and he goes through it.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.680
You're like, what the fuck?

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.400
I feel like that metaphorically is

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.800
what he does a lot of the time, just create a fake tunnel.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.600
Drive through it.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.240
So a caller calls in, wants to know about underground prisons

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.720
that are being built.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.360
I wanted to ask you if you had any information on underground

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.040
prison camps that they're developing.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.200
Yes, I have mainstream news articles.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.520
INS Kentucky poured concrete for two years

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.320
under a giant underground old coal mine

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.720
and built a supermax on top of it with airfields

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.600
and everything.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.320
They're building giant prisons everywhere.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.040
It's the new economy, a giant prison economy

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.240
where they literally own us, where torture

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.840
is the order of the day and is a virtue.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.440
That's very interesting because down here in Trinidad,

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.520
we're having seismographic readings.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.680
And in Trinidad was a site of an old Japanese internment camp,

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.520
and it has old mines, but they're

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.320
getting seismographic readings, but there's no faults there.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.800
And so I'm going to collect as much heart as I can.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.600
Sir, your Denver International Airport

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.760
has pictures of Nazis machine gunning piles of dead bodies,

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.480
satanic art everywhere, a giant FEMA camp on it publicly.

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:07.960
Sure.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.200
Really?

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.320
Yeah, you ever seen the artwork in the Denver airport?

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.160
Bro?

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:12.960
Yeah, so cool.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.040
This is very strange.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.720
This is very strange to listen to Alex

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.480
be like, the prison pipeline or the prison industrial complex

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.360
is going to eventually become what it is.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.760
Like, he's right on about the prison complex.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:28.200
And then to hear the crazier conspiracy theory

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.360
from his caller.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.720
Like, that weirds me out.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.200
We're living in a complete topsy-turvy world

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.480
because normally, nowadays, he would come out with something

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.960
like, you know, the devil's killing everybody,

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.000
and they're like, yeah, but maybe the devil

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.120
is just trying to raise the corporate tax rate.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.120
Like, you know, it's a very weird inversion

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.840
of the way this goes.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:50.080
Yeah, it is true.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.920
And speaking of, like, an inversion of the present,

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.040
this next call is fucked up, if you

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.280
consider Alex in the present.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:28:59.960
OK.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.120
Now, that's what I'm saying.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.840
We need to increase, you know, demanding that they bring

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.080
these people to justice, the whole Bush administration

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:12.440
and all these surf minions and bootlickers.

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.720
Well, let me ask you a question.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.880
You certainly know that Bush is just a puppet, though, right?

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.680
Right.

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.480
We need to get his puppet mask.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.880
Well, I would agree that the Rothschilds and others

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.800
need to be exposed.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.120
We've got a person exposing them.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:24.760
They need to be exterminated like they

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.760
had a plan for everybody else.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.320
If it's good enough for everybody else,

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.880
it's probably good enough for them.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:32.440
Well, I'm not sure my audio's cutting out,

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.240
but I appreciate your call, Omar.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:36.840
Right.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:37.840
Your audio is cutting out.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.440
Wow.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:38.920
Sure.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:39.520
Wow.

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.480
His caller said that they need to exterminate their enemies.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.840
And the puppet masters of the globalist puppets like Bush.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.440
Jesus.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.360
And Alex pretends that he didn't hear him and goes to break.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.320
When he comes back from the break,

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.440
he makes a point to bring this back up.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.200
I talked to the folks running the show.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.840
I wanted to, because I wasn't sure.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:03.800
I heard what I heard from Curtis.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.880
Or no, it wasn't Curtis.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.080
Curtis is coming up.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.720
That was, I was talking to Omar last segment

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.880
from Michigan, and so I did hear what I thought I heard.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.360
My audio was low.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.760
Omar, let me explain something to you, OK?

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.680
I'm sure you're a nice person and mean well,

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.760
and I appreciate your hard work, and you

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.880
say you're waking folks up.

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.440
But look, I've tried to make this clear,

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.360
and this is what I truly believe and know,

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.040
and I know what I'm talking about.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.960
I work on this probably harder than anybody else.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.120
Fighting the new world order, defending my family,

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.800
standing against crime, standing against evil.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.600
Have you not learned what I've said here, what history shows?

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.800
The globalists carry out violent acts

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.480
against their own institutions as a way

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:54.440
to legitimize power and control and domination

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.160
and the destruction of liberty.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.040
Violence is not the way to go.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.960
I will say it over and over and over again.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.080
Now, I know that Alex says politically,

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:10.440
I want to kill you in the future or whatever.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.120
He'll give lip service to the idea of nonviolence.

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.080
This is an instance where he clearly

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.640
was caught off guard by this caller saying,

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.360
we need to exterminate these folks,

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.520
and then went to break and decided to come back,

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:27.880
re-bring it up to stress that violence is not the way to go.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.120
Dan, haven't you heard the old adage?

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.920
If you're not a liberal at 20, you have no heart.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.400
And if you don't want to exterminate the poor at 40,

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.240
you have no brain.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.480
Everybody knows this.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.960
There's a real sense that I get that Alex might be a little bit

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:51.320
more keenly aware of how dangerous some

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.800
of the people who are drawn to his world view may be.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.200
Possible.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.520
I don't know, though.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.960
It's foreign as hell.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.480
Maybe he just doesn't have the, I mean,

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.680
he's just more in a vulnerable position, you know?

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.000
He's still got bosses at this time.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.240
He doesn't have complete autocratic, yeah, well,

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.120
that's fair.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:15.160
But I mean, he still has to answer to someone.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.520
There is still someone above him.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.960
And now there is no one above him.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:24.280
Well, his dad is HR.

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:26.840
I don't know if his dad is still alive.

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.920
I think this is a psycho situation where his dad is

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.040
actually in his attic a skeleton.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.880
I just think it's very interesting that Alex is,

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.920
I mean, it's still, like, obviously this broadcast is

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.720
still incredibly irresponsible, but there

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.040
is a complete world of difference

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:49.920
between taking a step back to calmly and emphatically stress

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.600
that there's no violence.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.560
Violence is no good.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.720
It's not the answer.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:57.280
And Alex's long pornographic rants

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.800
about slitting people's throats and talking

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.440
about how all the globalists are already dead and all

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:03.880
this in the present day.

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.880
Yeah, I mean, if you want to, that's such a bullshit

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.240
argument, cancel culture.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.480
Look at how people act when there are possible consequences.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.760
Look at how people act whenever you just

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:21.320
know that consequences are available versus when you act

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.600
when there are absolutely none.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:24.400
To be done.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.440
There's something to be said for that.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.640
You know, it's there.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.440
It's there.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.360
You act better.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.560
So I think that this leads Alex into.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.920
Or at least psychos do.

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.400
Alex, for the rest of the episode,

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.880
he gets into a bit of a headspace

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.960
where he's saying things that, like, a lot of it

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.880
sounds pretty good.

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.760
I don't believe him.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.120
And obviously, because I know where his show goes.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:45.920
Sure, sure.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.720
Certainly don't.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.080
Living in the future is tough.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.080
Don't think that he means it, but.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:55.200
We have just got to continue to be bold, to be loving,

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.120
to stand against this evil.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.920
Hate is not going to power us.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.520
Hate is not going to get the job done.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:04.600
Now, certainly, you have a right to defend yourself

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.800
against criminals and against people that are assaulting you

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.640
and assaulting your family.

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:14.080
But offensively, offensively, it is

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.880
wrong to go after the illegitimate government

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.120
because they want that.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.960
That's the reason?

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.320
I guess?

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.120
It's really interesting for Alex to say

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.520
that hate can't power their movement or whatever.

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.560
Because, I mean, I would say that that's

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.360
one of the major problems with the right wing

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.840
as it exists today.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.680
Because hate fuels their worldview.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.840
And I think it did, too, for Alex in 2003.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.360
Totally.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:48.360
Maybe he wasn't even as aware of it.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.360
It's not as overt.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.240
Yeah.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.680
Or he just casts such a wide net,

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.080
he doesn't even know the difference

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.920
between hate and not hate.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.040
And so, you know, you got this head space

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.840
where you don't want to exterminate your enemies.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.720
No, that would be bad.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:06.600
Alex just wants them to back off.

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.160
Sure.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.160
Back off, globalists.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.040
Sure.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.680
We are not revolutionaries.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.840
We are restorationists.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.200
We want America, the republic, back.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.960
Back.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.400
We just want the globalists to stop what they're doing

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.200
and to back off.

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.080
And we know that when they see weakness, they attack.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.280
We know when they see ignorance, they move forward.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.640
And I want to advise the globalists right now,

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.440
I want to give you some really good advice.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.600
And you can check.

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.080
I've done 800 radio interviews since 9-1-1.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.920
800 now.

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.280
I've done my own syndicated show on AM and FM's

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.240
all over the country.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:43.800
That doesn't count as an interview.

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.080
I have a website that gets millions of hits a month.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.440
Definitely doesn't count as an interview.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.600
Let me tell you, for every 500 positive emails,

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.680
I get one negative.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.160
And the people are so incoherent,

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.480
they are probably going to be IQs or lower.

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.000
I have done 800 interviews.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.160
And one out of 30 callers disagrees with me.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.040
Folks, let me tell you something, globalists.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.040
You're in a lot of trouble.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.360
They're in so much trouble.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.760
Alex has good reviews.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:13.040
And people often don't find it worth their time

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.120
to argue with them, I guess.

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.720
But yeah, they just need to back off.

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.480
And hey, there's good news.

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:22.360
I've got some advice for Alex.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.920
Back off.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.160
Why would he?

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.520
They're winning or something.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.720
Sure.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.880
I would say that if the globalists, when they see

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.880
weakness, they attack.

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.560
And when they see dumbness, they move forward.

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.160
Sure.

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.640
The preceding eight years after this

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:42.760
indicate that Alex and all of his friends are dumb and weak.

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:43.720
Yes, correct.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.960
Because the globalists didn't stop anything

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:46.800
according to Alex.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.680
That is exactly what they proved.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.960
That's interesting.

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.680
In 2003, it turns out there's not many globalists.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.040
You know what's going on.

01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:59.760
And if you sit there and shake and coward and sit there,

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.440
you're delivering your children into a living hell,

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.520
a hell on Earth, Hades on Earth.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.320
And I'm here to tell you that it's a handful.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:13.360
A few thousand globalist managers,

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.440
a few dozen families that own this thing,

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.080
they're counting on you being ignorant.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.280
If you find out they're counting on you being afraid

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.200
and being cowardly, you have got to be men.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.960
You have got to be women.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.840
You have got to be strong.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.920
You have got to do whatever it takes

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.600
to stand up against this evil and to speak out

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.240
and to not be violent and to tell the truth

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.000
and let them burn us at the stake

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.440
if they want to in the arena, I'm ready.

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.600
I believe what Jesus Christ said.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.160
I believe in decency.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.880
I believe in wholesomeness.

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.960
Wholesomeness.

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:50.800
Wholesome.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.920
That's how I would describe his show in the present day.

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.760
Wholesome.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:54.600
Very wholesome.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.440
Wholesome.

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.680
Reminds me of the Buttercream Gang.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.240
That's what it reminds me of.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.080
Yeah.

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.640
That's who I think of when I think of Alex, Owen,

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:07.400
Harrison, whites are the best Smith.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.920
I think of the Buttercream Gang.

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.680
Yeah, this was just really weird.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.840
Cause it was, I mean, it's fill in time

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.560
and it's just a long rant more or less

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.040
just about how like we gotta be peaceful.

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:22.880
Yeah.

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.720
We can't be hateful.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.560
Sure.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.640
The globalists are in trouble cause we're so popular

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.600
and you have to be strong and we believe in wholesomeness.

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:31.640
It's all goodness.

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.480
Oh yeah.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.880
And it all seems to be in response

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.880
to that caller bringing up extermination

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.800
of the enemies.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.040
It does seem like it's genuine too.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:40.880
I wonder if-

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:42.080
I mean in a certain sense.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.120
I wonder if it's also in part because Alex

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.640
was probably pretty excited about getting these DJs on

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:47.640
and it didn't go well.

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:48.480
Sure.

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.800
I wonder if that plays into his mood a little bit.

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.520
Since we know that generally speaking

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.240
what comes out of his mouth is the result

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.080
of how he's feeling.

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:57.920
Yeah.

01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.360
As opposed to what's going on.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.920
And I think that maybe the fact that that didn't

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.720
wasn't something he could build on at all

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.640
and he's just gonna have to pretend

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:06.600
that interview never happened.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.400
Yeah, that's basically what he's doing, yes.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.240
Yeah.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.520
It's a mulligan or whatever.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.920
Yeah, I wonder.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:14.760
That'd be interesting.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.000
Anyway, one of the things that we discovered

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.640
through every period of time that we've looked through

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.040
at least the last few years.

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:23.880
Sure.

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.960
Going back into 2015.

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:25.800
Right.

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.680
Even prior to Trump's candidacy, Alex loves Putin.

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.520
True.

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.360
And Russia.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.440
Loves him.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.800
Big strong man, I think he saw him on that horse

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.640
without his shirt on.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.200
Well, he had a stretch where he was like,

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.280
it was bad that Putin kills journalists.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.520
Yeah, that was a little farther back.

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.160
That was a little bit farther back, yeah.

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.000
True, true, true.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.040
That was what, 2013?

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.280
Well, here's 2003.

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.120
Okay.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:52.240
Look folks, Putin got caught.

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.040
Moscow police arrested FSB, the new KGB,

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.160
planning bombs in a fourth Moscow apartment building.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.120
They took him to jail, they had him.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.640
Putin's police raided it, arrested the cops,

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.400
took the bombs, that's a fact.

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.240
You know, government has to blow up its own stuff

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.760
as an excuse to crack down on you.

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.080
Figure that out.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.680
In the present day, Alex does not believe this.

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.400
Oh no, absolutely not.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:20.600
He does not believe that Putin was behind the bombings

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.120
that were blamed on the Chechen rebels.

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:26.040
No longer an expedient truth to know about.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.960
Now, I think that there's something interesting about this,

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.640
and that is, when was the lie?

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:37.880
Was he lying about it being a fact in 2003?

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:38.720
Yeah.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:39.560
Or is he lying now?

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:40.400
Yeah.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.080
You gotta...

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.120
Or does he just not care?

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:44.960
I think he doesn't care.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.400
Yeah, I mean, I think to a certain extent,

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.080
like when you think about a lie,

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.400
you do think about somebody with malicious intent

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.640
or at the very least, like desire to hide information

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.920
or something like that.

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:02.080
And to me, what I'm seeing from all of this totality now

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.800
is just a man who just doesn't give a fuck

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:07.280
if it's true or not or whatever.

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.280
He's not lying, he just doesn't care.

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:13.640
You know, he's just beyond lying or not lying.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.440
He's just making up his own reality that he exists in

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.080
from a moment to moment point of view.

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.440
Yeah, and there's some things

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.360
that seem pretty consistently important.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.200
Yeah.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.280
Like him being left alone, Christian supremacy,

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.520
whiteness and guns. Totally, yeah.

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:31.680
And then he's figured out some sort of routines

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.000
that work pretty well, like the vaccine lies

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
and stuff that you just see him doing consistently.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.320
Yeah, anyway, Alex has another caller.

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:42.320
Oh, jeez.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:43.160
I just keep this in

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.640
because I think it makes Alex look like a dick.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.680
Yeah, I want you to take 50 copies of Road to Tyranny

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.520
and hand it out to everybody.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.640
I can't, I only have one VCR.

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.040
I can't copy it yet.

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.680
Need to buy another one, pay the 50 bucks,

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:57.160
buy the blank tapes and do it.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.680
I guess, yeah, I know, but I don't even have 50 bucks.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.520
I'm doing what I can.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.360
Well, go to your neighbor, get it,

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.880
whenever you have to.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:04.720
All right.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:05.560
What?

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.760
Wow, that is presaging his televangelism right there.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:10.600
Yeah.

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.040
He doesn't get more televangelist then.

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:14.560
Oh, sell your home, sell your home.

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:17.320
Give me, ask your kids for money to give it to me.

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.160
Go to your neighbor.

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.000
I need a private jet.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.920
Go to your neighbor to go get money to buy a second VCR

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.960
so you can make copies of my movies.

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.120
Which you will give to your neighbor.

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.280
Yeah.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:29.640
Wow.

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.480
Oh boy.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.800
Anyway, I thought that was asshole-ish.

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.040
That's real dick-ish.

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:37.360
Yeah, I can't imagine the level of narcissistic

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.520
you have to be to have multiple follow-ups

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.200
when someone's explaining why they can't copy your tapes.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.520
No, I mean, it's sales, you know?

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.680
That's that like, Bill, rich dad, poor dad,

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.280
like don't take no for an answer shit.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.160
And you're like, no, that's psychopathic, you nutbag.

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.720
Back when I worked in telemarketing,

01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:00.520
if your calls were monitored, like you would get in trouble

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.960
if you didn't have two rebuttals.

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:02.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.680
And that seems like what Alex is doing there,

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.200
but it's not sales, you're talking to a person.

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.520
Yeah, exactly.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.360
But I guess it is sales.

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.680
About bullshit.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.680
So we have one last clip here from May 9th.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.040
And again, it's Alex talking about his enemies.

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.360
There's no mention of the devil.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.200
Are you sure it's not the devil?

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.800
It's like Monday's Night Ritter headline,

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.360
Night Ritter newspapers.

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.960
Neocons call for New World Order.

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.200
Well, it's not the Neocons.

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.400
They're just the puppets of the day.

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.760
When they say Ashcroft wants Patriot Act Two,

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.080
no, the globalists want Patriot Act Two.

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:36.760
Don't be diverted by just these low level puppet nobodies.

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:40.480
Be focused on the real power, the New World Order bankers.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:41.320
God bless you all.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.160
Have a good weekend.

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.360
See you back at nine, nine to midnight.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.320
Yeah, so it's New World Order bankers.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.280
I mean,

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:51.640
I guess.

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:57.640
Multiple times in these two days,

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:01.240
he clearly expresses who he feels he's up against.

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:02.160
Yeah.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.200
And it's all terrestrial concerns.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.720
It's not an elaborate conspiracy of dimensions.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.560
It's not.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.400
No.

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:10.240
It's not metaphysical.

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.960
He didn't get any dreams when he was 10.

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:12.800
Nothing.

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.920
He wasn't a Satanist.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.760
No.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.600
Nope.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.960
And I mean like this doesn't prove

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:20.000
that he never talks about any of this stuff,

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.160
but like a lot of the themes that you would think

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:25.560
might have been important are not important.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.880
And if they normally come up now,

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.880
if he brings up something similar to these topics,

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:34.400
there's always that personal element of like,

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.560
you know, I was a Satanist.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.400
You know, like that.

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.240
None of that shit.

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.060
None of that.

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:38.900
None of it.

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:39.720
Brutal.

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:40.560
No talk about Epstein.

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:45.400
No talk about cabals of secret child trading,

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.240
blood drinking.

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.240
Not even any Bill Gates.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.320
Oh, he does mention Bill Gates at one point.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.160
Oh, does he?

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.000
Yeah.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.400
But Gates isn't in there with the Rothschilds

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.800
and the Bilderbergs at Citra.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.240
No, this is a side mention of Bill Gates,

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.360
but I mean, of course he's been relevant for a long time

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.840
and a philanthropist.

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.320
And a piece of shit.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.280
Alex hates that because it works counter

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.960
to his political positions of doing everything he can

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.960
to hurt the developing world.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.800
Right.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.800
Anyway, I enjoyed a little bit of this

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.000
in as much as, you know, the Dixie chick deejays.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:17.840
Yeah.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:18.720
We're interviewed.

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:20.440
What a bunch of dicks.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.660
But, and I think that it's certainly,

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.680
I don't even want to know what Alex is doing

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:27.280
in the present day, quite frankly.

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.120
Oh no.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.120
Good God, no.

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:34.120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.120
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:38.800
I'm conflicted about whether or not

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.040
there's a need to cover present day.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:41.880
Oh my God.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:42.700
We will see.

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:43.540
We'll see.

01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:44.380
Oh, sweet Jesus.

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:46.840
Anyway, whatever ends up happening, we'll be back.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.880
Yes, we will.

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:48.980
But until then, we have a website.

01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:49.820
We do have a website.

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:50.720
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.600
Yes, we're also on Twitter.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.800
We are on Twitter.

It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:55.760
Go to bed, Jordan.

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:56.580
We're also on Facebook.

01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:58.420
We are on Facebook.

01:45:58.420 --> 01:45:59.360
I too said if you could,

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.520
please find a local charity or bail fund in your area

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.160
to help out people doing God's work right now.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:04.000
Yep, we'll be back.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.440
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.260
I'm Leo.

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:08.100
I'm DZX Clark.

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.640
I'm Daryl Rundes.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.600
This podcast is secretly brought to you by Clear Channel

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.320
and an elaborate conspiracy to sell tickets

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.200
to Alex Jones's live cabaret review.

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.600
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.560
Thanks for holding.

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:24.100
Hello, Alex.

01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:24.940
I'm a first time caller.

01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:25.760
I'm a huge fan.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:26.600
I love your work.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:49.600
I love you.
