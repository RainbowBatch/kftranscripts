Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,200
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,560
Andy Enchanze, you're on the air thanks for holding.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,940
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,880
I love your world!

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I love you.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Jordan.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're a couple dudes who like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Jordan.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Dan!

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Jordan.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We are also masters of crushing a bit after several weeks of practicing.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But I don't like you drawing attention to it.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I know, but you did such a great job!

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, thanks.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It was a perfect line read.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't appreciate positive feedback.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Fair enough.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, what do you appreciate, Dan? Because my question is, what is your bright spot this week?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, my bright spot, Jordan, we talked about how we should probably inform the good people about this.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And my bright spot is, after four and a half years, I've decided to take a vacation.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, yep, yep. For the first time in a very long time.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I mean, it's debatable. I guess I've taken a few days off here and there.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Indeed.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Staycations, if you will.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sure, sure.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I went to visit my parents for a holiday.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Right.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Not quite a vacation.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Not quite.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We went to Austin to do a live show.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Sure, that's definitely not a vacation. That's a work trip.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We got to fucking write it off on our taxes, Dan. It was a work trip.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't really know how to relax. I'm not really good at that.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But finally, we've decided to take a vacation.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Indeed.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So you and I and your partner are actually going together next week.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Of course.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We will be going to Hawaii for a week.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ah, visiting your homeland.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Exactly.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A big part of this is I've been meaning to take a trip back to my childhood home.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Definitely.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In Honolulu and see some of the sights, like Aliyolani Elementary School and go down to Waikiki Beach.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You know, kick around the old haunts.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I didn't have any old haunts. I was a child.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But I have a lot of sort of vague memories and snapshots in my head that I'd like to experience as an adult.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I like to try and fill in some of those gaps.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And so I'm very excited to take this trip and hope I don't freak out from lack of working.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nah, it's going to be great. It's going to be great.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's going to be great.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sometimes you're going to stay in your hotel late at night by yourself staring up at the ceiling thinking,

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
what if I were working right now? Wouldn't that be better?

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't doubt that will be the case.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But also this is relevant because the next three episodes we're going to have to prepare in advance.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Of course.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Of taking off for vacation.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So hopefully the schedule of release won't be affected at all by it.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But you'll notice that they will be maybe, hey, let's say something happens in the world.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We may not be aware of it.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We may not know because we're in the past.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Trump might rise back to power.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And be a real bummer.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And we will not know.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know. I think if anything super crazy happens, we'll probably break into a recording studio somewhere and be like,

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
hey, we got to put out two hours now.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's an emergency.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What if we had gone on vacation on like January 4th?

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We'd have episodes coming out and we wouldn't be aware that the Capitol had been stormed.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Sure.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It'd be very strange. That's what I'm saying.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That would be strange.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We're going to have to pre-record a few.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And thank you in advance for that.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, indeed. Absolutely.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
How about you, Jordan? What's your bright spot?

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
My bright spot, Dan, is at my partner's school.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
As you know, my partner is a teacher at school to be unnamed.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But basically, their new principal started at the beginning of this year, or the school year.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So last year.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And she has proven herself to be a giant racist piece of shit.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Like really, really bad.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Good thing you're not naming this school.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, to the point where all of the BIPOC staff and students have essentially just gone on fucking revolt.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Wow.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This shit is unsustainable.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And so today, these kids organized a fucking sit-in and then later on a walkout.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And my partner sent me a little clip of it.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And the BIPOC students leading this shit are absolutely astonishing.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
At a certain point, all these kids are chanting, protect our teachers, protect our teachers.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I'm like weeping my balls off.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Like these kids are incredible.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Great.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Like truly incredible and that's my bright spot.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's very inspirational.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, absolutely.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, good on them.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So Jordan, today we have an interesting situation to get into.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Because as I mentioned, we're going to be pre-recording some episodes.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And that's going to make it more difficult to be in the present day keeping up with Alex.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Of course, of course.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So it had been my plan to stay in the past, in 2003 probably, for those episodes.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sure.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And so I didn't want to do a 2003 episode here today.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Right.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And so I was like, all right, present day, let's see what Alex is going into.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's do this.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Look, Alex has been on vacation.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why don't we coordinate?

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He needs to let us know.

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We always have in the past.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He needs to let us know.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Every time we're gone, he's gone.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is infuriating.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't accept this whatsoever.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Owen Schroyer's been hosting all this week.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And I, look, I understand that the situation with Israel-Palestine is a big deal.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I do understand that.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't care what Owen Schroyer has to say about it.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, absolutely not.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm interested in the Infowars position and exactly how this is a false flag and what have you.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But I'm only going to take it from Alex.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not going to listen to an hour and a half Owen Schroyer to get a sense of it.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I really don't need to hear Owen say what amounts to none of this is real.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's all Palestine actually attacking themselves.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And even if Israel was committing genocide, I support that.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's what they would say.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's what he said.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not interested in hearing any of that nonsense from Owen.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But there is an update I need to give you about the present day.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There is a certain psy-op expert that's been subtly sneaking his way back onto the show.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Get the fuck out of here!

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They cannot quit him!

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Alex has been out of town and he's been showing up with Owen.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, so Steve Pachetic is creeping back and he's just flattering the shit out of Owen.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I watched their interview and he's like, oh, you're the best.

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Of course.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
God damn it.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
These idiots can be tricked in the same way all the time.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I also noticed that when I was watching this interview, I noticed that Steve was reading a lot.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's clearly looking down at something.

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So when he's rattling off a lot of these details and stuff, a lot of it is probably prepared.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I mean, I feel like somehow we're thinking of this as a negative thing.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But being a guest and being by far more prepared than anything that your host has ever done seems like a positive to me.

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't disagree and I support preparation.

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I just think that the way that Steve uses specifics and things like that is to create the impression of familiarity.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sure.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He creates the impression of familiarity with the staff of various administrations and stuff like that in a way that it would be kind of not as impressive that he knows people's names if it's on a sheet of paper in front of him.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
True.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So that kind of preparation kind of cuts through what he's trying to use his appearance and the way he's trying to present himself.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And rattling off details gives him the appearance of having a recall that is astonishing.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
How can one man possibly pull all of these things off his ass?

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How can he be making up all of this?

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Exactly.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I don't know.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There was an interesting thing too that for years Steve wouldn't appear on video.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He would only be on the phone and there would be a picture of him from when he was much younger.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sure.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
With a weird mustache.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, he should go back to that.

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, but I wonder if that was because back in those times he had a bunch of files in front of him and he didn't want to be on video.

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's possible.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I wonder about that and I never really thought about that because I never really watched too closely.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But his eyes were definitely reading.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I would also accept it wasn't until the pandemic that he insisted that some child in his neighborhood go set up Zoom for him so he can accurately...

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I know that his wife is on tech detail.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, okay.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you do go to his YouTube channel you can see her pressing the start and stop buttons sometimes.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That is very pretty and cute.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It is.

190
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Unfortunately.

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's unfortunately humanizing of a real weirdo.

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, it's infuriating.

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But it's very cute.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I guess what that leaves us with is possibly, I mean, I don't know.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know if Alex will be back in time for us to record anything in the present day before our trip.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Right.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So we may be getting back to Alex in the present day when we get back.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But it also put me in a bind of not really knowing exactly where to go for this episode.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Luckily, I found something and we'll get to it after we say hello to some wonks.

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Nice.

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Nicely done.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So first, Sheila B, the Garden Queen.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you so much.

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You are now a policy wonk.

207
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm a policy wonk.

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thanks, Sheila.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Thank you.

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Next, Kimmy from Seattle.

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is a shout out and a wonk title going to you.

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I appreciate you getting round the world into the show.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm a policy wonk.

214
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you.

215
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you, Kimmy.

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Next, Uncle Patches, CPA.

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Thank you so much.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You are now a policy wonk.

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm a policy wonk.

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm a policy wonk.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thanks, Uncle Patches.

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Next, Branigan.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you so much.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You are now a policy wonk.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm a policy wonk.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,380
Thank you very much.

228
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,200
Next, Down With the Tyrant King Jared.

229
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Thank you so much.

230
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
You are now a policy wonk.

231
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm a policy wonk.

232
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,260
Thank you very much.

233
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Thank you.

234
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Next, Sasha.

235
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Thank you so much.

236
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
You are now a policy wonk.

237
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
I'm a policy wonk.

238
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Thanks, Sasha.

239
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
Thank you.

240
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,500
Next, near free advertising for God's eternal wrath.

241
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Thank you so much.

242
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
You are now a policy wonk.

243
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,580
I'm a policy wonk.

244
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,340
Thank you very much.

245
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,520
Et cetera.

246
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,920
Now, Jordan.

247
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,160
We had to do a little bit of business here and that is, you know, sometimes you gotta

248
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
take it on the chin.

249
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Sure, sure.

250
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,680
Sometimes, you know, you just gotta take that punch as it comes.

251
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Naturally.

252
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,040
You realize that you have messed up.

253
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,220
Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

254
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,480
What is a plan but God laughing at you?

255
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
That's true.

256
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Or something?

257
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
How does that work?

258
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
God laughs at man that makes plans?

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,100
No, man plans while God laughs.

260
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
That's what it is.

261
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Yeah.

262
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
You got it.

263
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
So anyway.

264
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,120
What a shitty God who's gonna laugh at anybody for planning.

265
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,280
No, but it's like that, hahaha, oh, I love this guy so much.

266
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,520
Isn't it cute that he's planning?

267
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,920
Yeah, maybe give him a better plan.

268
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
It's paternal.

269
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,440
Don't laugh at him.

270
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,200
That's laughing at a homeless person.

271
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,600
God is laughing at a houseless person and it's fucking offensive.

272
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Let's do it.

273
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm offended by God.

274
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Let's take God's house.

275
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,040
I think we should.

276
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,760
Anyway, my point is that we have a couple of April birthdays.

277
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,400
I might have missed a couple of April birthdays.

278
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,920
Don't worry about it.

279
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,520
So uh, Katie, happy birthday back in April.

280
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Happy birthday.

281
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,320
This is from your husband, Nodbard, he wants to wish you a happy birthday, I hope you had

282
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
a great birthday.

283
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I do too.

284
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,260
Also I fucked up on this one, Tanya, happy birthday back in April.

285
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,520
Happy birthday Tanya.

286
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,560
That's totally on me, I need to do a better job of managing inboxes.

287
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
Nah, you're doing great.

288
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,240
Now, not all is trouble because we also have a presentation.

289
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,840
Hey, see, there we go.

290
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,720
This is coming from Savannah.

291
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Savannah wanted me to give a shout out to their spouse Shoshana and wish Shoshana a

292
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
happy birthday.

293
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
So happy birthday.

294
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Happy birthday Shoshana.

295
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,880
Hope you're having a great one out there.

296
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Perfect.

297
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,160
Now Jordan, we couldn't do the past.

298
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
We couldn't do the present.

299
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
No.

300
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,400
We can do the middle past?

301
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,840
I felt like that might be too confusing.

302
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,120
We had to do a bottle episode.

303
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,160
We gotta do a bottle episode.

304
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,440
Jim Baker still bums me out, I can't quite go back to that well.

305
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,800
Project Camelot, I think she got kicked off YouTube and now is back to a membership model

306
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,320
and so I don't know about the ethics of using-

307
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Once again.

308
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,960
Yeah, I'm back to being on shaky ground.

309
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,480
Sure, sure.

310
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
And so that leaves us in a bit of a pickle.

311
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,740
We need a bottle episode.

312
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Gotta do something.

313
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,960
I was like, is there anything that I've been meaning to do-

314
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,480
Review that bottle episode of Breaking Bad that everybody loves so much about the fly?

315
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah.

316
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
No.

317
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I have some thoughts.

318
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay.

319
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
But no, that's not what we're doing here today.

320
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,040
There is something that listeners have constantly been like, did you ever do that?

321
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
And we hadn't.

322
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Oh.

323
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Welcome back my friends.

324
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
The second hour of the broadcast.

325
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,440
We're going to be joined by Noam Chomsky coming up here in just a couple minutes.

326
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Yeah, that's right.

327
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,800
The Noam Chomsky interview.

328
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
That's right.

329
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
What are we doing?

330
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Yes.

331
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I feel so weird about this.

332
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,040
In 2001, pre-9-11, Noam Chomsky appeared on InfoWars.

333
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Sure.

334
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,460
The Alex Jones program.

335
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
Noam Chomsky.

336
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,220
The linguist.

337
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,360
Not the very short, shows up in your house in the middle of the night, makes you cookies?

338
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Noam with a G.

339
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes.

340
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
No.

341
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
No.

342
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
That is not-

343
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Okay.

344
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
It is not Gnome Chomsky.

345
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
All right.

346
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
The noted intellectual.

347
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Okay.

348
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,520
This actually is one of the more interesting interviews that I've ever heard on InfoWars.

349
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
For a couple reasons.

350
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,440
One, this is pre-9-11 Alex Jones.

351
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Sure.

352
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,720
He doesn't have the cache of predicting 9-11 yet.

353
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,220
I also think that he doesn't have nearly as much of the market share.

354
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,520
He doesn't have as much notoriety.

355
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,080
I don't think that people who might be invited to be on his show know much about him.

356
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
True.

357
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,360
So, you have that.

358
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,840
I take it Gnome does not know that Alex is fighting the literal devil.

359
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,320
I don't know if Alex knows that.

360
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
We haven't established that.

361
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,400
At what point he became aware that he was up against fields above.

362
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,220
I think earliest days in his career, a lot of it was based around making big publicity

363
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,960
stunts about trying to get the church, the Branch Davidians rebuilt.

364
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Sure.

365
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,400
He had some notoriety on a regional basis from that, but if you look at the early parts

366
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:16,560
of his career where he really hit the noss, as it were, in the fast and furious terms,

367
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,620
that's got to be all around 9-11 conspiracies.

368
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,680
This is before that.

369
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,280
Also, another thing that's really weird is that they agree about a lot of stuff.

370
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Of course.

371
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,200
Now, do they actually?

372
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,120
No, of course they do.

373
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,760
Alex and Gnome, best buds.

374
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:44,220
They agree about a lot of the surface level of things, but when you get down to what their

375
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,500
beliefs are based on, there's a little bit of difference, and this interview could have

376
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,940
been amazing, and it could have been great, and it is not.

377
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,880
It ends very poorly.

378
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Oh, no.

379
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,400
Does it end in a fight?

380
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
I'll let you decide.

381
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Okay.

382
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
All right.

383
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:14,080
So, Alex reads a little bit of a bio, and he's a professor of linguists, linguistics.

384
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,720
And he's written books like Manufacturing, Consent, and Excellent Video, also titled

385
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,680
Manufacturing Consent, and it goes into how they stage things, how they will have a supposed

386
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,880
debate on television, but the people debating are actually on the same side.

387
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,960
They're just debating the exact implementation by just a few degrees, giving you the psychological

388
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,120
illusion there's really some type of difference, so that in your mind, you're going to fall

389
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,360
in supposedly either phony camp being steered in the direction they wish.

390
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,040
Now, that's how I put it.

391
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,640
Chomsky does it in a little bit more sophisticated fashion.

392
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,520
But they do this all the time.

393
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,560
Manufacturing Consent is about the media, but it's not necessarily about staging events

394
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,160
or false flags or that kind of stuff, the way Alex is kind of leading it and presenting

395
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
that.

396
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,560
The general thesis of Chomsky's book, largely co-written by Edward Herman, is that the media

398
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,200
engages in self-censoring of ideas that are opposed to the interests of the elite corporations

399
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,760
in such a way that encourages acceptance of the policies being put in place by the government,

400
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,400
which support those interests, often to the detriment of what's in the interest of normal

401
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
people.

402
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
It's more complicated than even what I'm presenting, but that's a large part of what Chomsky and

403
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,560
Herman called the propaganda model.

404
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,600
It doesn't rely on coercion to operate, rather it's a product of just market forces.

405
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,860
There's a structural conflict of interest in how the media is organized that creates

406
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,300
a disconnect between conveying all of the information that's relevant to the interests

407
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,060
of the upper upper classes and those of everyone else.

408
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,200
This is the general 30,000 foot view of the manufacturing concept.

409
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,340
Yeah, if the media were capable of reporting correctly they would be reporting every single

410
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,760
day that we should do everything we can to destroy their billionaire owners, otherwise

411
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
their entire journalism is pointless.

412
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Interesting.

413
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Yeah.

414
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,640
I don't think I would be qualified to give a full breakdown of the ideas in that text,

415
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,440
but I can tell you that I'm also certain that Alex has not read it.

416
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,400
The propaganda model includes five filters, which are theorized as being determinative

417
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
about whether certain news is represented in the larger media.

418
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,840
The first four are ownership, funding, sources, and flak.

419
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,760
Alex could probably find agreement on those four, but he absolutely could not accept the

420
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
fifth, which is anti-communism.

421
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Oh!

422
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Boom!

423
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,840
We got a strikeout!

424
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Somehow it's a one-pitch strikeout!

425
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,040
Oh, difficult!

426
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,160
Anti-communism was the preferred media fear outlet in the time that the book was first

427
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
published.

428
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,000
During the Cold War the mass- Never went out of style, buddy.

429
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
Never went out of style!

430
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,240
During the Cold War the mass media wasn't going to give a serious chance to an outlet

431
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,720
that went at odds with the prevailing narrative, which was to be afraid of the commies.

432
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,000
In more recent times Chomsky has recontextualized this filter to update it to the times, where

433
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,400
the war on terror is more relevant as a media filter after 9-11 than anti-communism.

434
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Yeah, of course.

435
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,280
Alex could probably agree that large portions of the media have the same opinion on big

436
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,240
issues like the war on terror, and that possibly it was meant to scare people into accepting

437
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,520
policies they wouldn't maybe otherwise, but he absolutely could never accept that anti-communist

438
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,320
fervor during the Cold War was in any way part of that.

439
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Yeah, totally.

440
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
His entire personality and worldview is based on that.

441
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,040
Everything that is built is crumbled if you accept that.

442
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,600
Yeah, so I think that's kind of interesting, because I think what happens is that Alex

443
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,200
has a predetermined set of beliefs, and he's just decided that Chomsky backs those up.

444
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, or at least enough of them that he can make it look like he supports all of them.

445
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes.

446
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah.

447
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes.

448
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,040
So Alex talks, before getting into the actual interview, more about his, this is 2001, so

449
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,960
this is where he's at in terms of the similarities between the left and the right.

450
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
They're the same.

451
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Sure.

452
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Democrat, Republican.

453
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Sure, sure, sure.

454
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,120
And I would argue that this is an indication to me that it's always been very surface level.

455
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,000
It's like Republican, Democrat, Liberal, Conservative.

456
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,160
Liberals, Conservatives, you look at what they do at the top, they're all the same people.

457
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,920
The political left has secret police that wear black uniforms and ski masks.

458
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,320
The political right has police that wear black uniforms and ski masks around the world.

459
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
They just have the police.

460
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,960
Centralized government, and they tell you to be in the middle of that system.

461
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
More semantical deceptions.

462
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,960
I think what's strange here is that, like, I could hear somebody saying, like, the left

463
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,320
and the right's the same, they all wear black ski masks.

464
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Sure.

465
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
And it being a metaphor.

466
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Yeah.

467
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,600
And from Alex, I don't think it is.

468
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
No, it's absolutely direct.

469
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I think it's literal.

470
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,440
If he does not believe that they actually have secret police, then I don't know what

471
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,240
anything is real anymore.

472
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,240
I don't know what's true or what's false.

473
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,560
That man believes everyone has secret police and ski masks.

474
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,520
He believes that, like, uh...

475
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,120
That's my foundational belief system.

476
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,960
He believes that small corporations even have SWAT teams and stuff at this point.

477
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Yeah, absolutely.

478
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
It's very strange.

479
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,600
I don't even want to know what army he thinks AT&T has.

480
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Huge.

481
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Yeah.

482
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,520
So, yeah, I just...

483
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,800
I come away from clips like that with a feeling that, like, I don't know how in-depth any

484
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,440
of this assessment of, like, the similarities between left and right are.

485
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Sure.

486
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,160
Because I do think you can make a decent argument that there are similarities.

487
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,840
Obviously, there are entwined interests.

488
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,200
There are similar priorities in some ways, but there are also huge fucking differences.

489
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Maybe.

490
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,440
And I don't understand how Alex never really gives voice to those differences.

491
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Because the...

492
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Or ignores them.

493
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,920
Because the differences make it look like the people that he actually supports are bad.

494
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,520
Oh, yeah, that's right.

495
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,440
It is hard to be like, well, okay, there's one difference between Democrats and Republicans.

496
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,000
Democrats do want people to eat food.

497
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,520
I was kind of maybe being facetious when I said I don't know why.

498
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,160
I realized that I didn't even know that I was being facetious.

499
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,400
I was like, oh, I kind of get it.

500
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,480
Anyway, here comes Chomsky into the debate.

501
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,920
It's not a debate.

502
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
Just a conversation.

503
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,240
And they do have some agreement.

504
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,960
And this is a little bit longer clip, but that's because Chomsky speaks in full sentences.

505
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Ooh, no.

506
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Dangerous.

507
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Dangerous.

508
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,680
Alex lets him speak in full sentences?

509
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Oh, yeah.

510
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
So this is a...

511
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,240
This is where he learned his lesson right here.

512
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,560
Two and a half minute clip here.

513
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Okay.

514
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,920
I would call it almost a matrix-like system where 98% of people don't even know the real

515
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,800
parameters of power that surround them.

516
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,320
Phony paradigms and systems of phony left, right, with all the roads leading towards

517
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,680
a centralized, highly controlled corporate bureaucracy.

518
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
I agree with that.

519
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,560
But I think the only thing I would add as a kind of a footnote is that the marginalization

520
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,640
of the public that you're describing is quite purposeful and conscious, self-conscious.

521
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,600
So especially through the 20th, actually it goes back to the founding of the country,

522
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,480
but it's particularly in the 20th century, there has been a very self-conscious explicit

523
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
effort.

524
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I mean, you don't have to make it, nothing speculative, because the leaders say so.

525
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,960
Business leaders, intellectuals, academic social scientists and others say that it is

526
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,600
important to keep the public out of things.

527
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,880
It's important to ensure that the public remain what are called spectators, not participants.

528
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:54,720
They're supposed to be directed to other concerns and not interfere with policy formation.

529
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,720
That is a major phenomenon developed in the more democratic countries, in the United States

530
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,880
and England particularly, through the 20th century.

531
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
And the reason was very clear.

532
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,440
By the early 20th century, it was becoming very difficult to control people by other

533
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
means.

534
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,040
The voting franchise was extending, labor unions were developing, women were demanding

535
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
the vote.

536
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,720
I mean, the countries, especially England and the United States, were simply becoming

537
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,400
more democratic.

538
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,360
And it was recognized early on that if you can't control people by worse or, you know,

539
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,240
poverty or some other means, you are going to have to control them by what was quite

540
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,600
openly called propaganda at the time.

541
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,960
People don't like the term propaganda anymore, but that was used.

542
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,760
That's where the US public relations is.

543
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,440
It grows out of these experiences and this understanding and it is very explicit.

544
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,560
Professor Chomsky, they developed, put out their papers that I've read from the Carnegie

545
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,760
Endowment and others that mind control, behavioral modification is much cheaper and much more

546
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,080
effective than tanks and guns.

547
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,400
And it's the only thing you can do because in the more democratic countries, you can't

548
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
control people with tanks and guns.

549
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,200
I mean, maybe to some limited extent, but not very much.

550
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,600
There's too much freedom.

551
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,400
The one thing that I think is really key here is to notice where there is a salient agreement

552
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,520
between the two and also the way that those two things are fully differently understood

553
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
by the two parties.

554
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Oh, absolutely.

555
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
They are not talking about the same thing whatsoever.

556
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
No.

557
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
No.

558
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,240
I think that there is, you know, what Chomsky is bringing to the table is ideas about wanting

559
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,200
to keep people disengaged from some public discourse and some decisions that could be

560
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,400
detrimental to elite corporations' interests and in so much as that is in their interest,

561
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,680
then, you know, not having all information fully disseminated works to those goals.

562
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Right.

563
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,880
Bannon didn't invent muddying the waters, you know, like propaganda, especially the

564
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,560
United States propaganda has been rocking that boat for a long time.

565
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Sure.

566
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,320
What is early roots of advertising other than that?

567
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,440
Yeah, absolutely.

568
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,000
What is social media influencers in our day?

569
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,400
What are any kind of publicist?

570
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,240
You know, like a lot of that stuff is just perception management.

571
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,400
Your job is propaganda.

572
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Yeah.

573
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Yeah.

574
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,520
And I think that there is a real conversation that can be had and I think that, you know,

575
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,800
I obviously wouldn't necessarily take this tack, but someone could say that if literally

576
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,800
everybody was engaged in decision-making about every issue, it would be impossible for a

577
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,120
society to function.

578
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Sure.

579
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,440
And maybe to a limit, there is an argument that could be made for, you know, people being

580
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,600
disengaged is more productive, is actually a better organizational model.

581
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Sure.

582
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,760
I'm not advocating that, but I could see someone making that point and I could see Chomsky

583
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,800
having an interesting conversation with them.

584
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Right.

585
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,600
Alex, on the other hand, his beliefs veer so much into the vaccines are meant to make

586
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
us dumb.

587
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,880
They poison us in our food and all this, that even this point of agreement is a point of

588
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,800
departure for the two of them.

589
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Yeah.

590
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,880
And I find that very weird to look at.

591
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Yeah.

592
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:39,080
And it does sound like Noam Chomsky is describing the phenomena of the government destroying

593
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,260
the ability of the electorate to honestly engage with their actions.

594
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:49,460
And Alex responded, so obviously you're talking about mind control.

595
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,680
And I think that it, you know, I don't have a good enough glimpse of Alex at 2001, although

596
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:01,040
based on, you know, the present day, I would guess that he means like someone putting a

597
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
pendulum.

598
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
No, he means mind control.

599
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,600
He means legitimate mind control.

600
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,480
You look into my spinning thing.

601
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Yeah, I think so.

602
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,200
But I think that the way, you know, someone like his guest would interact with that is

603
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,560
taking that as metaphor.

604
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Yeah.

605
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Yeah.

606
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,300
If Alex was like, hey, so you're in agreement with me, they're putting computer chips inside

607
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,560
everybody's brain to make them do what they tell them to and Noam would have gone, that

608
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,680
is not what I'm saying at all.

609
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,060
But I don't know if that's what Alex is saying back at this point.

610
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,080
That's one of the parts that is kind of challenging about this is you can hear that from Alex

611
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,860
even as metaphor, as flourish of speaking, as opposed to it being like, I have you under

612
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,840
my control, lift your right arm.

613
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Right.

614
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:55,720
And that, that does kind of point out one big issue though, is that all too often we

615
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,320
just assume people are capable of metaphor.

616
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,600
Well, it's interesting that he's talking to a linguist.

617
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah.

618
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,360
This is borderline the Turing test.

619
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,400
That's what's going on.

620
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:16,400
It's borderline Alex trying to fool a computer into thinking he's human.

621
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:24,080
Chomsky is shockingly charitable with Alex and I think it's to his credit in hindsight.

622
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
He's a good interviewee.

623
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,160
So Alex talks about how Bush and Clinton, this is going to have to be, yeah, I guess

624
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,640
it would be George W. Bush because he just got elected at this point.

625
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,600
And Clinton had just been given the boot.

626
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Yeah.

627
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:46,840
So Alex talks about how they're the same based on a very specific set of axes.

628
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,680
Well take Bush and Clinton, they have the exact same policies on land grabbing, selling

629
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:59,260
out sovereignty, deindustrialization, drugging the children, but you asked the average person,

630
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,880
they have this, this, this cult-like following of their parties and can't admit it's really

631
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,600
the same, what I call the same, it's really two corporate management teams bidding for

632
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,680
control of the CEO job of the new world order.

633
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,360
Well, I, maybe I'm naive, but I have more faith in the public than that.

634
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,360
My feeling is that the general public is rather well aware of this and I think it shows up

635
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:27,880
in the, there are, you know, there's a lot of public opinion study in the United States,

636
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,360
mainly because business wants to keep its finger on the public pulse.

637
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,440
They want to know what people are thinking.

638
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,200
So we have a pretty trustworthy and very extensive polling industry.

639
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,840
And what comes out of public attitudes, I think is kind of revealing though for the

640
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,960
last 20 years or so, about 80% of the population, when they're asked, what do you think the

641
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,000
country, you know, who runs the government or what does it do?

642
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,880
The answer that they pick out of a set of choices is the government works for the few

643
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,640
and the special interests, not the people.

644
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,000
So Chomsky is coming at this with the perspective of like, all right, a lot of people are aware

645
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
of this.

646
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah.

647
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,240
There's a different problem that needs to be addressed.

648
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,160
And that'll come up a little bit later in the interview.

649
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Right.

650
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,520
But Alex, his selected criteria upon which Clinton and Bush are the same is weird to

651
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,840
me.

652
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,360
It's very suspiciously specific.

653
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,800
And unfairly articulated.

654
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,600
No, no, no, no, no.

655
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
They're both land grabbers.

656
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,040
They both eat children and then they move on and the, wait, what, hold on.

657
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,760
Did you say land grabbing, I assume is code for conservation.

658
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,320
Either that or eminent domain.

659
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Yeah, that could be at this point too.

660
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,080
At that point, I bet eminent domain was huge on Alex's mind.

661
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,680
Yeah, that could be.

662
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
That could be.

663
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:01,080
And also, I don't know if Bush's early record with EPA stuff was necessarily all that good.

664
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
Oh, not good.

665
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Not good.

666
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,440
Drugging the children is the one that's like, okay, you're just talking about like, psychiatric

667
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
meds or something?

668
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
Yeah, absolutely.

669
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,600
You're talking about Ritalin?

670
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,000
I heard him talking about Ritalin because that was a huge-

671
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,920
But it's not like Bush is putting people on Ritalin.

672
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,320
No, Bush was cramming Ritalin down everybody's throats.

673
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,680
You forgot the No Child Left Behind was, the parentheses was with Ritalin.

674
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,320
I mean, obviously, I think that there's overprescription of meds.

675
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,240
We've talked about that in the past.

676
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Sure.

677
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,960
I just don't know exactly what he expects Clinton or Bush to do about it.

678
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,680
Does he want to make it illegal to take the, like, I thought he's for drug legalization.

679
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,080
Does he want more regulation on pharmaceutical industries?

680
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,760
I think he wants you to go the exact opposite direction.

681
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,320
If you're going to get your ADHD meds, you should go to the corner like everybody else

682
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,560
does with their drugs.

683
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,520
I think that's what he's trying to say.

684
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,440
If it's not on the corner, it's not drugs, buddy.

685
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,960
Every other night I go down, I get a fifth of whiskey on the corner.

686
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Absolutely.

687
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
I know a guy, he's got a well-stocked coat.

688
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,880
Where else do you think I get my Lamictal, Dan?

689
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,240
I go down the street, guy opens his trench coat.

690
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Yeah.

691
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
It's bizarre.

692
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,080
And again, I think that really illustrates the sort of surface level and cherry-picked

693
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,680
way in which Alex describes the similarity between the two.

694
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Absolutely.

696
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:39,120
And I think I largely agree with Chomsky's analysis that this isn't, like, groundbreaking

697
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
stuff.

698
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Yeah.

699
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,480
The idea that people have an alienation from power.

700
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
Sure, sure.

701
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Absolutely.

702
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,080
A random person on the street, you think it's the government or our corporate overlords?

703
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,080
And they'll be like, ah, I'm going to go with corporate overlords.

704
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,960
Not surprising to anyone.

705
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,400
So there's a shift in propaganda that Alex has been feeling over the last few years.

706
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,560
And this is weird to hear in 2001, because he says this in much later years, too, that

707
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,960
there's been a shift recently in the last few years.

708
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,520
And that has been from keeping things secret about the globalists to throwing it in your

709
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
face.

710
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Ooh.

711
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,040
And Chomsky has brought up the idea of hopelessness, and that hopelessness is a response that people

712
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,240
can have to the idea that the government isn't necessarily serving their interests.

713
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Sure.

714
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,960
And that is a larger problem than actually some of the other things that Alex might bring

715
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
up.

716
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Helplessness leads to hopelessness.

717
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Not hard.

718
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Sure.

719
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,760
And Alex is suggesting that this shift in propaganda from hiding the globalists to throwing

720
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,080
it in your face is a way of facilitating this hopelessness.

721
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
There we go.

722
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,000
And Chomsky does not go in for that.

723
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,080
I've seen a shift in the propaganda in the last three years from denying all of this

724
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,800
to throwing it in our face.

725
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,320
Could be, but I think my own feeling is the roots go back farther.

726
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,880
If you go back again to the better, you know, the early part of the 20s, like 1920s approximately,

727
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,040
that's when this really takes off.

728
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Madison Avenue?

729
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,800
Yeah, that's when the public relations industry really exploded.

730
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,200
And it grew on the basis of the very sensible assumption that was pretty clearly articulated

731
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,600
that we have to somehow make sure that the general public does not make use of the democratic

732
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,000
opportunities that are available to them and leaves us to run the place as we've been doing.

733
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,160
And the way to do it was you read a business leaders are saying, look, we have to induce

734
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,240
what's called a philosophy of futility, actually use the phrase.

735
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:58,600
We have to kind of direct people to superficial things like fashionable consumption.

736
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
We have to regiment.

737
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,800
Yeah, it's something, anything that doesn't bother us.

738
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Bread and circus.

739
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Yeah.

740
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
It's just anything like that.

741
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
I mean, that's true of leading intellectuals.

742
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,360
I mean, takes a Walter Lippmann, who is the leading figure in the U.S. elite media in

743
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,920
the 20th century, major public intellectual, he's the one who invented the phrase manufacturer

744
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
of consent.

745
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,280
We borrowed it from him and he thought it was necessary.

746
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,400
It's necessary to manufacture consent in order to make sure that we, what he called the responsible

747
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,200
men can run the affairs of the world without being bothered.

748
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,120
And what he didn't say, but what is crucial is your point.

749
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:43,200
The people, you become a responsible man if you're serving the interests of concentrated

750
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,560
private power, otherwise you're not.

751
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:53,840
So when Chomsky is talking about a position and an idea, he's able to bring up the people

752
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,200
who are the proponents of the opposite of his idea there.

753
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,480
He's able to engage with this in a much more thorough way, even in a matter of a minute

754
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,880
than Alex is ever able to deal with any issue.

755
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah, it's very strange to hear somebody talk on this show and then be like, wow, really

756
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
smart.

757
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Really smart stuff.

758
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's a full thought.

759
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Good work, man.

760
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Good work.

761
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah.

762
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,380
Somebody should make you famous.

763
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,680
I don't even know what to respond with.

764
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,600
It's just like, there's an interesting conversation that you could have with Chomsky about these

765
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
issues.

766
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,520
Yeah, I would like to talk to Noam Chomsky.

767
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:45,200
I feel like that's what I'm learning from all of this is that somehow Alex fucking Jones

768
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,680
gets to talk to Noam Chomsky and he doesn't get to listen to me shit-talk him while he's

769
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,480
explaining the world to me.

770
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,800
Well, and that is, life is unfair sometimes.

771
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
It is unfair.

772
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
It is.

773
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,640
Yeah, this is one of the things that makes this kind of difficult to really even engage

774
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:12,480
with too deeply as content from my end is that, yeah, I think I can see what Chomsky

775
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
is saying.

776
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,960
He's articulating positions clearly.

777
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,640
I think rebutting things would, you know, there's some stuff that I maybe don't entirely

778
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:28,640
agree with, but you know, it would be a matter of teasing out points to really get to the

779
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:39,920
bottom of like, okay, well, you know, yes, there is an interest in media, in having people

780
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,880
consumed with superficial things.

781
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Sure, of course.

782
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,400
How much of that is intentional strategy driven by people who want people to be distracted

783
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,960
from larger issues, and how much of that is actively, that is what people want, and there

784
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,360
is a market for that, and you know, people are filling that market.

785
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,240
What is the balance between the two?

786
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,680
Yeah, I mean, it would be hard to argue that the best example of that very thing would

787
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,280
be Trump's tweets.

788
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,640
Like by constantly covering Trump's tweets, they almost ensured he would at least have

789
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,360
a run, have a shot at becoming president.

790
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:29,160
At the same time, if the public weren't so consumed and so interested with discovering

791
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,520
more and more about his dumb fuck tweets, then they wouldn't be covering it, you know?

792
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:43,440
Yeah, and to this question, particularly about what he's bringing up about the media and

793
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,460
what Alex Yell's bread and circuses with, is there is a supply component and there's

794
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:55,960
a demand component, and to ignore either I think is not the full picture, and I don't

795
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,580
think that Chomsky's ignoring the demand picture, it's just not part of this conversation, and

796
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:09,200
that would be the kind of way I would approach this, and I just, he makes points, and here

797
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
are the points.

798
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,240
See now, the problem Alex is, is he had a perfect opportunity to cut into Noam Chomsky

799
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,280
and be like, actually, I think it goes further back than that to Rome with bread and circuses,

800
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Mr. Chomsky!

801
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,440
You're not smart enough to figure out the echo on your phone, now are you?

802
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,720
Or hey, Noam, could I tell you about Adam Weisshop and the Bavarian Illuminati?

803
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:45,240
I'd like to tell you some fucked up ideas I have about the Illuminati, I don't know.

804
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:53,640
Anyway, I think that Noam Chomsky is able to make points, and so it's a foreign concept

805
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
on InfoWars.

806
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Sure, no, it's confusing.

807
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:02,280
But he brings up the difference of opinion between the sort of elite corporations and

808
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,560
the normal person who has a job, perhaps, in terms of free trade agreements.

809
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,360
One of the major issues for the public, look at Bowles and it's understandable, are these

810
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,280
international economic agreements, the things that are called free trade agreements.

811
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,920
So that's not what they are.

812
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,200
Those are very big issues for the public.

813
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,080
People are very much worried about the trade deficit, because they know that's their job.

814
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,400
China has a 40% tariff on us, we have a 2% on them.

815
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,240
They call that free trade, you're not an isolationist, are you?

816
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
No, I'm not.

817
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
But this stuff is not even free trade.

818
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
No, but that's what they say.

819
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
That's what they say.

820
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Right, of course.

821
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,720
Now, the point I'm trying to make is this, these are very big issues for the population.

822
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,360
They're also big issues for the business world, but the population and the business world

823
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,480
happens to be on opposite sides.

824
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,240
Therefore, the issues do not arise in political campaigns.

825
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,400
So like, for example, the free trade area of the Americas, which is an enormous agreement,

826
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,980
very little, a lot of consequences.

827
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,080
That has yet to be discussed in the media.

828
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,800
It's been negotiated for three years.

829
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,840
It finally broke through at the helmet of the Americas meeting in Quebec, there was

830
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,040
such a furor over it, it had to be mentioned.

831
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,840
But it's been under negotiation for a couple of years by corporate managers, by trade ministers

832
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,840
of governments who are basically corporate representatives.

833
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,280
The media know all about it, but they don't want the public to know.

834
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,240
It did not come up in the political campaigns.

835
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,120
The nature of these arrangements has yet to be made public.

836
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,720
I mean, you can sort of figure it out if you do a research project, but these things are

837
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,520
not made available to the public, and it's for a very clear reason.

838
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,640
Our final segment with the professor with solutions coming up.

839
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,440
So things still seem to be going fairly well between them.

840
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Yeah.

841
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,040
This is stuff that Alex can get on board with.

842
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Totally.

843
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,980
Now, maybe Alex would view this as the consequence of an elaborate shady conspiracy to put this

844
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,360
trade deal in in order to enslave white men.

845
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
Sure.

846
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:11,320
Whereas Chomsky would look at it more as the result of business interests, those filters

847
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:19,280
that are brought up in the propaganda model, things like ownership of conglomerates, the

848
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:27,120
sources of news, the advertising revenues, things like that create a market environment

849
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:34,240
where it's not in the best interest of the people who may profit from one of these arrangements

850
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,960
to cover it too much.

851
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Right.

852
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,560
If it's something that could be something that would be very unpopular with the normal

853
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,560
voting public.

854
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
Sure.

855
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:50,200
One thing I am absolutely seeing that is mitigating what I would think is so much disagreement

856
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,040
is that Chomsky is elucidating the conspiracies that are real that we all know about.

857
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,600
You know, like we all know that billionaires and the government work together to fuck us

858
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
over.

859
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,360
That's a normal conspiracy.

860
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
That's what they do.

861
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,000
And it's not even like it's not even like their fault.

862
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,720
They're just creations of the system that is propping them up.

863
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,040
And then they continue to, you know, they do that whole thing.

864
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,080
But since he's framing it in that conspiratorial, like these business interests and the government

865
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:29,600
are all working together to fuck us over, that can be viewed by Alex in the same way

866
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,720
that the metaphor could be viewed by Noam Chomsky.

867
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,920
It's like, oh, you're absolutely right.

868
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,960
There is a conspiracy of the Rothschilds and the government to fuck us over with NAFTA.

869
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Yeah.

870
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,200
There's enough leeway to this that Alex can still find it useful.

871
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,140
And the audience can still read into it what they want to read into it that fits the sort

872
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:58,600
of Infowars narrative structure.

873
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:05,400
Whereas it does not necessarily and it's a lot more boring than the way that Alex would

874
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
put it.

875
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
Yeah.

876
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:15,400
But man, you can absolutely see it like in 2001 that that level of like because the government

877
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,760
is so fucking corrupt and because Alex isn't outright saying he's fighting the devil.

878
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,000
You can go on an Infowars show and say the government's fucking corrupt.

879
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,360
And Alex is like, yeah, the government's fucking corrupt and everybody goes, yeah, the government's

880
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
fucking corrupt.

881
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,460
And then 20 years later, you're like, let's overthrow the government.

882
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,640
And it's like, oh, no, wrong.

883
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,040
Because they're working for the devil.

884
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Exactly.

885
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,040
No bill.

886
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,040
You messed up, guys.

887
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Shit.

888
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
Yeah.

889
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:48,000
And I think that this is in that real sweet spot of pre 9-11, but post 2000 election,

890
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,160
where there is so much chaos and alienation in people.

891
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:59,240
The result of the 2000 election was such a awful...

892
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,720
I mean, it was literally stolen.

893
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,040
It was a moment where scales fell from people's eyes in a lot of ways.

894
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,040
Yeah.

895
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,120
Across the aisle, perhaps, even.

896
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,160
You can't think of...

897
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,160
This is the way that our process is going through.

898
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,480
This doesn't feel right.

899
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:24,760
Are you telling me that our process has been derailed by Republican aides, fake dressing

900
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,480
up as business people to get rid of...

901
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,680
Wait, are you talking about Roger Stone?

902
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,680
What are we doing?

903
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,680
Is this our government?

904
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Is this how it works?

905
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,680
Yeah.

906
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,960
And you had that period before 9-11 where people were all over the map in terms of their

907
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,360
beliefs about the administration.

908
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Totally.

909
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,000
And I think that people galvanized a lot after 9-11 due to coming together after a national

910
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
tragedy.

911
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,600
But this exists in that space before that, where there's a lot of fertile ground for

912
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:06,200
Alex to take advantage of in political disillusionment.

913
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:13,040
And so I think that Noam, unfortunately, but I don't know, I don't think he knows too much

914
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:19,520
about Alex and just thinks that he is kind of like an alternative news guy.

915
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,480
And he says things like, you know, outlets like yours are important to...

916
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,880
But I think that that is a perception that even I certainly had more of a feeling of

917
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,880
four years ago.

918
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
Sure, totally.

919
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:42,560
Because there is a reality that people who are outside of the structures of advertising,

920
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,880
those voices are important.

921
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:50,600
And sometimes there is value in somebody who's, you know, maybe wrong sometimes, but willing

922
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
to take a chance.

923
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Totally.

924
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,400
I think those voices are valuable in the broad spectrum of media.

925
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
Totally.

926
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:04,680
I mean, to Chomsky's earlier point, like, if you recall the media immediately following

927
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,220
that stolen election, like, they quickly were like, hey, you know what, we need to unite

928
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,120
around our president and we need the country to come together.

929
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,840
At no point in time were they like, hey, we can't have a stolen election.

930
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,040
Like that just can't be a thing.

931
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,040
Yeah.

932
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
Yeah.

933
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,840
And I guess that opens up another conversation of like, what would it have looked like if

934
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,040
the media had called out the election?

935
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
I don't know.

936
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,200
I don't know.

937
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:36,640
But leaving that aside, I think that Chomsky has a similar tack to, you know, what I had

938
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,720
perhaps before I knew as much about Alex as I do.

939
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,000
And I think a lot of people, if they don't know all that much about him, which is just

940
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
like, you're a guy who's on the outside.

941
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You're a fringe guy.

942
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Sure.

943
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,960
You broke into Bohemian Grove or whatever.

944
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,720
Maybe I don't agree with you, but there's value in you existing in the media landscape.

945
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,480
And I don't agree with that now.

946
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
Disagree.

947
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,200
But you can kind of see that in the way that he's engaging with him.

948
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,860
Radio can be a very important, I mean, it's an extremely important instrument.

949
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:11,120
There can be real involvement of interchange and that can be a highly important educational

950
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,120
instrument.

951
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
And there are others.

952
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
I mean.

953
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,120
So it's not just sound bites.

954
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,120
People have to actually espouse ideas.

955
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,760
You know, these are not trivial issues.

956
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,160
You have to really think them through the thing that I mentioned, for example, the international

957
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
economic agreements.

958
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,560
You have to think about them, you have to learn about them.

959
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,200
You can't just listen to a slogan and say, OK, that's what I think.

960
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,120
Well, these are unelected, unaccountable international boards controlled by the top 20 corporations

961
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,880
and banks telling us they're going to run our lives.

962
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,680
I mean, that's a horrible idea, but most Americans don't know that.

963
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,240
That's essentially Alex responding to Noam Chomsky saying you can't use sound bites and

964
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,240
catchphrases.

965
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,240
With a sound bite.

966
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,240
More or less.

967
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,240
And a catchphrase.

968
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,240
Yeah.

969
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,240
Ah, man.

970
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,040
So you're telling me that Noam Chomsky told Alex Jones that he's important and Noam Chomsky

971
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,120
won't even talk to me.

972
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,240
That's just bullshit.

973
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
It's just bullshit.

974
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
It's unfair.

975
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,920
Noam Chomsky, I'm calling you out.

976
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,360
But again, again, if you don't know that much about Alex, you don't actually listen to his

977
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,360
show.

978
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,760
And like I said, I don't know too much about exactly what he was like in 2001.

979
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,100
But you see this in other eras of his career, too.

980
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:24,080
If you don't know all that much about him, you could get the sense that like, yeah, you're

981
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,080
not just doing sound bites.

982
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,320
You are getting into the issues.

983
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,280
And that is a value of radio.

984
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,000
I do agree with Chomsky on that.

985
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Absolutely.

986
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,680
But not Alex so much.

987
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,680
No.

988
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
Absolutely not.

989
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,120
The two of them get along pretty well.

990
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,880
They both seem to hate consumerism.

991
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,760
Well, that's like these $150 Nike tennis shoes that are so ugly I wouldn't touch them if

992
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,360
they were free.

993
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,680
But the young people are just begging and have to have them or they're not human.

994
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Yeah.

995
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,480
And if you watch, I mean, I sometimes watch this television with my grandchildren.

996
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,640
What they are subjected to is criminal.

997
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:06,800
I mean, they're barraged by propaganda, teaching them from infancy that the only thing in life

998
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,640
is getting those tennis shoes or those Pokemon cards or whatever it may be.

999
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,080
And that is really a way to control people in a very ugly fashion.

1000
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,240
People have to learn how to escape from that.

1001
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,720
It's a hard struggle.

1002
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
Yeah.

1003
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,720
Yeah.

1004
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,920
Consumerism is a toxic influence.

1005
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,440
And I don't know what's the answer to it.

1006
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,760
It's an individual process.

1007
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,760
Sure.

1008
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
Right?

1009
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,600
I mean, it can't be like outlawing advertising.

1010
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,920
No, that probably won't work.

1011
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:44,080
I would say one solution would obviously be to scorch the skies and have an AI keep us

1012
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,280
inside of egg sacks.

1013
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,760
That would be one solution.

1014
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,760
Certainly.

1015
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,760
Yeah.

1016
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,440
Although even then the AI has propaganda inside of it.

1017
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,800
So, man, you're never going to escape.

1018
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,800
No.

1019
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:01,120
I think the only way that this is productive as a conversation is addressing it as an individualistic

1020
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:06,360
pursuit of recognizing when those kinds of advertising tricks are being used.

1021
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,360
Right.

1022
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,120
And being like, yeah, I don't actually want that as much as they are saying I want it.

1023
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,120
Or maybe I do.

1024
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,120
Sure.

1025
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:19,760
You know, like advertising, I think that sometimes is dumb, but I actually do want what's being

1026
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,760
sold.

1027
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,760
Sure.

1028
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,440
I don't like Taco Bell commercials, but I do want Taco Bell.

1029
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:30,080
I just, all I want is, like, I'm so stoked when I find out something exists that I didn't

1030
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,080
know exists.

1031
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,920
Like if all commercials were just like, hey, you need to wash your clothes, Tide.

1032
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,520
I'd be like, holy shit, I didn't know Tide was out there.

1033
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,760
Yes, you did.

1034
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
That's not the point.

1035
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,760
That's not the point.

1036
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Sure.

1037
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,200
I mean, that experience was exactly what I had at the beginning of April when I saw the

1038
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,600
commercial for Mortal Kombat.

1039
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Yeah, exactly.

1040
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,600
It's like, what?

1041
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,960
Okay, then we'll watch Mortal Kombat.

1042
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,640
I don't give a shit about your commercial.

1043
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,600
The commercial is not going to convince me one way or another.

1044
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,600
You're informing me this exists.

1045
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Just tell me.

1046
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,600
That's all I needed to know.

1047
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Yeah.

1048
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:03,320
But I think that people can do that.

1049
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,360
They're very capable of doing that, and I think that that is what the message that Chomsky's

1050
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:15,400
bringing in many ways is, is thinking, is recognizing and being able to work around

1051
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,040
these things because you can't really stop them.

1052
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,280
And the fact that you can't stop them is what feeds into helplessness.

1053
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,680
You can't get rid of advertising.

1054
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,200
You're not going to get rid of public relations firms.

1055
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,200
Sure.

1056
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,200
That isn't going to happen.

1057
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,960
Because, I mean, even think about it just from a structural, actual perspective.

1058
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,260
How would that happen?

1059
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,400
How could you do that?

1060
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,840
You couldn't legislate away those kinds of...

1061
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,000
I just don't know.

1062
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It would be impossible.

1063
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Oh, ooh.

1064
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,840
Turn all the electricity off.

1065
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Sure.

1066
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,120
Then people would just make pamphlets again.

1067
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,680
Ah, they couldn't do it without electricity to run their printers.

1068
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,040
No, they'd just go back to the old cha-chunk.

1069
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,040
Get rid of presses.

1070
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,840
Get rid of ink.

1071
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Get rid of ink!

1072
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,240
Wow, you're good.

1073
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:13,080
So I think that the path away from helplessness that I'm hearing is self-motivated, self-driven,

1074
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,960
and the ways that intellectuals and public speakers can be of help is helping people

1075
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:24,960
recognize that it is a path out of this conundrum as opposed to, and sure, there's institutional

1076
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,720
things you can do, like perhaps break up large media entities.

1077
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,720
Sure.

1078
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:35,680
Certainly there's organization and things you can do on that front, but the idea of

1079
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,360
getting rid of the influence that is this negative consumerism is not likely.

1080
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,680
No, that is, yeah, it's not going back in the box, Pandora.

1081
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,680
No.

1082
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,680
Yeah.

1083
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,680
Yeah.

1084
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,680
This clip was really weird.

1085
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,240
I don't understand exactly what Alex is saying, but I have some thoughts on it.

1086
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,880
Take, say, these trade agreements that are coming along.

1087
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,800
One crucial part of them is to take what are called services and hand them over to private

1088
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
power.

1089
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,000
Well, services are just about anything that people would care about.

1090
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:16,640
You know, health, education, water, excuse me, I don't like anything that would be in

1091
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:22,120
the arena, in the public arena where people would not want to make decisions that has

1092
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,000
to be taken out of the public arena, put into private hands, unaccountable private hands,

1093
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,820
and then, you know, what's left for the public is which kind of shoes I buy.

1094
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:37,520
But these private corporations are taking on governmental power and take the lower Colorado

1095
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,000
river authority here in Texas, they're private, but they have SWAT teams and will arrest you.

1096
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,920
And it's the ultimate tyranny and then they say, hey, we're a corporation, you can't see

1097
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,920
our records.

1098
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,920
That's right.

1099
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,280
You can't ask questions.

1100
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:59,160
I think that what Alex is talking about is the lower Colorado river authority is like,

1101
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,520
you know, like dams and like electric power plants.

1102
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,040
I think he's talking about like guards around the area.

1103
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,040
Right.

1104
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,040
Right.

1105
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,040
Right.

1106
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
I'm not entirely sure.

1107
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,040
I think that's what he, cause they have like private security.

1108
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,040
Right.

1109
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,860
But what Chomsky's bringing up is privatization, essentially, and Alex is opposed to that,

1110
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,720
but he also hates big government.

1111
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,840
Whereas Chomsky's answer to this is public ownership and Alex would be staunchly opposed

1112
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,840
to that.

1113
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,320
He'd rather die than publicly own a business.

1114
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:37,480
He doesn't have a coherent answer to this because on the one hand you have public businesses

1115
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:45,480
or private businesses, should you allow private business for necessities?

1116
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Should you allow air to be privatized?

1117
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,000
Should you allow water to be privatized?

1118
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,840
Alex should be opposed to that, but also opposed to the alternative.

1119
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:01,800
It doesn't seem like Alex has a clear way out of his bullshit whenever cornered by Noam

1120
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,800
Chomsky.

1121
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,040
Someone who does have a position.

1122
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Yes.

1123
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,040
Yeah.

1124
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,760
What you do is you wiggle and Alex tries to bring up the difference between a democracy

1125
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,340
and a republic.

1126
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,560
This is a classic right wing fun time.

1127
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:23,560
So Alex is bringing up the difference between a democracy and a republic to Noam, can I

1128
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,560
read that?

1129
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,560
What's the name again?

1130
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
Chomsky.

1131
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,560
Noam Chomsky?

1132
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,560
Oh, that's who I would do it.

1133
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,560
Yeah.

1134
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,020
I wouldn't do it against that other guy.

1135
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,020
It doesn't go well.

1136
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:33,040
Ah, that's not surprising.

1137
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,360
And I would say that this is the turning point of the interview.

1138
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,080
This is where things go like, Oh, we're on thin ice.

1139
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,080
Okay.

1140
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,040
I hear Republicans, Democrats saying democracy, that's a semantical deception.

1141
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,760
The founding fathers said a democracy is horrible.

1142
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,640
It's two wolves and a sheet voting on what's for dinner.

1143
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,440
A republic has a rule of law, separation of powers, a bill of rights that you can't violate

1144
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,120
and the democracy 50% say, 51% say all the black people are killed or all the white people

1145
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
are killed.

1146
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,120
It's done or take that farm.

1147
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,120
It's done.

1148
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,120
Uh, right there.

1149
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,120
I mean, we hear this word democracy all the time.

1150
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,120
Well, we're a Republican.

1151
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,120
There's a big difference.

1152
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,240
Uh, actually, I think the real issues are elsewhere.

1153
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,240
I mean, the distinction between Republican democracy that you're describing was not really

1154
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,280
what concerned the founding fathers, what they were concerned about.

1155
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,080
He reads a James Madison, the main Kramer, what he was concerned about, but he wanted

1156
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:30,360
to have a system in which power would lie in the hands of what he called the wealth

1157
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,520
of the nation, uh, the more capable class of men.

1158
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:40,880
Uh, and the reason was because the goal of government, this phrase is to protect the

1159
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,280
minority of the opulence against the majority.

1160
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:50,360
So the system was designed to try to ensure that the wealth of the nation would essentially

1161
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,240
be in control and that the general public would be fragmented and marginalized and so

1162
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
on.

1163
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,880
Now you look over the course of time, middle class flourish here though, professor, pardon

1164
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,640
the middle class flourish here, uh, 4% of the population would have the middle class

1165
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,640
flourish.

1166
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,360
Well, that's, you know, that's not the middle, 4% of the population is in the middle class,

1167
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,360
middle class.

1168
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:18,040
It'll, but I think, look, so Alex is having trouble now because Noam has, uh, pointed

1169
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:23,280
a finger at the founders in a way that Alex cannot handle.

1170
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,240
Uh, um, yeah, so Alex rebuts that a middle class flourished here.

1171
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,920
And he, because of right wing policies, Dan, and his evidence of it is that 4% of the population

1172
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,040
of the world and we had half of the wealth.

1173
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,040
Yeah.

1174
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,040
Right.

1175
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:46,000
And I think Chomsky doesn't understand what he said because he said 4% isn't the middle

1176
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
class.

1177
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Right.

1178
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Right.

1179
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Right.

1180
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Right.

1181
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,660
And if he heard Alex saying 4% of our population had half of the wealth, then that would be

1182
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,480
the response that would be given.

1183
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,720
But I still think even if he had accurately heard what Alex said, I still think that what

1184
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,160
he's saying is accurate.

1185
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,160
Yeah.

1186
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,440
The 4% that had all the wealth wasn't necessarily the middle class.

1187
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,440
Yeah.

1188
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,440
Yeah.

1189
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
Yeah.

1190
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,880
They were very much not the middle class, uh, on account of there were only 4% of them.

1191
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,120
Uh, no, no, the 4% is 4% of the world's population.

1192
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,120
Oh yeah.

1193
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,120
Yeah.

1194
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,120
That's the way that Alex is meaning that.

1195
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,120
Gotcha.

1196
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,120
Gotcha.

1197
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,120
Okay.

1198
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,120
Um, so you leave the 4% aside.

1199
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,120
Sure.

1200
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,680
And if he did have half the wealth, it wasn't like evenly distributed among the population.

1201
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,080
There may have been a fairly comfortable, uh, middle class.

1202
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,080
Yeah.

1203
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:42,040
I would argue the, uh, slave population probably wasn't taken care of as well.

1204
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,040
Yeah.

1205
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,040
Yeah.

1206
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,040
At that point.

1207
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,040
Yeah.

1208
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,040
Yeah.

1209
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,040
Yeah.

1210
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,040
Yeah.

1211
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,640
Um, this, this issue with the founding fathers is the beginning of what is going to become

1212
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,640
a tear in the fabric of friendship.

1213
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
Sure.

1214
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:05,640
Um, we have, uh, this, this, uh, conversation, it ends up going to guns because of course

1215
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,640
it does.

1216
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,640
Oh no, it's not going to go to guns.

1217
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,640
Almost immediately.

1218
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,640
Almost immediately.

1219
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,640
Of course it does.

1220
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,800
I think, look, over the centuries, there's been a lot of struggles against this elitist

1221
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:22,040
concept, and the options for public participation did increase substantially.

1222
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,680
But was it elitist for them to say that we would all be armed and have the right to keep

1223
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,680
and bear arms?

1224
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,760
Well, you know, that's not what they meant back at that time.

1225
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,320
What they meant is you read the second amendment, they said, in the context of raising malicious

1226
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,920
people should have the right to bear arms.

1227
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,760
Now that's, we're living in a different world, you know, we're not raising malicious.

1228
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,720
The question whether people should have arms is a separate issue.

1229
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:49,400
I mean, in fact, here, the United States is off spectrum of international society.

1230
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,600
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, Gnome, Gnome.

1231
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,440
Did you just say internationals are the way?

1232
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,440
Gnome, Gnome.

1233
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,440
Gnome!

1234
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,440
Gnome!

1235
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:07,880
Gnome, you have, Gnome, you have hit a very dangerous button, and you can't undo this

1236
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,880
now.

1237
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
Nope.

1238
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,760
You have just told Alex that his interpretation of the second amendment is wrong.

1239
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,880
New world order.

1240
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,880
New world order.

1241
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,960
Oh no, turns out Gnome Chomsky's a shill.

1242
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,520
The United States is off spectrum of international society.

1243
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,080
Do you think people are hopeful, I mean, are you hopeful that folks are going to wake up

1244
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,880
to this system?

1245
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,720
I think people, again, like I said, maybe I'm naive, but I think that people more or

1246
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,560
less understand it, and what they feel is helpless, and they have to be able to overcome

1247
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,080
that feeling of helplessness, and there are ways of doing it.

1248
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:46,000
You know, in the past, people have organized, they have struggled, they've achieved rights,

1249
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
we have all kinds of rights and freedoms that didn't exist not long ago, and that's because

1250
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:59,920
people were not willing to just sit back and take it, but to organize, learn, act, educate,

1251
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,880
do things to change the world so that it's their concerns and needs.

1252
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,160
We have the opportunity to do that, and we're very privileged, we live in a society where

1253
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,680
people are not controlled by force, that's an extremely important privilege.

1254
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,640
Well, Mr. Chomsky, I have to be honest with you, and I really appreciate you coming on,

1255
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:20,760
I want to tell folks about some of your publications and let you get back to work, but right there,

1256
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:27,440
it seemed like a group think hurting mechanism when you talked about the guns, and you said,

1257
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:36,280
well, I think America, the US, is off from the main line of the rest of the world, as

1258
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,480
if, oh, we're a little backwards if we still have guns, I mean, that's that whole group

1259
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,680
think right there.

1260
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:47,640
So Alex is trying to express this notion that, you know, you're trying to shame America about

1261
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:53,160
guns based on the notion that the rest of the world is more civilized because they don't

1262
01:03:53,160 --> 01:04:01,360
have guns, and this is just anathema to Alex, he has decided that if you present that kind

1263
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:09,560
of a position on his show, you're fucking chill, and Alex throws out, literally, a great

1264
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,560
degree of agreement.

1265
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,560
Oh yeah, no, it's all gone.

1266
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,560
What guns!

1267
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:19,720
What could have led to a second interview, probably could have led to a decent, I mean

1268
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:26,160
eventually would fall apart, but there wasn't hostility here, there was someone who has

1269
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,560
a different perspective on some of the similar themes that Alex talks about.

1270
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:38,040
Yeah, no, I mean, the moment Noam said, we live in a country where you can't control

1271
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:43,760
people by force, all I saw in my head was Alex pulling a gun and saying, you take that

1272
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,160
back, and it's like, well!

1273
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,000
Look, guns are not about force, they're about politeness.

1274
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Exactly.

1275
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,600
So even that, when Alex is saying that, you know, like, hey, this is, you're trying to

1276
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:02,280
pull out some groupthink, even that, Chomsky is pretty generous and measured with his response.

1277
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,160
As if, oh, we're a little backwards that we still have guns, I mean, that's that whole

1278
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,880
groupthink right there.

1279
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,440
It could be, again, I don't think it's an obvious question, and I think we'd really

1280
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,080
have to talk about it and think it's true, but if you want my opinion, I think they're

1281
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,160
much too easy to get in the United States.

1282
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,560
But England's crime rate just doubled three years after they took all the guns.

1283
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:26,000
Well, see, the United States does not have a particularly high crime rate.

1284
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It's been sort of toward the high end of the spectrum of industrial societies, but not

1285
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,300
out of range.

1286
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,880
The one real difference between the United States and other countries is killings with

1287
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,880
guns.

1288
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:45,360
So, it seems like Chomsky is just ignoring Alex's obviously misrepresented stats about

1289
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,920
Yeah, he's not taking the bait.

1290
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,200
No, and he's framing the conversation where he believes it's more important, which is

1291
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:57,760
deaths, gun deaths, which is out of pace with other industrialized countries.

1292
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,480
Yeah, Alex isn't the first person to come at him with that bullshit.

1293
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,480
Doesn't seem like it.

1294
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,480
No.

1295
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,320
So, he might be the first, Alex might be the first person to come with this, though.

1296
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,880
The one real difference between the United States and other countries is killings with

1297
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,880
guns.

1298
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,880
Not anymore.

1299
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,240
Yeah, it's very high here as compared to other countries.

1300
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,760
Look at The Economist no longer.

1301
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,760
We're number 12.

1302
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,800
England and Australia are number one and two now.

1303
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,040
In deaths by guns?

1304
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,320
Yes, now they are.

1305
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,320
I don't think so.

1306
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,760
London is now more dangerous.

1307
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
Only the last three years.

1308
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,760
It wasn't three years ago.

1309
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,120
You're right, three years ago.

1310
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,400
It's now worse than Washington, D.C., sir.

1311
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,640
In deaths by guns?

1312
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,800
Yeah, I have about four different universities, three different governments.

1313
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,360
Australian, Europe, statistical data.

1314
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,800
It's all on Infowars.com right now, professor.

1315
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,760
Okay, I'd take a look, but if that's the case, I'd look at the reasons, and I would suspect

1316
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,400
that the reason is that there has been an increased availability of guns.

1317
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,680
If there's going to be an increased availability, then there are going to be crimes using guns.

1318
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,960
You're right, sir.

1319
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,760
They outlawed the guns, and so now the criminals...

1320
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,280
They've always had guns outlawed.

1321
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,660
So now the criminals have a reason to bring them in because the black markets made it

1322
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,660
very lucrative.

1323
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:19,320
See, I don't think the guns were always outlawed, and even the police didn't have guns in England

1324
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,320
until very recently.

1325
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,240
Oh, people had guns over there?

1326
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:28,360
No, look, in England, even the police were not armed with guns until fairly recently.

1327
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,520
Professor Chomsky?

1328
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,040
The police didn't have guns.

1329
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,800
The people had handguns and rifles.

1330
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,680
They just confiscated them three years ago.

1331
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,360
No, that happened, and it was an effort to do that in Canada.

1332
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,360
That's a different story.

1333
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,360
I mean, look, this is a big issue, and we have to look into the details of it.

1334
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,200
I really don't agree with you about the facts, but these are factual questions.

1335
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,200
We could settle it.

1336
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,200
I have the facts.

1337
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,160
Well, I'd love to debate you on it.

1338
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,560
Real quick, tell folks about some of your books and publications.

1339
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,280
That is a we're done here.

1340
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,880
Tell me about your publications.

1341
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:05,440
If there's more availability of guns, then there's more gun deaths.

1342
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,440
No!

1343
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:13,760
I see, I think that there's a really, not bizarre at all, very foreign to info wars

1344
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:20,760
situation going on where he's talking to a person who is staying on the one thing that

1345
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:27,080
they were talking about, which is deaths by guns, Alex's fudging statistics, making stuff

1346
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,080
up.

1347
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,080
Yeah, you brought up a different issue.

1348
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,760
Hey, tell people about your books.

1349
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,400
I'm going to have to let you go.

1350
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:37,040
But what Chomsky is doing is being overly charitable.

1351
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,720
He's not saying, Alex, you're a fucking liar.

1352
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,720
You're making stuff up.

1353
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,080
He's saying, I would need to take a look at that.

1354
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:48,360
And if that is the case, here is a potential explanation for why that could be the case.

1355
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:55,360
And then Alex has taken that potential explanation that Chomsky has for his fictitious stats,

1356
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,160
explanation for his fictitious stats.

1357
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:03,160
Yeah, I think I would have said something along the lines of, if England and Australia

1358
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:08,080
are one and two in gun deaths, I will eat a bowl of my own shit, you idiot.

1359
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,080
I bet you a million dollars.

1360
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,360
I will take that bet.

1361
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:17,080
So Alex, what he's doing is he's talking about the Firearms Amendment Acts of 1997 in England,

1362
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,200
which were passed in response to the Dunblane massacre, where a man in his 40s carried out

1363
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,280
a mass shooting at a primary school.

1364
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,360
The strategy that they employed was not to confiscate guns, but to ban future ownership

1365
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:32,640
of most guns and let the valid licenses that were active lapse and not be renewed.

1366
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,360
In response, a ton of people voluntarily turned in their guns, and Alex is pretending that's

1367
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,840
a confiscation.

1368
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:43,920
And it did make more guns illegal to own, but there's been some pretty strict rules

1369
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,560
about guns in England predating this.

1370
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,400
Like, Noam Chomsky's not far off.

1371
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,040
Alex could get him on a technicality if he was saying that all guns have always been

1372
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,920
illegal or whatever, but spiritually he's not off.

1373
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
Yeah.

1374
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,920
No.

1375
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,160
Cops shouldn't be armed.

1376
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:11,080
Now that having happened, Alex decides, I think I'm going to hang up on this dick.

1377
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,160
Really do appreciate you joining us.

1378
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,720
I would just say this, one big part of controlling the thought process and the debate where the

1379
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,320
rat thinks it has a choice, you can go forward, left, right or back, but it's still in there

1380
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:26,840
system, is having people out there talking about this propaganda state in Madison Avenue

1381
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,800
and only pointing out certain parts of it and misdirecting people back into the big

1382
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,360
government paradigm.

1383
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,480
And frankly, sir, you need to get the information on the guns, on the land grabbing, on all

1384
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:42,360
of it, because I have it right here and I respect your work, but at the same time, just

1385
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,480
here talking to you, I think some of it isn't as honest as it could be.

1386
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,920
Well, you know, that's for people, others to decide when they look at it.

1387
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,920
He is.

1388
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,920
My audience is pretty well educated.

1389
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,920
Thanks for joining us.

1390
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,440
Say hi to David Rockefeller for me.

1391
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,440
Wow.

1392
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,440
What a dick.

1393
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,440
What a complete dick.

1394
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,440
Yeah, now.

1395
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,440
What a bizarre end to this interview.

1396
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,440
Excuse me, sir.

1397
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:15,640
I'm going to agree with you for about an hour, but it turns out that you disagree with me

1398
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,640
on guns.

1399
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,480
So you work for David Rockefeller, you lying piece of shit.

1400
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,480
I hope you die.

1401
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,480
I hope you die.

1402
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,480
Click.

1403
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:27,520
And something that I think is really admirable is the way that Chomsky responds to that.

1404
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,400
Like Alex is basically calling him a liar and he's like, well, I guess people just figure

1405
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
that out.

1406
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,120
I'm not going to engage with your, your, your attempt to get me to fight with you or whatever.

1407
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Exactly.

1408
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,240
I like that.

1409
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,600
Excuse me, Alex.

1410
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,760
You realize I'm gnome Chomsky?

1411
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,640
His pulse didn't even go up at all.

1412
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,640
Nope.

1413
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,640
Nope.

1414
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,000
I think, I think you're controlled opposition and a real dick and a liar.

1415
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,280
Uh, well, I understand your point of view.

1416
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,280
I think, uh, people will be smart enough to look into it and see the difference here

1417
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,120
and gnome Chomsky.

1418
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,120
You're wrong, buddy.

1419
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,180
Say hi to David Rockefeller.

1420
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,180
You busted.

1421
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,840
So now that he's gone.

1422
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,960
Now we get to talk shit.

1423
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,960
Oh yeah.

1424
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,960
Oh yeah.

1425
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,420
There goes gnome Chomsky, ladies and gentlemen.

1426
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,800
And I've read his books and now I'm more sure of it than ever.

1427
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,560
He's a new world order shill up one side and down the other.

1428
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,960
Oh, I never had guns in England.

1429
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,040
They most certainly did.

1430
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,080
Certainly gun ownership wasn't as prolific.

1431
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:34,520
I mean, how many, I mean, you've seen the video that's been on nationwide of them cutting

1432
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:38,880
the guns in half over there, confiscating the handguns, the rifles three years ago.

1433
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,240
We've read the reports, the economist world net daily.

1434
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,240
Yeah.

1435
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,040
So I mean, just speak freely once he's gone.

1436
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,240
I've read his books now.

1437
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,240
I know for sure.

1438
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:53,600
So wait, was the idea to get him in there and then find something to disagree with and

1439
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,040
then declare him a shill?

1440
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,400
I think it has to have been because he has to have like, if, if, if what Alex is saying

1441
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:05,560
is true and he's read Chomsky's books and suspected that he was an NWO shill, then it

1442
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,200
would have to be like, I'm just looking for a point of disagreement in order to make you

1443
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,200
an enemy.

1444
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,200
Yeah.

1445
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
That's not, that's not cool.

1446
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:18,120
I would have suggested that when he was talking about one of the books that you supposedly

1447
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:24,320
read would be the time to say that, Hey, I think after having read your book, you're

1448
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,320
a shill.

1449
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,320
Yeah.

1450
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,320
I don't like your position on anti-communist.

1451
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,320
Exactly.

1452
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,320
Yes.

1453
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,320
It'd be very simple.

1454
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,640
All of my favorite people are anti-communist as hell.

1455
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,640
Yeah.

1456
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,640
Yeah.

1457
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,640
Yeah.

1458
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:48,400
I, I, I thought that this was really strange, um, Alex, I don't, I don't know what he was

1459
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
doing.

1460
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:53,400
I'm, I'm, I'm completely perplexed.

1461
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,680
There's so much agreement.

1462
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,680
Yeah.

1463
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:01,320
Now, Alex would have to give up a lot of the sort of more fun elements of his conspiratorial

1464
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,440
nonsense if he were to continue engaging with Chomsky.

1465
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,440
Sure.

1466
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,440
Because a lot of this stuff would fall apart.

1467
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,440
Yeah.

1468
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,440
Yeah.

1469
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,440
A lot of it would.

1470
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,560
And, and some of the, the more real, uh, sort of dynamics that Chomsky could bring to the

1471
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:20,360
table are not necessarily as exciting or lucrative.

1472
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,360
Yeah.

1473
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,360
Yeah.

1474
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,360
Yeah.

1475
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,760
And maybe there isn't value in it for Alex to be an ally of Chomsky.

1476
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,760
Right.

1477
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,760
Right.

1478
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,760
Right.

1479
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,760
No, I mean, it's hard for me to imagine that he did this interview as a trap in order to

1480
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,680
create this moment at the end.

1481
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,680
Yeah.

1482
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,680
Yeah.

1483
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,680
It just, it doesn't make sense.

1484
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,480
No, it really doesn't.

1485
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:44,360
It also doesn't feel angry enough for it to be like a visceral response on Alex's part

1486
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,680
where he's just like, fuck it.

1487
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,120
I'm just mad at this guy.

1488
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,120
Yeah.

1489
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:56,120
I mean, it kind of feels like if, if I were running it here would be my kind of a game

1490
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:02,720
plan there, which is if you and Noam Chomsky have an awesome interview, then you get to

1491
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,160
say Noam Chomsky is a fan of yours.

1492
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,160
Sure.

1493
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,720
And that legitimizes you to a lot of people.

1494
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,760
And it would help Alex's arguments of, you know, being above the left right paradigm.

1495
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,760
Yeah.

1496
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,360
If you get into a fight with Noam Chomsky, you got into a fight with Noam fucking Chomsky.

1497
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,520
A one-sided fight.

1498
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,320
And a lot of people will be like, hell yeah, man.

1499
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,800
So Alex really can't lose in this scenario.

1500
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:33,120
I do think that the extreme right elements of Alex's audience, which is certainly more

1501
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:41,360
of the keystone of it than anything, would not like the idea of being friends with Noam

1502
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Chomsky.

1503
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,360
Totally.

1504
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,360
Totally.

1505
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,360
Yeah.

1506
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,760
It's, I honestly, I've listened to this interview a couple times and I don't really know exactly

1507
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,760
what happened.

1508
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:51,760
Yeah.

1509
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,760
I'm not sure.

1510
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,000
It makes no sense to me.

1511
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Yeah.

1512
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,640
And maybe there was a decent chance that what we saw there with him being like, sir, you

1513
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:03,680
know, I believe that this is a group think and, you know, I think that you're not being

1514
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:07,500
as honest as maybe that's 2001 Angry Alex.

1515
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,500
Could be.

1516
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
Could be.

1517
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,520
You know, like maybe we're just judging it based on the bombastic performances of the

1518
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,520
present.

1519
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,680
Maybe that's how he was an angry dick back then.

1520
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,640
How many years had he been doing this?

1521
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,640
Not long.

1522
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,640
Not too long.

1523
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,640
He's inexperienced.

1524
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,400
I mean, I wasn't, I didn't get mediocre at comedy for seven years.

1525
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:33,640
So you can't imagine him being, you know, right out the gate, the bombastic disgusting

1526
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,360
human being that we expect today.

1527
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Yeah.

1528
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:45,300
And the years of substance abuse and globalists and hot tubs have certainly created the character

1529
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,300
that he is.

1530
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,300
Yeah.

1531
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,300
I don't know.

1532
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,300
Anyway, here's the last clip.

1533
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,300
Yeah.

1534
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,960
I had the spanking there at the end and I certainly enjoyed it.

1535
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,960
Really?

1536
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,960
Chomsky.

1537
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:54,960
Really?

1538
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,840
I've got a cold order shell and I've got twice the brain you've got with both arms tied behind

1539
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,960
my back.

1540
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,960
Makes sense.

1541
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:08,320
I tell you these people, it makes me want to puke.

1542
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,600
Our founding fathers were elitists.

1543
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,440
They wanted to protect the elite.

1544
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,440
They were bad.

1545
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,800
That might not have been the right thing for him to mock.

1546
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,120
Yeah.

1547
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,960
They owned humans.

1548
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:27,040
So they definitely wanted to protect owning humans.

1549
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,440
Yeah.

1550
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:34,720
I think that if you take anything away from this, it's Alex's contention that he has more

1551
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,080
brains with both hands tied behind his back.

1552
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,080
Man.

1553
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,720
A completely meaningless brag.

1554
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:47,720
It really couldn't get more obviously incongruous for someone to say, look how smart I am.

1555
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:53,880
I'm going to use a cliche that could not less apply to the very thing that I'm saying I'm

1556
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,880
smart about.

1557
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,880
Yeah.

1558
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,480
I think that really kind of sums it up.

1559
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:04,040
And honestly, strategically it even sums up what I look at.

1560
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:10,080
There are very few times that I take a look at something that happened in Alex's past

1561
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,160
and I'm just completely flummoxed.

1562
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:17,080
And I really don't know why this happened the way it did.

1563
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,640
It's confusing.

1564
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,640
I don't know.

1565
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,760
And I don't think I have any answers.

1566
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,880
I would like to know how the Booker got Noam Chomsky.

1567
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,500
I think a lot of people are more gettable than we think.

1568
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,500
That's probably true.

1569
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,600
I think that a lot of folks that you might want to talk to, it would just be a matter

1570
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:37,600
of a couple emails.

1571
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,600
Yeah.

1572
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:45,720
I mean, considering how much free time I could make at the drop of a hat, I imagine public

1573
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,320
intellectuals are in a very similar spot.

1574
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,000
Maybe a little bit less free time than you.

1575
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,320
Maybe a little bit less free time than me, specifically.

1576
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,520
The paragon of free time, Jordan.

1577
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,520
Yeah.

1578
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,720
I think about how differently history could have gone if Alex and Noam became buddies

1579
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:10,440
instead of Steve Pacanich and Noam Chomsky.

1580
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,920
You're not going to get as many big swings from Noam Chomsky.

1581
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:14,920
I believe-

1582
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,920
Why not?

1583
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,240
Steve came into the fold in 2002.

1584
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,240
This is 2001.

1585
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,240
Wow.

1586
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,240
So this is pre-Steve Pacanich.

1587
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,000
Hey, we got to get a new Noam Chomsky.

1588
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,880
Get Steve Pacanich in here.

1589
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,160
Dude, if the infinite universes is real, there is a universe-

1590
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,360
The multiverse theory.

1591
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,760
Where Steve Pacanich is played by Noam Chomsky on the Alex Jones show.

1592
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,760
How does that go?

1593
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,720
Do you think Noam Chomsky gets crazier or Alex gets less crazy?

1594
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,280
I mean, if you go solely based on this interview-

1595
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,280
Sure, sure.

1596
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,040
I think Alex gets less crazy.

1597
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,040
Yes.

1598
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,000
Because to me, Chomsky seems immovable.

1599
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,880
No, he's got a heart rate 120 over 80 all day, baby.

1600
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:00,280
He does not seem to care too much and is willing to elucidate positions and clarify things

1601
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,720
while discussing things with Alex.

1602
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,160
And I think that that would not...

1603
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:09,840
He would disappear before he got crazier because of Alex, I think.

1604
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,920
I think Alex believes that he is the waves that could wear away the rock, but instead

1605
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,160
it is Noam Chomsky.

1606
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,160
Yeah.

1607
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,160
Yeah.

1608
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,600
And to be honest, I think Steve was crazy when he showed up.

1609
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,800
Oh no, of course.

1610
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,600
I think Alex didn't make him more crazy.

1611
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,600
Steve was crazy when he was working for the State Department.

1612
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,600
Probably.

1613
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,600
Yeah.

1614
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,600
When he killed Aldo Morrow.

1615
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,040
They were all probably like, this guy thinks he killed Aldo Morrow.

1616
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,840
He did kill Aldo Morrow.

1617
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,840
That's true.

1618
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,480
So anyway, Jordan, we will be back.

1619
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,360
This has been a long overdue checking this box off.

1620
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,360
Oh yeah.

1621
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,120
And I wish I had more to bring to it, but I honestly don't.

1622
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,480
I think it's just an interesting glimpse of public intellectual...

1623
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,480
It really is.

1624
01:20:53,480 --> 01:21:01,720
Having a conversation with Alex that it steps on a number of commonalities between where

1625
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:10,480
sort of critical historical study overlaps with, you know, pseudo-conspiracy, you know,

1626
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,480
and where there is distinction and where there's departure.

1627
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:20,000
And I think you also get a really solid glimpse of, even in 2001, Alex is so sensitive about

1628
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
guns.

1629
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Totally.

1630
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,680
And it may be one of the only things that really means anything to him.

1631
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,680
Yeah.

1632
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,680
Yeah.

1633
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:34,760
And to a certain extent, you know, so many men treat guns as an extension of toxic masculinity,

1634
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:38,080
so maybe that's even more, like, at the deepest level.

1635
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,480
It's just toxic masculinity.

1636
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,480
Sure.

1637
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,480
You know?

1638
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,480
Or property rights.

1639
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
Sure.

1640
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:47,360
It could be a symbol of the idea of personal private property.

1641
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,360
Sure, sure.

1642
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,360
I don't know.

1643
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,360
Totally true.

1644
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,360
But it's strange.

1645
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,240
It's strange that he had to make a fight out of essentially a decent point.

1646
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,240
Yeah.

1647
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,240
Yep.

1648
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,240
Yep.

1649
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,520
Anyway, we'll be back, Jordan.

1650
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,520
But until then, we have a website.

1651
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,520
We do have a website.

1652
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,520
It's knowledgefight.com.

1653
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,640
We are also on Twitter.

1654
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,640
We are on Twitter.

1655
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,640
It's at knowledgefight.com.

1656
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,640
Go to bed.

1657
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:08,640
We're also on Facebook.

1658
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,640
We are on Facebook.

1659
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,920
If you'd like to download the show, please go to iTunes and et cetera.

1660
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,120
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1661
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,120
doing God's work.

1662
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,120
Yep.

1663
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,120
We'll be back.

1664
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,120
But until then, I'm Neo.

1665
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,120
I'm Leo.

1666
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,120
I'm Dizzy X. Clark.

1667
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,120
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1668
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,120
And now, here comes the sex robots.

1669
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,280
In Kansas, you're on the air.

1670
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,280
Thanks for holding.

1671
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,280
Hello, Alex.

1672
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,280
I'm a first time caller.

1673
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,280
I'm a huge fan.

1674
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,280
I love your work.

1675
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,280
I love you.

1676
01:22:32,280 --> 01:23:01,280
I love you, too.
