Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.200
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

Andy Enchanze, you're on the air thanks for holding.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.940
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan.

00:51.940 --> 00:53.880
I love your world!

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I love you.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm Jordan.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
We're a couple dudes who like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Jordan.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Dan!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Jordan.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
We are also masters of crushing a bit after several weeks of practicing.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
But I don't like you drawing attention to it.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I know, but you did such a great job!

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, thanks.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
It was a perfect line read.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I don't appreciate positive feedback.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Fair enough.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, what do you appreciate, Dan? Because my question is, what is your bright spot this week?

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, my bright spot, Jordan, we talked about how we should probably inform the good people about this.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
And my bright spot is, after four and a half years, I've decided to take a vacation.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes, yep, yep. For the first time in a very long time.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
I mean, it's debatable. I guess I've taken a few days off here and there.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Indeed.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Staycations, if you will.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Sure, sure.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I went to visit my parents for a holiday.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Right.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Not quite a vacation.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Not quite.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
We went to Austin to do a live show.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Sure, that's definitely not a vacation. That's a work trip.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
We got to fucking write it off on our taxes, Dan. It was a work trip.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I don't really know how to relax. I'm not really good at that.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
But finally, we've decided to take a vacation.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Indeed.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So you and I and your partner are actually going together next week.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Of course.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
We will be going to Hawaii for a week.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Ah, visiting your homeland.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Exactly.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
A big part of this is I've been meaning to take a trip back to my childhood home.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Definitely.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
In Honolulu and see some of the sights, like Aliyolani Elementary School and go down to Waikiki Beach.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Oh, yeah.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
You know, kick around the old haunts.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh, yeah.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I didn't have any old haunts. I was a child.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
But I have a lot of sort of vague memories and snapshots in my head that I'd like to experience as an adult.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I like to try and fill in some of those gaps.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
And so I'm very excited to take this trip and hope I don't freak out from lack of working.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Nah, it's going to be great. It's going to be great.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
It's going to be great.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Sometimes you're going to stay in your hotel late at night by yourself staring up at the ceiling thinking,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
what if I were working right now? Wouldn't that be better?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I don't doubt that will be the case.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
But also this is relevant because the next three episodes we're going to have to prepare in advance.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Of course.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Of taking off for vacation.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
So hopefully the schedule of release won't be affected at all by it.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
But you'll notice that they will be maybe, hey, let's say something happens in the world.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
We may not be aware of it.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
We may not know because we're in the past.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Trump might rise back to power.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And be a real bummer.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And we will not know.

03:38.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't know. I think if anything super crazy happens, we'll probably break into a recording studio somewhere and be like,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
hey, we got to put out two hours now.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
It's an emergency.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
What if we had gone on vacation on like January 4th?

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
We'd have episodes coming out and we wouldn't be aware that the Capitol had been stormed.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Sure.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
It'd be very strange. That's what I'm saying.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
That would be strange.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
We're going to have to pre-record a few.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
And thank you in advance for that.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, indeed. Absolutely.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
How about you, Jordan? What's your bright spot?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
My bright spot, Dan, is at my partner's school.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
As you know, my partner is a teacher at school to be unnamed.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
But basically, their new principal started at the beginning of this year, or the school year.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
So last year.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
And she has proven herself to be a giant racist piece of shit.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Like really, really bad.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Good thing you're not naming this school.

04:34.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah, to the point where all of the BIPOC staff and students have essentially just gone on fucking revolt.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Wow.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
This shit is unsustainable.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
And so today, these kids organized a fucking sit-in and then later on a walkout.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And my partner sent me a little clip of it.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
And the BIPOC students leading this shit are absolutely astonishing.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
At a certain point, all these kids are chanting, protect our teachers, protect our teachers.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And I'm like weeping my balls off.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Like these kids are incredible.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Great.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Like truly incredible and that's my bright spot.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
That's very inspirational.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, absolutely.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Well, good on them.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
So Jordan, today we have an interesting situation to get into.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Because as I mentioned, we're going to be pre-recording some episodes.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
And that's going to make it more difficult to be in the present day keeping up with Alex.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Of course, of course.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
So it had been my plan to stay in the past, in 2003 probably, for those episodes.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Sure.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And so I didn't want to do a 2003 episode here today.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Right.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
And so I was like, all right, present day, let's see what Alex is going into.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Let's do this.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
Look, Alex has been on vacation.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Why don't we coordinate?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
He needs to let us know.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
We always have in the past.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
He needs to let us know.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Every time we're gone, he's gone.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
This is infuriating.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
I don't accept this whatsoever.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Owen Schroyer's been hosting all this week.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
And I, look, I understand that the situation with Israel-Palestine is a big deal.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I do understand that.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I don't care what Owen Schroyer has to say about it.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh, absolutely not.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
I'm interested in the Infowars position and exactly how this is a false flag and what have you.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
But I'm only going to take it from Alex.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
I'm not going to listen to an hour and a half Owen Schroyer to get a sense of it.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
I really don't need to hear Owen say what amounts to none of this is real.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
It's all Palestine actually attacking themselves.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
And even if Israel was committing genocide, I support that.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
That's what they would say.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
That's what he said.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I'm not interested in hearing any of that nonsense from Owen.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
But there is an update I need to give you about the present day.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Okay.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
There is a certain psy-op expert that's been subtly sneaking his way back onto the show.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Get the fuck out of here!

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
They cannot quit him!

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Alex has been out of town and he's been showing up with Owen.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah, so Steve Pachetic is creeping back and he's just flattering the shit out of Owen.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I watched their interview and he's like, oh, you're the best.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Of course.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
God damn it.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
These idiots can be tricked in the same way all the time.

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
I also noticed that when I was watching this interview, I noticed that Steve was reading a lot.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
He's clearly looking down at something.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
So when he's rattling off a lot of these details and stuff, a lot of it is probably prepared.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
I mean, I feel like somehow we're thinking of this as a negative thing.

07:38.000 --> 07:49.000
But being a guest and being by far more prepared than anything that your host has ever done seems like a positive to me.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I don't disagree and I support preparation.

07:51.000 --> 08:00.000
I just think that the way that Steve uses specifics and things like that is to create the impression of familiarity.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Sure.

08:01.000 --> 08:14.000
He creates the impression of familiarity with the staff of various administrations and stuff like that in a way that it would be kind of not as impressive that he knows people's names if it's on a sheet of paper in front of him.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
True.

08:15.000 --> 08:23.000
So that kind of preparation kind of cuts through what he's trying to use his appearance and the way he's trying to present himself.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
And rattling off details gives him the appearance of having a recall that is astonishing.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yes.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
How can one man possibly pull all of these things off his ass?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
How can he be making up all of this?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Exactly.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
And I don't know.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
There was an interesting thing too that for years Steve wouldn't appear on video.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
He would only be on the phone and there would be a picture of him from when he was much younger.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Sure.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
With a weird mustache.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, he should go back to that.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah, but I wonder if that was because back in those times he had a bunch of files in front of him and he didn't want to be on video.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
That's possible.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
I wonder about that and I never really thought about that because I never really watched too closely.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
But his eyes were definitely reading.

09:05.000 --> 09:14.000
I would also accept it wasn't until the pandemic that he insisted that some child in his neighborhood go set up Zoom for him so he can accurately...

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I don't know.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I know that his wife is on tech detail.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Oh, okay.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
If you do go to his YouTube channel you can see her pressing the start and stop buttons sometimes.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
That is very pretty and cute.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
It is.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Unfortunately.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It's unfortunately humanizing of a real weirdo.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Yes, it's infuriating.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
But it's very cute.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
So I guess what that leaves us with is possibly, I mean, I don't know.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
I don't know if Alex will be back in time for us to record anything in the present day before our trip.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Right.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
So we may be getting back to Alex in the present day when we get back.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
But it also put me in a bind of not really knowing exactly where to go for this episode.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
Luckily, I found something and we'll get to it after we say hello to some wonks.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Nice.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Nicely done.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
So first, Sheila B, the Garden Queen.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Thank you so much.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
You are now a policy wonk.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm a policy wonk.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Thanks, Sheila.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Thank you.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Next, Kimmy from Seattle.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
This is a shout out and a wonk title going to you.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I appreciate you getting round the world into the show.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm a policy wonk.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Thank you.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Thank you, Kimmy.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Next, Uncle Patches, CPA.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Thank you so much.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
You are now a policy wonk.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
I'm a policy wonk.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I'm a policy wonk.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Thanks, Uncle Patches.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Thank you.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Next, Branigan.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Thank you so much.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You are now a policy wonk.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I'm a policy wonk.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.380
Thank you very much.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.200
Next, Down With the Tyrant King Jared.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.200
Thank you so much.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
You are now a policy wonk.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.200
I'm a policy wonk.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.260
Thank you very much.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.260
Thank you.

10:38.260 --> 10:39.260
Next, Sasha.

10:39.260 --> 10:40.260
Thank you so much.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.260
You are now a policy wonk.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.260
I'm a policy wonk.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.260
Thanks, Sasha.

10:43.260 --> 10:44.260
Thank you.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.500
Next, near free advertising for God's eternal wrath.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
Thank you so much.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
You are now a policy wonk.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.580
I'm a policy wonk.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.340
Thank you very much.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.520
Et cetera.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.920
Now, Jordan.

10:52.920 --> 10:57.160
We had to do a little bit of business here and that is, you know, sometimes you gotta

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
take it on the chin.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
Sure, sure.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.680
Sometimes, you know, you just gotta take that punch as it comes.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.680
Naturally.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.040
You realize that you have messed up.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.220
Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.480
What is a plan but God laughing at you?

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
That's true.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.480
Or something?

11:10.480 --> 11:11.480
How does that work?

11:11.480 --> 11:12.480
God laughs at man that makes plans?

11:12.480 --> 11:14.100
No, man plans while God laughs.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.100
That's what it is.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
Yeah.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.100
You got it.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.100
So anyway.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.120
What a shitty God who's gonna laugh at anybody for planning.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.280
No, but it's like that, hahaha, oh, I love this guy so much.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.520
Isn't it cute that he's planning?

11:25.520 --> 11:27.920
Yeah, maybe give him a better plan.

11:27.920 --> 11:28.920
It's paternal.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.440
Don't laugh at him.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.200
That's laughing at a homeless person.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.600
God is laughing at a houseless person and it's fucking offensive.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
Let's do it.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.720
I'm offended by God.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.720
Let's take God's house.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.040
I think we should.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.760
Anyway, my point is that we have a couple of April birthdays.

11:44.760 --> 11:51.400
I might have missed a couple of April birthdays.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.920
Don't worry about it.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.520
So uh, Katie, happy birthday back in April.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
Happy birthday.

11:56.520 --> 12:01.320
This is from your husband, Nodbard, he wants to wish you a happy birthday, I hope you had

12:01.320 --> 12:02.320
a great birthday.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.320
I do too.

12:03.320 --> 12:08.260
Also I fucked up on this one, Tanya, happy birthday back in April.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.520
Happy birthday Tanya.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.560
That's totally on me, I need to do a better job of managing inboxes.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.360
Nah, you're doing great.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.240
Now, not all is trouble because we also have a presentation.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.840
Hey, see, there we go.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.720
This is coming from Savannah.

12:22.720 --> 12:28.480
Savannah wanted me to give a shout out to their spouse Shoshana and wish Shoshana a

12:28.480 --> 12:29.480
happy birthday.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.480
So happy birthday.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
Happy birthday Shoshana.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.880
Hope you're having a great one out there.

12:32.880 --> 12:33.880
Perfect.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.160
Now Jordan, we couldn't do the past.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.240
We couldn't do the present.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.240
No.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.400
We can do the middle past?

12:41.400 --> 12:45.840
I felt like that might be too confusing.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.120
We had to do a bottle episode.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.160
We gotta do a bottle episode.

12:49.160 --> 12:53.440
Jim Baker still bums me out, I can't quite go back to that well.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.800
Project Camelot, I think she got kicked off YouTube and now is back to a membership model

12:58.800 --> 13:01.320
and so I don't know about the ethics of using-

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
Once again.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.960
Yeah, I'm back to being on shaky ground.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.480
Sure, sure.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.040
And so that leaves us in a bit of a pickle.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.740
We need a bottle episode.

13:10.740 --> 13:11.740
Gotta do something.

13:11.740 --> 13:14.960
I was like, is there anything that I've been meaning to do-

13:14.960 --> 13:19.480
Review that bottle episode of Breaking Bad that everybody loves so much about the fly?

13:19.480 --> 13:20.480
Yeah.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.480
No.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.480
I have some thoughts.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.480
Okay.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.480
But no, that's not what we're doing here today.

13:24.480 --> 13:28.040
There is something that listeners have constantly been like, did you ever do that?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.040
And we hadn't.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
Oh.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
Welcome back my friends.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
The second hour of the broadcast.

13:32.040 --> 13:36.440
We're going to be joined by Noam Chomsky coming up here in just a couple minutes.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.440
Yeah, that's right.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.800
The Noam Chomsky interview.

13:39.800 --> 13:40.800
That's right.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.800
What are we doing?

13:41.800 --> 13:42.800
Yes.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
I feel so weird about this.

13:43.800 --> 13:50.040
In 2001, pre-9-11, Noam Chomsky appeared on InfoWars.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.040
Sure.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.460
The Alex Jones program.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.460
Noam Chomsky.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.220
The linguist.

13:55.220 --> 14:00.360
Not the very short, shows up in your house in the middle of the night, makes you cookies?

14:00.360 --> 14:01.360
Noam with a G.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.360
Yes.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
No.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
No.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
That is not-

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
Okay.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
It is not Gnome Chomsky.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360
All right.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.360
The noted intellectual.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.360
Okay.

14:11.360 --> 14:16.520
This actually is one of the more interesting interviews that I've ever heard on InfoWars.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.520
For a couple reasons.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.440
One, this is pre-9-11 Alex Jones.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.440
Sure.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.720
He doesn't have the cache of predicting 9-11 yet.

14:22.720 --> 14:29.220
I also think that he doesn't have nearly as much of the market share.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.520
He doesn't have as much notoriety.

14:31.520 --> 14:36.080
I don't think that people who might be invited to be on his show know much about him.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.080
True.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.360
So, you have that.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.840
I take it Gnome does not know that Alex is fighting the literal devil.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.320
I don't know if Alex knows that.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
We haven't established that.

14:47.320 --> 14:53.400
At what point he became aware that he was up against fields above.

14:53.400 --> 14:59.220
I think earliest days in his career, a lot of it was based around making big publicity

14:59.220 --> 15:02.960
stunts about trying to get the church, the Branch Davidians rebuilt.

15:02.960 --> 15:03.960
Sure.

15:03.960 --> 15:09.400
He had some notoriety on a regional basis from that, but if you look at the early parts

15:09.400 --> 15:16.560
of his career where he really hit the noss, as it were, in the fast and furious terms,

15:16.560 --> 15:19.620
that's got to be all around 9-11 conspiracies.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.680
This is before that.

15:21.680 --> 15:27.280
Also, another thing that's really weird is that they agree about a lot of stuff.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.280
Of course.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.200
Now, do they actually?

15:30.200 --> 15:32.120
No, of course they do.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.760
Alex and Gnome, best buds.

15:35.760 --> 15:44.220
They agree about a lot of the surface level of things, but when you get down to what their

15:44.220 --> 15:49.500
beliefs are based on, there's a little bit of difference, and this interview could have

15:49.500 --> 15:55.940
been amazing, and it could have been great, and it is not.

15:55.940 --> 15:57.880
It ends very poorly.

15:57.880 --> 15:58.880
Oh, no.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.400
Does it end in a fight?

16:02.400 --> 16:03.400
I'll let you decide.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.400
Okay.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.400
All right.

16:05.400 --> 16:14.080
So, Alex reads a little bit of a bio, and he's a professor of linguists, linguistics.

16:14.080 --> 16:19.720
And he's written books like Manufacturing, Consent, and Excellent Video, also titled

16:19.720 --> 16:26.680
Manufacturing Consent, and it goes into how they stage things, how they will have a supposed

16:26.680 --> 16:30.880
debate on television, but the people debating are actually on the same side.

16:30.880 --> 16:37.960
They're just debating the exact implementation by just a few degrees, giving you the psychological

16:37.960 --> 16:43.120
illusion there's really some type of difference, so that in your mind, you're going to fall

16:43.120 --> 16:50.360
in supposedly either phony camp being steered in the direction they wish.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.040
Now, that's how I put it.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.640
Chomsky does it in a little bit more sophisticated fashion.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.520
But they do this all the time.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.560
Manufacturing Consent is about the media, but it's not necessarily about staging events

17:03.560 --> 17:08.160
or false flags or that kind of stuff, the way Alex is kind of leading it and presenting

17:08.160 --> 17:09.160
that.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.560
The general thesis of Chomsky's book, largely co-written by Edward Herman, is that the media

17:13.560 --> 17:18.200
engages in self-censoring of ideas that are opposed to the interests of the elite corporations

17:18.200 --> 17:22.760
in such a way that encourages acceptance of the policies being put in place by the government,

17:22.760 --> 17:27.400
which support those interests, often to the detriment of what's in the interest of normal

17:27.400 --> 17:28.400
people.

17:28.400 --> 17:33.120
It's more complicated than even what I'm presenting, but that's a large part of what Chomsky and

17:33.120 --> 17:35.560
Herman called the propaganda model.

17:35.560 --> 17:40.600
It doesn't rely on coercion to operate, rather it's a product of just market forces.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.860
There's a structural conflict of interest in how the media is organized that creates

17:43.860 --> 17:47.300
a disconnect between conveying all of the information that's relevant to the interests

17:47.300 --> 17:51.060
of the upper upper classes and those of everyone else.

17:51.060 --> 17:56.200
This is the general 30,000 foot view of the manufacturing concept.

17:56.200 --> 18:01.340
Yeah, if the media were capable of reporting correctly they would be reporting every single

18:01.340 --> 18:05.760
day that we should do everything we can to destroy their billionaire owners, otherwise

18:05.760 --> 18:08.240
their entire journalism is pointless.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
Interesting.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
Yeah.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.640
I don't think I would be qualified to give a full breakdown of the ideas in that text,

18:12.640 --> 18:16.440
but I can tell you that I'm also certain that Alex has not read it.

18:16.440 --> 18:20.400
The propaganda model includes five filters, which are theorized as being determinative

18:20.400 --> 18:23.760
about whether certain news is represented in the larger media.

18:23.760 --> 18:27.840
The first four are ownership, funding, sources, and flak.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.760
Alex could probably find agreement on those four, but he absolutely could not accept the

18:31.760 --> 18:33.360
fifth, which is anti-communism.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.360
Oh!

18:34.360 --> 18:35.360
Boom!

18:35.360 --> 18:37.840
We got a strikeout!

18:37.840 --> 18:39.840
Somehow it's a one-pitch strikeout!

18:39.840 --> 18:42.040
Oh, difficult!

18:42.040 --> 18:45.160
Anti-communism was the preferred media fear outlet in the time that the book was first

18:45.160 --> 18:46.160
published.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.000
During the Cold War the mass- Never went out of style, buddy.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.600
Never went out of style!

18:51.600 --> 18:55.240
During the Cold War the mass media wasn't going to give a serious chance to an outlet

18:55.240 --> 18:59.720
that went at odds with the prevailing narrative, which was to be afraid of the commies.

18:59.720 --> 19:04.000
In more recent times Chomsky has recontextualized this filter to update it to the times, where

19:04.000 --> 19:08.400
the war on terror is more relevant as a media filter after 9-11 than anti-communism.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
Yeah, of course.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.280
Alex could probably agree that large portions of the media have the same opinion on big

19:13.280 --> 19:17.240
issues like the war on terror, and that possibly it was meant to scare people into accepting

19:17.240 --> 19:22.520
policies they wouldn't maybe otherwise, but he absolutely could never accept that anti-communist

19:22.520 --> 19:25.320
fervor during the Cold War was in any way part of that.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.320
Yeah, totally.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.320
His entire personality and worldview is based on that.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.040
Everything that is built is crumbled if you accept that.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.600
Yeah, so I think that's kind of interesting, because I think what happens is that Alex

19:35.600 --> 19:42.200
has a predetermined set of beliefs, and he's just decided that Chomsky backs those up.

19:42.200 --> 19:47.000
Yeah, or at least enough of them that he can make it look like he supports all of them.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Yes.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Yes.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.040
So Alex talks, before getting into the actual interview, more about his, this is 2001, so

19:57.040 --> 20:00.960
this is where he's at in terms of the similarities between the left and the right.

20:00.960 --> 20:01.960
They're the same.

20:01.960 --> 20:02.960
Sure.

20:02.960 --> 20:03.960
Democrat, Republican.

20:03.960 --> 20:04.960
Sure, sure, sure.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.120
And I would argue that this is an indication to me that it's always been very surface level.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.000
It's like Republican, Democrat, Liberal, Conservative.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.160
Liberals, Conservatives, you look at what they do at the top, they're all the same people.

20:16.160 --> 20:19.920
The political left has secret police that wear black uniforms and ski masks.

20:19.920 --> 20:24.320
The political right has police that wear black uniforms and ski masks around the world.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.320
They just have the police.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.960
Centralized government, and they tell you to be in the middle of that system.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.200
More semantical deceptions.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.960
I think what's strange here is that, like, I could hear somebody saying, like, the left

20:35.960 --> 20:38.320
and the right's the same, they all wear black ski masks.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.320
Sure.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.320
And it being a metaphor.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.320
Yeah.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.600
And from Alex, I don't think it is.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.600
No, it's absolutely direct.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
I think it's literal.

20:45.600 --> 20:52.440
If he does not believe that they actually have secret police, then I don't know what

20:52.440 --> 20:54.240
anything is real anymore.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.240
I don't know what's true or what's false.

20:57.240 --> 21:00.560
That man believes everyone has secret police and ski masks.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.520
He believes that, like, uh...

21:02.520 --> 21:05.120
That's my foundational belief system.

21:05.120 --> 21:11.960
He believes that small corporations even have SWAT teams and stuff at this point.

21:11.960 --> 21:12.960
Yeah, absolutely.

21:12.960 --> 21:13.960
It's very strange.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.600
I don't even want to know what army he thinks AT&T has.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
Huge.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.600
Yeah.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.520
So, yeah, I just...

21:22.520 --> 21:28.800
I come away from clips like that with a feeling that, like, I don't know how in-depth any

21:28.800 --> 21:33.440
of this assessment of, like, the similarities between left and right are.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.440
Sure.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.160
Because I do think you can make a decent argument that there are similarities.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.840
Obviously, there are entwined interests.

21:39.840 --> 21:46.200
There are similar priorities in some ways, but there are also huge fucking differences.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
Maybe.

21:47.200 --> 21:52.440
And I don't understand how Alex never really gives voice to those differences.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.440
Because the...

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
Or ignores them.

21:54.440 --> 22:00.920
Because the differences make it look like the people that he actually supports are bad.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.520
Oh, yeah, that's right.

22:03.520 --> 22:08.440
It is hard to be like, well, okay, there's one difference between Democrats and Republicans.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.000
Democrats do want people to eat food.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.520
I was kind of maybe being facetious when I said I don't know why.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.160
I realized that I didn't even know that I was being facetious.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.400
I was like, oh, I kind of get it.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.480
Anyway, here comes Chomsky into the debate.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.920
It's not a debate.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.160
Just a conversation.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.240
And they do have some agreement.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.960
And this is a little bit longer clip, but that's because Chomsky speaks in full sentences.

22:32.960 --> 22:33.960
Ooh, no.

22:33.960 --> 22:34.960
Dangerous.

22:34.960 --> 22:35.960
Dangerous.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.680
Alex lets him speak in full sentences?

22:37.680 --> 22:38.680
Oh, yeah.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.680
So this is a...

22:39.680 --> 22:41.240
This is where he learned his lesson right here.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.560
Two and a half minute clip here.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.560
Okay.

22:43.560 --> 22:48.920
I would call it almost a matrix-like system where 98% of people don't even know the real

22:48.920 --> 22:51.800
parameters of power that surround them.

22:51.800 --> 22:57.320
Phony paradigms and systems of phony left, right, with all the roads leading towards

22:57.320 --> 23:00.680
a centralized, highly controlled corporate bureaucracy.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.680
I agree with that.

23:01.680 --> 23:07.560
But I think the only thing I would add as a kind of a footnote is that the marginalization

23:07.560 --> 23:12.640
of the public that you're describing is quite purposeful and conscious, self-conscious.

23:12.640 --> 23:17.600
So especially through the 20th, actually it goes back to the founding of the country,

23:17.600 --> 23:23.480
but it's particularly in the 20th century, there has been a very self-conscious explicit

23:23.480 --> 23:24.480
effort.

23:24.480 --> 23:29.480
I mean, you don't have to make it, nothing speculative, because the leaders say so.

23:29.480 --> 23:34.960
Business leaders, intellectuals, academic social scientists and others say that it is

23:34.960 --> 23:39.600
important to keep the public out of things.

23:39.600 --> 23:46.880
It's important to ensure that the public remain what are called spectators, not participants.

23:46.880 --> 23:54.720
They're supposed to be directed to other concerns and not interfere with policy formation.

23:54.720 --> 24:00.720
That is a major phenomenon developed in the more democratic countries, in the United States

24:00.720 --> 24:04.880
and England particularly, through the 20th century.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.880
And the reason was very clear.

24:06.880 --> 24:13.440
By the early 20th century, it was becoming very difficult to control people by other

24:13.440 --> 24:15.440
means.

24:15.440 --> 24:22.040
The voting franchise was extending, labor unions were developing, women were demanding

24:22.040 --> 24:23.040
the vote.

24:23.040 --> 24:26.720
I mean, the countries, especially England and the United States, were simply becoming

24:26.720 --> 24:28.400
more democratic.

24:28.400 --> 24:35.360
And it was recognized early on that if you can't control people by worse or, you know,

24:35.360 --> 24:39.240
poverty or some other means, you are going to have to control them by what was quite

24:39.240 --> 24:41.600
openly called propaganda at the time.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.960
People don't like the term propaganda anymore, but that was used.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.760
That's where the US public relations is.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.440
It grows out of these experiences and this understanding and it is very explicit.

24:52.440 --> 24:58.560
Professor Chomsky, they developed, put out their papers that I've read from the Carnegie

24:58.560 --> 25:03.760
Endowment and others that mind control, behavioral modification is much cheaper and much more

25:03.760 --> 25:08.080
effective than tanks and guns.

25:08.080 --> 25:12.400
And it's the only thing you can do because in the more democratic countries, you can't

25:12.400 --> 25:14.080
control people with tanks and guns.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.200
I mean, maybe to some limited extent, but not very much.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.600
There's too much freedom.

25:18.600 --> 25:25.400
The one thing that I think is really key here is to notice where there is a salient agreement

25:25.400 --> 25:31.520
between the two and also the way that those two things are fully differently understood

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
by the two parties.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.520
Oh, absolutely.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.440
They are not talking about the same thing whatsoever.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.440
No.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.440
No.

25:37.440 --> 25:43.240
I think that there is, you know, what Chomsky is bringing to the table is ideas about wanting

25:43.240 --> 25:49.200
to keep people disengaged from some public discourse and some decisions that could be

25:49.200 --> 25:56.400
detrimental to elite corporations' interests and in so much as that is in their interest,

25:56.400 --> 26:03.680
then, you know, not having all information fully disseminated works to those goals.

26:03.680 --> 26:04.680
Right.

26:04.680 --> 26:09.880
Bannon didn't invent muddying the waters, you know, like propaganda, especially the

26:09.880 --> 26:13.560
United States propaganda has been rocking that boat for a long time.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.560
Sure.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.320
What is early roots of advertising other than that?

26:17.320 --> 26:18.440
Yeah, absolutely.

26:18.440 --> 26:22.000
What is social media influencers in our day?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.400
What are any kind of publicist?

26:25.400 --> 26:30.240
You know, like a lot of that stuff is just perception management.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.400
Your job is propaganda.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
Yeah.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.400
Yeah.

26:33.400 --> 26:38.520
And I think that there is a real conversation that can be had and I think that, you know,

26:38.520 --> 26:42.800
I obviously wouldn't necessarily take this tack, but someone could say that if literally

26:42.800 --> 26:48.800
everybody was engaged in decision-making about every issue, it would be impossible for a

26:48.800 --> 26:50.120
society to function.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.120
Sure.

26:51.120 --> 26:57.440
And maybe to a limit, there is an argument that could be made for, you know, people being

26:57.440 --> 27:02.600
disengaged is more productive, is actually a better organizational model.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
Sure.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.760
I'm not advocating that, but I could see someone making that point and I could see Chomsky

27:07.760 --> 27:09.800
having an interesting conversation with them.

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
Right.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.600
Alex, on the other hand, his beliefs veer so much into the vaccines are meant to make

27:15.600 --> 27:16.600
us dumb.

27:16.600 --> 27:22.880
They poison us in our food and all this, that even this point of agreement is a point of

27:22.880 --> 27:24.800
departure for the two of them.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.800
Yeah.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.880
And I find that very weird to look at.

27:29.880 --> 27:30.880
Yeah.

27:30.880 --> 27:39.080
And it does sound like Noam Chomsky is describing the phenomena of the government destroying

27:39.080 --> 27:44.260
the ability of the electorate to honestly engage with their actions.

27:44.260 --> 27:49.460
And Alex responded, so obviously you're talking about mind control.

27:49.460 --> 27:54.680
And I think that it, you know, I don't have a good enough glimpse of Alex at 2001, although

27:54.680 --> 28:01.040
based on, you know, the present day, I would guess that he means like someone putting a

28:01.040 --> 28:02.040
pendulum.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.040
No, he means mind control.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.600
He means legitimate mind control.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.480
You look into my spinning thing.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.480
Yeah, I think so.

28:09.480 --> 28:14.200
But I think that the way, you know, someone like his guest would interact with that is

28:14.200 --> 28:15.560
taking that as metaphor.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.560
Yeah.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.560
Yeah.

28:17.560 --> 28:22.300
If Alex was like, hey, so you're in agreement with me, they're putting computer chips inside

28:22.300 --> 28:26.560
everybody's brain to make them do what they tell them to and Noam would have gone, that

28:26.560 --> 28:28.680
is not what I'm saying at all.

28:28.680 --> 28:32.060
But I don't know if that's what Alex is saying back at this point.

28:32.060 --> 28:37.080
That's one of the parts that is kind of challenging about this is you can hear that from Alex

28:37.080 --> 28:43.860
even as metaphor, as flourish of speaking, as opposed to it being like, I have you under

28:43.860 --> 28:46.840
my control, lift your right arm.

28:46.840 --> 28:47.840
Right.

28:47.840 --> 28:55.720
And that, that does kind of point out one big issue though, is that all too often we

28:55.720 --> 28:58.320
just assume people are capable of metaphor.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.600
Well, it's interesting that he's talking to a linguist.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
Yeah.

29:02.600 --> 29:07.360
This is borderline the Turing test.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.400
That's what's going on.

29:09.400 --> 29:16.400
It's borderline Alex trying to fool a computer into thinking he's human.

29:16.400 --> 29:24.080
Chomsky is shockingly charitable with Alex and I think it's to his credit in hindsight.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.080
He's a good interviewee.

29:26.080 --> 29:31.160
So Alex talks about how Bush and Clinton, this is going to have to be, yeah, I guess

29:31.160 --> 29:35.640
it would be George W. Bush because he just got elected at this point.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.600
And Clinton had just been given the boot.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
Yeah.

29:38.600 --> 29:46.840
So Alex talks about how they're the same based on a very specific set of axes.

29:46.840 --> 29:51.680
Well take Bush and Clinton, they have the exact same policies on land grabbing, selling

29:51.680 --> 29:59.260
out sovereignty, deindustrialization, drugging the children, but you asked the average person,

29:59.260 --> 30:03.880
they have this, this, this cult-like following of their parties and can't admit it's really

30:03.880 --> 30:08.600
the same, what I call the same, it's really two corporate management teams bidding for

30:08.600 --> 30:11.680
control of the CEO job of the new world order.

30:11.680 --> 30:16.360
Well, I, maybe I'm naive, but I have more faith in the public than that.

30:16.360 --> 30:21.360
My feeling is that the general public is rather well aware of this and I think it shows up

30:21.360 --> 30:27.880
in the, there are, you know, there's a lot of public opinion study in the United States,

30:27.880 --> 30:31.360
mainly because business wants to keep its finger on the public pulse.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.440
They want to know what people are thinking.

30:33.440 --> 30:39.200
So we have a pretty trustworthy and very extensive polling industry.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.840
And what comes out of public attitudes, I think is kind of revealing though for the

30:42.840 --> 30:49.960
last 20 years or so, about 80% of the population, when they're asked, what do you think the

30:49.960 --> 30:54.000
country, you know, who runs the government or what does it do?

30:54.000 --> 30:58.880
The answer that they pick out of a set of choices is the government works for the few

30:58.880 --> 31:01.640
and the special interests, not the people.

31:01.640 --> 31:07.000
So Chomsky is coming at this with the perspective of like, all right, a lot of people are aware

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
of this.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Yeah.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.240
There's a different problem that needs to be addressed.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.160
And that'll come up a little bit later in the interview.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.160
Right.

31:16.160 --> 31:22.520
But Alex, his selected criteria upon which Clinton and Bush are the same is weird to

31:22.520 --> 31:23.840
me.

31:23.840 --> 31:28.360
It's very suspiciously specific.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.800
And unfairly articulated.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.600
No, no, no, no, no.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.600
They're both land grabbers.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.040
They both eat children and then they move on and the, wait, what, hold on.

31:40.040 --> 31:44.760
Did you say land grabbing, I assume is code for conservation.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.320
Either that or eminent domain.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.320
Yeah, that could be at this point too.

31:48.320 --> 31:52.080
At that point, I bet eminent domain was huge on Alex's mind.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.680
Yeah, that could be.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.680
That could be.

31:54.680 --> 32:01.080
And also, I don't know if Bush's early record with EPA stuff was necessarily all that good.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.080
Oh, not good.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.080
Not good.

32:03.080 --> 32:08.440
Drugging the children is the one that's like, okay, you're just talking about like, psychiatric

32:08.440 --> 32:09.440
meds or something?

32:09.440 --> 32:10.440
Yeah, absolutely.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.600
You're talking about Ritalin?

32:11.600 --> 32:15.000
I heard him talking about Ritalin because that was a huge-

32:15.000 --> 32:17.920
But it's not like Bush is putting people on Ritalin.

32:17.920 --> 32:22.320
No, Bush was cramming Ritalin down everybody's throats.

32:22.320 --> 32:28.680
You forgot the No Child Left Behind was, the parentheses was with Ritalin.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.320
I mean, obviously, I think that there's overprescription of meds.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.240
We've talked about that in the past.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.240
Sure.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.960
I just don't know exactly what he expects Clinton or Bush to do about it.

32:38.960 --> 32:44.680
Does he want to make it illegal to take the, like, I thought he's for drug legalization.

32:44.680 --> 32:49.080
Does he want more regulation on pharmaceutical industries?

32:49.080 --> 32:52.760
I think he wants you to go the exact opposite direction.

32:52.760 --> 32:58.320
If you're going to get your ADHD meds, you should go to the corner like everybody else

32:58.320 --> 32:59.560
does with their drugs.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.520
I think that's what he's trying to say.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.440
If it's not on the corner, it's not drugs, buddy.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.960
Every other night I go down, I get a fifth of whiskey on the corner.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
Absolutely.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.840
I know a guy, he's got a well-stocked coat.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.880
Where else do you think I get my Lamictal, Dan?

33:13.880 --> 33:17.240
I go down the street, guy opens his trench coat.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.240
Yeah.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.240
It's bizarre.

33:19.240 --> 33:26.080
And again, I think that really illustrates the sort of surface level and cherry-picked

33:26.080 --> 33:29.680
way in which Alex describes the similarity between the two.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:30.680 --> 33:31.680
Absolutely.

33:31.680 --> 33:39.120
And I think I largely agree with Chomsky's analysis that this isn't, like, groundbreaking

33:39.120 --> 33:40.120
stuff.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.120
Yeah.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.480
The idea that people have an alienation from power.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.000
Sure, sure.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Absolutely.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.080
A random person on the street, you think it's the government or our corporate overlords?

33:53.080 --> 33:57.080
And they'll be like, ah, I'm going to go with corporate overlords.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.960
Not surprising to anyone.

33:59.960 --> 34:06.400
So there's a shift in propaganda that Alex has been feeling over the last few years.

34:06.400 --> 34:13.560
And this is weird to hear in 2001, because he says this in much later years, too, that

34:13.560 --> 34:16.960
there's been a shift recently in the last few years.

34:16.960 --> 34:21.520
And that has been from keeping things secret about the globalists to throwing it in your

34:21.520 --> 34:22.520
face.

34:22.520 --> 34:23.520
Ooh.

34:23.520 --> 34:29.040
And Chomsky has brought up the idea of hopelessness, and that hopelessness is a response that people

34:29.040 --> 34:33.240
can have to the idea that the government isn't necessarily serving their interests.

34:33.240 --> 34:34.240
Sure.

34:34.240 --> 34:38.960
And that is a larger problem than actually some of the other things that Alex might bring

34:38.960 --> 34:39.960
up.

34:39.960 --> 34:40.960
Helplessness leads to hopelessness.

34:40.960 --> 34:41.960
Not hard.

34:41.960 --> 34:42.960
Sure.

34:42.960 --> 34:49.760
And Alex is suggesting that this shift in propaganda from hiding the globalists to throwing

34:49.760 --> 34:53.080
it in your face is a way of facilitating this hopelessness.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.080
There we go.

34:54.080 --> 34:57.000
And Chomsky does not go in for that.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.080
I've seen a shift in the propaganda in the last three years from denying all of this

35:01.080 --> 35:04.800
to throwing it in our face.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.320
Could be, but I think my own feeling is the roots go back farther.

35:08.320 --> 35:12.880
If you go back again to the better, you know, the early part of the 20s, like 1920s approximately,

35:12.880 --> 35:15.040
that's when this really takes off.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.040
Madison Avenue?

35:16.040 --> 35:20.800
Yeah, that's when the public relations industry really exploded.

35:20.800 --> 35:28.200
And it grew on the basis of the very sensible assumption that was pretty clearly articulated

35:28.200 --> 35:34.600
that we have to somehow make sure that the general public does not make use of the democratic

35:34.600 --> 35:41.000
opportunities that are available to them and leaves us to run the place as we've been doing.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.160
And the way to do it was you read a business leaders are saying, look, we have to induce

35:47.160 --> 35:51.240
what's called a philosophy of futility, actually use the phrase.

35:51.240 --> 35:58.600
We have to kind of direct people to superficial things like fashionable consumption.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.600
We have to regiment.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.800
Yeah, it's something, anything that doesn't bother us.

36:01.800 --> 36:02.800
Bread and circus.

36:02.800 --> 36:03.800
Yeah.

36:03.800 --> 36:04.800
It's just anything like that.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.800
I mean, that's true of leading intellectuals.

36:05.800 --> 36:12.360
I mean, takes a Walter Lippmann, who is the leading figure in the U.S. elite media in

36:12.360 --> 36:17.920
the 20th century, major public intellectual, he's the one who invented the phrase manufacturer

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
of consent.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.280
We borrowed it from him and he thought it was necessary.

36:22.280 --> 36:29.400
It's necessary to manufacture consent in order to make sure that we, what he called the responsible

36:29.400 --> 36:34.200
men can run the affairs of the world without being bothered.

36:34.200 --> 36:38.120
And what he didn't say, but what is crucial is your point.

36:38.120 --> 36:43.200
The people, you become a responsible man if you're serving the interests of concentrated

36:43.200 --> 36:45.560
private power, otherwise you're not.

36:45.560 --> 36:53.840
So when Chomsky is talking about a position and an idea, he's able to bring up the people

36:53.840 --> 36:58.200
who are the proponents of the opposite of his idea there.

36:58.200 --> 37:03.480
He's able to engage with this in a much more thorough way, even in a matter of a minute

37:03.480 --> 37:07.880
than Alex is ever able to deal with any issue.

37:07.880 --> 37:15.000
Yeah, it's very strange to hear somebody talk on this show and then be like, wow, really

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
smart.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Really smart stuff.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
That's a full thought.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Good work, man.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Good work.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.380
Somebody should make you famous.

37:25.380 --> 37:28.680
I don't even know what to respond with.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.600
It's just like, there's an interesting conversation that you could have with Chomsky about these

37:32.600 --> 37:33.600
issues.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.520
Yeah, I would like to talk to Noam Chomsky.

37:36.520 --> 37:45.200
I feel like that's what I'm learning from all of this is that somehow Alex fucking Jones

37:45.200 --> 37:50.680
gets to talk to Noam Chomsky and he doesn't get to listen to me shit-talk him while he's

37:50.680 --> 37:53.480
explaining the world to me.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.800
Well, and that is, life is unfair sometimes.

37:56.800 --> 37:57.800
It is unfair.

37:57.800 --> 37:58.800
It is.

37:58.800 --> 38:04.640
Yeah, this is one of the things that makes this kind of difficult to really even engage

38:04.640 --> 38:12.480
with too deeply as content from my end is that, yeah, I think I can see what Chomsky

38:12.480 --> 38:13.480
is saying.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.960
He's articulating positions clearly.

38:15.960 --> 38:20.640
I think rebutting things would, you know, there's some stuff that I maybe don't entirely

38:20.640 --> 38:28.640
agree with, but you know, it would be a matter of teasing out points to really get to the

38:28.640 --> 38:39.920
bottom of like, okay, well, you know, yes, there is an interest in media, in having people

38:39.920 --> 38:41.880
consumed with superficial things.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.880
Sure, of course.

38:43.880 --> 38:51.400
How much of that is intentional strategy driven by people who want people to be distracted

38:51.400 --> 38:57.960
from larger issues, and how much of that is actively, that is what people want, and there

38:57.960 --> 39:03.360
is a market for that, and you know, people are filling that market.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.240
What is the balance between the two?

39:05.240 --> 39:09.680
Yeah, I mean, it would be hard to argue that the best example of that very thing would

39:09.680 --> 39:11.280
be Trump's tweets.

39:11.280 --> 39:18.640
Like by constantly covering Trump's tweets, they almost ensured he would at least have

39:18.640 --> 39:21.360
a run, have a shot at becoming president.

39:21.360 --> 39:29.160
At the same time, if the public weren't so consumed and so interested with discovering

39:29.160 --> 39:34.520
more and more about his dumb fuck tweets, then they wouldn't be covering it, you know?

39:34.520 --> 39:43.440
Yeah, and to this question, particularly about what he's bringing up about the media and

39:43.440 --> 39:48.460
what Alex Yell's bread and circuses with, is there is a supply component and there's

39:48.460 --> 39:55.960
a demand component, and to ignore either I think is not the full picture, and I don't

39:55.960 --> 40:02.580
think that Chomsky's ignoring the demand picture, it's just not part of this conversation, and

40:02.580 --> 40:09.200
that would be the kind of way I would approach this, and I just, he makes points, and here

40:09.200 --> 40:10.200
are the points.

40:10.200 --> 40:16.240
See now, the problem Alex is, is he had a perfect opportunity to cut into Noam Chomsky

40:16.240 --> 40:23.280
and be like, actually, I think it goes further back than that to Rome with bread and circuses,

40:23.280 --> 40:24.280
Mr. Chomsky!

40:24.280 --> 40:28.440
You're not smart enough to figure out the echo on your phone, now are you?

40:28.440 --> 40:34.720
Or hey, Noam, could I tell you about Adam Weisshop and the Bavarian Illuminati?

40:34.720 --> 40:45.240
I'd like to tell you some fucked up ideas I have about the Illuminati, I don't know.

40:45.240 --> 40:53.640
Anyway, I think that Noam Chomsky is able to make points, and so it's a foreign concept

40:53.640 --> 40:54.640
on InfoWars.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.640
Sure, no, it's confusing.

40:55.640 --> 41:02.280
But he brings up the difference of opinion between the sort of elite corporations and

41:02.280 --> 41:07.560
the normal person who has a job, perhaps, in terms of free trade agreements.

41:07.560 --> 41:13.360
One of the major issues for the public, look at Bowles and it's understandable, are these

41:13.360 --> 41:17.280
international economic agreements, the things that are called free trade agreements.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.920
So that's not what they are.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.200
Those are very big issues for the public.

41:21.200 --> 41:27.080
People are very much worried about the trade deficit, because they know that's their job.

41:27.080 --> 41:31.400
China has a 40% tariff on us, we have a 2% on them.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.240
They call that free trade, you're not an isolationist, are you?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.240
No, I'm not.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.240
But this stuff is not even free trade.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.240
No, but that's what they say.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.240
That's what they say.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.240
Right, of course.

41:39.240 --> 41:45.720
Now, the point I'm trying to make is this, these are very big issues for the population.

41:45.720 --> 41:49.360
They're also big issues for the business world, but the population and the business world

41:49.360 --> 41:51.480
happens to be on opposite sides.

41:51.480 --> 41:55.240
Therefore, the issues do not arise in political campaigns.

41:55.240 --> 42:01.400
So like, for example, the free trade area of the Americas, which is an enormous agreement,

42:01.400 --> 42:03.980
very little, a lot of consequences.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.080
That has yet to be discussed in the media.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.800
It's been negotiated for three years.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.840
It finally broke through at the helmet of the Americas meeting in Quebec, there was

42:11.840 --> 42:15.040
such a furor over it, it had to be mentioned.

42:15.040 --> 42:21.840
But it's been under negotiation for a couple of years by corporate managers, by trade ministers

42:21.840 --> 42:24.840
of governments who are basically corporate representatives.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.280
The media know all about it, but they don't want the public to know.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.240
It did not come up in the political campaigns.

42:31.240 --> 42:35.120
The nature of these arrangements has yet to be made public.

42:35.120 --> 42:39.720
I mean, you can sort of figure it out if you do a research project, but these things are

42:39.720 --> 42:43.520
not made available to the public, and it's for a very clear reason.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.640
Our final segment with the professor with solutions coming up.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.440
So things still seem to be going fairly well between them.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.440
Yeah.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.040
This is stuff that Alex can get on board with.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.040
Totally.

42:53.040 --> 42:59.980
Now, maybe Alex would view this as the consequence of an elaborate shady conspiracy to put this

42:59.980 --> 43:03.360
trade deal in in order to enslave white men.

43:03.360 --> 43:04.360
Sure.

43:04.360 --> 43:11.320
Whereas Chomsky would look at it more as the result of business interests, those filters

43:11.320 --> 43:19.280
that are brought up in the propaganda model, things like ownership of conglomerates, the

43:19.280 --> 43:27.120
sources of news, the advertising revenues, things like that create a market environment

43:27.120 --> 43:34.240
where it's not in the best interest of the people who may profit from one of these arrangements

43:34.240 --> 43:35.960
to cover it too much.

43:35.960 --> 43:36.960
Right.

43:36.960 --> 43:41.560
If it's something that could be something that would be very unpopular with the normal

43:41.560 --> 43:42.560
voting public.

43:42.560 --> 43:43.560
Sure.

43:43.560 --> 43:50.200
One thing I am absolutely seeing that is mitigating what I would think is so much disagreement

43:50.200 --> 43:57.040
is that Chomsky is elucidating the conspiracies that are real that we all know about.

43:57.040 --> 44:02.600
You know, like we all know that billionaires and the government work together to fuck us

44:02.600 --> 44:03.600
over.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.360
That's a normal conspiracy.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.360
That's what they do.

44:06.360 --> 44:09.000
And it's not even like it's not even like their fault.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.720
They're just creations of the system that is propping them up.

44:12.720 --> 44:17.040
And then they continue to, you know, they do that whole thing.

44:17.040 --> 44:23.080
But since he's framing it in that conspiratorial, like these business interests and the government

44:23.080 --> 44:29.600
are all working together to fuck us over, that can be viewed by Alex in the same way

44:29.600 --> 44:33.720
that the metaphor could be viewed by Noam Chomsky.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.920
It's like, oh, you're absolutely right.

44:35.920 --> 44:41.960
There is a conspiracy of the Rothschilds and the government to fuck us over with NAFTA.

44:41.960 --> 44:42.960
Yeah.

44:42.960 --> 44:49.200
There's enough leeway to this that Alex can still find it useful.

44:49.200 --> 44:54.140
And the audience can still read into it what they want to read into it that fits the sort

44:54.140 --> 44:58.600
of Infowars narrative structure.

44:58.600 --> 45:05.400
Whereas it does not necessarily and it's a lot more boring than the way that Alex would

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
put it.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.400
Yeah.

45:07.400 --> 45:15.400
But man, you can absolutely see it like in 2001 that that level of like because the government

45:15.400 --> 45:20.760
is so fucking corrupt and because Alex isn't outright saying he's fighting the devil.

45:20.760 --> 45:25.000
You can go on an Infowars show and say the government's fucking corrupt.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.360
And Alex is like, yeah, the government's fucking corrupt and everybody goes, yeah, the government's

45:29.360 --> 45:30.360
fucking corrupt.

45:30.360 --> 45:33.460
And then 20 years later, you're like, let's overthrow the government.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.640
And it's like, oh, no, wrong.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.040
Because they're working for the devil.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.040
Exactly.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.040
No bill.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.040
You messed up, guys.

45:40.040 --> 45:41.040
Shit.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.040
Yeah.

45:42.040 --> 45:48.000
And I think that this is in that real sweet spot of pre 9-11, but post 2000 election,

45:48.000 --> 45:53.160
where there is so much chaos and alienation in people.

45:53.160 --> 45:59.240
The result of the 2000 election was such a awful...

45:59.240 --> 46:02.720
I mean, it was literally stolen.

46:02.720 --> 46:08.040
It was a moment where scales fell from people's eyes in a lot of ways.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.040
Yeah.

46:09.040 --> 46:11.120
Across the aisle, perhaps, even.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.160
You can't think of...

46:12.160 --> 46:15.160
This is the way that our process is going through.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.480
This doesn't feel right.

46:16.480 --> 46:24.760
Are you telling me that our process has been derailed by Republican aides, fake dressing

46:24.760 --> 46:26.480
up as business people to get rid of...

46:26.480 --> 46:28.680
Wait, are you talking about Roger Stone?

46:28.680 --> 46:29.680
What are we doing?

46:29.680 --> 46:30.680
Is this our government?

46:30.680 --> 46:32.680
Is this how it works?

46:32.680 --> 46:33.680
Yeah.

46:33.680 --> 46:41.960
And you had that period before 9-11 where people were all over the map in terms of their

46:41.960 --> 46:44.360
beliefs about the administration.

46:44.360 --> 46:45.360
Totally.

46:45.360 --> 46:51.000
And I think that people galvanized a lot after 9-11 due to coming together after a national

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
tragedy.

46:52.000 --> 47:00.600
But this exists in that space before that, where there's a lot of fertile ground for

47:00.600 --> 47:06.200
Alex to take advantage of in political disillusionment.

47:06.200 --> 47:13.040
And so I think that Noam, unfortunately, but I don't know, I don't think he knows too much

47:13.040 --> 47:19.520
about Alex and just thinks that he is kind of like an alternative news guy.

47:19.520 --> 47:26.480
And he says things like, you know, outlets like yours are important to...

47:26.480 --> 47:31.880
But I think that that is a perception that even I certainly had more of a feeling of

47:31.880 --> 47:32.880
four years ago.

47:32.880 --> 47:33.880
Sure, totally.

47:33.880 --> 47:42.560
Because there is a reality that people who are outside of the structures of advertising,

47:42.560 --> 47:43.880
those voices are important.

47:43.880 --> 47:50.600
And sometimes there is value in somebody who's, you know, maybe wrong sometimes, but willing

47:50.600 --> 47:51.600
to take a chance.

47:51.600 --> 47:52.600
Totally.

47:52.600 --> 47:56.400
I think those voices are valuable in the broad spectrum of media.

47:56.400 --> 47:57.400
Totally.

47:57.400 --> 48:04.680
I mean, to Chomsky's earlier point, like, if you recall the media immediately following

48:04.680 --> 48:10.220
that stolen election, like, they quickly were like, hey, you know what, we need to unite

48:10.220 --> 48:13.120
around our president and we need the country to come together.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.840
At no point in time were they like, hey, we can't have a stolen election.

48:16.840 --> 48:19.040
Like that just can't be a thing.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.040
Yeah.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.040
Yeah.

48:21.040 --> 48:24.840
And I guess that opens up another conversation of like, what would it have looked like if

48:24.840 --> 48:27.040
the media had called out the election?

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
I don't know.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.200
I don't know.

48:29.200 --> 48:36.640
But leaving that aside, I think that Chomsky has a similar tack to, you know, what I had

48:36.640 --> 48:39.720
perhaps before I knew as much about Alex as I do.

48:39.720 --> 48:43.000
And I think a lot of people, if they don't know all that much about him, which is just

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
like, you're a guy who's on the outside.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
You're a fringe guy.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Sure.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.960
You broke into Bohemian Grove or whatever.

48:50.960 --> 48:55.720
Maybe I don't agree with you, but there's value in you existing in the media landscape.

48:55.720 --> 48:57.480
And I don't agree with that now.

48:57.480 --> 48:58.480
Disagree.

48:58.480 --> 49:02.200
But you can kind of see that in the way that he's engaging with him.

49:02.200 --> 49:05.860
Radio can be a very important, I mean, it's an extremely important instrument.

49:05.860 --> 49:11.120
There can be real involvement of interchange and that can be a highly important educational

49:11.120 --> 49:12.120
instrument.

49:12.120 --> 49:13.120
And there are others.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.120
I mean.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.120
So it's not just sound bites.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.120
People have to actually espouse ideas.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.760
You know, these are not trivial issues.

49:17.760 --> 49:23.160
You have to really think them through the thing that I mentioned, for example, the international

49:23.160 --> 49:24.160
economic agreements.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.560
You have to think about them, you have to learn about them.

49:26.560 --> 49:30.200
You can't just listen to a slogan and say, OK, that's what I think.

49:30.200 --> 49:35.120
Well, these are unelected, unaccountable international boards controlled by the top 20 corporations

49:35.120 --> 49:36.880
and banks telling us they're going to run our lives.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.680
I mean, that's a horrible idea, but most Americans don't know that.

49:39.680 --> 49:44.240
That's essentially Alex responding to Noam Chomsky saying you can't use sound bites and

49:44.240 --> 49:45.240
catchphrases.

49:45.240 --> 49:46.240
With a sound bite.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.240
More or less.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.240
And a catchphrase.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.240
Yeah.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.240
Ah, man.

49:50.240 --> 49:56.040
So you're telling me that Noam Chomsky told Alex Jones that he's important and Noam Chomsky

49:56.040 --> 49:58.120
won't even talk to me.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.240
That's just bullshit.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.240
It's just bullshit.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
It's unfair.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.920
Noam Chomsky, I'm calling you out.

50:03.920 --> 50:09.360
But again, again, if you don't know that much about Alex, you don't actually listen to his

50:09.360 --> 50:10.360
show.

50:10.360 --> 50:14.760
And like I said, I don't know too much about exactly what he was like in 2001.

50:14.760 --> 50:18.100
But you see this in other eras of his career, too.

50:18.100 --> 50:24.080
If you don't know all that much about him, you could get the sense that like, yeah, you're

50:24.080 --> 50:27.080
not just doing sound bites.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.320
You are getting into the issues.

50:28.320 --> 50:30.280
And that is a value of radio.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.000
I do agree with Chomsky on that.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Absolutely.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.680
But not Alex so much.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.680
No.

50:35.680 --> 50:36.680
Absolutely not.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.120
The two of them get along pretty well.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.880
They both seem to hate consumerism.

50:40.880 --> 50:46.760
Well, that's like these $150 Nike tennis shoes that are so ugly I wouldn't touch them if

50:46.760 --> 50:48.360
they were free.

50:48.360 --> 50:51.680
But the young people are just begging and have to have them or they're not human.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.680
Yeah.

50:52.680 --> 50:57.480
And if you watch, I mean, I sometimes watch this television with my grandchildren.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.640
What they are subjected to is criminal.

50:59.640 --> 51:06.800
I mean, they're barraged by propaganda, teaching them from infancy that the only thing in life

51:06.800 --> 51:12.640
is getting those tennis shoes or those Pokemon cards or whatever it may be.

51:12.640 --> 51:18.080
And that is really a way to control people in a very ugly fashion.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.240
People have to learn how to escape from that.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.720
It's a hard struggle.

51:21.720 --> 51:22.720
Yeah.

51:22.720 --> 51:23.720
Yeah.

51:23.720 --> 51:25.920
Consumerism is a toxic influence.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.440
And I don't know what's the answer to it.

51:28.440 --> 51:29.760
It's an individual process.

51:29.760 --> 51:30.760
Sure.

51:30.760 --> 51:31.760
Right?

51:31.760 --> 51:33.600
I mean, it can't be like outlawing advertising.

51:33.600 --> 51:36.920
No, that probably won't work.

51:36.920 --> 51:44.080
I would say one solution would obviously be to scorch the skies and have an AI keep us

51:44.080 --> 51:46.280
inside of egg sacks.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.760
That would be one solution.

51:47.760 --> 51:48.760
Certainly.

51:48.760 --> 51:49.760
Yeah.

51:49.760 --> 51:52.440
Although even then the AI has propaganda inside of it.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.800
So, man, you're never going to escape.

51:54.800 --> 51:55.800
No.

51:55.800 --> 52:01.120
I think the only way that this is productive as a conversation is addressing it as an individualistic

52:01.120 --> 52:06.360
pursuit of recognizing when those kinds of advertising tricks are being used.

52:06.360 --> 52:07.360
Right.

52:07.360 --> 52:12.120
And being like, yeah, I don't actually want that as much as they are saying I want it.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.120
Or maybe I do.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.120
Sure.

52:14.120 --> 52:19.760
You know, like advertising, I think that sometimes is dumb, but I actually do want what's being

52:19.760 --> 52:20.760
sold.

52:20.760 --> 52:21.760
Sure.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.440
I don't like Taco Bell commercials, but I do want Taco Bell.

52:24.440 --> 52:30.080
I just, all I want is, like, I'm so stoked when I find out something exists that I didn't

52:30.080 --> 52:31.080
know exists.

52:31.080 --> 52:35.920
Like if all commercials were just like, hey, you need to wash your clothes, Tide.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.520
I'd be like, holy shit, I didn't know Tide was out there.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.760
Yes, you did.

52:39.760 --> 52:40.760
That's not the point.

52:40.760 --> 52:41.760
That's not the point.

52:41.760 --> 52:42.760
Sure.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.200
I mean, that experience was exactly what I had at the beginning of April when I saw the

52:45.200 --> 52:46.600
commercial for Mortal Kombat.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.600
Yeah, exactly.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.600
It's like, what?

52:48.600 --> 52:49.960
Okay, then we'll watch Mortal Kombat.

52:49.960 --> 52:51.640
I don't give a shit about your commercial.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.600
The commercial is not going to convince me one way or another.

52:53.600 --> 52:54.600
You're informing me this exists.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.600
Just tell me.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.600
That's all I needed to know.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
Yeah.

52:57.600 --> 53:03.320
But I think that people can do that.

53:03.320 --> 53:08.360
They're very capable of doing that, and I think that that is what the message that Chomsky's

53:08.360 --> 53:15.400
bringing in many ways is, is thinking, is recognizing and being able to work around

53:15.400 --> 53:19.040
these things because you can't really stop them.

53:19.040 --> 53:23.280
And the fact that you can't stop them is what feeds into helplessness.

53:23.280 --> 53:25.680
You can't get rid of advertising.

53:25.680 --> 53:29.200
You're not going to get rid of public relations firms.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.200
Sure.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.200
That isn't going to happen.

53:31.200 --> 53:35.960
Because, I mean, even think about it just from a structural, actual perspective.

53:35.960 --> 53:38.260
How would that happen?

53:38.260 --> 53:39.400
How could you do that?

53:39.400 --> 53:42.840
You couldn't legislate away those kinds of...

53:42.840 --> 53:44.000
I just don't know.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
It would be impossible.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Oh, ooh.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.840
Turn all the electricity off.

53:47.840 --> 53:48.840
Sure.

53:48.840 --> 53:50.120
Then people would just make pamphlets again.

53:50.120 --> 53:54.680
Ah, they couldn't do it without electricity to run their printers.

53:54.680 --> 53:58.040
No, they'd just go back to the old cha-chunk.

53:58.040 --> 53:59.040
Get rid of presses.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.840
Get rid of ink.

54:00.840 --> 54:01.840
Get rid of ink!

54:01.840 --> 54:03.240
Wow, you're good.

54:03.240 --> 54:13.080
So I think that the path away from helplessness that I'm hearing is self-motivated, self-driven,

54:13.080 --> 54:17.960
and the ways that intellectuals and public speakers can be of help is helping people

54:17.960 --> 54:24.960
recognize that it is a path out of this conundrum as opposed to, and sure, there's institutional

54:24.960 --> 54:28.720
things you can do, like perhaps break up large media entities.

54:28.720 --> 54:29.720
Sure.

54:29.720 --> 54:35.680
Certainly there's organization and things you can do on that front, but the idea of

54:35.680 --> 54:41.360
getting rid of the influence that is this negative consumerism is not likely.

54:41.360 --> 54:45.680
No, that is, yeah, it's not going back in the box, Pandora.

54:45.680 --> 54:46.680
No.

54:46.680 --> 54:47.680
Yeah.

54:47.680 --> 54:48.680
Yeah.

54:48.680 --> 54:49.680
This clip was really weird.

54:49.680 --> 54:53.240
I don't understand exactly what Alex is saying, but I have some thoughts on it.

54:53.240 --> 54:56.880
Take, say, these trade agreements that are coming along.

54:56.880 --> 55:02.800
One crucial part of them is to take what are called services and hand them over to private

55:02.800 --> 55:03.800
power.

55:03.800 --> 55:08.000
Well, services are just about anything that people would care about.

55:08.000 --> 55:16.640
You know, health, education, water, excuse me, I don't like anything that would be in

55:16.640 --> 55:22.120
the arena, in the public arena where people would not want to make decisions that has

55:22.120 --> 55:27.000
to be taken out of the public arena, put into private hands, unaccountable private hands,

55:27.000 --> 55:31.820
and then, you know, what's left for the public is which kind of shoes I buy.

55:31.820 --> 55:37.520
But these private corporations are taking on governmental power and take the lower Colorado

55:37.520 --> 55:43.000
river authority here in Texas, they're private, but they have SWAT teams and will arrest you.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.920
And it's the ultimate tyranny and then they say, hey, we're a corporation, you can't see

55:47.920 --> 55:48.920
our records.

55:48.920 --> 55:49.920
That's right.

55:49.920 --> 55:51.280
You can't ask questions.

55:51.280 --> 55:59.160
I think that what Alex is talking about is the lower Colorado river authority is like,

55:59.160 --> 56:04.520
you know, like dams and like electric power plants.

56:04.520 --> 56:07.040
I think he's talking about like guards around the area.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.040
Right.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.040
Right.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.040
Right.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.040
I'm not entirely sure.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.040
I think that's what he, cause they have like private security.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.040
Right.

56:13.040 --> 56:18.860
But what Chomsky's bringing up is privatization, essentially, and Alex is opposed to that,

56:18.860 --> 56:20.720
but he also hates big government.

56:20.720 --> 56:25.840
Whereas Chomsky's answer to this is public ownership and Alex would be staunchly opposed

56:25.840 --> 56:26.840
to that.

56:26.840 --> 56:29.320
He'd rather die than publicly own a business.

56:29.320 --> 56:37.480
He doesn't have a coherent answer to this because on the one hand you have public businesses

56:37.480 --> 56:45.480
or private businesses, should you allow private business for necessities?

56:45.480 --> 56:47.480
Should you allow air to be privatized?

56:47.480 --> 56:51.000
Should you allow water to be privatized?

56:51.000 --> 56:54.840
Alex should be opposed to that, but also opposed to the alternative.

56:54.840 --> 57:01.800
It doesn't seem like Alex has a clear way out of his bullshit whenever cornered by Noam

57:01.800 --> 57:02.800
Chomsky.

57:02.800 --> 57:05.040
Someone who does have a position.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.040
Yes.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.040
Yeah.

57:07.040 --> 57:11.760
What you do is you wiggle and Alex tries to bring up the difference between a democracy

57:11.760 --> 57:13.340
and a republic.

57:13.340 --> 57:15.560
This is a classic right wing fun time.

57:15.560 --> 57:23.560
So Alex is bringing up the difference between a democracy and a republic to Noam, can I

57:23.560 --> 57:24.560
read that?

57:24.560 --> 57:25.560
What's the name again?

57:25.560 --> 57:26.560
Chomsky.

57:26.560 --> 57:27.560
Noam Chomsky?

57:27.560 --> 57:28.560
Oh, that's who I would do it.

57:28.560 --> 57:29.560
Yeah.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.020
I wouldn't do it against that other guy.

57:31.020 --> 57:32.020
It doesn't go well.

57:32.020 --> 57:33.040
Ah, that's not surprising.

57:33.040 --> 57:36.360
And I would say that this is the turning point of the interview.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.080
This is where things go like, Oh, we're on thin ice.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.080
Okay.

57:40.080 --> 57:43.040
I hear Republicans, Democrats saying democracy, that's a semantical deception.

57:43.040 --> 57:45.760
The founding fathers said a democracy is horrible.

57:45.760 --> 57:48.640
It's two wolves and a sheet voting on what's for dinner.

57:48.640 --> 57:54.440
A republic has a rule of law, separation of powers, a bill of rights that you can't violate

57:54.440 --> 57:59.120
and the democracy 50% say, 51% say all the black people are killed or all the white people

57:59.120 --> 58:00.120
are killed.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.120
It's done or take that farm.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.120
It's done.

58:02.120 --> 58:03.120
Uh, right there.

58:03.120 --> 58:06.120
I mean, we hear this word democracy all the time.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.120
Well, we're a Republican.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.120
There's a big difference.

58:08.120 --> 58:12.240
Uh, actually, I think the real issues are elsewhere.

58:12.240 --> 58:17.240
I mean, the distinction between Republican democracy that you're describing was not really

58:17.240 --> 58:20.280
what concerned the founding fathers, what they were concerned about.

58:20.280 --> 58:25.080
He reads a James Madison, the main Kramer, what he was concerned about, but he wanted

58:25.080 --> 58:30.360
to have a system in which power would lie in the hands of what he called the wealth

58:30.360 --> 58:34.520
of the nation, uh, the more capable class of men.

58:34.520 --> 58:40.880
Uh, and the reason was because the goal of government, this phrase is to protect the

58:40.880 --> 58:44.280
minority of the opulence against the majority.

58:44.280 --> 58:50.360
So the system was designed to try to ensure that the wealth of the nation would essentially

58:50.360 --> 58:55.240
be in control and that the general public would be fragmented and marginalized and so

58:55.240 --> 58:56.240
on.

58:56.240 --> 59:00.880
Now you look over the course of time, middle class flourish here though, professor, pardon

59:00.880 --> 59:05.640
the middle class flourish here, uh, 4% of the population would have the middle class

59:05.640 --> 59:06.640
flourish.

59:06.640 --> 59:11.360
Well, that's, you know, that's not the middle, 4% of the population is in the middle class,

59:11.360 --> 59:12.360
middle class.

59:12.360 --> 59:18.040
It'll, but I think, look, so Alex is having trouble now because Noam has, uh, pointed

59:18.040 --> 59:23.280
a finger at the founders in a way that Alex cannot handle.

59:23.280 --> 59:30.240
Uh, um, yeah, so Alex rebuts that a middle class flourished here.

59:30.240 --> 59:35.920
And he, because of right wing policies, Dan, and his evidence of it is that 4% of the population

59:35.920 --> 59:38.040
of the world and we had half of the wealth.

59:38.040 --> 59:39.040
Yeah.

59:39.040 --> 59:40.040
Right.

59:40.040 --> 59:46.000
And I think Chomsky doesn't understand what he said because he said 4% isn't the middle

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
class.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Right.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Right.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Right.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Right.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.660
And if he heard Alex saying 4% of our population had half of the wealth, then that would be

59:53.660 --> 59:55.480
the response that would be given.

59:55.480 --> 01:00:00.720
But I still think even if he had accurately heard what Alex said, I still think that what

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.160
he's saying is accurate.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.160
Yeah.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.440
The 4% that had all the wealth wasn't necessarily the middle class.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440
Yeah.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.440
Yeah.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440
Yeah.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.880
They were very much not the middle class, uh, on account of there were only 4% of them.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.120
Uh, no, no, the 4% is 4% of the world's population.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.120
Oh yeah.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120
Yeah.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120
That's the way that Alex is meaning that.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120
Gotcha.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120
Gotcha.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120
Okay.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.120
Um, so you leave the 4% aside.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.120
Sure.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:29.680
And if he did have half the wealth, it wasn't like evenly distributed among the population.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.080
There may have been a fairly comfortable, uh, middle class.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080
Yeah.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:42.040
I would argue the, uh, slave population probably wasn't taken care of as well.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.040
Yeah.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.040
Yeah.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.040
At that point.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.040
Yeah.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.040
Yeah.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.040
Yeah.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040
Yeah.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.640
Um, this, this issue with the founding fathers is the beginning of what is going to become

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.640
a tear in the fabric of friendship.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.640
Sure.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:05.640
Um, we have, uh, this, this, uh, conversation, it ends up going to guns because of course

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.640
it does.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.640
Oh no, it's not going to go to guns.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640
Almost immediately.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640
Almost immediately.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640
Of course it does.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.800
I think, look, over the centuries, there's been a lot of struggles against this elitist

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:22.040
concept, and the options for public participation did increase substantially.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.680
But was it elitist for them to say that we would all be armed and have the right to keep

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.680
and bear arms?

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.760
Well, you know, that's not what they meant back at that time.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.320
What they meant is you read the second amendment, they said, in the context of raising malicious

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.920
people should have the right to bear arms.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.760
Now that's, we're living in a different world, you know, we're not raising malicious.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.720
The question whether people should have arms is a separate issue.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:49.400
I mean, in fact, here, the United States is off spectrum of international society.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.600
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, Gnome, Gnome.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.440
Did you just say internationals are the way?

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440
Gnome, Gnome.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.440
Gnome!

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440
Gnome!

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:07.880
Gnome, you have, Gnome, you have hit a very dangerous button, and you can't undo this

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:08.880
now.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880
Nope.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.760
You have just told Alex that his interpretation of the second amendment is wrong.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.880
New world order.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880
New world order.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.960
Oh no, turns out Gnome Chomsky's a shill.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.520
The United States is off spectrum of international society.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.080
Do you think people are hopeful, I mean, are you hopeful that folks are going to wake up

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.880
to this system?

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.720
I think people, again, like I said, maybe I'm naive, but I think that people more or

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.560
less understand it, and what they feel is helpless, and they have to be able to overcome

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.080
that feeling of helplessness, and there are ways of doing it.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:46.000
You know, in the past, people have organized, they have struggled, they've achieved rights,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
we have all kinds of rights and freedoms that didn't exist not long ago, and that's because

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.920
people were not willing to just sit back and take it, but to organize, learn, act, educate,

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.880
do things to change the world so that it's their concerns and needs.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.160
We have the opportunity to do that, and we're very privileged, we live in a society where

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.680
people are not controlled by force, that's an extremely important privilege.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.640
Well, Mr. Chomsky, I have to be honest with you, and I really appreciate you coming on,

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:20.760
I want to tell folks about some of your publications and let you get back to work, but right there,

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.440
it seemed like a group think hurting mechanism when you talked about the guns, and you said,

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:36.280
well, I think America, the US, is off from the main line of the rest of the world, as

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.480
if, oh, we're a little backwards if we still have guns, I mean, that's that whole group

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.680
think right there.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:47.640
So Alex is trying to express this notion that, you know, you're trying to shame America about

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:53.160
guns based on the notion that the rest of the world is more civilized because they don't

01:03:53.160 --> 01:04:01.360
have guns, and this is just anathema to Alex, he has decided that if you present that kind

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:09.560
of a position on his show, you're fucking chill, and Alex throws out, literally, a great

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.560
degree of agreement.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.560
Oh yeah, no, it's all gone.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560
What guns!

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:19.720
What could have led to a second interview, probably could have led to a decent, I mean

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:26.160
eventually would fall apart, but there wasn't hostility here, there was someone who has

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.560
a different perspective on some of the similar themes that Alex talks about.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:38.040
Yeah, no, I mean, the moment Noam said, we live in a country where you can't control

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.760
people by force, all I saw in my head was Alex pulling a gun and saying, you take that

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.160
back, and it's like, well!

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.000
Look, guns are not about force, they're about politeness.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Exactly.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.600
So even that, when Alex is saying that, you know, like, hey, this is, you're trying to

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:02.280
pull out some groupthink, even that, Chomsky is pretty generous and measured with his response.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.160
As if, oh, we're a little backwards that we still have guns, I mean, that's that whole

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.880
groupthink right there.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.440
It could be, again, I don't think it's an obvious question, and I think we'd really

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.080
have to talk about it and think it's true, but if you want my opinion, I think they're

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.160
much too easy to get in the United States.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.560
But England's crime rate just doubled three years after they took all the guns.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:26.000
Well, see, the United States does not have a particularly high crime rate.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It's been sort of toward the high end of the spectrum of industrial societies, but not

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.300
out of range.

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:36.880
The one real difference between the United States and other countries is killings with

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.880
guns.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:45.360
So, it seems like Chomsky is just ignoring Alex's obviously misrepresented stats about

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.920
Yeah, he's not taking the bait.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.200
No, and he's framing the conversation where he believes it's more important, which is

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:57.760
deaths, gun deaths, which is out of pace with other industrialized countries.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.480
Yeah, Alex isn't the first person to come at him with that bullshit.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.480
Doesn't seem like it.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.480
No.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:08.320
So, he might be the first, Alex might be the first person to come with this, though.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.880
The one real difference between the United States and other countries is killings with

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880
guns.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880
Not anymore.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.240
Yeah, it's very high here as compared to other countries.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.760
Look at The Economist no longer.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760
We're number 12.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.800
England and Australia are number one and two now.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.040
In deaths by guns?

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.320
Yes, now they are.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320
I don't think so.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.760
London is now more dangerous.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760
Only the last three years.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760
It wasn't three years ago.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.120
You're right, three years ago.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.400
It's now worse than Washington, D.C., sir.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.640
In deaths by guns?

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.800
Yeah, I have about four different universities, three different governments.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.360
Australian, Europe, statistical data.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.800
It's all on Infowars.com right now, professor.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.760
Okay, I'd take a look, but if that's the case, I'd look at the reasons, and I would suspect

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:59.400
that the reason is that there has been an increased availability of guns.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.680
If there's going to be an increased availability, then there are going to be crimes using guns.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.960
You're right, sir.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.760
They outlawed the guns, and so now the criminals...

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.280
They've always had guns outlawed.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.660
So now the criminals have a reason to bring them in because the black markets made it

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.660
very lucrative.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:19.320
See, I don't think the guns were always outlawed, and even the police didn't have guns in England

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320
until very recently.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.240
Oh, people had guns over there?

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:28.360
No, look, in England, even the police were not armed with guns until fairly recently.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.520
Professor Chomsky?

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.040
The police didn't have guns.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.800
The people had handguns and rifles.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.680
They just confiscated them three years ago.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.360
No, that happened, and it was an effort to do that in Canada.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.360
That's a different story.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.360
I mean, look, this is a big issue, and we have to look into the details of it.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.200
I really don't agree with you about the facts, but these are factual questions.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200
We could settle it.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200
I have the facts.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.160
Well, I'd love to debate you on it.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.560
Real quick, tell folks about some of your books and publications.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.280
That is a we're done here.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.880
Tell me about your publications.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:05.440
If there's more availability of guns, then there's more gun deaths.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440
No!

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:13.760
I see, I think that there's a really, not bizarre at all, very foreign to info wars

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:20.760
situation going on where he's talking to a person who is staying on the one thing that

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:27.080
they were talking about, which is deaths by guns, Alex's fudging statistics, making stuff

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080
up.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080
Yeah, you brought up a different issue.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.760
Hey, tell people about your books.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.400
I'm going to have to let you go.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:37.040
But what Chomsky is doing is being overly charitable.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.720
He's not saying, Alex, you're a fucking liar.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.720
You're making stuff up.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.080
He's saying, I would need to take a look at that.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.360
And if that is the case, here is a potential explanation for why that could be the case.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:55.360
And then Alex has taken that potential explanation that Chomsky has for his fictitious stats,

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.160
explanation for his fictitious stats.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:03.160
Yeah, I think I would have said something along the lines of, if England and Australia

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:08.080
are one and two in gun deaths, I will eat a bowl of my own shit, you idiot.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.080
I bet you a million dollars.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.360
I will take that bet.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:17.080
So Alex, what he's doing is he's talking about the Firearms Amendment Acts of 1997 in England,

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.200
which were passed in response to the Dunblane massacre, where a man in his 40s carried out

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.280
a mass shooting at a primary school.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.360
The strategy that they employed was not to confiscate guns, but to ban future ownership

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.640
of most guns and let the valid licenses that were active lapse and not be renewed.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.360
In response, a ton of people voluntarily turned in their guns, and Alex is pretending that's

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.840
a confiscation.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.920
And it did make more guns illegal to own, but there's been some pretty strict rules

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.560
about guns in England predating this.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.400
Like, Noam Chomsky's not far off.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:55.040
Alex could get him on a technicality if he was saying that all guns have always been

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.920
illegal or whatever, but spiritually he's not off.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920
Yeah.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920
No.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.160
Cops shouldn't be armed.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:11.080
Now that having happened, Alex decides, I think I'm going to hang up on this dick.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.160
Really do appreciate you joining us.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.720
I would just say this, one big part of controlling the thought process and the debate where the

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.320
rat thinks it has a choice, you can go forward, left, right or back, but it's still in there

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.840
system, is having people out there talking about this propaganda state in Madison Avenue

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.800
and only pointing out certain parts of it and misdirecting people back into the big

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.360
government paradigm.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.480
And frankly, sir, you need to get the information on the guns, on the land grabbing, on all

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.360
of it, because I have it right here and I respect your work, but at the same time, just

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.480
here talking to you, I think some of it isn't as honest as it could be.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.920
Well, you know, that's for people, others to decide when they look at it.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.920
He is.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920
My audience is pretty well educated.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.920
Thanks for joining us.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.440
Say hi to David Rockefeller for me.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.440
Wow.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.440
What a dick.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.440
What a complete dick.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440
Yeah, now.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.440
What a bizarre end to this interview.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.440
Excuse me, sir.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:15.640
I'm going to agree with you for about an hour, but it turns out that you disagree with me

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:16.640
on guns.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.480
So you work for David Rockefeller, you lying piece of shit.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480
I hope you die.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.480
I hope you die.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480
Click.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.520
And something that I think is really admirable is the way that Chomsky responds to that.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.400
Like Alex is basically calling him a liar and he's like, well, I guess people just figure

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400
that out.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.120
I'm not going to engage with your, your, your attempt to get me to fight with you or whatever.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120
Exactly.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.240
I like that.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.600
Excuse me, Alex.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.760
You realize I'm gnome Chomsky?

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.640
His pulse didn't even go up at all.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640
Nope.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.640
Nope.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.000
I think, I think you're controlled opposition and a real dick and a liar.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.280
Uh, well, I understand your point of view.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.280
I think, uh, people will be smart enough to look into it and see the difference here

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.120
and gnome Chomsky.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120
You're wrong, buddy.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.180
Say hi to David Rockefeller.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.180
You busted.

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.840
So now that he's gone.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.960
Now we get to talk shit.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.960
Oh yeah.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960
Oh yeah.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.420
There goes gnome Chomsky, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.800
And I've read his books and now I'm more sure of it than ever.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.560
He's a new world order shill up one side and down the other.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.960
Oh, I never had guns in England.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:26.040
They most certainly did.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.080
Certainly gun ownership wasn't as prolific.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:34.520
I mean, how many, I mean, you've seen the video that's been on nationwide of them cutting

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.880
the guns in half over there, confiscating the handguns, the rifles three years ago.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.240
We've read the reports, the economist world net daily.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240
Yeah.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.040
So I mean, just speak freely once he's gone.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.240
I've read his books now.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240
I know for sure.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:53.600
So wait, was the idea to get him in there and then find something to disagree with and

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.040
then declare him a shill?

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:59.400
I think it has to have been because he has to have like, if, if, if what Alex is saying

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:05.560
is true and he's read Chomsky's books and suspected that he was an NWO shill, then it

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.200
would have to be like, I'm just looking for a point of disagreement in order to make you

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.200
an enemy.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200
Yeah.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200
That's not, that's not cool.

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:18.120
I would have suggested that when he was talking about one of the books that you supposedly

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:24.320
read would be the time to say that, Hey, I think after having read your book, you're

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320
a shill.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.320
Yeah.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.320
I don't like your position on anti-communist.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.320
Exactly.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.320
Yes.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.320
It'd be very simple.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.640
All of my favorite people are anti-communist as hell.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640
Yeah.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.640
Yeah.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640
Yeah.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:48.400
I, I, I thought that this was really strange, um, Alex, I don't, I don't know what he was

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.400
doing.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.400
I'm, I'm, I'm completely perplexed.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.680
There's so much agreement.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680
Yeah.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.320
Now, Alex would have to give up a lot of the sort of more fun elements of his conspiratorial

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.440
nonsense if he were to continue engaging with Chomsky.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.440
Sure.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.440
Because a lot of this stuff would fall apart.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.440
Yeah.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.440
Yeah.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440
A lot of it would.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.560
And, and some of the, the more real, uh, sort of dynamics that Chomsky could bring to the

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.360
table are not necessarily as exciting or lucrative.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360
Yeah.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.360
Yeah.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.360
Yeah.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.760
And maybe there isn't value in it for Alex to be an ally of Chomsky.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.760
Right.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.760
Right.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.760
Right.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.760
No, I mean, it's hard for me to imagine that he did this interview as a trap in order to

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.680
create this moment at the end.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680
Yeah.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.680
Yeah.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.680
It just, it doesn't make sense.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.480
No, it really doesn't.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.360
It also doesn't feel angry enough for it to be like a visceral response on Alex's part

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.680
where he's just like, fuck it.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.120
I'm just mad at this guy.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.120
Yeah.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:56.120
I mean, it kind of feels like if, if I were running it here would be my kind of a game

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:02.720
plan there, which is if you and Noam Chomsky have an awesome interview, then you get to

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.160
say Noam Chomsky is a fan of yours.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.160
Sure.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.720
And that legitimizes you to a lot of people.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.760
And it would help Alex's arguments of, you know, being above the left right paradigm.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.760
Yeah.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.360
If you get into a fight with Noam Chomsky, you got into a fight with Noam fucking Chomsky.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.520
A one-sided fight.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.320
And a lot of people will be like, hell yeah, man.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.800
So Alex really can't lose in this scenario.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:33.120
I do think that the extreme right elements of Alex's audience, which is certainly more

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:41.360
of the keystone of it than anything, would not like the idea of being friends with Noam

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.360
Chomsky.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.360
Totally.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.360
Totally.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.360
Yeah.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.760
It's, I honestly, I've listened to this interview a couple times and I don't really know exactly

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.760
what happened.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.760
Yeah.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.760
I'm not sure.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.000
It makes no sense to me.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Yeah.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.640
And maybe there was a decent chance that what we saw there with him being like, sir, you

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.680
know, I believe that this is a group think and, you know, I think that you're not being

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.500
as honest as maybe that's 2001 Angry Alex.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.500
Could be.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.500
Could be.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.520
You know, like maybe we're just judging it based on the bombastic performances of the

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.520
present.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.680
Maybe that's how he was an angry dick back then.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.640
How many years had he been doing this?

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640
Not long.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.640
Not too long.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640
He's inexperienced.

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.400
I mean, I wasn't, I didn't get mediocre at comedy for seven years.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:33.640
So you can't imagine him being, you know, right out the gate, the bombastic disgusting

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:35.360
human being that we expect today.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.360
Yeah.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:45.300
And the years of substance abuse and globalists and hot tubs have certainly created the character

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.300
that he is.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.300
Yeah.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.300
I don't know.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.300
Anyway, here's the last clip.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.300
Yeah.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.960
I had the spanking there at the end and I certainly enjoyed it.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:52.960
Really?

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.960
Chomsky.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:54.960
Really?

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.840
I've got a cold order shell and I've got twice the brain you've got with both arms tied behind

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.960
my back.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.960
Makes sense.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.320
I tell you these people, it makes me want to puke.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.600
Our founding fathers were elitists.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.440
They wanted to protect the elite.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.440
They were bad.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.800
That might not have been the right thing for him to mock.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.120
Yeah.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.960
They owned humans.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:27.040
So they definitely wanted to protect owning humans.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.440
Yeah.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:34.720
I think that if you take anything away from this, it's Alex's contention that he has more

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.080
brains with both hands tied behind his back.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080
Man.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:41.720
A completely meaningless brag.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:47.720
It really couldn't get more obviously incongruous for someone to say, look how smart I am.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:53.880
I'm going to use a cliche that could not less apply to the very thing that I'm saying I'm

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880
smart about.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880
Yeah.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.480
I think that really kind of sums it up.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:04.040
And honestly, strategically it even sums up what I look at.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:10.080
There are very few times that I take a look at something that happened in Alex's past

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.160
and I'm just completely flummoxed.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:17.080
And I really don't know why this happened the way it did.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.640
It's confusing.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.640
I don't know.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.760
And I don't think I have any answers.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.880
I would like to know how the Booker got Noam Chomsky.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.500
I think a lot of people are more gettable than we think.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.500
That's probably true.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.600
I think that a lot of folks that you might want to talk to, it would just be a matter

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.600
of a couple emails.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.600
Yeah.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:45.720
I mean, considering how much free time I could make at the drop of a hat, I imagine public

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.320
intellectuals are in a very similar spot.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.000
Maybe a little bit less free time than you.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.320
Maybe a little bit less free time than me, specifically.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.520
The paragon of free time, Jordan.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.520
Yeah.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:03.720
I think about how differently history could have gone if Alex and Noam became buddies

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.440
instead of Steve Pacanich and Noam Chomsky.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.920
You're not going to get as many big swings from Noam Chomsky.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.920
I believe-

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:15.920
Why not?

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.240
Steve came into the fold in 2002.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.240
This is 2001.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.240
Wow.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.240
So this is pre-Steve Pacanich.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.000
Hey, we got to get a new Noam Chomsky.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.880
Get Steve Pacanich in here.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.160
Dude, if the infinite universes is real, there is a universe-

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.360
The multiverse theory.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.760
Where Steve Pacanich is played by Noam Chomsky on the Alex Jones show.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.760
How does that go?

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.720
Do you think Noam Chomsky gets crazier or Alex gets less crazy?

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:42.280
I mean, if you go solely based on this interview-

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.280
Sure, sure.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.040
I think Alex gets less crazy.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.040
Yes.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.000
Because to me, Chomsky seems immovable.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.880
No, he's got a heart rate 120 over 80 all day, baby.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:20:00.280
He does not seem to care too much and is willing to elucidate positions and clarify things

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.720
while discussing things with Alex.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.160
And I think that that would not...

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.840
He would disappear before he got crazier because of Alex, I think.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.920
I think Alex believes that he is the waves that could wear away the rock, but instead

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.160
it is Noam Chomsky.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:17.160
Yeah.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160
Yeah.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.600
And to be honest, I think Steve was crazy when he showed up.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.800
Oh no, of course.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.600
I think Alex didn't make him more crazy.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.600
Steve was crazy when he was working for the State Department.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.600
Probably.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.600
Yeah.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.600
When he killed Aldo Morrow.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:33.040
They were all probably like, this guy thinks he killed Aldo Morrow.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.840
He did kill Aldo Morrow.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840
That's true.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.480
So anyway, Jordan, we will be back.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.360
This has been a long overdue checking this box off.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.360
Oh yeah.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.120
And I wish I had more to bring to it, but I honestly don't.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.480
I think it's just an interesting glimpse of public intellectual...

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.480
It really is.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:01.720
Having a conversation with Alex that it steps on a number of commonalities between where

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:10.480
sort of critical historical study overlaps with, you know, pseudo-conspiracy, you know,

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.480
and where there is distinction and where there's departure.

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:20.000
And I think you also get a really solid glimpse of, even in 2001, Alex is so sensitive about

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
guns.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Totally.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.680
And it may be one of the only things that really means anything to him.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.680
Yeah.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.680
Yeah.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:34.760
And to a certain extent, you know, so many men treat guns as an extension of toxic masculinity,

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.080
so maybe that's even more, like, at the deepest level.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.480
It's just toxic masculinity.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.480
Sure.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.480
You know?

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480
Or property rights.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480
Sure.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.360
It could be a symbol of the idea of personal private property.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360
Sure, sure.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360
I don't know.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360
Totally true.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360
But it's strange.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:56.240
It's strange that he had to make a fight out of essentially a decent point.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240
Yeah.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.240
Yep.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.240
Yep.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.520
Anyway, we'll be back, Jordan.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.520
But until then, we have a website.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.520
We do have a website.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.640
We are also on Twitter.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.640
We are on Twitter.

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.640
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.640
Go to bed.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.640
We're also on Facebook.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.640
We are on Facebook.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.920
If you'd like to download the show, please go to iTunes and et cetera.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:17.120
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.120
doing God's work.

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.120
Yep.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.120
We'll be back.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.120
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.120
I'm Leo.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.120
I'm Dizzy X. Clark.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.120
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.120
And now, here comes the sex robots.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.280
In Kansas, you're on the air.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280
Thanks for holding.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.280
Hello, Alex.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280
I'm a first time caller.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280
I'm a huge fan.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.280
I love your work.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.280
I love you.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:23:01.280
I love you, too.
