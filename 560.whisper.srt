00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:58,880
I love you.

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,860
I'm Jordan.

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,160
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, talk about how great Selene is, and also discuss Alex Jones.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,760
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,260
Ah, Cult of Selene, whee!

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,060
Uh, hm.

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,460
See, I wasn't even going to bring attention to it that time.

15
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,260
Harumpf.

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,860
Dan!

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,360
Jordan.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,160
I have a quick question for you.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,860
What's up?

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,960
Uh, what's your bright spot today?

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,260
My bright spot today, Jordan, is that I survived an ordeal that would destroy a lesser version of myself.

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,660
Oh, oh yes.

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:38,460
And that is that the other night, I ordered some food for delivery, and I went downstairs to get it, and I locked myself out.

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,260
Oh my god.

25
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,760
Locked myself out of the house at about 9.30 in the evening, and I was terrified.

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,360
Uh, yeah.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,560
Because I didn't have my keys, I know my landlord's not going to come over, I don't even know who my landlord is.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,660
No, absolutely not.

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,760
No, no, no, no, no.

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,360
They're not going to come let me in?

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,760
I can't break into my window, because it's not on the bottom floor.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,360
Third floor, third floor is trouble.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,460
Uh, I don't think that I have that kind of parkour ability, uh, to scale the building.

34
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,560
It would be difficult.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,460
And so I was looking at the neighbors' windows, which is never great, and they're all dark.

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,360
Everything is dark.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
I'm like, I'm not going to hit the buzzer and like wake somebody up.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,660
Right.

39
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,060
That seems like too much.

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,560
Could be.

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,960
So I walked around the side of the building, and I saw someone's TV on, and I hit the buzzer.

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,660
And thankfully they buzzed me, but I was so terrified that I was like, well, great.

43
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,260
I've got my food, but now I guess I'll be-

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Well, at least you wouldn't starve out there.

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,260
I was going to be eating and sleeping out in the alley tonight.

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,660
It was a warm night.

47
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,560
It wasn't too bad.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:39,860
Yeah.

49
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,360
That's true.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
And that might have been part of the reason why I forgot my keys.

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,660
Yeah, it could have been.

52
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,360
Uh, because it was just sort of like, hey.

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
Did you put your shoes on?

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,860
I think I had sandals.

55
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,260
Ooh, how dare you.

56
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,360
How dare you.

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,460
I know you're not a fan of slippers.

58
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,060
No open toothed shoes.

59
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,960
It's not open toe.

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,660
It's closed.

61
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,560
It's closed toe.

62
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,160
All right.

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
So what about you?

64
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:07,060
My Bright Spot, Deanne, is currently, as we speak, goes the Eurovision Song Contest.

65
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,560
I know every year you get very excited about, what the fuck?

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,060
No, you don't.

67
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,760
No, I don't.

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,160
No, I've never really even watched it before.

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,260
But this is the first time that I've really decided to dig in and watch some Eurovision.

70
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,760
Sure.

71
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,160
And it is just universally terrible music.

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
But the pageantry is amazing.

73
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,260
I mean, really, really bad.

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,160
But they're given an airplane hangar to do whatever they want with.

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,960
And they create some ridiculous spectacles.

76
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,560
And from what I understand, I don't know too much about Eurovision.

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,660
But from what I understand, it gets pretty serious, like country against country.

78
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,560
Yeah, everybody's cheering.

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Most everybody is doing, like, you know how Americans invented good music?

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,060
They're all doing that.

81
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,960
But, you know, through their own lens, that kind of thing.

82
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,460
But some countries do, like, their own shit.

83
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,160
You know, like traditional stuff.

84
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,560
And it's really, really good.

85
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,760
But everything else is garbage.

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,260
Nobody has a good baseline.

87
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,560
It's just tragic.

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
Oh, that's too bad.

89
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,660
Man, there's light shows everywhere.

90
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,060
Well, that's great.

91
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,360
So Jordan, today, speaking of light shows, I would like to let you look into my disco ball.

92
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,760
It is actually a time machine.

93
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Alright.

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,260
Okay.

95
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,160
We're going back in time.

96
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,860
Disco ball.

97
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,960
Where are we off to today, Mr. Peabody?

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Well, today we are going to May 12th and 13th, 2003.

99
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,460
Okay.

100
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,260
Continuing back in our exploration of Alex Jones in 2003.

101
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,660
And seeing primarily what he's all about.

102
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,960
What are some similarities?

103
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,060
What are some differences?

104
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,760
Where's the devil at?

105
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
I mean, that's definitely one of the biggest questions.

106
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,560
Sure, sure.

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,260
Does Alex Jones believe he's fighting the devil in 2003?

108
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,860
Has his ultimate enemy been revealed to him yet?

109
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,560
Yes.

110
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,460
Or have the prophecies that he received in his dreams been a little bit muddled?

111
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,060
And a secondary element of that question is,

112
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,260
does Alex believe he's fighting the devil and actively try to hide that from his presentation?

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,060
Yes, correct.

114
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,460
In order to be taken more seriously at this point in his career.

115
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
Right, right, right, right.

116
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,660
And at this point, we started the beginning of May 2003 and we're now coming to the middle of the month.

117
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,260
And I think it's still an open question.

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,260
And we'll learn a little bit more today.

119
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,760
Alright.

120
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,060
But before we do, let's take a little moment to say thank you to some wonks.

121
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,960
Oh, that's a good idea.

122
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,460
So first, if I become a policy wonk, do I get to see exclusive pictures of Celine being excessively cute?

123
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,260
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

124
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm a policy wonk.

125
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,460
Thank you very much!

126
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,860
I'm not sure, but I will send a picture of Celine to Jordan so you can tweet it.

127
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,160
Yeah, there are no exclusive pictures of Celine here.

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,660
No, but I could give you a cute picture and you could put it on Twitter if you like.

129
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
I'll take care of it.

130
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Next, Louis Box, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

131
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,760
I'm a policy wonk.

132
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,460
Thank you, Louis Box.

133
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:55,960
Thank you.

134
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,660
Next, TheMorningDude listening on Steve Puchenik's neon nips, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

135
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,760
I'm a policy wonk.

136
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,660
Thank you very much, terrifying nightmare that will never escape my brain.

137
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,660
Next, Joe, my neighbors might think I actually listened to Alex, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

138
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
I'm a policy wonk.

139
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,860
Thank you very much!

140
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,060
Next, I came here to say that you were this close to the joke, not all heroes wear masks, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

141
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
I'm a policy wonk.

142
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,660
I like policy wonk names that are joke critiques.

143
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,260
Really, that one actually almost hits me in the gut a little bit.

144
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,060
That's a little bit like a get off your high horse thing, okay?

145
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,460
Next, EscapedSonOfAPreecherMan, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

146
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,660
I'm a policy wonk.

147
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Thank you very much!

148
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,660
The only one who could ever reach me was the escaped son of a bitch, but...

149
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Next, ScooterTheCorgi, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

150
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I'm a policy wonk.

151
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
Thanks, Scoot.

152
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Thank you very much.

153
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,660
And, Jordan, even though we're in the past, I should say that something's happening in the present, but not just Eurovision.

154
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
Right.

155
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
Not just Eurovision.

156
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,660
And that is that some people have some birthdays.

157
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
So, in 20...

158
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
What have we become?

159
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:09,660
In 2021, I should tell you, this weekend was chock-a-block with policy wonk birthdays.

160
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Sure, sure.

161
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
We got Heather M. had a birthday.

162
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Happy birthday, Heather M.

163
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Happy birthday.

164
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
Throwback Zach had a birthday.

165
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,660
Throwback Zach!

166
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,660
Happy birthday.

167
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,660
And Ethan Mary sent a message wanting us to wish you a happy birthday over the weekend.

168
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Hope you all...

169
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,660
Happy birthday, Ethan.

170
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Yeah.

171
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
Alright.

172
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,660
We start here on the 12th, and it is a slog.

173
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,660
It is a rough time at the beginning.

174
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,660
But Alex gets around to some actual news, and that is where we will jump in.

175
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,660
You can't judge these books by their covers, the LA Times.

176
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Many textbooks distort history, slamming the US and glorifying despotic regimes.

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Last week, the LA Times had an article saying McCarthy was right.

178
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
What is going on?

179
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,660
The liberal papers sound conservative.

180
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,660
The conservative papers sound liberal.

181
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,660
I mean, they're really scrambling things right now.

182
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,660
So just a quick reminder, the LA Times editorial that Alex is talking about did not say that

183
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
McCarthy was right.

184
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,660
No.

185
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,660
It was in fact a scathing condemnation of McCarthy and his tactics, and a plea not to

186
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,660
throw out all opposition to communism just based on how big a piece of shit he was.

187
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,660
So maybe journalistic outlets aren't as topsy-turvy as he's kind of presenting it.

188
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
No.

189
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,660
If you just make assumptions based on headlines and what you think things are, then maybe

190
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
things are topsy-turvy.

191
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
That could be topsy-turvy.

192
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,660
So I was able to find this article that Alex is talking about in the LA Times about textbooks.

193
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,660
It's by Diane Ravitch, an author whose work is almost exclusively about education-related

194
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
issues.

195
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,660
The first thing to point out is that this, much like the other article Alex cites, is

196
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
an editorial.

197
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,660
Ravitch is writing in the first person, and it's not a piece of straight reporting.

198
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Around this time in history, Ravitch had just released a book titled The Language Police,

199
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,660
How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn.

200
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,660
The book was about how fear of igniting controversy from both left and right-wing pressure groups

201
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,660
has led to textbooks that give students an incomplete view of subjects like history and

202
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,660
literature.

203
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,660
In her article for the Times, she says, quote, the textbooks go out of their way to sanitize

204
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,660
the very practices in non-Western cultures that they rightly condemn in our society.

205
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,660
For instance, every textbook acknowledges that the enslavement of Africans by the West

206
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
was a great crime.

207
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,660
However, when describing slavery in the Middle East or Africa, many claim that it is a path

208
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,660
to upward career mobility or a chance to join a new family.

209
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Slavery is wrong in any time and place and should be recognized as such.

210
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,660
That's a fair enough point, but I want to make sure that we illuminate how this criticism

211
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,660
is different than that that's lobbied by someone like Alex.

212
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Alex doesn't want all cultures to be represented accurately and with proper historical context.

213
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,660
He would want the Middle Eastern or African slavery discussed, but he would also want

214
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,660
the textbooks to ignore American slavery, or if they had to cover it, the focus should

215
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
be on how America actually ended slavery.

216
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,660
No, if it weren't for white people, we never would have ended slavery.

217
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Everybody knows this.

218
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Ravitch is pointing out certain textbooks that she's read that are lazy.

219
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Alex just doesn't want history to make him feel bad.

220
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
It would make him feel really bad.

221
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
It would make him feel really bad.

222
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
It's a very specific difference.

223
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Yeah, yeah, you know, if you're quoting Thomas Jefferson incorrectly all the time,

224
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
but it's like, hey, I'm Thomas Jefferson.

225
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
I love having slaves.

226
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,660
It'd make you feel like maybe the founding fathers weren't very smart.

227
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Also, I suspect that Alex wouldn't like this paragraph in the Times article.

228
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Quote, the history's treatment of religion is scandalous.

229
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,660
The origin stories of each religion are recounted as if they were documented history

230
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
rather than religious myths.

231
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Many publishers have multicultural advisory boards to ensure the textbooks contain

232
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,660
only positive facts about religion or ethnic groups.

233
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,660
I suspect that Alex didn't read the whole article since he definitely would not like

234
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,660
the suggestion that his religious beliefs are a myth.

235
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Also, that clip that we listened to is like a half hour into the show.

236
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,660
It's a real, it was walking through molasses.

237
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
Yeah, yeah, that's not good.

238
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
It was tough.

239
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
That's not good.

240
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,660
But it started up fast after half an hour.

241
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,660
And it got into some, like, really interesting stuff that, like,

242
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,660
when I think about, like, going back in time and looking at these episodes,

243
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,660
this is such a good example of, like, being able to go in different directions

244
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,660
from things that Alex says and learning about interesting stuff like this.

245
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,660
This is now in the Belfast Telegraph.

246
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
It is in the BBC.

247
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,660
It is in the London Guardian.

248
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Top double agent in IRA, guilty of up to 40 murders.

249
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Turns out that the top man in the IRA carrying out the bombings,

250
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,660
the killings, the shootings, everything, as we told you last year,

251
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,660
was MI5-6, ultra-secret agent.

252
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
Okay. All right.

253
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,660
So what's going on here is that Alex is glossing over an amazing story

254
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,660
just to make it valuable to his worldview when, in fact, it doesn't really work at all.

255
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,660
The IRA member in question here is a double agent for British intelligence

256
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
codenamed Steakknife.

257
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
He denies that any of this is-

258
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
That is not as cool as you made it sound.

259
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
Codenamed Steakknife? No, that sucks. That would be terrible.

260
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I don't want to be codenamed Steakknife.

261
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,660
It's S-T-A-K-E.

262
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
That's even worse. I don't want to be a pun.

263
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Whatever.

264
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Okay.

265
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
So he denies that any of this is true, but it's widely understood

266
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,660
that this was a man named Freddy Scappaticci.

267
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,660
And if his denial isn't a lie, his story is bananas.

268
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,660
So there's a great piece about this by James Harkin in GQ

269
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,660
that I'm taking a lot of the background information for,

270
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,660
and I would recommend people check out that article.

271
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,660
Okay, cool.

272
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Apparently, in the late 1970s, Scappaticci met an army sergeant named Peter Jones,

273
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,660
a guy who's so charismatic that his superiors, quote,

274
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,660
allowed him to wear civilian clothes, don a beard, and develop his own sources.

275
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
So he was Sergeant Bilko.

276
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,660
Somehow, through the magic of charm and booze, even though Jones worked for the British Army

277
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,660
and Scappaticci was in the IRA, they forged a friendship that resulted in Scappaticci becoming a mole.

278
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,660
Wow, this is a real Romeo and Juliet situation.

279
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,660
This is kind of a, yeah, I like it.

280
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,660
So by this point, the IRA had become a slightly smaller organization,

281
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,660
which was aware that they were spies trying to infiltrate their ranks and become snitches.

282
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,660
As such, they put together a counterintelligence team,

283
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660
which was meant to root out any potential spies.

284
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
From Harkins' article, quote,

285
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,660
By the mid-1980s, Scappaticci was the deputy head of internal security

286
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,660
and a trusted member of its general headquarters staff.

287
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,660
This story happened so many goddamn times!

288
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,660
Why are you always put in charge of your own investigation?

289
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Yeah.

290
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Essentially, through unconventional methods,

291
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,660
the British government had cultivated a relationship with a double agent

292
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,660
who was placed internally in a position that was almost comically strategically-

293
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
It's just ridiculous!

294
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Get the fuck out of here!

295
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Their double agent was the guy in the IRA who was in charge of finding double agents within the IRA.

296
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,660
That's unrealistic in a Bond movie!

297
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
You'd be like, get the fuck out of here!

298
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
Yeah.

299
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,660
So as is the case with all these sorts of spy-related stories,

300
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
everything is morally questionable.

301
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,660
A lot of the story revolves around Scappaticci killing or allowing people to be killed

302
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,660
who could compromise his position as a double agent,

303
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,660
or people who they needed to protect in order to pursue goals of, like, arresting higher-up figures.

304
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Sure, sure.

305
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
And unfortunately, some of those people definitely got killed.

306
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gotcha.

307
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,660
It's messy business, and no one's hands are clean,

308
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,660
but depending on whose version of the story you believe,

309
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
this is all made up, according to Scappaticci.

310
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Okay.

311
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,660
Or Scappaticci was responsible for helping disrupt multiple terrorist plots at a horrible cost.

312
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,660
The accusation that Freddy Scappaticci was steak knife came to light in 2003,

313
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,660
and this became a big story, as well it should be.

314
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,660
The important piece to recognize here, though, is that Alex is missing the forest for the trees.

315
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,660
He deprives his audience of learning about this fascinating piece of history,

316
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,660
or from learning about the history of the IRA and the Troubles,

317
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,660
because the headline works a different way for him.

318
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,660
This is a story about a very well-placed double agent within the IRA,

319
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,660
but to Alex, this can prove that MI6 was running the IRA all along,

320
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,660
and the bombings and the attacks were all just false flags.

321
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,660
That's an outrageous misuse of this story, and by reporting it this way,

322
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Alex is actually doing something worse than just ignoring the story altogether.

323
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,660
He's creating a fake version of it for his audience to erroneously convince themselves they understand.

324
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
He's like Aaron Sorkin!

325
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,660
Even if all the allegations about Scappaticci are correct and accurate,

326
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,660
he wasn't the top man in the IRA, and he wasn't the one carrying out the bombings.

327
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,660
Alex is embellishing that element of the story because it helps him construct the impression

328
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,660
that the world is all fake, and that everything you hear is a lie.

329
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,660
It's a perversion of skepticism and curiosity.

330
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Yeah, it is really a good...

331
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,660
I mean, as far as storytelling goes, when you reduce it down into this kind of bullshit,

332
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,660
you miss out on a very human story where people are making difficult decisions in moral grey areas,

333
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
where they're struggling to keep from being caught,

334
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,660
while at the same time struggling to show that they're trying to catch themselves.

335
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
That's a really fascinating story!

336
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,660
The MI6 already running the IRA is a really boring story, actually.

337
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,660
Yeah, but it's much easier.

338
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,660
It has explanatory power over stuff that would be so...

339
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,660
It takes years of study.

340
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,660
You could be a historian at a university with tenure,

341
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,660
and maybe not fully be able to explain it except over the course of a semester.

342
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Right, right, right.

343
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Well, I mean, and it goes back again to how boring it is that your enemy is both everywhere

344
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,660
running everything and is also so incompetent that you can defeat them at any and all times.

345
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
Of course.

346
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,660
It's like, that's a boring story! I don't care if Superman can always win.

347
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,660
I don't care.

348
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,660
Sure.

349
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
I know, it's boring.

350
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,660
What I was getting at is that it's very unsatisfying if you're a demagogue on the radio

351
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,660
to be like, alright, let's buckle down and everybody take notes.

352
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
This is going to take forever.

353
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,660
It's going to require a lot of reading and research on your part.

354
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
Instead...

355
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
Serial became a huge hit!

356
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,660
Instead, just telling people it's all fake.

357
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,660
The big boogeyman is running everything, who cares?

358
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
It's all these globalists.

359
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Serial did become a huge hit.

360
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
I don't know...

361
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
I'm saying it does both. Never mind. I'm sorry.

362
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
I don't know if that was a lecture.

363
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
I was playing both sides.

364
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Fair enough.

365
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,660
Yeah.

366
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Also, I should tell you this.

367
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
Yes.

368
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,660
In 2018, Freddy Scampaticci's home was searched as part of an investigation into his role

369
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,660
in the IRA, which didn't result in any murder charges, although he did plead guilty to having

370
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,660
at least 329 images of animal porn on his computer.

371
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,660
According to an article in the Irish Times, quote, Westminster's Magistrates Court heard

372
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Scampaticci tell police that he was not sexually interested in animals, but preferred women

373
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
with big breasts.

374
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,660
He was ordered to pay a total of 185 pounds, including court costs.

375
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
I...

376
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Man...

377
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Okay.

378
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
This is why...

379
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:25,660
This is why journalism has a huge hole, and that is...

380
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Very intended.

381
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
I now need to know what they mean by animal porn.

382
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
I can't not know.

383
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,660
It's pornography featuring animals.

384
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
Yes, but I don't know what that means.

385
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
The animal kingdom is large.

386
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
How many...

387
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
You know what I'm saying?

388
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
No, I know exactly what you're saying.

389
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
I just don't share your curiosity.

390
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
I'm sorry, but I just...

391
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
I absolutely do not share.

392
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
It's a curiosity now.

393
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Okay.

394
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,660
I'm sorry.

395
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
I don't know who can get those court files for you.

396
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I don't want to see the court files.

397
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,660
I don't want to see it.

398
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
I just want to know.

399
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,660
No, but I'm sure they didn't reprint all of it in the court files.

400
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
It just might be more specific.

401
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Well, I would like to...

402
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
I would like...

403
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,660
Okay, Jordan.

404
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
I'll take a transcript of a description.

405
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
Jordan.

406
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
I do not want to see it.

407
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,660
I'd like to apologize that my research did not go deeper into this...

408
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
I'm just saying.

409
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,660
This postscript on a story.

410
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Okay.

411
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,660
I'm just saying decency rules keep us from getting a full picture of the story.

412
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
And it shall continue.

413
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Okay.

414
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,660
So, Alex has used this story about the IRA double agent in order to justify that, like,

415
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
everything is a false flag.

416
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
Sure.

417
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,660
All of the conflict in Northern Ireland was false flaggery.

418
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Sure.

419
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,660
And that the British just do it all.

420
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
False flagging is a British trick.

421
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Although, it's been picked up by other people that Alex might love in the present day.

422
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
This is a British trick.

423
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,660
They have been big in it before the Russians or the US were.

424
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Putin.

425
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Putin.

426
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Of course, Putin was caught blowing up or trying to blow up his fourth apartment.

427
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Kalden did blow up three of them.

428
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,660
Moscow police arrested FSB in 99, planting the bombs.

429
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:13,660
And then Moscow GRU, their internal security force, went in and arrested the police and

430
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,660
others that had the hexagon explosives.

431
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,660
They arrested members of the media and that story was shut down quite quickly.

432
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,660
But that is confirmed and members of the FSB and others have now spoken out who fled the

433
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
country.

434
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Then Britain moved to have them arrested and shipped back to Vladimir Putin, who was the

435
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:37,660
former head of the KGB in Stalingrad, Leningrad, St. Petersburg, whatever name you want to

436
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
give it for the day.

437
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,660
But it's now St. Petersburg, the old name.

438
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,660
And he was the guy really running things and they were pushing Boris Yeltsin around in

439
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,660
a wheelchair completely drunk and drugged out of his mind who couldn't even speak.

440
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,660
He's been running things for at least the last three years of Yeltsin's tenure.

441
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
He was wildly unpopular.

442
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Suddenly, three apartment buildings got blown up outside Moscow in the suburb.

443
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,660
He cracked down, said, I will save you, was a big hero and got elected with a large portion

444
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:14,660
of the vote and then had a great war against the Chechnyans who screamed, it's not us,

445
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,660
it's you.

446
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Why would we bomb you and bring down your wrath?

447
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
This is insane.

448
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:26,660
So Alex seems to, in 2003, have a lot of reasons why he believes that Putin did this.

449
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Yeah, we're very much in a, he's mobbed up, he's a front man for consortiums on the East

450
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Coast territory in terms of knowledge of crime.

451
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,660
It's strange because I don't think that Alex is expressing like, I think he did it.

452
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
No, no, no.

453
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Alex is saying that these people were arrested, planting the bombs.

454
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,660
Sure.

455
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
To him, it's definitive.

456
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Yeah.

457
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
And somehow that has changed.

458
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,660
Or he's just decided, I don't care if someone falls flags, I'll pretend they didn't because

459
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,660
I like the way that they're strong manning.

460
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's, if everybody else is false flagging, then I might as well pick

461
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
the guy who's doing it the best.

462
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Or doing it in such a way...

463
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,660
In service of my hopeful white nationalism.

464
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
Perhaps.

465
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,660
I mean, if he does truly believe that, I mean, it's a short jump from everything is fake

466
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
to nothing matters.

467
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
Yeah.

468
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,660
That is a very good point.

469
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:36,660
I mean, if everything is fake and everybody is false flagging everybody, then the ethical

470
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,660
implications of pulling a false flag are really not that high.

471
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,660
Yeah, that's true.

472
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,660
It's really just what the result is.

473
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,660
So I could see Alex ethically being okay with false flagging in order to serve whatever

474
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,660
interests he's most in line with.

475
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,660
I don't know that to be the case, but I could easily see that being something that he could

476
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
subconsciously convince himself of.

477
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
Totally.

478
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,660
I would argue that there's zero possibility before Alex's life is over that he himself

479
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
does not try and carry out some sort of false flag.

480
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Sure, sure.

481
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
He's just going to.

482
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
Like, that's the narrative arc for him.

483
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
I see him pulling a last season of House.

485
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Yeah.

486
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
And taking his own death.

487
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
Yeah, the whole thing, yeah.

488
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,660
So he and Steve Pacetic can ride motorcycles around.

489
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
And they're hanging out with Aldo Morrow.

490
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
Yeah.

491
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,660
So, lest you think that I am just saying that Alex thinks everything is fake.

492
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
It's all out there.

493
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Mainstream news.

494
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,660
We haven't found a terror attack in modern history anywhere in the world of any size

495
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
or scope that wasn't carried out by the globalist.

496
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,660
When I say globalist, I'm talking about the private banks and their private armies that

497
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:56,660
control the top cabals, the compartmentalized cabals, and all the intelligence agencies.

498
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
So, that doesn't sound like the devil.

499
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
No, no.

500
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
That's one thing.

501
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
That's straight up globalists.

502
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,660
And then secondarily, Alex seems to be convinced that literally everything is the globalist.

503
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
It does seem to be the globalist.

504
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
There are no real terrorist attacks.

505
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
There is no real...

506
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,660
That's, that's in line.

507
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,660
Yeah.

508
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:23,660
I don't know if he would stand by that today, but that makes sense for the way he acts.

509
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
Yeah.

510
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,660
Yeah.

511
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
Everything is fake.

512
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:32,660
If you start from the position of everything is fake, that leaves you with way more options

513
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,660
to occasionally accept things as being true.

514
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,660
If you start with the position that some things are true, for instance, Putin bombed his own

515
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,660
buildings, then eventually you're going to have to change your opinion whenever you change

516
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
your opinion about Putin.

517
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,660
And for normal people with shame, that's no good.

518
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,660
That's no good.

519
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Yeah.

520
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,660
And I think that Alex is so sneaky that when he says everything is fake, there's so many

521
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,660
different versions of fake that he has in his mind that you're like, okay, well...

522
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,660
No, the event actually happened and it wasn't orchestrated, but because they knew about

523
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,660
the drugging in advance, they had already prepared for it.

524
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,660
Somebody was on mind control drugs.

525
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

526
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,660
Absolutely.

527
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,660
And this clip actually got me into an interesting headspace.

528
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Okay.

529
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:24,660
The average person in the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, even the White House is a good person.

530
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,660
The average Democrat, the average Republican might be corrupt and might be a good old boy,

531
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,660
but compared to the cabals that run things, they are nothing.

532
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,660
And let's make this clear, that we have just a few thousand globalists and a few thousand

533
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,660
operatives who are carrying all of this out and then they have the scripts for the media

534
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,660
with the media ownership, they follow the agenda.

535
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,660
We have the power to save this country and, yes, the world if we have courage and stand

536
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
up and tell the truth.

537
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,660
That clip really helped me put into context why it's so much less painful to listen to

538
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Alex's show in 2003 as compared to the present day.

539
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,660
And that is there's a presentation of hope.

540
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,660
In 2003, most people, Democrats and Republicans, even people who work in the intelligence community

541
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,660
or in the White House, are good people.

542
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,660
It's just a couple thousand villains who are secretly orchestrating literally every

543
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,660
terrorist attack in the world and running all governments and financial systems.

544
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,660
It's ludicrous, but from the standpoint of gauging emotional states, there's a perspective

545
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,660
of optimism that you can kind of feel in the program.

546
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Compare that to the modern day where Alex's show is just fucking doom.

547
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,660
In this clip alone, you have a reminder that most people are good people and a confident

548
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,660
assertion that there's a good chance that the world can be saved.

549
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,660
Both of these are completely foreign concepts to Alex today.

550
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,660
Everyone who disagrees with him is a pedophile who works for Satan.

551
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,660
And even if the Patriots are successful, the globalists are still going to kill almost

552
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,660
everyone with a super bio weapon or whatever he feels like ranting about that day.

553
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:00,660
Part of the reason his show sucks so much in 2021 is that it's actively depressing.

554
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,660
Not just in the sense that it's depressing that someone would believe the nonsense that

555
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,660
he says, but the way the show is structured and the way information is conveyed is a

556
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,660
fucking drag.

557
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,660
I don't believe Alex when he talks about courage or honesty, but I think that he might

558
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,660
respect human life in 2003.

559
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Yeah, I mean, I...

560
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Here's what I would say, all right?

561
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,660
I don't think any show should last longer than, say, ten years.

562
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,660
Because here's... we're getting... this is what's happening.

563
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Iron Man, you're just fighting Hobodiah Stane.

564
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,660
That's the first movie.

565
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
You're just fighting some other guy.

566
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
It's a real small self-contained story.

567
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Twenty years later, half of the universe has disappeared.

568
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
You know what I'm saying?

569
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
It's the problem of escalation.

570
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
It's like The Simpsons.

571
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,660
They're talking about a family.

572
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,660
And then ten years later, it's like The Simpsons are going to the moon.

573
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,660
And it's like because you just can't keep going at the same level.

574
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,660
But what would happen if The Simpsons went to the moon?

575
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,660
I think everyone wants to know.

576
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
I think everybody does want to know.

577
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,660
But eventually, you're going to have to say that everybody's going to die.

578
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,660
If you start out with, there's a few thousand people.

579
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,660
Twenty years later, everybody has to die.

580
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,660
Like, it's just... yeah.

581
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,660
I think that you're right when it's...

582
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,660
I don't know if it's universal, but narrative fiction does have that way of

583
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,660
running into a problem of like, well, we've told this story already.

584
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
What other story are we going to tell?

585
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,660
What is Infowars but improvised narrative fiction?

586
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
No, I agree.

587
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,660
And I think that that is the same problem that Alex is running into.

588
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
How do you keep people excited?

589
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,660
Exactly.

590
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,660
Because I think that you can have other things like the McNeil Lehrer hour

591
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660
didn't go into it.

592
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,660
Sure, sure, sure.

593
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,660
I realize Carson was on the air for a while.

594
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Yeah, there's other forms of entertainment that don't have the same

595
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
escalatory problem.

596
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Nope, everything is faulty towers.

597
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,660
The end, two seasons, get out.

598
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,660
So here is a nice example of the continuing threat of Alex being

599
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,660
wrong in a way that he will soon learn is wrong.

600
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,660
And they are appointing bath party leaders to almost every position.

601
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,660
The people trained by the CIA in torture, espionage, oppression

602
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
in the 70s and 80s.

603
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,660
It is a CIA government.

604
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,660
They're appointing the scum again in Iraq.

605
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,660
So we've got these really consistent things that keep coming up on every show.

606
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Like Putin bombed the apartment buildings and they're putting the bath party

607
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,660
CIA agents in power.

608
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:32,660
I know it sounds like I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's constant.

609
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,660
Not like he's saying it every other minute, but it's every show these things

610
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,660
are touched on.

611
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,660
And they're both not at all, well one's just inaccurate, and then the other one

612
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,660
is something that is exactly the opposite of what Alex will later believe.

613
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Yeah, he doesn't know, we don't know yet that de-bathification is beginning.

614
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:00,660
No, I believe we're another week or so off of when that conversation starts.

615
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,660
Yeah, I mean it's close though.

616
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,660
I believe it's in May or roundabouts in 2003.

617
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,660
See, now this is one thing that is so frustrating about Alex is that

618
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,660
on that day that he does find out, I would like him to find out on air

619
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,660
and I would like him to deflate like a balloon.

620
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,660
I would like somebody to prick him and he just goes, ummm, like that.

621
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,660
But he's not going to do that, he's just going to include it in some other part

622
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,660
of some, he's going to say no, they're doing it publicly to get rid of baths

623
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,660
to make you forget that they're actually putting the CIA people in there.

624
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
It's unfortunate, I want him deflated.

625
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,660
This is wild, I mean we're on May 12th here and I just looked this up

626
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:45,660
and the first coalition provisional authority announcement that started

627
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,660
the process of de-bathification is the 16th.

628
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,660
So we're four days away from this as we look at Alex's...

629
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
Absolutely wild.

630
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,660
So I guess we'll, on a pretty soon episode, we'll find out how he pivots.

631
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:07,660
I don't know, I'm a little bit older than you and so in 2003 I was an adult.

632
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
Yeah, I was not yet.

633
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,660
I was a dignified, I was not.

634
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,660
No, you were not.

635
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,660
But I remember the conversation about Freedom Fries.

636
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,660
Yes, oh, I won't forget that one.

637
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,660
And Freedom Toast.

638
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Yep.

639
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,660
I wasn't even an adult yet and I knew that was fucking stupid.

640
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,660
People, particularly two members who are republicans in the house,

641
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,660
got mad about french fries and french toast being served in the cafeteria

642
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:41,660
because of course France had not agreed to join in with the invasion of Iraq

643
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
and they were cowards.

644
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Yeah, it's never not going to be surprising that we are governed by children.

645
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Yeah.

646
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Yeah.

647
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,660
To Alex's credit, he also thinks that whole Freedom Fry thing was stupid.

648
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,660
Good for him.

649
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Although...

650
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
Uh oh.

651
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
Mexico opposed the war.

652
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Well, why aren't you mad at them if you're mad at France?

653
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,660
France has three million Muslims by the way in it.

654
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,660
You know why they said no, they'd get attacked.

655
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
They didn't by their internal population.

656
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,660
It's just reached new levels of ridiculousness.

657
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Jeremy in Indiana, you're on the air.

658
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Thanks for holding.

659
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,660
Go ahead.

660
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
That's not great.

661
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
That's not cool.

662
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,660
I didn't even know there could be a racist reason for that being stupid.

663
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Yeah, I...

664
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,660
It's stupid because it doesn't mean anything.

665
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,660
It doesn't mean anything.

666
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,660
It's a Belgian waffle even if Belgium doesn't appreciate what you're doing.

667
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,660
Freedom waffle.

668
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
It doesn't matter.

669
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,660
It's stupid on its face because it doesn't mean anything.

670
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,660
It's an empty, meaningless, pointless gesture.

671
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,660
It's not somehow the cause of racism.

672
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Or you said, like, how is that possible?

673
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,660
All things considered, I think I would rather deal with

674
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,660
freedom fries and freedom toast than someone like Alex

675
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,660
who's perpetuating the idea that France made this geopolitical decision

676
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,660
to not get involved in the Iraq war at that point

677
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,660
because they were afraid of Muslim French people attacking from within.

678
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Yeah, there you go.

679
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
Yeah, yeah.

680
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,660
That's deeply Islamophobic and terrifying.

681
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:18,660
And it's at a point in his career when he has the presentation

682
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,660
of not being anti-Muslim.

683
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,660
He's certainly not as aggressively anti-Muslim as he is in the present.

684
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,660
But it seems like those latent things are there pretty clearly.

685
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
Definitely.

686
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
That's the level of shit where you're like,

687
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,660
there's just no way you won't take it back to racism.

688
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Just like, oh, you know, I think I need a new coffee maker.

689
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Well, that's because of, I don't want to know why,

690
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
but it's because my other one broke.

691
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,660
There's no other reason.

692
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,660
The other one just broke.

693
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
There's no people behind it.

694
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
Are you sure it's not the Turks?

695
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
No, damn it!

696
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
They're really involved in coffee.

697
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,660
There's no reason to be racist about this.

698
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,660
So one thing, I wish that I had musical ability.

699
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,660
Because if I did, long ago, I would have made a bumper

700
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,660
kind of Sting sound for the Alex telling a story that totally happened.

701
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
Sure, sure.

702
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Totally happened.

703
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Because we get them all over the place.

704
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Throughout his career, at any point, you're going to hear stories

705
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
that definitely happened.

706
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,660
All right, cue me right before you play the clip.

707
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,660
All right, right now.

708
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Alex's true story.

709
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,660
You know, I have state police majors walk up to me.

710
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,660
I walk into the cleaners.

711
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,660
And I randomly pull in to get my laundry.

712
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Oh, I put it in two weeks ago.

713
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,660
What I'm saying is it wasn't some stage deal

714
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,660
where the major and the state police was waiting to talk to me.

715
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,660
I'm driving back from the studio, a couple months ago,

716
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,660
decided to pull in to get my laundry just randomly.

717
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,660
And there's a state police officer in there getting his uniforms.

718
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,660
He goes, Moosker Jones, can you come outside, please?

719
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,660
And he goes, we were raised that this was the Soviet Union.

720
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
We know something's wrong.

721
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,660
The things we're being told are incredible.

722
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
And I go, how many of you are awake?

723
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,660
And he goes, most of the senior officers know something is wrong, Mr. Jones.

724
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,660
DPS intelligence is fully aware of what's happening.

725
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,660
And he goes, we know this isn't a conservative administration.

726
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,660
I mean, you know, cops come up to me at the mall.

727
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,660
They're doing security and telling me they know what's happening

728
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,660
with a tear in their eyes.

729
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,660
These cops come up to me.

730
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,660
This is true story.

731
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,660
They come up to me at the mall crying, telling me Bush isn't conservative.

732
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
We get it.

733
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Sir, Alex Jones, please free us from the Soviet Union we were raised in.

734
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,660
I saw your eyes get a little confused when he was talking about his laundry.

735
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
And I was a little bit confused as well.

736
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,660
But I realized that maybe he's talking about dry cleaning.

737
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Yeah, I was assuming dry cleaning.

738
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Yeah, yeah.

739
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
I was totally assuming that.

740
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
It seems weird to drop off laundry.

741
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
It's a strange random thing to do.

742
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,660
The time frame is really what was worrying to me.

743
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Yeah, that's true.

744
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
So yeah, this didn't happen.

745
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,660
So Alex takes a call at this point in the show.

746
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,660
And this was interesting.

747
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,660
This introduces a large theme that we'll run throughout the next couple days.

748
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
One more thing, if you don't mind.

749
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Sure.

750
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,660
These drills today that they're going to be doing in about 15 minutes, I guess.

751
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Yeah, the fake radiation attack in Seattle, stuff in Chicago,

752
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
all training you to be a federal slave.

753
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,660
These are supposed to take place for five days and raise the alert level, I'm told?

754
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,660
Well, yes.

755
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
Now during the drills, they're going to raise the alert level.

756
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,660
Amber Alert will be flashing.

757
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Report gun owners.

758
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Report terrorists.

759
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Yes.

760
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
And is this going to continue on for five days?

761
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,660
And are they going to treat us?

762
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Are they going to basically put us under martial law for this?

763
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
That's what this is, yes.

764
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,660
This is a practice drill for martial law.

765
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,660
When we get back, I will read you the article.

766
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,660
This is a bad answer on Alex's part, but I kind of see what he meant.

767
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,660
Alex meant that this drill was a part of preparing the public for martial law,

768
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,660
but what the caller was asking was whether or not the drill would continue past day five

769
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,660
into day six and day seven and so on.

770
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,660
Would the drill be how martial law literally started?

771
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,660
That was the question that was being asked.

772
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,660
Sure.

773
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,660
By replying in the affirmative, Alex was essentially telling this guy that this drill

774
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,660
was the beginning of enslavement, which is really bad.

775
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,660
It's hard for me to imagine that Alex misunderstood the question,

776
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,660
except in the case that he wasn't listening at all, which is totally possible.

777
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,660
Most likely.

778
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,660
So I found the after-action report for this drill released by the Washington State Department of Health.

779
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:39,660
This drill was called Top-Off 2, and it was meant to simulate a WMD attack simultaneously hitting multiple cities.

780
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,660
It began with a bioterrorist attack in Chicago and a dirty bomb going off in Seattle.

781
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
In addition to these challenges, quote,

782
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,660
a cyber event affecting the state's communication infrastructure hit the week before.

783
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,660
To further complicate the situation, a hostile takeover of the Washington State Ferry

784
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,660
and a hostage event in Pierce County, south of Seattle, were included.

785
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,660
That probably seems like overkill, but that's the point.

786
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,660
As the report explicitly says, quote,

787
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,660
in all, the event was meant to overwhelm local, state, and federal agencies

788
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,660
with the goal of finding ways to improve preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities in the future.

789
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,660
The goal was to create a fake situation that was too much to handle,

790
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,660
so you can stress test in a fake situation instead of a real one.

791
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,660
This bucket's not done. We're gonna fill it full of water to find out where the fucking holes are.

792
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,660
Yep. This simulation taught the Washington State Department of Health a bunch of important lessons.

793
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:34,660
For instance, they learned that their Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center had no reason to be on site,

794
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,660
since it, quote,

795
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:41,660
became mired in the response organization, which limited its ability to fully perform its work in off-site areas.

796
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:48,660
That's a pretty important lesson, but probably less critical than them learning that the infrastructure they had in place to transmit bulk data

797
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,660
was insufficient to handle the needs they faced in an emergency.

798
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,660
Maps and data tables that were critical to get to decision-makers were not effectively transmitted given their existing setup,

799
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,660
which is a huge issue that they were able to identify from this.

800
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,660
Uh, turns out, turns out using the Pony Express is not going to do it.

801
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize.

802
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,660
You gotta speed this up.

803
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Another thing that's important to understand is that this is just the after-action report for the Washington State Department of Health.

804
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,660
They didn't run the simulation. They were just one of the groups participating in it.

805
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,660
Each entity that took part, they played different roles in the simulation, and they faced different challenges,

806
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,660
and each came away with their own lessons, their own gaps in planning that they could resolve.

807
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,660
I found the after-action summary for the entire exercise from the Department of Homeland Security,

808
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,660
and the Washington Department of Health is just one of 47 state or local agencies that took part in the drill,

809
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:49,660
along with 41 federal agencies and 21 agencies from Canada that got involved because that bio-attack that hit Chicago,

810
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,660
it ended up spreading to Canada.

811
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,660
Oh, God damn it, Canada.

812
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,660
Yeah. I was reading over this summary, and there's an amazing piece on page 8,

813
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:03,660
where the exercise ended up teaching everyone who participated about the actual definitions that are in the Stafford Act,

814
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,660
which covers how federal assistance is deployed to states in an emergency.

815
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
They found...

816
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,660
I know we were supposed to read it before. I know.

817
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,660
No, they had read it, but it clarified a definition because they hadn't role-played this thing out.

818
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,660
Sure, sure, sure.

819
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,660
They found that as it was written, a terrorist bio-attack, quote,

820
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,660
does not clearly fit the existing definition of a disaster by the act.

821
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,660
This made it so the President couldn't issue a declaration of a disaster in the drill,

822
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,660
but instead the Secretary of HHS could only declare a public health emergency.

823
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,660
They didn't realize this beforehand.

824
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:41,660
From the report, quote, these two declarations illustrated some of the subtleties of the Stafford Act

825
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,660
that may not have been fully appreciated before the exercise.

826
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
Sure, sure.

827
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,660
There's a ton of value to organizations preparing like this,

828
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,660
using fake disasters to learn how to respond better to real disasters.

829
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,660
This exercise was followed by Top-Off 3, which took place in 2005

830
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,660
and expanded to fully include exercises being run by the Canadian and UK governments in collaboration.

831
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Cool, cool.

832
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:09,660
In that scenario, they came up with 15 scary terrorist ideas and chose three to simulate.

833
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,660
There was a terrorist release of a mnemonic plague in New Jersey,

834
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,660
a mustard gas IED attack in Connecticut,

835
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,660
and then the events in the UK and Canada, which this report doesn't specify,

836
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,660
and that really pissed me off because I want to know what games they were playing.

837
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Yeah, I want to figure it out.

838
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,660
Yeah, absolutely.

839
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,660
This was followed by Top-Off 4 in 2010,

840
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,660
and as of yet, this series of scenario planning exercises has not resulted in martial law.

841
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,660
You would think that if Alex's whole thing about how the globalists used these exercises

842
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,660
to launch their evil plans or something had any merit,

843
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,660
one of these would have resulted in something more nefarious than government employees learning things.

844
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,660
Yeah.

845
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,660
And honestly, I love reading these reports because it's like,

846
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,660
this would be my best day at work.

847
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,660
Yeah, that would be a good day at work.

848
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,660
If I worked in these areas, it would be so much fun.

849
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,660
Oh, totally.

850
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,660
It's the day at school where they're like, okay, today we're going to play Heads Up 7-Up.

851
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,660
You're like, yes, that's my favorite day in school.

852
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,660
Yeah, totally.

853
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,660
Or there was this thing called CASA in Missouri, in Columbia.

854
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,660
It was the Columbia Aeronautic and Space Association.

855
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,660
Okay.

856
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,660
And so what they would do is they would have students come,

857
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,660
and we would simulate running a spacecraft.

858
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,660
Oh, that's cool as shit.

859
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,660
Yeah, and so one of the stations was,

860
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,660
my memories of this are a little bit spotty,

861
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,660
but one of the stations was made to look like the actual shuttle.

862
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
And so you're in there and you'd have some responsibilities.

863
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Another one was command, the command center.

865
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,660
And so you were like...

866
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
You're Kobayashi Maru-ing it.

867
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Sure.

868
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Yeah.

869
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,660
And I remember that being, that's a day that sticks out to me in my head

870
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,660
from my entire elementary school career

871
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,660
because of just the excitement of going and role-playing this scenario

872
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,660
of trying to make sure we were able to communicate between the two.

873
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,660
And they obviously would throw some curve balls,

874
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,660
like something's going wrong.

875
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,660
Sure, yeah, of course.

876
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,660
You've got to fix something.

877
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
Yeah, it's excitement.

878
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,660
So much fun.

879
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:10,660
Yeah, we had a small six-foot-tall inflatable planetarium.

880
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,660
Mm-hmm.

881
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,660
You could see the stars.

882
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,660
Not quite as fun.

883
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,660
Not, no.

884
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
No, it wasn't.

885
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660
So, I don't know.

886
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,660
I got really into this, and I got furious that the Canadian

887
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,660
and UK scenarios weren't at me.

888
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,660
Yeah, that sounds pretty fun.

889
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,660
Talk about the document because I was like,

890
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,660
I want to know what they were facing.

891
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,660
I kind of want to see if we can orchestrate like a giant national

892
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,660
role-playing game where we just play the exact same thing,

893
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,660
but we're people inside of the simulations,

894
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,660
and we have to act like we're all dying.

895
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,660
One thing that I found that I actually kind of took a little bit of issue with

896
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,660
was that prior to this there was an exercise, the original Top Off exercise.

897
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,660
Sure, sure, sure.

898
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,660
And that one was unannounced, and so people didn't know it was happening.

899
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,660
Oh, man.

900
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,660
And I would say-

901
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,660
They've learned a lot of lessons from Top Off over the years.

902
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,660
The other ones were announced ahead of time.

903
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,660
Yeah, yeah.

904
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,660
And I don't know why they would do it unannounced.

905
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,660
Like, I mean, everyone who was participating knew.

906
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,660
Yeah, but I mean, that happened with the fucking United States Army

907
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,660
in Russia during the Cold War.

908
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,660
They were like, let's simulate bombing Russia,

909
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,660
and let's not tell Russia about it, you know?

910
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,660
They're dumb people.

911
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,660
It seems like not a wise-

912
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,660
It seems like a possibility for trouble.

913
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,660
Yeah.

914
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,660
Anyway, Alex gets another caller, and this guy brings up a question

915
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,660
about 9-11, and I found this to be troubling.

916
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,660
Well, you know, there's one question on 9-11,

917
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,660
so I just got your DVD last Friday.

918
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,660
I've only gone through it slowly, and then I'll go home and park.

919
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,660
But let me ask you, you say over and over again,

920
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,660
Al-Qaeda is a CIA type of trained people, correct?

921
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
Yes.

922
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,660
These types of people don't commit suicide.

923
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,660
Well, let me explain that.

924
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,660
A what?

925
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,660
We believe, all the evidence says, those people weren't even on those aircraft.

926
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,660
You know most of the hijackers have been found alive.

927
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,660
Stay there. We'll talk about all that.

928
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,660
A what now?

929
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,660
This is a great indicator of how seriously Alex takes research

930
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,660
into what's supposed to be his primary field of study, the truth about 9-11.

931
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,660
It's a regular talking point in the 9-11 conspiracy communities

932
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,660
that some of the accused hijackers have been found alive,

933
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,660
but anyone who's looked into this with any depth at all

934
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,660
could tell you that this is a simple case of mistaken identity

935
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,660
and the investigative process being judged in the middle,

936
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,660
as opposed to at its conclusion.

937
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,660
Yeah.

938
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,660
One of the men listed as a suspected hijacker was Walid Al-Shahiri,

939
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,660
and just after the FBI released a photo of him,

940
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,660
he made a pretty big effort to stress that they had the wrong guy.

941
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,660
He is a pilot in Saudi Arabia and had done flight training at the same school

942
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,660
in Daytona Beach that the other 9-11 hijackers had,

943
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,660
but he was definitely alive and was living in Morocco.

944
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,660
Sure, sure, sure.

945
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,660
Hi, I did not fly that plane on account of I am here.

946
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,660
So what happened here?

947
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,660
This was a simple case of mistaken identity.

948
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,660
One of the Flight 11 hijackers was named Walid Mohamed Al-Shahiri.

949
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,660
As the man who was alive protested his innocence,

950
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,660
the BBC made an error in their initial coverage,

951
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,660
reporting that a man listed as one of the hijackers was actually alive,

952
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,660
which, while technically accurate,

953
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,660
gave a different impression from what was actually going on.

954
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,660
If you just live and die by headlines and never look any deeper into things,

955
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,660
you could easily think that the person the FBI claimed was on Flight 11

956
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,660
was actually alive, but you would be wrong.

957
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,660
This is a super easy thread to untangle if you want to know what happened,

958
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,660
and certainly all of this information was fully available in 2003.

959
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,660
Sure.

960
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,660
There are a couple other people who were named as hijackers

961
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,660
who initial reports claimed were alive, who actually were alive,

962
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,660
like Abdulaziz Al-Omari and Salim Al-Hazimi.

963
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,660
These two men had something very specific in common,

964
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,660
which is that at some point in the not-too-distant past,

965
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,660
they had their passports stolen.

966
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
Al has me by a pickpocket in Cairo,

967
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,660
and Al-Omari in a burglary when he was living in Denver.

968
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,660
Sure, sure.

969
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,660
Each of the instances Alex has of supposed anomalies like this

970
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,660
are actually instances of bad, miscommunicated information

971
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,660
that he never followed up on.

972
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,660
Unlike Alex, reporters for Der Spiegel actually did look into

973
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,660
some of these coincidences to see what happened.

974
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,660
They reached out to John Bradley, the managing editor of Arab News,

975
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,660
where much of the initial reporting originated, who told them,

976
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,660
quote, all of this is attributable to the chaos that prevailed

977
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,660
during the first few days following the attack.

978
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,660
Yeah.

979
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,660
What we're dealing with are coincidentally identical names.

980
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,660
He also made it clear that these articles were being written after

981
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,660
September 14th, when the FBI had only released a list of names

982
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,660
of suspected hijackers.

983
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,660
If there's one area where Alex really needs to be sure he's covering his bases,

984
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,660
it should be 9-11 conspiracies.

985
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:51,660
But you can see here how sloppy his work is, even on this trademark subject.

986
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,660
Even in 2003, even about 9-11, you can't go deeper than headlines.

987
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,660
Yeah.

988
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:04,660
I can't imagine the terrible day you would have if your passport had been stolen

989
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:09,660
and then you woke up the next day and it was flying into a plane.

990
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,660
That would be a real bummer of a day for you.

991
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,660
Yeah.

992
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,660
Man, oh boy.

993
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,660
Yeah, and so there's a combination of a number of different reasons

994
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,660
for these mistaken identities.

995
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,660
There's some that's like identity theft, or at least very strongly

996
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,660
suspected identity theft.

997
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,660
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

998
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:35,660
And then some of it is this other element, this misreported similar names

999
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,660
or the same names.

1000
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,660
There's a lot of people in the world.

1001
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,660
Right.

1002
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,660
Some of them have the same names.

1003
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,660
Right, I don't.

1004
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,660
And that period of time between when the FBI released names

1005
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,660
and when they released photos, there was a great deal of confusion

1006
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,660
and sort of the fog of unclarity.

1007
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,660
As we see after every great disaster.

1008
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1009
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,660
So Alex takes another call and this one does not go well at all.

1010
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,660
I have one more question.

1011
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,660
I'm sorry to take so long.

1012
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,660
Are you aware of a guy by the name of William Cooper?

1013
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,660
Of course I am.

1014
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:06,660
Okay.

1015
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,660
I stole my career from him.

1016
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:13,660
There's something on his website and he has all his recordings from way back.

1017
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,660
Yeah, I know.

1018
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,660
But he has one thing about you being a liar.

1019
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,660
I understand, sir.

1020
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,660
That's a diversion.

1021
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,660
Total diversion.

1022
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,660
I appreciate your call.

1023
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,660
Frankly, my show is not about, and most other shows are,

1024
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,660
and that's why we never get anywhere,

1025
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:32,660
my show is not about what this talk show host says

1026
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:36,660
or what that talk show host says in the Patriot movement.

1027
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,660
I'm sorry.

1028
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,660
My show is not the gossip column.

1029
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,660
Even before it descended to the trash that it is now,

1030
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,660
even in 2009 he spent all his time yelling about Glenn Beck.

1031
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,660
Oh, man.

1032
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,660
So yeah, I mean, he quickly became the gossip column.

1033
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,660
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,660
Well, a lot of people, as he stated,

1035
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,660
a lot of people really like to listen to the gossip shows.

1036
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,660
It's true.

1037
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,660
So he was looking more for that.

1038
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,660
So this caller has made Alex introspective and he decides,

1039
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,660
well, the name William Cooper has been evoked on my show.

1040
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,660
I'd better lie about it.

1041
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,660
Okay.

1042
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,660
William Cooper became unstable in the last years of his life

1043
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,660
before he was gunned down by a SWAT team in his Arizona home.

1044
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,660
I called the guy up when he was in trouble with the IRS calling

1045
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,660
for help and said, I'd like to interview you.

1046
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,660
And he began cussing and yelling and saying,

1047
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,660
only I have the answers.

1048
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,660
Well, I want to just tell folks,

1049
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,660
I never got into UFOs and stuff you can't prove.

1050
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,660
Cooper did.

1051
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,660
And I don't know what Cooper's problem was,

1052
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,660
and I'm sad he's dead.

1053
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,660
I'm not going to sit here and talk about somebody who's dead.

1054
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,660
Here's the issue.

1055
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,660
Alex is totally right that Bill Cooper was incredibly unstable

1056
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,660
and was a nut.

1057
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,660
He's lying about the appearance on the show, though.

1058
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,660
We did an entire episode.

1059
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,660
Oh, I thought he was lying about how long William Cooper

1060
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,660
had been unstable for.

1061
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,660
Oh, yeah, probably a bit longer.

1062
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,660
The last few years of his life.

1063
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,660
Oh, boy, it was a lot longer than that.

1064
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,660
I think he did get much worse, though.

1065
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,660
Yeah, I believe that.

1066
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:01,660
Yeah, we did an episode that covered Bill Cooper's appearance

1067
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,660
on Alex's show, and it does not match up at all

1068
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,660
with the way that Alex presents it.

1069
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,660
Nope.

1070
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,660
Alex was an asshole to him, if anything.

1071
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,660
Yep, 100%.

1072
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,660
But, you know, Alex doesn't get...

1073
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,660
I'd be rich for a guy to criticize somebody

1074
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,660
getting into aliens later on in life,

1075
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,660
and then later on in life telling me

1076
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,660
that interdimensional beings are controlling the globalists.

1077
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,660
Oh, and, I mean, he says stuff that's even more ironic.

1078
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,660
So, see, what I do on this show is

1079
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,660
I don't talk about the visions that some prophet had

1080
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
out in the desert.

1081
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,660
Oh, no.

1082
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,660
He said the nukes are going to go off next week.

1083
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,660
No.

1084
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,660
And I don't talk about Planet X.

1085
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,660
And I don't talk about flying saucers.

1086
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,660
And I don't talk about psychics.

1087
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,660
Oh, no.

1088
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,660
And I don't talk about other talk show hosts,

1089
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,660
unless there's some national host, like Sean Hannity

1090
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,660
saying every child should take a microchip.

1091
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,660
Did I get Bingo?

1092
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,660
I have a video of Hannity and Combs.

1093
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,660
Or if it's Savage saying,

1094
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,660
put anyone who disagrees with the government

1095
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,660
in a forced labor camp.

1096
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,660
I occasionally break my rule for that.

1097
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:03,660
But I don't talk about rumors and trash.

1098
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,660
I don't talk about psychics, and then in the future,

1099
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,660
I'm a psychic.

1100
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,660
I'm a psychic.

1101
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,660
I'm a psychic.

1102
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,660
Come on, now.

1103
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,660
I don't talk about visions.

1104
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,660
I have visions all the time.

1105
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,660
Actually, the universe was revealed to me,

1106
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,660
and my prediction of 9-11 was actually based on a vision.

1107
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,660
I have dreams that are prophetic.

1108
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,660
Yeah, and a lot of the time, they happen

1109
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,660
whenever I'm out in the middle of nowhere.

1110
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,660
Ah, what a dick.

1111
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,660
What an asshole.

1112
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,660
So Alex takes another call,

1113
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,660
and this person brings up prison labor.

1114
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,660
Sure.

1115
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,660
This is bizarre, because I think that Alex's

1116
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,660
opposition to prison labor might not come from

1117
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,660
the same place that yours or mine might.

1118
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,660
Yeah, I would say slave labor is bad,

1119
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,660
and I somehow feel like Alex would disagree

1120
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,660
with me on that point.

1121
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,660
I think he agrees, but the reason why

1122
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,660
is where we get into a little bit of a...

1123
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,660
I saw him on a colloquy with Mark Saldor

1124
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,660
Thursday a week ago concerning the prison industries

1125
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,660
and how they're putting our small businesses

1126
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,660
out of business, so our people are not...

1127
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,660
A lot of good old boys, Jones, say,

1128
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,660
hey, make them prisoners work.

1129
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,660
The problem is most of the industry is now privatized.

1130
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,660
It is an industry.

1131
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,660
They're working for an average of 23 cents an hour

1132
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,660
competing against your jobs from the lumber

1133
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,660
to electronics to furniture to...

1134
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,660
To uniforms for our military.

1135
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,660
Customer service, everything.

1136
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,660
It's taking our jobs.

1137
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,660
It's slave camps.

1138
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,660
Exactly.

1139
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,660
Seven and a half million people in the system now.

1140
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,660
I think that opposition to prison labor

1141
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,660
shouldn't be it's putting other people out of business.

1142
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,660
Yeah, I would say that Alex is now a union man

1143
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:48,660
in about 1845 saying that slavery is great,

1144
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,660
but you're competing with our wages.

1145
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,660
Yeah, because it does imply that this kind of thing

1146
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,660
would be okay were it not to jeopardize

1147
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,660
the success of other businesses.

1148
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,660
Yeah, and I think...

1149
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,660
And I don't agree with that.

1150
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,660
The way to put it on an equal playing field

1151
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,660
is if they're competing with your business

1152
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,660
where you pay people, say, $9 an hour,

1153
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,660
what you should do is convert them into slaves for you

1154
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,660
and then everybody's on an equal playing field.

1155
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,660
That's Alex's solution, I think.

1156
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,660
I'm not sure if that is his solution.

1157
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,660
I think that's what he said.

1158
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:29,660
But I find this to be an unthought through position.

1159
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,660
Or at least...

1160
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,660
A psychopathic, self-involved, and beneficial solution.

1161
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,660
If that is where his opposition to prison labor

1162
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,660
and the system that is in place,

1163
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,660
if that is where it derives from, it's shallow.

1164
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:49,660
It has nothing to do with the act

1165
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,660
of making people in prison work for very low wages.

1166
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,660
Sure.

1167
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,660
Just not in industries that compete with American businesses, Dan.

1168
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,660
I don't like this.

1169
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,660
What makes you not like that?

1170
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,660
Anyway, so this caller has heard about a bill.

1171
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,660
Maybe. Possibly.

1172
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,660
Doesn't remember the bill, but it did something.

1173
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,660
And maybe it has to do with prison labor.

1174
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,660
Could be.

1175
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:18,660
Well, I wanted to give you the number of H.R. 1829.

1176
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,660
What does that bill do?

1177
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,660
Well, you know, to tell you the truth,

1178
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,660
I was away from my 50th class reunion.

1179
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:32,660
I didn't take notes, but Sauter and the other fellow, Mark Sauter and...

1180
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,660
Okay, what did they say the bill did?

1181
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,660
They were trying to restrict it in some way.

1182
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,660
So it's a bill that expands the prison industry.

1183
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,660
They admitted, oh, they're not for it.

1184
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,660
They're against it.

1185
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,660
Okay.

1186
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,660
And plus, they said that they're already,

1187
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,660
the government is already building new plants,

1188
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,660
new buildings for expansion of the plants.

1189
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,660
Yeah, I mean, what did camps do in Germany?

1190
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,660
You had a bunch of prisoners next door to a plant.

1191
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,660
Right.

1192
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,660
It's incredible.

1193
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,660
Joan, I appreciate the call.

1194
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:05,660
So that caller had sort of heard something about a bill,

1195
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,660
but didn't know what it did or really anything about it,

1196
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:12,660
but someone she'd heard talk about it kind of was maybe into it or maybe not.

1197
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,660
I don't know what was going on there.

1198
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,660
No, I appreciate anybody calling into a political talk show

1199
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,660
describing their political views very similarly

1200
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,660
to how my grandma would describe the movie that she just saw a couple of days ago.

1201
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,660
It was the one with the, and there were the people in it.

1202
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,660
What's the opposite of informative?

1203
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,660
Because that's what that was.

1204
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,660
Ooh, deformative?

1205
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,660
Maybe.

1206
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,660
So H.R. 1829 in the 108th Congress was also known

1207
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:43,660
as the Federal Prison Industries Competition and Contracting Act of 2003.

1208
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,660
Here's what that was about.

1209
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,660
There's a government-owned corporation called Federal Prison Industries,

1210
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,660
which is used to produce goods using the labor of incarcerated persons.

1211
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,660
I'll read to you here from the C.G.O. cost assessment of implementing this bill.

1212
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,660
Quote,

1213
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,660
Under current law, federal agencies are required to purchase products from F.P.I.

1214
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,660
if products are available to meet the agency's needs

1215
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,660
and the costs would not exceed current market prices.

1216
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,660
Such products include office furniture, textiles, vehicle tags, and fiber optics.

1217
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,660
Under the proposed legislation, this requirement would be reduced

1218
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,660
over the next several years, and the share of the federal market

1219
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,660
that F.P.I. holds for the products and services it provides

1220
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:26,660
would be limited to 20% and 5%, respectively.

1221
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,660
If you understand that text properly, what this bill would have done

1222
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:33,660
is actively reduce the government use of products created with prison labor.

1223
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,660
The bill aimed to divert some of this productive capacity

1224
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,660
towards making goods that would be donated to non-profit organizations

1225
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,660
instead of being sold to the government, which honestly still sucks.

1226
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,660
Additionally, there were provisions for funding of vocational training

1227
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:48,660
for incarcerated persons and funding for programs

1228
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,660
to test rehabilitative activities that could be productive towards helping.

1229
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,660
This caller has no idea what this bill is, and she's telling Alex about it

1230
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,660
as if it's something that expands the prison system when in actuality

1231
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,660
it was designed to limit the profits that are derived from prison labor

1232
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,660
and funneled a fair amount of money towards efforts to help people

1233
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,660
improve their lives while incarcerated.

1234
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,660
In the House, it's completely bizarre to see how split the vote on this was

1235
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,660
and not on party lines.

1236
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,660
It got yay votes from Steve King, Nancy Pelosi, and Mike Pence.

1237
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,660
Well, they all love slave labor.

1238
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,660
But it got nay votes from Maxine Waters

1239
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,660
and Walter No French Fries and My Cafeteria Jones.

1240
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,660
He was one of the guys who did the freedom fries thing.

1241
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:39,660
I am really struggling with the idea that somebody wrote into a bill

1242
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:46,660
before we've used 100% slave labor for our stuff,

1243
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:55,660
but now we want our slaves to make things to give to nonprofit organizations.

1244
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,660
Not 100%, but I get what you're saying.

1245
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:06,660
Can you write that down and think of that as not terrifying psychopathy?

1246
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,660
Yeah, it's weird.

1247
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,660
That's wild.

1248
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,660
What do you think Ron Paul voted?

1249
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,660
I'm going to go with Ron Paul voted.

1250
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,660
Wait, this would have restricted the amount that the government

1251
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,660
could have bought from their slaves, right?

1252
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,660
Yeah.

1253
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,660
Okay, so I'm going to go with Ron voted for it.

1254
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,660
He abstained from voting.

1255
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,660
Oh, god damn it. That's because it's screwed with his brain.

1256
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,660
He has to hate whatever Nancy Pelosi likes,

1257
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:36,660
but he also wants private businesses to...

1258
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,660
In the time of polarization that we're in now in the present day,

1259
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:47,660
it is really weird to look at this and see it being pretty mixed

1260
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,660
in terms of parties on each side.

1261
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,660
The bill ended up passing the House 350 to 65,

1262
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,660
but it died immediately upon being received by the Senate,

1263
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,660
and no action was taken on it.

1264
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,660
Cool.

1265
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
Good work, government.

1266
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,660
Way to do your jobs.

1267
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:09,660
So Alex ends up talking to this guy named Colonel Craig Roberts,

1268
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,660
and he's not the same person as Paul Craig Roberts,

1269
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:16,660
who's a weirdo and guy who wrote for VDARE.

1270
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,660
This dude is super into conspiracies like JFK.

1271
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,660
Sure.

1272
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,660
He loves Oklahoma City.

1273
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,660
Sure.

1274
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,660
And the Finders.

1275
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,660
Gotta love the Finders.

1276
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,660
He's big into the Finders.

1277
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,660
Yeah, absolutely.

1278
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,660
So they're talking about some child rings and stuff

1279
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,660
back in 2003.

1280
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,660
Okay.

1281
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,660
Alex isn't super into it, and it's not all that lascivious.

1282
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,660
Good.

1283
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,660
And he doesn't bring up Epstein, so that's interesting.

1284
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:39,660
So he didn't know about Epstein.

1285
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,660
He might have.

1286
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,660
Could have.

1287
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,660
It's not proof that he doesn't.

1288
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,660
True.

1289
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,660
But it's not something that comes up immediately.

1290
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,660
Although Alex does say this in their interview.

1291
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,660
It's like, ugh, come on.

1292
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,660
Governments always get corrupt individuals in control of them.

1293
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,660
They always seek to maintain control and expand that control.

1294
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,660
They always flip out and get on power trips and start exterminating their populations

1295
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,660
for no reason other than the fact that they serve their father.

1296
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,660
We know who that is.

1297
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:10,660
God damn it.

1298
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,660
Infuriating.

1299
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,660
Okay.

1300
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,660
Still could be a metaphor.

1301
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,660
It's very unsatisfying.

1302
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,660
That's dark.

1303
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,660
How dare he say that?

1304
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:24,660
Stop tippy-toeing around it and dip your balls into Jesus, okay?

1305
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,660
Let's go for it.

1306
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,660
He still talks about Jesus from time to time.

1307
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,660
I'm less interested in him being religious.

1308
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,660
Right, right, right.

1309
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,660
Which does exist.

1310
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,660
Certainly not as extremist and overt as it is in the present.

1311
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,660
Sure, sure.

1312
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,660
But I'm not interested in that.

1313
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:47,660
I'm interested in specifically the literalness of his waging war against the devil.

1314
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,660
That like turning into a televangelist type deal.

1315
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,660
Yes, yes.

1316
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,660
Where everything we're doing is a fight against the literal Christian devil, you know?

1317
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:02,660
So the Craig Roberts and Alex have a conversation that it hits on a number of kind of like,

1318
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,660
I don't care, kind of conspiracy topics.

1319
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,660
Sure, sure.

1320
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:10,660
And it's, you know, it hits a lot of bases that we've hit before.

1321
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:16,660
And I'm not so much interested in a lot of that minutia because of stuff like this.

1322
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,660
Once they put laws into effect, they can say,

1323
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,660
well this law is going to sunset for a certain time.

1324
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,660
Well a Brady law sunsetted and it didn't go away.

1325
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,660
The assault weapons ban sunsetted.

1326
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:30,660
Patriot Act One sunsetted, but now they're saying they're going to get rid of that sunset.

1327
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,660
These dudes are being super dishonest about the subject they're covering here.

1328
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,660
For one thing, this episode is in 2003,

1329
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:42,660
over a year before the federal assault weapons ban is set to hit its sunset date.

1330
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:46,660
Alex is saying that the ban's sunset provision had just been ignored, which is a lie.

1331
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,660
And even if he was just saying that they were going to ignore the sunset provision in the future,

1332
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,660
he would be wrong.

1333
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,660
The Patriot Act was not subject to a complete sunset clause,

1334
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,660
but various sections of the bill were.

1335
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:02,660
However, the sunset date for that bill was December 31, 2005,

1336
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,660
more than two years in the future from the point that Alex is speaking here.

1337
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,660
In terms of this one, it's a little bit more of a complicated picture.

1338
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,660
I'm not in favor of the Patriot Act,

1339
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,660
but I don't think that attacking it from the standpoint of sunset clauses

1340
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,660
is a particularly effective approach.

1341
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,660
There have been multiple bills over the years that reexamined

1342
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,660
and reauthorized various provisions and amended some of them as well.

1343
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,660
This is a common aspect of bills that have sunset clauses.

1344
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,660
You know, it's not like they have a self-destruct clause.

1345
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,660
The idea is to set a date in the future to reassess whether or not

1346
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,660
the particular bill is worth continuing.

1347
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:35,660
You can take issue with the decision to reauthorize the Patriot Act,

1348
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,660
but pretending that reauthorizing it is somehow cheating?

1349
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,660
That's a silly argument.

1350
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,660
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

1351
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,660
Both of these examples that Alex uses to make his point that the bills,

1352
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:48,660
they have these sunset clauses, they just never go away,

1353
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,660
they're bills that haven't reached their sunset dates yet.

1354
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,660
He's just making this shit up.

1355
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:56,660
Now, the case of the Brady Bill is actually a little bit more interesting.

1356
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:00,660
The bill was first introduced in 1987 and was constantly a non-starter.

1357
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,660
The Reagan administration didn't appear all that interested in it,

1358
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,660
and Congress had a lot of trouble with getting it to a floor vote,

1359
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,660
so they would tend to attempt to attach it to larger crime bills,

1360
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,660
which ended up being a losing strategy.

1361
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:16,660
All this changed when Bill Clinton was elected in 1992

1362
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
and voiced support for the Brady Bill

1363
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:22,660
and indicated that he was willing to sign it if it was passed.

1364
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,660
This changed the landscape, and the bill made its way through Congress.

1365
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,660
Part of the negotiation to get the bill through Congress

1366
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:32,660
had to do with the mandatory waiting periods the bill put in place for gun purchases.

1367
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,660
With the technology available at the time,

1368
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,660
it could take a while to run a background check,

1369
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,660
so a five-day period was included in the bill.

1370
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:41,660
However, gun proponents wanted to strike a deal.

1371
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:45,660
Their long-standing argument was that a provision should exist

1372
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,660
that this waiting period would be made null and void

1373
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,660
once the technology existed for an instant-check system.

1374
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:54,660
This made some sense, given that the waiting period was largely predicated

1375
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,660
on the technological inability to do the checks quicker.

1376
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,660
Instead of this compromise, what was decided was that

1377
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,660
the waiting-period provision of the bill would have a sunset clause

1378
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,660
that would kick in in five years

1379
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:08,660
whether or not there was an instant-check system that worked.

1380
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:13,660
This satisfied both sides, and the bill passed the House and Senate in November 1993.

1381
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,660
The Brady bill itself didn't have a sunset clause.

1382
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,660
This provision of it did.

1383
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,660
The larger bill was permanent, and put in place requirements for background checks

1384
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,660
for gun sales made by federally licensed gun sellers.

1385
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:29,660
In 1998, the NICS system was developed, and that kind of made this whole question moot.

1386
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,660
The sunset clause came and went,

1387
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,660
and now there is no federal waiting period required for purchasing a gun.

1388
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,660
Each state has the right to make their own rules on that,

1389
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,660
and according to a recent article from ABC News,

1390
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:42,660
ten states and the District of Columbia have waiting periods,

1391
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,660
whereas most states do not.

1392
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,660
Alex and Craig Roberts are covering the subject from a completely dishonest perspective.

1393
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,660
Alex is just making stuff up,

1394
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,660
and Craig is pretending that the entire Brady bill was set to sunset

1395
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,660
when in fact it was just the specific provision which did in fact go away.

1396
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,660
I understand that there's staunch opponents of any kind of gun regulation,

1397
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,660
but covering the material this inaccurately feels like it's a disservice

1398
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,660
to sincere people who care about gun rights,

1399
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,660
and it leads me not to take the stuff that they're saying all that seriously about any other issues.

1400
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:14,660
Yeah, that's frustrating. That's very frustrating.

1401
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,660
I don't like it. I don't like it.

1402
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,660
Also, I don't like that the waiting period expired.

1403
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,660
I think that's stupid.

1404
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,660
At the very least, at the very least, here's what we should have.

1405
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,660
No bad days waiting period.

1406
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,660
You can't have a bad day and then go buy a gun.

1407
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,660
You gotta wait at least until your bad day is over.

1408
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:34,660
You know what I'm saying?

1409
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,660
Yeah, I do. I understand that position,

1410
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,660
and I think that states that decide to pass those things are well within their right.

1411
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,660
Makes sense.

1412
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:48,660
The idea of not having a federal mandated waiting period doesn't seem that weird to me.

1413
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:53,660
As long as the background check system does work and it is effective,

1414
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:59,660
which I'm not positive it's fully operational and does a perfect job,

1415
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:04,660
yeah, I don't know. I can see both sides of it, but I don't know.

1416
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,660
I think on a state level it's fine for that to be where that lives.

1417
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,660
Sure, sure, I see that.

1418
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,660
Let's call it the no breakfast of champions law.

1419
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:19,660
You can't have a sudden outbreak of a syphilitic breakdown and buy a gun on the same day.

1420
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,660
I think that's fine.

1421
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,660
Yeah, in a perfect world I would be alright with that.

1422
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,660
Okay, good. We have come to compromise.

1423
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,660
Sure.

1424
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:31,660
Now, Jordan, it's time for you to play the theme song for our new segment.

1425
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,660
Alright, Alex's True Story.

1426
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:43,660
The one time I got death-threaded by the government was when Judge Walter Smith in Waco case wouldn't allow a jury.

1427
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:47,660
And I don't know who did it, but obviously it was from that quarter.

1428
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:53,660
And I went and we protested, we pointed this out, I was billing that Branch Davidian Memorial Church,

1429
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,660
and they got very mad.

1430
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:58,660
And I got little messages that couldn't come from anywhere but the government.

1431
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:01,660
You know, the whole voice changer bit, the whole thing.

1432
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,660
You know, the stuff from horror movies.

1433
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:03,660
Anybody can do that.

1434
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,660
Stuff from spy movies.

1435
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,660
The news does that.

1436
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,660
I love my country, you know, so be it.

1437
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:08,660
I told them.

1438
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,660
Whatever, you know, I don't know.

1439
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,660
And I've been left alone.

1440
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:17,660
I don't believe Alex's version of this story or that it happened,

1441
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:26,660
but even if you take Alex at his word, in 2003 he had only been threatened once.

1442
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:35,660
I just don't like that I know for a fact that they've been doing TV interviews with voice modulators and everything.

1443
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,660
Oh, they haven't.

1444
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,660
Yes, they have since the 80s.

1445
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,660
Oh, they haven't.

1446
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:40,660
Even before that.

1447
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,660
And Alex is like, only the government has that capability.

1448
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,660
Yeah, no one else has a voice box thing.

1449
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,660
Yeah, absolutely not.

1450
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,660
No, no, no.

1451
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,660
There was a fucking vocoder for Peter God-

1452
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,660
This is really high-tech stuff, all right?

1453
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,660
Only the feds have this.

1454
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:06,660
So he's talking, Alex is talking to Craig Roberts, and this clip really, really was a big problem for me.

1455
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,660
Well, remember Chandra Levy, this was even on Fox and CNN.

1456
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:14,660
It ended when it broke that she was involved in some type of weird satanic sex call.

1457
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,660
Did you hear that, Colonel?

1458
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,660
Yeah, and that didn't surprise me either because of all these other findings we have.

1459
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:25,660
And there is a huge satanic underground movement that's linked to the homosexual community in Washington, D.C.

1460
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:29,660
And we're not the only ones saying this. I mean, this stuff pops up on TV.

1461
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:30,660
Oh, yeah.

1462
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:36,660
Well, here's the first real indication that I've seen that maybe Alex does think he's up against the literal devil at this early stage in his career.

1463
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,660
This one sounds pretty serious.

1464
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:43,660
It's still not nearly as overt as he is now, but it's getting close to being disturbing.

1465
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:48,660
The issue that I run into is that based on what Alex is saying, he could very well think that he's fighting a group of Satanists,

1466
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,660
and at the same time not think that he's fighting the minions of the literal Christian devil.

1467
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,660
True.

1468
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:58,660
He could just think that these Satanists are idiots doing dark, pointless rituals to a non-existent deity,

1469
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,660
so I regret to inform you that this is not conclusive enough for me to call this case closed.

1470
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,660
True.

1471
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:08,660
So I was interested in the idea that Chandra Levy, be it, was involved in a satanic sex cult.

1472
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:12,660
This was news to me, so I decided to poke around and see what Alex is talking about.

1473
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,660
It was also news to me.

1474
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:21,660
This was not a story that broke in the mainstream news, and the reason people stopped talking much about Levy and Gary Condit was because 9-11 happened.

1475
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:26,660
It wasn't like the media was worried that people would learn of a secret satanic sex cult, so they buried the story.

1476
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,660
9-11 happened.

1477
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:33,660
It was, well, I mean, that was, it, look, that happened in the morning.

1478
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,660
Otherwise it was a slow news day.

1479
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:42,660
I would imagine that not a lot that ranked happened that day after, yeah, I could see that.

1480
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:49,660
So this is a bit confusing, but it appears that this traces back to a post on the website of a guy named Tex Mars.

1481
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:57,660
This is upsetting for a number of reasons, and one of them actually dovetails with this stupid conspiracy that Alex is raising here on this episode.

1482
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:07,660
Tex Mars died in 2019, but up to that point he was an incredibly prolific conspiracy theorist and extremist Christian speaker, coincidentally also based in Austin.

1483
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:16,660
Perhaps one of the most distinctive traits of his, though, is a very clear, very deep, and very consistent anti-Semitism.

1484
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:22,660
Tex still has a website running, and if you go there, you can purchase audio tapes of some of his lectures.

1485
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:25,660
Or maybe they're preaching? I don't know.

1486
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:34,660
Allow me to read some of the titles that you can buy, which I was tempted to buy, but I'm not going to give this asshole or his estate a penny.

1487
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:42,660
Who killed Jesus? How cowardly lukewarm Christians are abandoning the truth and ripping passages out of the Bible in a futile attempt to appease the Jews.

1488
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:45,660
Was that a sequel to Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

1489
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:46,660
Nope.

1490
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,660
Here's another one.

1491
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:50,660
All hail the Jewish master race!

1492
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:53,660
I think that sounds weirdly positive, honestly.

1493
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,660
Here's a little snippet of the description of that one.

1494
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:56,660
OK.

1495
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:01,660
Quote, first the Romans asserted their superiority. Then came the Nazis and their exalted Aryan race.

1496
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:06,660
Now, now it's the Jews who claim to be the master race.

1497
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:14,660
Tex Mars exposes those would-be gods on Earth for what they are. Arrogant, power-grubbing people ferociously opposing God's truth.

1498
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,660
Please, one quick second.

1499
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,660
So here's another one.

1500
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:25,660
Quote, Obama tells Jews no more. The president finally stands up to the world's tormentors.

1501
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:29,660
What a weird thing to support Obama for.

1502
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,660
This one was apparently about Rahm Emanuel leaving the administration.

1503
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,660
Sure. Good for Rahm Emanuel, I guess.

1504
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:38,660
One of them is called, quote, famous anti-Semites whom I admire.

1505
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,660
Interestingly, Ron Paul.

1506
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,660
That's just a diary entry.

1507
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,660
Yeah.

1508
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:47,660
That is just a diary entry. How dare you. Don't you just list that shit. Buzzfeed. Fuck you.

1509
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,660
He includes Ron Paul on his list.

1510
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,660
Oh, wow. Ron Paul is great at anti-Semitism.

1511
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:58,660
Then there's one called, quote, chimeras, monsters, pizza gate, and the satanic hoodwink of America and the world.

1512
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:01,660
That sounds like a pretty regular TED Talk, to be honest.

1513
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:07,660
The description includes, quote, Jewish scientists are working on DNA that will be inserted into the mind of every person at birth,

1514
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:11,660
ending anti-Semitism forever and creating new races that will love Jews.

1515
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:16,660
That's almost a legitimate possible solution for Jews. I think they should try that one.

1516
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:20,660
One more is called, quote, should Christians burn the Jewish Talmud?

1517
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:21,660
No.

1518
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:25,660
Now, I don't want to order or listen to this one, but I'm guessing the answer Tex comes to is yes.

1519
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:31,660
Based on how the description ends. Quote, if Tex Mars were to declare an international burn the Talmud day,

1520
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,660
would you be there to help him toss these trashy devil volumes into the bonfire?

1521
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,660
Um.

1522
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,660
Sure.

1523
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,660
Uh.

1524
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,660
Do the people burning holy books think they're the good guys?

1525
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,660
Tex does.

1526
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,660
Oh, okay.

1527
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,660
Also, I should point out that his website also sells a bunch of books about how the Holocaust didn't happen,

1528
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,660
including one by a guy named Brian A. Lewis Sherlebot.

1529
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:57,660
That middle name's probably a coincidence, right?

1530
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,660
That could be.

1531
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,660
Probably a coincidence.

1532
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,660
Could be. I doubt there's anything to do with it.

1533
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,660
Oh, boy.

1534
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:10,660
Tex Mars is a giant pile of shit, and one of the things that's the most constant theme of his is that Judaism is synonymous with Satanism.

1535
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,660
It's something that constantly comes up in his lecture titles.

1536
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:21,660
One is just called, quote, inventors of evil things, how the Jews created Freemasonry, Illuminism, Communism, Satanism, Witchcraft,

1537
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:24,660
and the New Age movement, and what they're up to now.

1538
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,660
The description of that tape includes this.

1539
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:32,660
Quote, Jesus said of the Jews, you are of your father the devil, and he spoke absolute truth.

1540
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:34,660
The historical record is clear.

1541
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:36,660
Wow. Good work, Bible.

1542
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:41,660
Now, this also takes us back to earlier, when Alex used, you know, you are of your father.

1543
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,660
Little bit.

1544
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:43,660
Little bit of...

1545
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:44,660
Might be some crossover.

1546
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,660
...troubling parallels.

1547
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,660
Could be something to do with that.

1548
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:52,660
For someone like Tex Mars, all roads lead back to Jewish people being behind the conspiracies that he promotes.

1549
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,660
His brand is antisemitism.

1550
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,660
It's just impossible to engage with his material and not understand that.

1551
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:06,660
So if Alex, taking this conspiracy about Chandra Levy being involved in satanic sex cults, you know, that's from Tex Mars's website,

1552
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:14,660
if he's taking that seriously, that's an indication of a very serious trend towards antisemitic content on Alex's part in this period.

1553
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:18,660
Tex wrote at least two columns about Chandra Levy's disappearance and murder,

1554
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,660
and thankfully these are not behind a paywall, so I could read them.

1555
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,660
They're fucking ridiculous.

1556
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,660
Okay.

1557
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:28,660
One attempts to make the argument that Levy was a secret Mossad agent.

1558
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,660
Okay.

1559
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:35,660
Quote, an accumulation of evidence indicates that the 24-year-old Levy was a youthful recruit in the Israeli Mossad,

1560
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,660
that nation's premier spy agency.

1561
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:44,660
In that capacity, she had served as an intern at the executive offices of California Governor Gray Davis, an Illuminati initiate,

1562
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:49,660
and that is where she first met Mr. Condit, also an Illuminati servant.

1563
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,660
This falls just short of being convincing.

1564
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:54,660
Is that an accumulation of evidence or just like a-

1565
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:55,660
It's piling up.

1566
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,660
Yeah, okay.

1567
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:01,660
Tex, based on literally no evidence other than his imagination, decides that as a Mossad agent,

1568
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:08,660
Chandra had insinuated herself in Gary Condit's life, then used him to get herself access to the CIA headquarters.

1569
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:13,660
There, she learned of the Illuminati's plan to use fake Islamic terrorists to do 9-11,

1570
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,660
and thus she had to be killed so she couldn't spill the beans.

1571
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,660
Wow, she's good.

1572
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,660
Tex puts it this way.

1573
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:24,660
Quote, as horrifying as the question may be, one must now contemplate the mind-numbing possibility-

1574
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,660
No.

1575
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:29,660
That Chandra Levy very well may have been victim to a darkly vicious satanic force.

1576
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:30,660
Damn.

1577
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,660
My response to this is, must one?

1578
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,660
Yes.

1579
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,660
I don't think one must contemplate that possibility.

1580
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,660
I don't know, have you started contemplating it yet?

1581
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,660
I have.

1582
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,660
Okay, see, then you did.

1583
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,660
According to Tex, these darkly vicious satanic forces are the work of, quote,

1584
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:50,660
DC's exclusive satanic brotherhood, to which he claims literally all members of Congress have to be a part.

1585
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,660
Not that exclusive.

1586
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:58,660
When Tex Mars is discussing these satanic forces, you'd have to be a monumental idiot to not understand he's demonizing Jewish people.

1587
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,660
Yeah.

1588
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:02,660
It's really fucking obvious if you know anything about his work.

1589
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:07,660
You could just check out his lecture titled, quote, The Jews Are Preparing a Grave for America,

1590
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:14,660
which warns that, quote, powerful Jewish interests have a stranglehold on American government, the economy, and our culture.

1591
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,660
We are in grave danger!

1592
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,660
What's the anti-Semitic about that?

1593
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:25,660
On the one hand, it's kind of intriguing to have this first step towards Alex talking about his feelings about the devil and Satanism in 2003.

1594
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:31,660
But on the other, and much more serious hand, it's a real problem when you pull the thread of what he's talking about

1595
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:37,660
and it leads back to another Austin-based conspiracy theory who believes that Satanism is a plot of the Jews.

1596
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:45,660
Yeah, it would be hard to believe that, living in Austin simultaneously, no one brought him up to Alex.

1597
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:50,660
No one brought this guy up, so Alex has no idea who this is, and this is all coming from his own brain.

1598
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,660
I know that Tex Mars has been on Alex's show before.

1599
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,660
Of course.

1600
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:59,660
Yeah, although I don't think that he plays as much of a role in later times.

1601
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:05,660
I know that the name has come up, but one of the problems is there's another guy who's a conspiracy theorist named Jim Mars.

1602
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,660
Damn.

1603
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:15,660
I know he was on Alex's show a lot, and I think that Tex Mars had a lesser, but definitely a still-existing presence.

1604
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,660
Right.

1605
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:19,660
And they both created M&Ms together?

1606
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:20,660
Mm-hmm.

1607
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,660
Mm-hmm.

1608
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,660
Good joke.

1609
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:32,660
Sorry. That was shitty.

1610
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:38,660
So yeah, I'm really troubled by this.

1611
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:47,660
I did not expect that the first sort of fuller overture towards talking about satanic forces and what have you

1612
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:53,660
would be in the context of a story that was widely disseminated primarily by Tex Mars,

1613
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:59,660
who has a tendency towards satanism and stuff being coded ways for him to be antisemitic.

1614
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1615
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:07,660
That leads me to be very worried about how much more antisemitic Alex's show may have been in the past.

1616
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,660
Yeah, it does seem like...

1617
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:13,660
And it's making me clear that I need to, when I'm looking at these past episodes,

1618
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,660
I need to be a little bit more cognizant of that.

1619
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:17,660
Right, right.

1620
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:23,660
Because the question could be raised like, with the globalists,

1621
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:30,660
is he stealing obviously effective antisemitic propaganda in order to rebrand it

1622
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:34,660
and use what is a very effective way to make his own money?

1623
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,660
Right.

1624
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:42,660
Or is he antisemitic and he's just camouflaging that same propaganda under the term globalists?

1625
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:43,660
Yeah.

1626
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:46,660
So it's that kind of appropriation versus...

1627
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:50,660
It's a question that we've never really been able to find definitive answers to.

1628
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:51,660
Right.

1629
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,660
This does seem like a good...

1630
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,660
It's more troubling.

1631
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,660
Yeah.

1632
01:19:55,660 --> 01:20:02,660
Because I don't believe that anybody, anybody could engage with the work that Tex Mars puts out

1633
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:06,660
and not be aware of the particular character of antisemitism.

1634
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,660
Yeah.

1635
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,660
And a bunch of other stuff too, anti-Catholic.

1636
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,660
He just hates a lot of people.

1637
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:14,660
But I don't think that you could.

1638
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:21,660
And for Alex to, you know, seem to take information from his website seriously,

1639
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:24,660
it makes you worried about what other stuff he might.

1640
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,660
Yeah, that's not good.

1641
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:26,660
Yeah.

1642
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,660
That's not good.

1643
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:32,660
So we now jump to the 13th because they have such a good time, Craig and Alex,

1644
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,660
that they just take calls and...

1645
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,660
Sure.

1646
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,660
It's boring.

1647
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:37,660
Yeah.

1648
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,660
So we jump to the 13th and overnight there was a bombing in Saudi Arabia.

1649
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,660
There was a series of bombings.

1650
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,660
And based on nothing, Alex has decided that this was a false flag.

1651
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:47,660
Sure.

1652
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:48,660
Sure.

1653
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,660
And he has a list of suspects.

1654
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:50,660
Go for it.

1655
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:51,660
Now, this could be the CIA.

1656
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:52,660
It could be Mossad.

1657
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:58,660
Or it really could be Palestinians that got into the country, got explosives and did this.

1658
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:01,660
There are real suicide bombers.

1659
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,660
There are real terror groups.

1660
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,660
They are few and far between.

1661
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:06,660
We don't know right now.

1662
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,660
We probably never will.

1663
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:12,660
We know Vladimir Putin blew up three apartment buildings to get martial law going in Russia.

1664
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,660
That's admitted though.

1665
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,660
So that keeps going.

1666
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:15,660
Yeah.

1667
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,660
Again.

1668
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:17,660
Yeah, you just gotta toss that in there.

1669
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,660
Yeah, that's pretty constant.

1670
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:25,660
It is a really great example of a false flag effectively turning a man into a dictator.

1671
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,660
So, there's that.

1672
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:31,660
Yeah, so Alex has these suspects for this bombing and it's just based on nothing.

1673
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:38,660
Like, he has nothing to demonstrate or prove that this was in any way anything other than

1674
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,660
suicide bombings.

1675
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,660
I don't know.

1676
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,660
It feels like maybe it's the CIA or Mossad.

1677
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,660
Yeah, probably.

1678
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,660
Feels like it could be, Dan.

1679
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:54,660
So, one of the things that we've heard Alex say in various periods of time is conditional

1680
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,660
acceptance of wars of regime change.

1681
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,660
Sure, sure.

1682
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1683
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,660
It's something he actually really does believe.

1684
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:06,160
You know, if the government was leaving our liberties alone, leaving our guns alone, leaving

1685
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,660
our freedoms alone, controlling our borders, and they said, let's invade Iraq because they're

1686
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:11,660
bad.

1687
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,660
Let's invade Syria, Iran.

1688
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:16,140
I could say, well, that violates what George Washington said.

1689
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,140
But you know what?

1690
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,580
You can't really argue with it too much.

1691
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,980
If they were really bringing freedom and all this, but they're not.

1692
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,980
They're mowing down protesters.

1693
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,700
They're giving them $20 a month to live on.

1694
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:26,940
They're totally enslaving them.

1695
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,420
They're grabbing all the oil.

1696
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,300
They're enslaving us here domestically.

1697
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:35,940
They got gun bills that dwarf all gun control ever seen that Bush says he's gonna sign.

1698
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:41,180
Again, this is the same thing as the thing about prison labor.

1699
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:46,220
It's somebody who has the same position as you being opposed to prison labor or being

1700
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:53,780
opposed to the war in Iraq, but the reasons are not the same, and that's bad.

1701
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:57,700
Because Alex is conditionally fine with regime change wars as long as people will just leave

1702
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,700
him alone.

1703
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,700
Yeah.

1704
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,700
No, no, no.

1705
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:01,700
Apartheid is bad.

1706
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,700
Sometimes.

1707
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:03,700
That's not a good take.

1708
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,700
That's not a good take, Dan.

1709
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:05,700
No.

1710
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,700
Not a good take.

1711
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,020
No, because if you solve the wrong problem, then the bigger problem is okay.

1712
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:11,020
It's still there.

1713
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,020
Hooray.

1714
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,020
It's okay with Alex.

1715
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,020
Yeah.

1716
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,020
Yeah.

1717
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:16,020
No, we can't have a dictator in this country.

1718
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,500
Well, I mean, we can have my dictator.

1719
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,500
Yeah.

1720
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,500
That's a good dictator.

1721
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,780
I don't mind a dictator as long as they leave me alone.

1722
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:23,100
It's gotta be my dictator who's gonna do what I say.

1723
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,100
Yeah.

1724
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,100
That's how I want things to work.

1725
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,860
I tell people how to live.

1726
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:32,980
Now, I should tell you, I have studied everything about tyranny and I am probably the only person

1727
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:37,660
who really understands it and is a voice against all forms of despotism.

1728
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,740
Except for the women that I do.

1729
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,740
Right.

1730
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,260
Because if you do my dictatorship, you'll never have another dictator.

1731
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,260
Yeah.

1732
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,260
Duh.

1733
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:50,700
And I think that this is indicative of the shallowness of Alex's opposition and the shallowness

1734
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:57,340
of his beliefs, at least surrounding the issues that he presents himself as being on the marquee

1735
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,340
of that.

1736
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,340
100 certain.

1737
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,340
Yeah.

1738
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,340
Yeah.

1739
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,340
Yeah.

1740
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,340
Yeah.

1741
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,340
It's really troubling to me.

1742
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:08,140
And one of the things that I can't really get past is like how obvious it is listening

1743
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:13,060
to this, that even if you didn't know that Alex turned into the biggest piece of shit

1744
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:14,060
in the world.

1745
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:15,060
Right.

1746
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,260
If I heard him say that back then, I would be like, wait a second.

1747
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:20,260
Sure.

1748
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,260
Wait a second.

1749
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:25,900
You would be fine with this war if you didn't have your guns hypothetically needing to be

1750
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:26,900
registered?

1751
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,980
I don't know.

1752
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:28,980
You know?

1753
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:29,980
That's one of those things.

1754
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:37,000
And I think what it is not so much that as it is like I think about going back and watching

1755
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,660
a movie from the 90s now and stuff pops up and you're like, I remember this movie as

1756
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:43,660
being one thing.

1757
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,660
Yeah.

1758
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,940
And now I saw this and I'm like, holy shit.

1759
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:47,940
That's definitely true.

1760
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:51,860
I think if you give somebody the benefit of the doubt, especially during the time period,

1761
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:56,340
you're going to wind up missing or like skipping over in your brain just stuff and being like,

1762
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,420
he wasn't really thinking about that.

1763
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,420
He's on the radio.

1764
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:00,420
He's just talking shit.

1765
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,700
You know, like that kind of stuff.

1766
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,740
I guess that's true.

1767
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:08,420
And you can also, you can't account for like how differently you engage with things based

1768
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,420
on the time.

1769
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,420
Totally.

1770
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:15,580
You know, like watching, I went back and I watched some of the like attitude era wrestling

1771
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,580
not too long ago, a couple of years back.

1772
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,580
And I was watching it.

1773
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,580
I was horrified.

1774
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:20,580
Yeah.

1775
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:28,260
Some of the stuff was like, wow, not realize, oh, you go back and you're like, Jesus Christ.

1776
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,260
Yeah.

1777
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,260
Yeah.

1778
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,260
So Alex has this, this story.

1779
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:37,820
The main story of the episode is the bombing in Saudi Arabia.

1780
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:41,460
There is no real actual discussion of it.

1781
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:46,360
There's no, I mean, there's discussion of it, but there's no information that he provides.

1782
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,360
There's nothing.

1783
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,360
You can't really discuss that.

1784
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,360
It's a false flag.

1785
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,900
Every information that you get would be false information, Dan.

1786
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,340
So you just got to speculate, right?

1787
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:58,660
There's a lot of speculation and then also this, this is what I think is the most important

1788
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,660
thing.

1789
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:04,140
We'll be right back and I'll get into the NRA finally admitting the ultra gun grabbing

1790
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,140
is going on.

1791
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:11,460
More on the bombings, more on the terror drills that coincide with the bombings, final control

1792
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,460
is needed.

1793
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:19,740
See what happens when you don't become our slaves, the Batman come and eat boom, boom

1794
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,740
you.

1795
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:24,220
Operation Northwoods will be back.

1796
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:28,700
So I have to say that this is a pretty desperate attempt to grasp at straws on Alex's part.

1797
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:33,180
In order for his theories to make any sense, terrorist attacks have to match up with drills

1798
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:37,980
and you can see here because he's already covered the top off drill, he'll accept any

1799
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:41,260
event as connected regardless of how weak the argument is.

1800
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,260
Oh, totally.

1801
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:45,500
His belief about the whole drill thing is that the globalists use drills so they can

1802
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:50,300
have plausible deniability in case one of their plans goes wrong or, you know, someone

1803
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,380
involved in the attack gets caught.

1804
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,760
For instance, they'll run a bombing drill when they plan to carry out a bombing because

1805
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,180
that way they can plan out the details of the bombing and if anybody asks what they're

1806
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,740
doing, they can say it's for the drill.

1807
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,740
Sure.

1808
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:04,820
There are also ideas about how the globalists have to tell you what they're doing before

1809
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,980
they do it according to some dumb intergalactic contract law.

1810
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:11,560
But generally speaking, this concept that the drills are used as cover is central to

1811
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,300
why the connection between drill and event means anything.

1812
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,900
Alex's theories about the London 7-7 bombing rely on a misunderstanding about news reports

1813
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:24,220
about a consultant giving a brainstorming presentation to business executives where

1814
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:28,860
he had a scenario planned that closely mirrored the actual events of the bombing.

1815
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:32,980
That's a thin connection to draw, but at least the subject matter of the scenario and the

1816
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:36,860
attack were similar enough that you could see what Alex is trying to say.

1817
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:37,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1818
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:42,660
In this instance, there were a number of suicide bombings in residential compounds in Riyadh

1819
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:47,380
that were generally known to be occupied by foreigners, particularly Westerners.

1820
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:52,500
Meanwhile, in Chicago and Seattle, there was an interagency exercise going on that simulated

1821
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:57,140
a simultaneous biological attack in one city and a dirty bomb in another.

1822
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:01,340
These two situations lack the primary piece of the whole drill conspiracy puzzle, which

1823
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,860
is that they're used to plan the attacks.

1824
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:04,860
Yeah, that's what they're supposed to be.

1825
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,860
Or that there's a connection between the two.

1826
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:06,860
That's what they're supposed to be used for.

1827
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:11,500
This is sloppy shit, and I'm kind of shocked that Alex's listeners wouldn't realize this.

1828
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:15,500
I can kind of understand buying the whole drill conspiracy when there's overlap between

1829
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:20,720
the drill and the event, but even when you accept this nonsense, now Alex expects you

1830
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,700
to believe this extends this far?

1831
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:32,840
These completely unrelated and not even thematically connected scenarios in Seattle and Chicago

1832
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:43,300
are somehow related to bombings in Riyadh, like when there's a very unpopular war happening

1833
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,060
in Iraq.

1834
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:51,580
That is probably one of the benefits for him of having constant global news at all times

1835
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,980
because something is always happening.

1836
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:57,540
So there's always something coincidentally happening with something else that he wants

1837
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,540
to claim.

1838
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,180
Yeah, but this is, this is soft.

1839
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:03,140
Oh, it's weak shit.

1840
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:06,380
It is weak tea.

1841
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:07,660
It's a ways off.

1842
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:14,180
I wouldn't even, if I were Alex, I wouldn't even try this.

1843
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,340
He's a young gun.

1844
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:16,620
He's inexperienced.

1845
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,380
He's really giving a shot.

1846
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:23,180
You gotta find your boundaries, and the only way to find your boundaries is to step beyond

1847
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,180
them.

1848
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:25,180
Fine.

1849
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:28,500
So anyway, Alex talks about this a little bit more, and my only note on this is that

1850
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,060
this is unfair.

1851
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:36,660
Already into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast, wide open phones in the shower.

1852
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:44,660
We talk about the tragic, convenient, right on time bombings to legitimize the police

1853
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:49,740
state and these drills they're running, the FEMA takeover drills, the martial law preparation

1854
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:52,960
activation tests that's going on for the FEMA takeover.

1855
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:59,100
So now the bombings themselves are meant to give credibility to the exercises that are

1856
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,780
being run in Seattle and Chicago.

1857
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:02,780
What the fuck?

1858
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,780
No, I'm very tired.

1859
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,020
You can't.

1860
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,020
That exhausts me.

1861
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,020
Yeah.

1862
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,020
This is pretzel shit, dude.

1863
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,020
Yeah, no.

1864
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:10,900
No, you cannot eat your own tail at me.

1865
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,540
That's not possible.

1866
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,800
Yeah, it's not, it's not fair.

1867
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,800
It's not fair.

1868
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:21,420
Either these exercises are used to provide cover and planning for the globalists or they're

1869
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:28,580
part of contract law or they're not actually what's like, sometimes the terrorist attack

1870
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,660
is actually about the exercise.

1871
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:31,660
It's actually the reverse.

1872
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,660
Sure.

1873
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,660
Yeah.

1874
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,660
That's what I was thinking.

1875
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,660
He like twisted it around.

1876
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:40,600
So now that the, now the terrorist attack is providing cover for the drills instead

1877
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,600
of the drills.

1878
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,840
I mean, I guess the reality is that when anything is fake, it doesn't matter.

1879
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,840
That's a good point.

1880
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:52,180
If you believe or like your editorial line for these narratives is that all this stuff

1881
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:57,540
is fake, it's no longer disrespectful to take something like this and use it however you

1882
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,600
want because who cares?

1883
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,780
Your editorial position is just expediency.

1884
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:09,660
Whatever's the, I, yeah, I don't know if anybody's ever really truly made a career out of taking

1885
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:13,040
the path of least resistance quite like Alex.

1886
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,480
It's just like, I'm just flowing.

1887
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:20,000
You know, he's almost reached a zen position of just flowing through the river.

1888
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,480
Whatever bullshit comes out of his mouth, he just rides along it behind him.

1889
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,520
He's self-sustaining a fart blimp.

1890
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,760
That's what he is, Dan.

1891
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,880
I have become one with the wind.

1892
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:36,240
He is the Hindenburg.

1893
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:42,320
So Alex takes some calls and he gets a call from a guy who gets pretty religious with

1894
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,320
him.

1895
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,320
Sure.

1896
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,920
So quick, Alex hangs up on this guy.

1897
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:46,920
Okay.

1898
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:52,880
But I also spend my life also in the scriptures and what's amazing to me, the things that

1899
01:31:52,880 --> 01:32:00,000
are being spoken, not only by yourself, but there's a few others like you out there that

1900
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,640
the scripture speaks of.

1901
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:06,320
I hear you and I appreciate your call, Nante, and it's good to have you as a listener.

1902
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,320
Take care.

1903
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:15,440
If you're dead in Pennsylvania and you're on the air, go ahead.

1904
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,280
This caller was saying that you're in the Bible.

1905
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,760
Alex, I am calling to say that you're a prophet.

1906
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,240
Listen, I don't have that kind of stuff on my show.

1907
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:26,240
Cut to, I am the Messiah!

1908
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,240
Yeah.

1909
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,240
Yeah.

1910
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,240
Yeah.

1911
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,240
Wow.

1912
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,240
Quite a change.

1913
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,240
God damn.

1914
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,240
Quite a change.

1915
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,240
God damn that is fast.

1916
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,240
Yep.

1917
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:46,080
In 2003, one of his sort of primary positions and branding strategies is anti-police brutality

1918
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,080
and anti-police stuff.

1919
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,080
Yes.

1920
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,080
Yeah.

1921
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,080
Yeah.

1922
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,680
It's a quick, easy way to look above the left-right paradigm.

1923
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,680
Yes.

1924
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:57,000
Because I mentioned it and it's online at info-wars.com right now.

1925
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,320
Councilwoman criticizes action by constables.

1926
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:06,120
This is out of the Morning Call Online mainstream newspaper.

1927
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:11,960
They shot three dogs too fatally when they went to serve a warrant in Allentown for unpaid

1928
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,120
parking tickets.

1929
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:19,560
Saying there is a doozy of a problem here, Allentown Councilwoman Gail Hoover expressed

1930
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:24,780
outrage Sunday over the shooting of three dogs too fatally by constables serving a warrant

1931
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:27,400
on a man who had not paid parking tickets.

1932
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,400
Obviously, this is not something I'm okay with.

1933
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,840
Police should never behave this way, and I think we can all agree on that.

1934
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,620
I just find it interesting that Alex ends up taking almost an entire segment on the

1935
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:42,580
show to rant about this story, which is honestly tragic, but definitely doesn't seem like something

1936
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,520
that needs to be front and center of the show's news that day.

1937
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,680
It just makes me really sad to see him spending like ten minutes decrying the evils of the

1938
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:54,400
police killing two dogs, when in his later career he rationalizes that sometimes police

1939
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,840
are right when they shoot unarmed black people.

1940
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:01,960
Personally, I'm opposed to all acts of police violence, but I don't think a story like this

1941
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:05,800
actually ranks as important news for a number of reasons.

1942
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,480
The first is that even from Alex's headline, you can tell that the city council person

1943
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,640
is upset about this event, and is pushing to take appropriate steps to address the issue.

1944
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,240
No, all globalists are evil.

1945
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:20,440
In this instance, you can see unacceptable behavior from the police, but you can also

1946
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:23,920
almost be certain that the victim is going to win a civil suit and have some kind of

1947
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,920
restitution.

1948
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:29,040
And that's exactly what did end up happening, when they settled a claim against the cops

1949
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,240
who shot their dogs for $320,000.

1950
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:37,640
Money can never make up for the loss of a loved pet, but what can you do after the fact?

1951
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,800
Hold people responsible and pay the victims.

1952
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:46,680
Even this story that came out in the morning call about this shooting prior to this episode

1953
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:51,160
that Alex is recording quotes another cop who quote, said he wanted the family to know

1954
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:55,440
that constables carry up to $500,000 in liability insurance.

1955
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,880
Quote, we're walking cash cows for a good lawyer, he said.

1956
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:03,840
Even other cops in the department were saying that they needed to do what needed to be done

1957
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,840
to make things right.

1958
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:05,840
Wow.

1959
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,840
And they had a lot of insurance.

1960
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:12,120
That cop reminds me so much of that Kyle Kinane bit, where he's like, you know, you meet somebody,

1961
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:16,660
you meet enough, you live an interesting enough life, you meet plenty of cops in your day.

1962
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:21,000
And every now and again, you find one who's just like there but for the grace of God,

1963
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,080
he's like, I could have been working at the gas station or I could be in a cop pays five

1964
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,080
bucks better.

1965
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,120
So, oh, man, that's great.

1966
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:32,040
That cop just being like, hey, man, sue the shit out of me.

1967
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,400
I don't got to worry about shit.

1968
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,800
You got a lot of insurance.

1969
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,260
Come on.

1970
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,760
So we have one last clip here.

1971
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:44,880
It's another story that Alex is sort of touching on, but he doesn't really know the details.

1972
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:50,080
And I'm driving along listening when I left to the, you know, seven o'clock news or whatever.

1973
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:57,840
But I'm listening and they said that the that the governor with the Speaker of the House

1974
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:05,360
has ordered the arrest of over 80 members of the legislature.

1975
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,360
And I'm listening.

1976
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,580
No, I'm not kidding.

1977
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:14,760
I'm listening to them reading this, this AP headline national headline, because they say

1978
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,800
they've been ordered basically under Homeland Security to follow all orders, the voters

1979
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,920
they're told by Washington.

1980
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:25,360
And then you hear this state rep from Houston saying they're taking over.

1981
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:26,600
We won't be part of this.

1982
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,600
And that's all it said.

1983
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,120
We don't know what they're talking about.

1984
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,180
I typed in the article.

1985
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:33,180
It popped up.

1986
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,680
It just said they've been ordered to be arrested.

1987
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:42,380
See, I'm so conditioned in this la la land that I'm hearing that members of the House

1988
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:46,680
have been ordered in the Senate to be arrested.

1989
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,880
I don't know how you do it.

1990
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:52,680
I mean, that's the fact people are listening right now in Texas, you heard this was on

1991
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,520
national AP news, call into the show if you heard it, why I didn't print that article.

1992
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,640
I read it online last night when I got home, didn't print it didn't cover it.

1993
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,920
I can't keep track of it anymore.

1994
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:06,480
Seems like if it's this kind of story, you probably should have thought to print it.

1995
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,480
Yeah.

1996
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,480
All right.

1997
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,880
So what happened here is that the Republicans had taken control of the Texas legislature

1998
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,080
in the most recent election, and they were pushing a hard agenda that included harsh

1999
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,480
spending cuts and redistricting.

2000
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:23,600
How funny is it that we no longer live in a world where I can assume after you say the

2001
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:29,360
Texas Republicans took control of the legislature, that it would end in, in an election.

2002
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:33,960
The Texas House requires a quorum of at least a hundred of their members to actually meet

2003
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,040
and vote on things.

2004
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:40,620
So 58 of the Democrats in office decided just to not show up, to boycott the agenda that

2005
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:43,560
they were essentially powerless to stop in a vote.

2006
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,080
This is something they can do, and in response, the House Speaker has the authority to send

2007
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,880
the Texas Rangers out to find them and bring them in to vote.

2008
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:54,360
It's basically hide and seek, but with the government.

2009
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,360
Exactly.

2010
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,060
52 of the lawmakers decided to get out of the state in order to avoid being arrested,

2011
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:03,160
so the Speaker requested help from other states to get them back into chambers.

2012
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,160
Naturally.

2013
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,680
An Associated Press article includes an amazingly dishy response from New Mexico Attorney General

2014
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:13,220
Patricia Madrid, who said that she had, quote, no authority to arrest lawmakers who show

2015
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:18,360
up there, but went on to say, quote, nevertheless, I have put out an all-points bulletin for

2016
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:22,480
law enforcement to be on the lookout for politicians in favor of health care for the needy and

2017
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,600
against tax cuts for the wealthy.

2018
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,440
Ha ha ha ha!

2019
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:27,440
Goddamn!

2020
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,440
Woo!

2021
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,440
Get her!

2022
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,000
Oh, get her on Roast Battle!

2023
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Shit!

2024
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Yeah.

2025
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Goddamn!

2026
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,880
The Democrats returned when the time had elapsed for the bill, but it didn't matter.

2027
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,340
Governor Rick Perry held repeated special sessions to push through the redistricting

2028
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:44,320
plan and eventually got it passed, thereby gerrymandering the hell out of the state house

2029
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:48,960
districts and giving a very strong advantage to Republicans to remain in power.

2030
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,640
Alex is pretending that this is an instance of power-mad folks having their political

2031
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:57,540
opponents arrested and sent to the hole, but the reality is it's part of political maneuvering

2032
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:02,280
that's uncommon, but it's not really outside of the standard rules set forth by the Texas

2033
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,280
House.

2034
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,920
Yeah, it's power-mad politicians so corrupt that they're willing to destroy their entire

2035
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,880
state in order to ensure that right-wing politics rules the day.

2036
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,880
Listen.

2037
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,400
It has nothing to do with putting your political enemies in the hooskout.

2038
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,240
Listen, the gerrymandering and the redistricting stuff is the real issue.

2039
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,240
That's the real problem.

2040
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,520
That's the conversation.

2041
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,840
That's corrupt and power-hungry.

2042
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:32,540
The sending Texas Rangers out to bring people back to vote is a silly portion of the rules

2043
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,540
of –

2044
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:34,540
Yeah, we live in a weird world.

2045
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:35,540
Yes.

2046
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:38,040
It's a sort of government procedure.

2047
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:44,640
Yeah, there is that, like, I understand that we have those rules, but this is childish.

2048
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,640
Sure.

2049
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,640
This is silly.

2050
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,280
Like how you have to say, like, the good, gentlewoman from New Hampshire.

2051
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,280
Totally.

2052
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:51,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2053
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,280
Shut the fuck up.

2054
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:53,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2055
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,280
I don't need this bullshit.

2056
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,280
Yeah.

2057
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,280
So, we reached the end of this.

2058
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,560
I mean, that was a pretty boring episode, the 13th, I gotta say.

2059
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,560
Yeah.

2060
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,560
Not much goes on.

2061
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,560
It did not feel like it.

2062
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,560
A lot of talk about that bombing.

2063
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,560
Sure.

2064
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:06,040
A lot of actual information.

2065
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,360
But I think that we stumbled upon something fairly important here, and this is –

2066
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:16,120
The satanic cabal, living underneath DC, swallowing the blood of our children.

2067
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:22,760
The way that this is characterized, the way this sort of has a little bit of a clue leading

2068
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:27,640
back to Tex Mars is a bit troubling.

2069
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:34,400
And I'm worried about what we're actually going to find through this fanciful and seemingly

2070
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:39,160
fun investigation into when Alex started thinking he was fighting the devil.

2071
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,160
Yeah.

2072
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:48,680
The uncovering that maybe this, too, is all rooted in appropriated or exploited anti-Semitic

2073
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:52,100
ideals is not what I would have liked.

2074
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:59,220
It does feel a lot like that day you're like, hey, Carrie Cassidy, kind of an anti-Semite.

2075
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:04,840
And then it all crumbled down and you're like, fuck, all fun things just wind up with anti-Semitism

2076
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:05,840
at the bottom.

2077
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,840
Brutal.

2078
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:14,560
It does seem that this might be another indication or another example of that, and we will see.

2079
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,040
We will check back in and, you know, we'll see what we find.

2080
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,000
I hope it really goes well for him.

2081
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Alex?

2082
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,520
I have bad news.

2083
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,520
He shows up.

2084
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,520
I hope he gets his act together.

2085
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,520
Oh, no.

2086
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:30,360
Right now, I feel like 2003, there's a bright future ahead of him.

2087
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:33,680
Eighteen years later, he will be on air threatening to eat his neighbors.

2088
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,680
There's that.

2089
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,680
There is that.

2090
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,680
Okay.

2091
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,680
I don't think it goes well.

2092
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:41,600
It's at best lateral because he's richer.

2093
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,600
That's true.

2094
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,600
He's much richer.

2095
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,600
That's true.

2096
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,600
That's true.

2097
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,600
That's true.

2098
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,600
In some ways.

2099
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,600
Yeah.

2100
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:49,680
Anyway, we'll check back in, but until then, we have a website.

2101
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:50,680
We do have a website.

2102
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,680
It's at knowledgefight.com.

2103
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,680
Yep.

2104
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,680
We're also on Twitter.

2105
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:54,680
We are on Twitter.

2106
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,680
It's at knowledge underscore fight.

2107
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:56,680
And I go to bed.

2108
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,680
And we're on iTunes.

2109
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:02,200
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area.

2110
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,200
Yep.

2111
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,200
We'll be back.

2112
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,200
But until then, I'm Neo.

2113
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,200
I'm Leo.

2114
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,200
I'm DZX.

2115
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,200
Clark.

2116
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,200
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2117
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,200
I kind of think that steak knife is a fine code name.

2118
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,200
Andy in Kansas.

2119
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,200
You're on the air.

2120
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,200
Thanks for holding.

2121
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,200
Hello, Alex.

2122
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,200
I'm a first time caller.

2123
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,200
I'm a huge fan.

2124
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,200
I love your work.

2125
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:22,200
I love you.
