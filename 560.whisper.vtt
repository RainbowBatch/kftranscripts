N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.920
I have great respect for knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.360 --> 00:58.880
I love you.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.360
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

01:01.360 --> 01:01.860
I'm Jordan.

01:01.860 --> 01:08.160
We're a couple dudes, I can sit around, talk about how great Selene is, and also discuss Alex Jones.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.760
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.260
Ah, Cult of Selene, whee!

01:11.260 --> 01:13.060
Uh, hm.

01:13.060 --> 01:15.460
See, I wasn't even going to bring attention to it that time.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.260
Harumpf.

01:17.260 --> 01:17.860
Dan!

01:17.860 --> 01:18.360
Jordan.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.160
I have a quick question for you.

01:19.160 --> 01:19.860
What's up?

01:19.860 --> 01:20.960
Uh, what's your bright spot today?

01:20.960 --> 01:27.260
My bright spot today, Jordan, is that I survived an ordeal that would destroy a lesser version of myself.

01:27.260 --> 01:28.660
Oh, oh yes.

01:28.660 --> 01:38.460
And that is that the other night, I ordered some food for delivery, and I went downstairs to get it, and I locked myself out.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.260
Oh my god.

01:39.260 --> 01:44.760
Locked myself out of the house at about 9.30 in the evening, and I was terrified.

01:44.760 --> 01:45.360
Uh, yeah.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.560
Because I didn't have my keys, I know my landlord's not going to come over, I don't even know who my landlord is.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.660
No, absolutely not.

01:50.660 --> 01:51.760
No, no, no, no, no.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.360
They're not going to come let me in?

01:53.360 --> 01:56.760
I can't break into my window, because it's not on the bottom floor.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.360
Third floor, third floor is trouble.

01:58.360 --> 02:03.460
Uh, I don't think that I have that kind of parkour ability, uh, to scale the building.

02:03.460 --> 02:04.560
It would be difficult.

02:04.560 --> 02:12.460
And so I was looking at the neighbors' windows, which is never great, and they're all dark.

02:12.460 --> 02:13.360
Everything is dark.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.160
I'm like, I'm not going to hit the buzzer and like wake somebody up.

02:16.160 --> 02:16.660
Right.

02:16.660 --> 02:18.060
That seems like too much.

02:18.060 --> 02:18.560
Could be.

02:18.560 --> 02:24.960
So I walked around the side of the building, and I saw someone's TV on, and I hit the buzzer.

02:24.960 --> 02:29.660
And thankfully they buzzed me, but I was so terrified that I was like, well, great.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.260
I've got my food, but now I guess I'll be-

02:32.260 --> 02:34.260
Well, at least you wouldn't starve out there.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.260
I was going to be eating and sleeping out in the alley tonight.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.660
It was a warm night.

02:38.660 --> 02:39.560
It wasn't too bad.

02:39.560 --> 02:39.860
Yeah.

02:39.860 --> 02:40.360
That's true.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.560
And that might have been part of the reason why I forgot my keys.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.660
Yeah, it could have been.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.360
Uh, because it was just sort of like, hey.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.560
Did you put your shoes on?

02:46.560 --> 02:47.860
I think I had sandals.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.260
Ooh, how dare you.

02:50.260 --> 02:51.360
How dare you.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.460
I know you're not a fan of slippers.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.060
No open toothed shoes.

02:55.060 --> 02:55.960
It's not open toe.

02:55.960 --> 02:56.660
It's closed.

02:56.660 --> 02:57.560
It's closed toe.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.160
All right.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.160
So what about you?

02:59.160 --> 03:07.060
My Bright Spot, Deanne, is currently, as we speak, goes the Eurovision Song Contest.

03:07.060 --> 03:10.560
I know every year you get very excited about, what the fuck?

03:10.560 --> 03:11.060
No, you don't.

03:11.060 --> 03:11.760
No, I don't.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.160
No, I've never really even watched it before.

03:14.160 --> 03:19.260
But this is the first time that I've really decided to dig in and watch some Eurovision.

03:19.260 --> 03:19.760
Sure.

03:19.760 --> 03:23.160
And it is just universally terrible music.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.160
But the pageantry is amazing.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.260
I mean, really, really bad.

03:25.260 --> 03:29.160
But they're given an airplane hangar to do whatever they want with.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.960
And they create some ridiculous spectacles.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.560
And from what I understand, I don't know too much about Eurovision.

03:34.560 --> 03:39.660
But from what I understand, it gets pretty serious, like country against country.

03:39.660 --> 03:42.560
Yeah, everybody's cheering.

03:42.560 --> 03:49.760
Most everybody is doing, like, you know how Americans invented good music?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.060
They're all doing that.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.960
But, you know, through their own lens, that kind of thing.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.460
But some countries do, like, their own shit.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.160
You know, like traditional stuff.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.560
And it's really, really good.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.760
But everything else is garbage.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.260
Nobody has a good baseline.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.560
It's just tragic.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.760
Oh, that's too bad.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.660
Man, there's light shows everywhere.

04:11.660 --> 04:13.060
Well, that's great.

04:13.060 --> 04:19.360
So Jordan, today, speaking of light shows, I would like to let you look into my disco ball.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.760
It is actually a time machine.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
Alright.

04:21.760 --> 04:22.260
Okay.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.160
We're going back in time.

04:23.160 --> 04:23.860
Disco ball.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.960
Where are we off to today, Mr. Peabody?

04:26.960 --> 04:31.960
Well, today we are going to May 12th and 13th, 2003.

04:31.960 --> 04:32.460
Okay.

04:32.460 --> 04:37.260
Continuing back in our exploration of Alex Jones in 2003.

04:37.260 --> 04:40.660
And seeing primarily what he's all about.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.960
What are some similarities?

04:41.960 --> 04:43.060
What are some differences?

04:43.060 --> 04:44.760
Where's the devil at?

04:44.760 --> 04:46.760
I mean, that's definitely one of the biggest questions.

04:46.760 --> 04:47.560
Sure, sure.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.260
Does Alex Jones believe he's fighting the devil in 2003?

04:51.260 --> 04:53.860
Has his ultimate enemy been revealed to him yet?

04:53.860 --> 04:54.560
Yes.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.460
Or have the prophecies that he received in his dreams been a little bit muddled?

04:58.460 --> 05:02.060
And a secondary element of that question is,

05:02.060 --> 05:07.260
does Alex believe he's fighting the devil and actively try to hide that from his presentation?

05:07.260 --> 05:08.060
Yes, correct.

05:08.060 --> 05:11.460
In order to be taken more seriously at this point in his career.

05:11.460 --> 05:12.460
Right, right, right, right.

05:12.460 --> 05:19.660
And at this point, we started the beginning of May 2003 and we're now coming to the middle of the month.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.260
And I think it's still an open question.

05:22.260 --> 05:25.260
And we'll learn a little bit more today.

05:25.260 --> 05:25.760
Alright.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.060
But before we do, let's take a little moment to say thank you to some wonks.

05:29.060 --> 05:29.960
Oh, that's a good idea.

05:29.960 --> 05:34.460
So first, if I become a policy wonk, do I get to see exclusive pictures of Celine being excessively cute?

05:34.460 --> 05:36.260
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

05:36.260 --> 05:37.360
I'm a policy wonk.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.460
Thank you very much!

05:38.460 --> 05:42.860
I'm not sure, but I will send a picture of Celine to Jordan so you can tweet it.

05:42.860 --> 05:46.160
Yeah, there are no exclusive pictures of Celine here.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.660
No, but I could give you a cute picture and you could put it on Twitter if you like.

05:49.660 --> 05:50.660
I'll take care of it.

05:50.660 --> 05:53.660
Next, Louis Box, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

05:53.660 --> 05:54.760
I'm a policy wonk.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.460
Thank you, Louis Box.

05:55.460 --> 05:55.960
Thank you.

05:55.960 --> 06:00.660
Next, TheMorningDude listening on Steve Puchenik's neon nips, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:00.660 --> 06:01.760
I'm a policy wonk.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.660
Thank you very much, terrifying nightmare that will never escape my brain.

06:05.660 --> 06:11.660
Next, Joe, my neighbors might think I actually listened to Alex, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:11.660 --> 06:12.660
I'm a policy wonk.

06:12.660 --> 06:13.860
Thank you very much!

06:13.860 --> 06:21.060
Next, I came here to say that you were this close to the joke, not all heroes wear masks, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:21.060 --> 06:22.060
I'm a policy wonk.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.660
I like policy wonk names that are joke critiques.

06:24.660 --> 06:28.260
Really, that one actually almost hits me in the gut a little bit.

06:28.260 --> 06:32.060
That's a little bit like a get off your high horse thing, okay?

06:32.060 --> 06:35.460
Next, EscapedSonOfAPreecherMan, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.660
I'm a policy wonk.

06:36.660 --> 06:37.660
Thank you very much!

06:37.660 --> 06:41.660
The only one who could ever reach me was the escaped son of a bitch, but...

06:41.660 --> 06:45.660
Next, ScooterTheCorgi, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk.

06:45.660 --> 06:46.660
I'm a policy wonk.

06:46.660 --> 06:47.660
Thanks, Scoot.

06:47.660 --> 06:49.660
Thank you very much.

06:49.660 --> 06:54.660
And, Jordan, even though we're in the past, I should say that something's happening in the present, but not just Eurovision.

06:54.660 --> 06:55.660
Right.

06:55.660 --> 06:56.660
Not just Eurovision.

06:56.660 --> 07:00.660
And that is that some people have some birthdays.

07:00.660 --> 07:01.660
So, in 20...

07:01.660 --> 07:02.660
What have we become?

07:02.660 --> 07:09.660
In 2021, I should tell you, this weekend was chock-a-block with policy wonk birthdays.

07:09.660 --> 07:10.660
Sure, sure.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.660
We got Heather M. had a birthday.

07:12.660 --> 07:13.660
Happy birthday, Heather M.

07:13.660 --> 07:14.660
Happy birthday.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.660
Throwback Zach had a birthday.

07:16.660 --> 07:17.660
Throwback Zach!

07:17.660 --> 07:18.660
Happy birthday.

07:18.660 --> 07:23.660
And Ethan Mary sent a message wanting us to wish you a happy birthday over the weekend.

07:23.660 --> 07:24.660
Hope you all...

07:24.660 --> 07:25.660
Happy birthday, Ethan.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.660
Yeah.

07:26.660 --> 07:27.660
Alright.

07:27.660 --> 07:32.660
We start here on the 12th, and it is a slog.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.660
It is a rough time at the beginning.

07:35.660 --> 07:38.660
But Alex gets around to some actual news, and that is where we will jump in.

07:38.660 --> 07:43.660
You can't judge these books by their covers, the LA Times.

07:43.660 --> 07:51.660
Many textbooks distort history, slamming the US and glorifying despotic regimes.

07:51.660 --> 07:56.660
Last week, the LA Times had an article saying McCarthy was right.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.660
What is going on?

07:58.660 --> 08:01.660
The liberal papers sound conservative.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.660
The conservative papers sound liberal.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.660
I mean, they're really scrambling things right now.

08:06.660 --> 08:10.660
So just a quick reminder, the LA Times editorial that Alex is talking about did not say that

08:10.660 --> 08:11.660
McCarthy was right.

08:11.660 --> 08:12.660
No.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.660
It was in fact a scathing condemnation of McCarthy and his tactics, and a plea not to

08:16.660 --> 08:20.660
throw out all opposition to communism just based on how big a piece of shit he was.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.660
So maybe journalistic outlets aren't as topsy-turvy as he's kind of presenting it.

08:24.660 --> 08:25.660
No.

08:25.660 --> 08:29.660
If you just make assumptions based on headlines and what you think things are, then maybe

08:29.660 --> 08:30.660
things are topsy-turvy.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.660
That could be topsy-turvy.

08:31.660 --> 08:35.660
So I was able to find this article that Alex is talking about in the LA Times about textbooks.

08:35.660 --> 08:40.660
It's by Diane Ravitch, an author whose work is almost exclusively about education-related

08:40.660 --> 08:41.660
issues.

08:41.660 --> 08:46.660
The first thing to point out is that this, much like the other article Alex cites, is

08:46.660 --> 08:47.660
an editorial.

08:47.660 --> 08:51.660
Ravitch is writing in the first person, and it's not a piece of straight reporting.

08:51.660 --> 08:56.660
Around this time in history, Ravitch had just released a book titled The Language Police,

08:56.660 --> 08:59.660
How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn.

08:59.660 --> 09:03.660
The book was about how fear of igniting controversy from both left and right-wing pressure groups

09:03.660 --> 09:07.660
has led to textbooks that give students an incomplete view of subjects like history and

09:07.660 --> 09:08.660
literature.

09:08.660 --> 09:12.660
In her article for the Times, she says, quote, the textbooks go out of their way to sanitize

09:12.660 --> 09:17.660
the very practices in non-Western cultures that they rightly condemn in our society.

09:17.660 --> 09:21.660
For instance, every textbook acknowledges that the enslavement of Africans by the West

09:21.660 --> 09:22.660
was a great crime.

09:22.660 --> 09:26.660
However, when describing slavery in the Middle East or Africa, many claim that it is a path

09:26.660 --> 09:30.660
to upward career mobility or a chance to join a new family.

09:30.660 --> 09:33.660
Slavery is wrong in any time and place and should be recognized as such.

09:33.660 --> 09:37.660
That's a fair enough point, but I want to make sure that we illuminate how this criticism

09:37.660 --> 09:41.660
is different than that that's lobbied by someone like Alex.

09:41.660 --> 09:46.660
Alex doesn't want all cultures to be represented accurately and with proper historical context.

09:46.660 --> 09:50.660
He would want the Middle Eastern or African slavery discussed, but he would also want

09:50.660 --> 09:54.660
the textbooks to ignore American slavery, or if they had to cover it, the focus should

09:54.660 --> 09:56.660
be on how America actually ended slavery.

09:56.660 --> 10:00.660
No, if it weren't for white people, we never would have ended slavery.

10:00.660 --> 10:01.660
Everybody knows this.

10:01.660 --> 10:05.660
Ravitch is pointing out certain textbooks that she's read that are lazy.

10:05.660 --> 10:08.660
Alex just doesn't want history to make him feel bad.

10:08.660 --> 10:10.660
It would make him feel really bad.

10:10.660 --> 10:11.660
It would make him feel really bad.

10:11.660 --> 10:12.660
It's a very specific difference.

10:12.660 --> 10:17.660
Yeah, yeah, you know, if you're quoting Thomas Jefferson incorrectly all the time,

10:17.660 --> 10:19.660
but it's like, hey, I'm Thomas Jefferson.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.660
I love having slaves.

10:21.660 --> 10:24.660
It'd make you feel like maybe the founding fathers weren't very smart.

10:24.660 --> 10:29.660
Also, I suspect that Alex wouldn't like this paragraph in the Times article.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.660
Quote, the history's treatment of religion is scandalous.

10:32.660 --> 10:36.660
The origin stories of each religion are recounted as if they were documented history

10:36.660 --> 10:37.660
rather than religious myths.

10:37.660 --> 10:41.660
Many publishers have multicultural advisory boards to ensure the textbooks contain

10:41.660 --> 10:44.660
only positive facts about religion or ethnic groups.

10:44.660 --> 10:47.660
I suspect that Alex didn't read the whole article since he definitely would not like

10:47.660 --> 10:50.660
the suggestion that his religious beliefs are a myth.

10:50.660 --> 10:53.660
Also, that clip that we listened to is like a half hour into the show.

10:53.660 --> 10:56.660
It's a real, it was walking through molasses.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.660
Yeah, yeah, that's not good.

10:58.660 --> 10:59.660
It was tough.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.660
That's not good.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.660
But it started up fast after half an hour.

11:03.660 --> 11:07.660
And it got into some, like, really interesting stuff that, like,

11:07.660 --> 11:12.660
when I think about, like, going back in time and looking at these episodes,

11:12.660 --> 11:18.660
this is such a good example of, like, being able to go in different directions

11:18.660 --> 11:23.660
from things that Alex says and learning about interesting stuff like this.

11:23.660 --> 11:26.660
This is now in the Belfast Telegraph.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.660
It is in the BBC.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.660
It is in the London Guardian.

11:31.660 --> 11:36.660
Top double agent in IRA, guilty of up to 40 murders.

11:36.660 --> 11:42.660
Turns out that the top man in the IRA carrying out the bombings,

11:42.660 --> 11:48.660
the killings, the shootings, everything, as we told you last year,

11:48.660 --> 11:53.660
was MI5-6, ultra-secret agent.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.660
Okay. All right.

11:55.660 --> 12:00.660
So what's going on here is that Alex is glossing over an amazing story

12:00.660 --> 12:05.660
just to make it valuable to his worldview when, in fact, it doesn't really work at all.

12:05.660 --> 12:08.660
The IRA member in question here is a double agent for British intelligence

12:08.660 --> 12:10.660
codenamed Steakknife.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.660
He denies that any of this is-

12:12.660 --> 12:14.660
That is not as cool as you made it sound.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.660
Codenamed Steakknife? No, that sucks. That would be terrible.

12:16.660 --> 12:18.660
I don't want to be codenamed Steakknife.

12:18.660 --> 12:21.660
It's S-T-A-K-E.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.660
That's even worse. I don't want to be a pun.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.660
Whatever.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.660
Okay.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.660
So he denies that any of this is true, but it's widely understood

12:27.660 --> 12:30.660
that this was a man named Freddy Scappaticci.

12:30.660 --> 12:34.660
And if his denial isn't a lie, his story is bananas.

12:34.660 --> 12:37.660
So there's a great piece about this by James Harkin in GQ

12:37.660 --> 12:40.660
that I'm taking a lot of the background information for,

12:40.660 --> 12:43.660
and I would recommend people check out that article.

12:43.660 --> 12:44.660
Okay, cool.

12:44.660 --> 12:50.660
Apparently, in the late 1970s, Scappaticci met an army sergeant named Peter Jones,

12:50.660 --> 12:53.660
a guy who's so charismatic that his superiors, quote,

12:53.660 --> 12:57.660
allowed him to wear civilian clothes, don a beard, and develop his own sources.

12:57.660 --> 12:59.660
So he was Sergeant Bilko.

12:59.660 --> 13:04.660
Somehow, through the magic of charm and booze, even though Jones worked for the British Army

13:04.660 --> 13:10.660
and Scappaticci was in the IRA, they forged a friendship that resulted in Scappaticci becoming a mole.

13:10.660 --> 13:14.660
Wow, this is a real Romeo and Juliet situation.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.660
This is kind of a, yeah, I like it.

13:17.660 --> 13:20.660
So by this point, the IRA had become a slightly smaller organization,

13:20.660 --> 13:25.660
which was aware that they were spies trying to infiltrate their ranks and become snitches.

13:25.660 --> 13:28.660
As such, they put together a counterintelligence team,

13:28.660 --> 13:30.660
which was meant to root out any potential spies.

13:30.660 --> 13:32.660
From Harkins' article, quote,

13:32.660 --> 13:37.660
By the mid-1980s, Scappaticci was the deputy head of internal security

13:37.660 --> 13:39.660
and a trusted member of its general headquarters staff.

13:39.660 --> 13:43.660
This story happened so many goddamn times!

13:43.660 --> 13:47.660
Why are you always put in charge of your own investigation?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.660
Yeah.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.660
Essentially, through unconventional methods,

13:51.660 --> 13:54.660
the British government had cultivated a relationship with a double agent

13:54.660 --> 13:57.660
who was placed internally in a position that was almost comically strategically-

13:57.660 --> 13:59.660
It's just ridiculous!

13:59.660 --> 14:01.660
Get the fuck out of here!

14:01.660 --> 14:06.660
Their double agent was the guy in the IRA who was in charge of finding double agents within the IRA.

14:06.660 --> 14:09.660
That's unrealistic in a Bond movie!

14:09.660 --> 14:11.660
You'd be like, get the fuck out of here!

14:11.660 --> 14:12.660
Yeah.

14:12.660 --> 14:15.660
So as is the case with all these sorts of spy-related stories,

14:15.660 --> 14:17.660
everything is morally questionable.

14:17.660 --> 14:21.660
A lot of the story revolves around Scappaticci killing or allowing people to be killed

14:21.660 --> 14:24.660
who could compromise his position as a double agent,

14:24.660 --> 14:29.660
or people who they needed to protect in order to pursue goals of, like, arresting higher-up figures.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.660
Sure, sure.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.660
And unfortunately, some of those people definitely got killed.

14:32.660 --> 14:33.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gotcha.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.660
It's messy business, and no one's hands are clean,

14:35.660 --> 14:38.660
but depending on whose version of the story you believe,

14:38.660 --> 14:40.660
this is all made up, according to Scappaticci.

14:40.660 --> 14:41.660
Okay.

14:41.660 --> 14:47.660
Or Scappaticci was responsible for helping disrupt multiple terrorist plots at a horrible cost.

14:47.660 --> 14:51.660
The accusation that Freddy Scappaticci was steak knife came to light in 2003,

14:51.660 --> 14:55.660
and this became a big story, as well it should be.

14:55.660 --> 14:59.660
The important piece to recognize here, though, is that Alex is missing the forest for the trees.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.660
He deprives his audience of learning about this fascinating piece of history,

15:02.660 --> 15:05.660
or from learning about the history of the IRA and the Troubles,

15:05.660 --> 15:08.660
because the headline works a different way for him.

15:08.660 --> 15:12.660
This is a story about a very well-placed double agent within the IRA,

15:12.660 --> 15:17.660
but to Alex, this can prove that MI6 was running the IRA all along,

15:17.660 --> 15:21.660
and the bombings and the attacks were all just false flags.

15:21.660 --> 15:24.660
That's an outrageous misuse of this story, and by reporting it this way,

15:24.660 --> 15:28.660
Alex is actually doing something worse than just ignoring the story altogether.

15:28.660 --> 15:34.660
He's creating a fake version of it for his audience to erroneously convince themselves they understand.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.660
He's like Aaron Sorkin!

15:36.660 --> 15:41.660
Even if all the allegations about Scappaticci are correct and accurate,

15:41.660 --> 15:45.660
he wasn't the top man in the IRA, and he wasn't the one carrying out the bombings.

15:45.660 --> 15:49.660
Alex is embellishing that element of the story because it helps him construct the impression

15:49.660 --> 15:53.660
that the world is all fake, and that everything you hear is a lie.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.660
It's a perversion of skepticism and curiosity.

15:56.660 --> 15:59.660
Yeah, it is really a good...

15:59.660 --> 16:05.660
I mean, as far as storytelling goes, when you reduce it down into this kind of bullshit,

16:05.660 --> 16:11.660
you miss out on a very human story where people are making difficult decisions in moral grey areas,

16:11.660 --> 16:13.660
where they're struggling to keep from being caught,

16:13.660 --> 16:17.660
while at the same time struggling to show that they're trying to catch themselves.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.660
That's a really fascinating story!

16:19.660 --> 16:23.660
The MI6 already running the IRA is a really boring story, actually.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.660
Yeah, but it's much easier.

16:25.660 --> 16:31.660
It has explanatory power over stuff that would be so...

16:31.660 --> 16:33.660
It takes years of study.

16:33.660 --> 16:39.660
You could be a historian at a university with tenure,

16:39.660 --> 16:44.660
and maybe not fully be able to explain it except over the course of a semester.

16:44.660 --> 16:45.660
Right, right, right.

16:45.660 --> 16:52.660
Well, I mean, and it goes back again to how boring it is that your enemy is both everywhere

16:52.660 --> 16:56.660
running everything and is also so incompetent that you can defeat them at any and all times.

16:56.660 --> 16:57.660
Of course.

16:57.660 --> 17:01.660
It's like, that's a boring story! I don't care if Superman can always win.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.660
I don't care.

17:03.660 --> 17:04.660
Sure.

17:04.660 --> 17:05.660
I know, it's boring.

17:05.660 --> 17:11.660
What I was getting at is that it's very unsatisfying if you're a demagogue on the radio

17:11.660 --> 17:15.660
to be like, alright, let's buckle down and everybody take notes.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.660
This is going to take forever.

17:17.660 --> 17:20.660
It's going to require a lot of reading and research on your part.

17:20.660 --> 17:21.660
Instead...

17:21.660 --> 17:23.660
Serial became a huge hit!

17:23.660 --> 17:27.660
Instead, just telling people it's all fake.

17:27.660 --> 17:30.660
The big boogeyman is running everything, who cares?

17:30.660 --> 17:32.660
It's all these globalists.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.660
Serial did become a huge hit.

17:35.660 --> 17:36.660
I don't know...

17:36.660 --> 17:38.660
I'm saying it does both. Never mind. I'm sorry.

17:38.660 --> 17:40.660
I don't know if that was a lecture.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.660
I was playing both sides.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.660
Fair enough.

17:42.660 --> 17:43.660
Yeah.

17:43.660 --> 17:44.660
Also, I should tell you this.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.660
Yes.

17:45.660 --> 17:49.660
In 2018, Freddy Scampaticci's home was searched as part of an investigation into his role

17:49.660 --> 17:54.660
in the IRA, which didn't result in any murder charges, although he did plead guilty to having

17:54.660 --> 17:58.660
at least 329 images of animal porn on his computer.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.660
According to an article in the Irish Times, quote, Westminster's Magistrates Court heard

18:02.660 --> 18:06.660
Scampaticci tell police that he was not sexually interested in animals, but preferred women

18:06.660 --> 18:08.660
with big breasts.

18:08.660 --> 18:13.660
He was ordered to pay a total of 185 pounds, including court costs.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.660
I...

18:14.660 --> 18:15.660
Man...

18:15.660 --> 18:18.660
Okay.

18:18.660 --> 18:19.660
This is why...

18:19.660 --> 18:25.660
This is why journalism has a huge hole, and that is...

18:25.660 --> 18:28.660
Very intended.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.660
I now need to know what they mean by animal porn.

18:30.660 --> 18:32.660
I can't not know.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.660
It's pornography featuring animals.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.660
Yes, but I don't know what that means.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.660
The animal kingdom is large.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.660
How many...

18:40.660 --> 18:42.660
You know what I'm saying?

18:42.660 --> 18:44.660
No, I know exactly what you're saying.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.660
I just don't share your curiosity.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.660
I'm sorry, but I just...

18:48.660 --> 18:50.660
I absolutely do not share.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.660
It's a curiosity now.

18:52.660 --> 18:53.660
Okay.

18:53.660 --> 18:54.660
I'm sorry.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.660
I don't know who can get those court files for you.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.660
I don't want to see the court files.

18:57.660 --> 18:58.660
I don't want to see it.

18:58.660 --> 18:59.660
I just want to know.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.660
No, but I'm sure they didn't reprint all of it in the court files.

19:02.660 --> 19:03.660
It just might be more specific.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.660
Well, I would like to...

19:05.660 --> 19:06.660
I would like...

19:06.660 --> 19:07.660
Okay, Jordan.

19:07.660 --> 19:08.660
I'll take a transcript of a description.

19:08.660 --> 19:09.660
Jordan.

19:09.660 --> 19:10.660
I do not want to see it.

19:10.660 --> 19:14.660
I'd like to apologize that my research did not go deeper into this...

19:14.660 --> 19:16.660
I'm just saying.

19:16.660 --> 19:19.660
This postscript on a story.

19:19.660 --> 19:20.660
Okay.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.660
I'm just saying decency rules keep us from getting a full picture of the story.

19:23.660 --> 19:24.660
And it shall continue.

19:24.660 --> 19:25.660
Okay.

19:25.660 --> 19:31.660
So, Alex has used this story about the IRA double agent in order to justify that, like,

19:31.660 --> 19:32.660
everything is a false flag.

19:32.660 --> 19:33.660
Sure.

19:33.660 --> 19:37.660
All of the conflict in Northern Ireland was false flaggery.

19:37.660 --> 19:38.660
Sure.

19:38.660 --> 19:40.660
And that the British just do it all.

19:40.660 --> 19:42.660
False flagging is a British trick.

19:42.660 --> 19:47.660
Although, it's been picked up by other people that Alex might love in the present day.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.660
This is a British trick.

19:49.660 --> 19:53.660
They have been big in it before the Russians or the US were.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.660
Putin.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.660
Putin.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.660
Of course, Putin was caught blowing up or trying to blow up his fourth apartment.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.660
Kalden did blow up three of them.

20:00.660 --> 20:05.660
Moscow police arrested FSB in 99, planting the bombs.

20:05.660 --> 20:13.660
And then Moscow GRU, their internal security force, went in and arrested the police and

20:13.660 --> 20:16.660
others that had the hexagon explosives.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.660
They arrested members of the media and that story was shut down quite quickly.

20:19.660 --> 20:23.660
But that is confirmed and members of the FSB and others have now spoken out who fled the

20:23.660 --> 20:24.660
country.

20:24.660 --> 20:31.660
Then Britain moved to have them arrested and shipped back to Vladimir Putin, who was the

20:31.660 --> 20:37.660
former head of the KGB in Stalingrad, Leningrad, St. Petersburg, whatever name you want to

20:37.660 --> 20:38.660
give it for the day.

20:38.660 --> 20:41.660
But it's now St. Petersburg, the old name.

20:41.660 --> 20:47.660
And he was the guy really running things and they were pushing Boris Yeltsin around in

20:47.660 --> 20:52.660
a wheelchair completely drunk and drugged out of his mind who couldn't even speak.

20:52.660 --> 20:57.660
He's been running things for at least the last three years of Yeltsin's tenure.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.660
He was wildly unpopular.

20:59.660 --> 21:03.660
Suddenly, three apartment buildings got blown up outside Moscow in the suburb.

21:03.660 --> 21:08.660
He cracked down, said, I will save you, was a big hero and got elected with a large portion

21:08.660 --> 21:14.660
of the vote and then had a great war against the Chechnyans who screamed, it's not us,

21:14.660 --> 21:15.660
it's you.

21:15.660 --> 21:18.660
Why would we bomb you and bring down your wrath?

21:18.660 --> 21:20.660
This is insane.

21:20.660 --> 21:26.660
So Alex seems to, in 2003, have a lot of reasons why he believes that Putin did this.

21:26.660 --> 21:33.660
Yeah, we're very much in a, he's mobbed up, he's a front man for consortiums on the East

21:33.660 --> 21:36.660
Coast territory in terms of knowledge of crime.

21:36.660 --> 21:41.660
It's strange because I don't think that Alex is expressing like, I think he did it.

21:41.660 --> 21:42.660
No, no, no.

21:42.660 --> 21:46.660
Alex is saying that these people were arrested, planting the bombs.

21:46.660 --> 21:47.660
Sure.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.660
To him, it's definitive.

21:49.660 --> 21:50.660
Yeah.

21:50.660 --> 21:52.660
And somehow that has changed.

21:52.660 --> 21:57.660
Or he's just decided, I don't care if someone falls flags, I'll pretend they didn't because

21:57.660 --> 22:01.660
I like the way that they're strong manning.

22:01.660 --> 22:09.660
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's, if everybody else is false flagging, then I might as well pick

22:09.660 --> 22:11.660
the guy who's doing it the best.

22:11.660 --> 22:14.660
Or doing it in such a way...

22:14.660 --> 22:17.660
In service of my hopeful white nationalism.

22:17.660 --> 22:18.660
Perhaps.

22:18.660 --> 22:24.660
I mean, if he does truly believe that, I mean, it's a short jump from everything is fake

22:24.660 --> 22:25.660
to nothing matters.

22:25.660 --> 22:26.660
Yeah.

22:26.660 --> 22:30.660
That is a very good point.

22:30.660 --> 22:36.660
I mean, if everything is fake and everybody is false flagging everybody, then the ethical

22:36.660 --> 22:40.660
implications of pulling a false flag are really not that high.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.660
Yeah, that's true.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.660
It's really just what the result is.

22:43.660 --> 22:49.660
So I could see Alex ethically being okay with false flagging in order to serve whatever

22:49.660 --> 22:52.660
interests he's most in line with.

22:52.660 --> 22:57.660
I don't know that to be the case, but I could easily see that being something that he could

22:57.660 --> 22:59.660
subconsciously convince himself of.

22:59.660 --> 23:00.660
Totally.

23:00.660 --> 23:06.660
I would argue that there's zero possibility before Alex's life is over that he himself

23:06.660 --> 23:08.660
does not try and carry out some sort of false flag.

23:08.660 --> 23:09.660
Sure, sure.

23:09.660 --> 23:10.660
He's just going to.

23:10.660 --> 23:12.660
Like, that's the narrative arc for him.

23:12.660 --> 23:13.660
Yeah, yeah.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.660
I see him pulling a last season of House.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.660
Yeah.

23:16.660 --> 23:17.660
And taking his own death.

23:17.660 --> 23:18.660
Yeah, the whole thing, yeah.

23:18.660 --> 23:23.660
So he and Steve Pacetic can ride motorcycles around.

23:23.660 --> 23:25.660
And they're hanging out with Aldo Morrow.

23:25.660 --> 23:26.660
Yeah.

23:26.660 --> 23:31.660
So, lest you think that I am just saying that Alex thinks everything is fake.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.660
It's all out there.

23:33.660 --> 23:34.660
Mainstream news.

23:34.660 --> 23:41.660
We haven't found a terror attack in modern history anywhere in the world of any size

23:41.660 --> 23:44.660
or scope that wasn't carried out by the globalist.

23:44.660 --> 23:49.660
When I say globalist, I'm talking about the private banks and their private armies that

23:49.660 --> 23:56.660
control the top cabals, the compartmentalized cabals, and all the intelligence agencies.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.660
So, that doesn't sound like the devil.

23:58.660 --> 23:59.660
No, no.

23:59.660 --> 24:00.660
That's one thing.

24:00.660 --> 24:01.660
That's straight up globalists.

24:01.660 --> 24:07.660
And then secondarily, Alex seems to be convinced that literally everything is the globalist.

24:07.660 --> 24:08.660
It does seem to be the globalist.

24:08.660 --> 24:10.660
There are no real terrorist attacks.

24:10.660 --> 24:12.660
There is no real...

24:12.660 --> 24:15.660
That's, that's in line.

24:15.660 --> 24:16.660
Yeah.

24:16.660 --> 24:23.660
I don't know if he would stand by that today, but that makes sense for the way he acts.

24:23.660 --> 24:24.660
Yeah.

24:24.660 --> 24:25.660
Yeah.

24:25.660 --> 24:26.660
Everything is fake.

24:26.660 --> 24:32.660
If you start from the position of everything is fake, that leaves you with way more options

24:32.660 --> 24:35.660
to occasionally accept things as being true.

24:35.660 --> 24:40.660
If you start with the position that some things are true, for instance, Putin bombed his own

24:40.660 --> 24:44.660
buildings, then eventually you're going to have to change your opinion whenever you change

24:44.660 --> 24:45.660
your opinion about Putin.

24:45.660 --> 24:48.660
And for normal people with shame, that's no good.

24:48.660 --> 24:49.660
That's no good.

24:49.660 --> 24:50.660
Yeah.

24:50.660 --> 24:55.660
And I think that Alex is so sneaky that when he says everything is fake, there's so many

24:55.660 --> 24:59.660
different versions of fake that he has in his mind that you're like, okay, well...

24:59.660 --> 25:04.660
No, the event actually happened and it wasn't orchestrated, but because they knew about

25:04.660 --> 25:07.660
the drugging in advance, they had already prepared for it.

25:07.660 --> 25:09.660
Somebody was on mind control drugs.

25:09.660 --> 25:10.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:10.660 --> 25:11.660
Absolutely.

25:11.660 --> 25:16.660
And this clip actually got me into an interesting headspace.

25:16.660 --> 25:17.660
Okay.

25:17.660 --> 25:24.660
The average person in the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, even the White House is a good person.

25:24.660 --> 25:29.660
The average Democrat, the average Republican might be corrupt and might be a good old boy,

25:29.660 --> 25:33.660
but compared to the cabals that run things, they are nothing.

25:33.660 --> 25:38.660
And let's make this clear, that we have just a few thousand globalists and a few thousand

25:38.660 --> 25:44.660
operatives who are carrying all of this out and then they have the scripts for the media

25:44.660 --> 25:47.660
with the media ownership, they follow the agenda.

25:47.660 --> 25:53.660
We have the power to save this country and, yes, the world if we have courage and stand

25:53.660 --> 25:54.660
up and tell the truth.

25:54.660 --> 25:59.660
That clip really helped me put into context why it's so much less painful to listen to

25:59.660 --> 26:02.660
Alex's show in 2003 as compared to the present day.

26:02.660 --> 26:05.660
And that is there's a presentation of hope.

26:05.660 --> 26:10.660
In 2003, most people, Democrats and Republicans, even people who work in the intelligence community

26:10.660 --> 26:13.660
or in the White House, are good people.

26:13.660 --> 26:17.660
It's just a couple thousand villains who are secretly orchestrating literally every

26:17.660 --> 26:20.660
terrorist attack in the world and running all governments and financial systems.

26:20.660 --> 26:25.660
It's ludicrous, but from the standpoint of gauging emotional states, there's a perspective

26:25.660 --> 26:28.660
of optimism that you can kind of feel in the program.

26:28.660 --> 26:32.660
Compare that to the modern day where Alex's show is just fucking doom.

26:32.660 --> 26:35.660
In this clip alone, you have a reminder that most people are good people and a confident

26:35.660 --> 26:39.660
assertion that there's a good chance that the world can be saved.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.660
Both of these are completely foreign concepts to Alex today.

26:42.660 --> 26:45.660
Everyone who disagrees with him is a pedophile who works for Satan.

26:45.660 --> 26:49.660
And even if the Patriots are successful, the globalists are still going to kill almost

26:49.660 --> 26:54.660
everyone with a super bio weapon or whatever he feels like ranting about that day.

26:54.660 --> 27:00.660
Part of the reason his show sucks so much in 2021 is that it's actively depressing.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.660
Not just in the sense that it's depressing that someone would believe the nonsense that

27:03.660 --> 27:08.660
he says, but the way the show is structured and the way information is conveyed is a

27:08.660 --> 27:09.660
fucking drag.

27:09.660 --> 27:14.660
I don't believe Alex when he talks about courage or honesty, but I think that he might

27:14.660 --> 27:17.660
respect human life in 2003.

27:17.660 --> 27:20.660
Yeah, I mean, I...

27:20.660 --> 27:22.660
Here's what I would say, all right?

27:22.660 --> 27:26.660
I don't think any show should last longer than, say, ten years.

27:26.660 --> 27:30.660
Because here's... we're getting... this is what's happening.

27:30.660 --> 27:33.660
Iron Man, you're just fighting Hobodiah Stane.

27:33.660 --> 27:34.660
That's the first movie.

27:34.660 --> 27:36.660
You're just fighting some other guy.

27:36.660 --> 27:38.660
It's a real small self-contained story.

27:38.660 --> 27:42.660
Twenty years later, half of the universe has disappeared.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.660
You know what I'm saying?

27:43.660 --> 27:44.660
It's the problem of escalation.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.660
It's like The Simpsons.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.660
They're talking about a family.

27:47.660 --> 27:51.660
And then ten years later, it's like The Simpsons are going to the moon.

27:51.660 --> 27:55.660
And it's like because you just can't keep going at the same level.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.660
But what would happen if The Simpsons went to the moon?

27:57.660 --> 27:59.660
I think everyone wants to know.

27:59.660 --> 28:00.660
I think everybody does want to know.

28:00.660 --> 28:04.660
But eventually, you're going to have to say that everybody's going to die.

28:04.660 --> 28:07.660
If you start out with, there's a few thousand people.

28:07.660 --> 28:09.660
Twenty years later, everybody has to die.

28:09.660 --> 28:11.660
Like, it's just... yeah.

28:11.660 --> 28:15.660
I think that you're right when it's...

28:15.660 --> 28:20.660
I don't know if it's universal, but narrative fiction does have that way of

28:20.660 --> 28:24.660
running into a problem of like, well, we've told this story already.

28:24.660 --> 28:25.660
What other story are we going to tell?

28:25.660 --> 28:28.660
What is Infowars but improvised narrative fiction?

28:28.660 --> 28:29.660
No, I agree.

28:29.660 --> 28:32.660
And I think that that is the same problem that Alex is running into.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.660
How do you keep people excited?

28:34.660 --> 28:35.660
Exactly.

28:35.660 --> 28:39.660
Because I think that you can have other things like the McNeil Lehrer hour

28:39.660 --> 28:40.660
didn't go into it.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.660
Sure, sure, sure.

28:42.660 --> 28:44.660
I realize Carson was on the air for a while.

28:44.660 --> 28:48.660
Yeah, there's other forms of entertainment that don't have the same

28:48.660 --> 28:49.660
escalatory problem.

28:49.660 --> 28:51.660
Nope, everything is faulty towers.

28:51.660 --> 28:53.660
The end, two seasons, get out.

28:53.660 --> 28:57.660
So here is a nice example of the continuing threat of Alex being

28:57.660 --> 29:00.660
wrong in a way that he will soon learn is wrong.

29:00.660 --> 29:04.660
And they are appointing bath party leaders to almost every position.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.660
The people trained by the CIA in torture, espionage, oppression

29:08.660 --> 29:09.660
in the 70s and 80s.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.660
It is a CIA government.

29:11.660 --> 29:15.660
They're appointing the scum again in Iraq.

29:15.660 --> 29:19.660
So we've got these really consistent things that keep coming up on every show.

29:19.660 --> 29:23.660
Like Putin bombed the apartment buildings and they're putting the bath party

29:23.660 --> 29:26.660
CIA agents in power.

29:26.660 --> 29:32.660
I know it sounds like I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's constant.

29:32.660 --> 29:36.660
Not like he's saying it every other minute, but it's every show these things

29:36.660 --> 29:38.660
are touched on.

29:38.660 --> 29:44.660
And they're both not at all, well one's just inaccurate, and then the other one

29:44.660 --> 29:48.660
is something that is exactly the opposite of what Alex will later believe.

29:48.660 --> 29:54.660
Yeah, he doesn't know, we don't know yet that de-bathification is beginning.

29:54.660 --> 30:00.660
No, I believe we're another week or so off of when that conversation starts.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.660
Yeah, I mean it's close though.

30:02.660 --> 30:06.660
I believe it's in May or roundabouts in 2003.

30:06.660 --> 30:10.660
See, now this is one thing that is so frustrating about Alex is that

30:10.660 --> 30:14.660
on that day that he does find out, I would like him to find out on air

30:14.660 --> 30:17.660
and I would like him to deflate like a balloon.

30:17.660 --> 30:22.660
I would like somebody to prick him and he just goes, ummm, like that.

30:22.660 --> 30:25.660
But he's not going to do that, he's just going to include it in some other part

30:25.660 --> 30:28.660
of some, he's going to say no, they're doing it publicly to get rid of baths

30:28.660 --> 30:32.660
to make you forget that they're actually putting the CIA people in there.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.660
It's unfortunate, I want him deflated.

30:34.660 --> 30:38.660
This is wild, I mean we're on May 12th here and I just looked this up

30:38.660 --> 30:45.660
and the first coalition provisional authority announcement that started

30:45.660 --> 30:48.660
the process of de-bathification is the 16th.

30:48.660 --> 30:53.660
So we're four days away from this as we look at Alex's...

30:53.660 --> 30:55.660
Absolutely wild.

30:55.660 --> 31:01.660
So I guess we'll, on a pretty soon episode, we'll find out how he pivots.

31:01.660 --> 31:07.660
I don't know, I'm a little bit older than you and so in 2003 I was an adult.

31:07.660 --> 31:08.660
Yeah, I was not yet.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.660
I was a dignified, I was not.

31:10.660 --> 31:11.660
No, you were not.

31:11.660 --> 31:14.660
But I remember the conversation about Freedom Fries.

31:14.660 --> 31:16.660
Yes, oh, I won't forget that one.

31:16.660 --> 31:17.660
And Freedom Toast.

31:17.660 --> 31:18.660
Yep.

31:18.660 --> 31:22.660
I wasn't even an adult yet and I knew that was fucking stupid.

31:22.660 --> 31:28.660
People, particularly two members who are republicans in the house,

31:28.660 --> 31:34.660
got mad about french fries and french toast being served in the cafeteria

31:34.660 --> 31:41.660
because of course France had not agreed to join in with the invasion of Iraq

31:41.660 --> 31:42.660
and they were cowards.

31:42.660 --> 31:46.660
Yeah, it's never not going to be surprising that we are governed by children.

31:46.660 --> 31:47.660
Yeah.

31:47.660 --> 31:48.660
Yeah.

31:48.660 --> 31:52.660
To Alex's credit, he also thinks that whole Freedom Fry thing was stupid.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.660
Good for him.

31:53.660 --> 31:54.660
Although...

31:54.660 --> 31:55.660
Uh oh.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.660
Mexico opposed the war.

31:57.660 --> 32:00.660
Well, why aren't you mad at them if you're mad at France?

32:00.660 --> 32:03.660
France has three million Muslims by the way in it.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.660
You know why they said no, they'd get attacked.

32:06.660 --> 32:08.660
They didn't by their internal population.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.660
It's just reached new levels of ridiculousness.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.660
Jeremy in Indiana, you're on the air.

32:13.660 --> 32:14.660
Thanks for holding.

32:14.660 --> 32:15.660
Go ahead.

32:15.660 --> 32:16.660
That's not great.

32:16.660 --> 32:17.660
That's not cool.

32:17.660 --> 32:21.660
I didn't even know there could be a racist reason for that being stupid.

32:21.660 --> 32:23.660
Yeah, I...

32:23.660 --> 32:27.660
It's stupid because it doesn't mean anything.

32:27.660 --> 32:29.660
It doesn't mean anything.

32:29.660 --> 32:32.660
It's a Belgian waffle even if Belgium doesn't appreciate what you're doing.

32:32.660 --> 32:33.660
Freedom waffle.

32:33.660 --> 32:34.660
It doesn't matter.

32:34.660 --> 32:37.660
It's stupid on its face because it doesn't mean anything.

32:37.660 --> 32:40.660
It's an empty, meaningless, pointless gesture.

32:40.660 --> 32:43.660
It's not somehow the cause of racism.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.660
Or you said, like, how is that possible?

32:46.660 --> 32:50.660
All things considered, I think I would rather deal with

32:50.660 --> 32:53.660
freedom fries and freedom toast than someone like Alex

32:53.660 --> 32:57.660
who's perpetuating the idea that France made this geopolitical decision

32:57.660 --> 33:01.660
to not get involved in the Iraq war at that point

33:01.660 --> 33:06.660
because they were afraid of Muslim French people attacking from within.

33:06.660 --> 33:07.660
Yeah, there you go.

33:07.660 --> 33:08.660
Yeah, yeah.

33:08.660 --> 33:12.660
That's deeply Islamophobic and terrifying.

33:12.660 --> 33:18.660
And it's at a point in his career when he has the presentation

33:18.660 --> 33:21.660
of not being anti-Muslim.

33:21.660 --> 33:26.660
He's certainly not as aggressively anti-Muslim as he is in the present.

33:26.660 --> 33:30.660
But it seems like those latent things are there pretty clearly.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.660
Definitely.

33:31.660 --> 33:33.660
That's the level of shit where you're like,

33:33.660 --> 33:36.660
there's just no way you won't take it back to racism.

33:36.660 --> 33:40.660
Just like, oh, you know, I think I need a new coffee maker.

33:40.660 --> 33:42.660
Well, that's because of, I don't want to know why,

33:42.660 --> 33:45.660
but it's because my other one broke.

33:45.660 --> 33:47.660
There's no other reason.

33:47.660 --> 33:48.660
The other one just broke.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.660
There's no people behind it.

33:50.660 --> 33:51.660
Are you sure it's not the Turks?

33:51.660 --> 33:52.660
No, damn it!

33:52.660 --> 33:53.660
They're really involved in coffee.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.660
There's no reason to be racist about this.

33:56.660 --> 34:01.660
So one thing, I wish that I had musical ability.

34:01.660 --> 34:05.660
Because if I did, long ago, I would have made a bumper

34:05.660 --> 34:11.660
kind of Sting sound for the Alex telling a story that totally happened.

34:11.660 --> 34:12.660
Sure, sure.

34:12.660 --> 34:14.660
Totally happened.

34:14.660 --> 34:16.660
Because we get them all over the place.

34:16.660 --> 34:19.660
Throughout his career, at any point, you're going to hear stories

34:19.660 --> 34:20.660
that definitely happened.

34:20.660 --> 34:23.660
All right, cue me right before you play the clip.

34:23.660 --> 34:24.660
All right, right now.

34:24.660 --> 34:26.660
Alex's true story.

34:26.660 --> 34:31.660
You know, I have state police majors walk up to me.

34:31.660 --> 34:33.660
I walk into the cleaners.

34:33.660 --> 34:36.660
And I randomly pull in to get my laundry.

34:36.660 --> 34:38.660
Oh, I put it in two weeks ago.

34:38.660 --> 34:41.660
What I'm saying is it wasn't some stage deal

34:41.660 --> 34:46.660
where the major and the state police was waiting to talk to me.

34:46.660 --> 34:50.660
I'm driving back from the studio, a couple months ago,

34:50.660 --> 34:54.660
decided to pull in to get my laundry just randomly.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.660
And there's a state police officer in there getting his uniforms.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.660
He goes, Moosker Jones, can you come outside, please?

35:00.660 --> 35:04.660
And he goes, we were raised that this was the Soviet Union.

35:04.660 --> 35:05.660
We know something's wrong.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.660
The things we're being told are incredible.

35:07.660 --> 35:09.660
And I go, how many of you are awake?

35:09.660 --> 35:13.660
And he goes, most of the senior officers know something is wrong, Mr. Jones.

35:13.660 --> 35:16.660
DPS intelligence is fully aware of what's happening.

35:16.660 --> 35:20.660
And he goes, we know this isn't a conservative administration.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.660
I mean, you know, cops come up to me at the mall.

35:23.660 --> 35:25.660
They're doing security and telling me they know what's happening

35:25.660 --> 35:27.660
with a tear in their eyes.

35:27.660 --> 35:29.660
These cops come up to me.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.660
This is true story.

35:31.660 --> 35:35.660
They come up to me at the mall crying, telling me Bush isn't conservative.

35:35.660 --> 35:36.660
We get it.

35:36.660 --> 35:42.660
Sir, Alex Jones, please free us from the Soviet Union we were raised in.

35:42.660 --> 35:47.660
I saw your eyes get a little confused when he was talking about his laundry.

35:47.660 --> 35:48.660
And I was a little bit confused as well.

35:48.660 --> 35:51.660
But I realized that maybe he's talking about dry cleaning.

35:51.660 --> 35:52.660
Yeah, I was assuming dry cleaning.

35:52.660 --> 35:53.660
Yeah, yeah.

35:53.660 --> 35:54.660
I was totally assuming that.

35:54.660 --> 35:56.660
It seems weird to drop off laundry.

35:56.660 --> 35:58.660
It's a strange random thing to do.

35:58.660 --> 36:01.660
The time frame is really what was worrying to me.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.660
Yeah, that's true.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.660
So yeah, this didn't happen.

36:03.660 --> 36:06.660
So Alex takes a call at this point in the show.

36:06.660 --> 36:09.660
And this was interesting.

36:09.660 --> 36:15.660
This introduces a large theme that we'll run throughout the next couple days.

36:15.660 --> 36:16.660
One more thing, if you don't mind.

36:16.660 --> 36:17.660
Sure.

36:17.660 --> 36:21.660
These drills today that they're going to be doing in about 15 minutes, I guess.

36:21.660 --> 36:27.660
Yeah, the fake radiation attack in Seattle, stuff in Chicago,

36:27.660 --> 36:29.660
all training you to be a federal slave.

36:29.660 --> 36:34.660
These are supposed to take place for five days and raise the alert level, I'm told?

36:34.660 --> 36:35.660
Well, yes.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.660
Now during the drills, they're going to raise the alert level.

36:37.660 --> 36:38.660
Amber Alert will be flashing.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.660
Report gun owners.

36:39.660 --> 36:40.660
Report terrorists.

36:40.660 --> 36:41.660
Yes.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.660
And is this going to continue on for five days?

36:43.660 --> 36:44.660
And are they going to treat us?

36:44.660 --> 36:47.660
Are they going to basically put us under martial law for this?

36:47.660 --> 36:48.660
That's what this is, yes.

36:48.660 --> 36:50.660
This is a practice drill for martial law.

36:50.660 --> 36:54.660
When we get back, I will read you the article.

36:54.660 --> 36:57.660
This is a bad answer on Alex's part, but I kind of see what he meant.

36:57.660 --> 37:01.660
Alex meant that this drill was a part of preparing the public for martial law,

37:01.660 --> 37:05.660
but what the caller was asking was whether or not the drill would continue past day five

37:05.660 --> 37:07.660
into day six and day seven and so on.

37:07.660 --> 37:10.660
Would the drill be how martial law literally started?

37:10.660 --> 37:12.660
That was the question that was being asked.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.660
Sure.

37:13.660 --> 37:16.660
By replying in the affirmative, Alex was essentially telling this guy that this drill

37:16.660 --> 37:19.660
was the beginning of enslavement, which is really bad.

37:19.660 --> 37:22.660
It's hard for me to imagine that Alex misunderstood the question,

37:22.660 --> 37:25.660
except in the case that he wasn't listening at all, which is totally possible.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.660
Most likely.

37:26.660 --> 37:32.660
So I found the after-action report for this drill released by the Washington State Department of Health.

37:32.660 --> 37:39.660
This drill was called Top-Off 2, and it was meant to simulate a WMD attack simultaneously hitting multiple cities.

37:39.660 --> 37:44.660
It began with a bioterrorist attack in Chicago and a dirty bomb going off in Seattle.

37:44.660 --> 37:46.660
In addition to these challenges, quote,

37:46.660 --> 37:51.660
a cyber event affecting the state's communication infrastructure hit the week before.

37:51.660 --> 37:55.660
To further complicate the situation, a hostile takeover of the Washington State Ferry

37:55.660 --> 37:59.660
and a hostage event in Pierce County, south of Seattle, were included.

37:59.660 --> 38:02.660
That probably seems like overkill, but that's the point.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.660
As the report explicitly says, quote,

38:05.660 --> 38:08.660
in all, the event was meant to overwhelm local, state, and federal agencies

38:08.660 --> 38:14.660
with the goal of finding ways to improve preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities in the future.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.660
The goal was to create a fake situation that was too much to handle,

38:17.660 --> 38:20.660
so you can stress test in a fake situation instead of a real one.

38:20.660 --> 38:24.660
This bucket's not done. We're gonna fill it full of water to find out where the fucking holes are.

38:24.660 --> 38:28.660
Yep. This simulation taught the Washington State Department of Health a bunch of important lessons.

38:28.660 --> 38:34.660
For instance, they learned that their Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center had no reason to be on site,

38:34.660 --> 38:35.660
since it, quote,

38:35.660 --> 38:41.660
became mired in the response organization, which limited its ability to fully perform its work in off-site areas.

38:41.660 --> 38:48.660
That's a pretty important lesson, but probably less critical than them learning that the infrastructure they had in place to transmit bulk data

38:48.660 --> 38:52.660
was insufficient to handle the needs they faced in an emergency.

38:52.660 --> 38:58.660
Maps and data tables that were critical to get to decision-makers were not effectively transmitted given their existing setup,

38:58.660 --> 39:02.660
which is a huge issue that they were able to identify from this.

39:02.660 --> 39:07.660
Uh, turns out, turns out using the Pony Express is not going to do it.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.660
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize.

39:09.660 --> 39:10.660
You gotta speed this up.

39:10.660 --> 39:16.660
Another thing that's important to understand is that this is just the after-action report for the Washington State Department of Health.

39:16.660 --> 39:21.660
They didn't run the simulation. They were just one of the groups participating in it.

39:21.660 --> 39:27.660
Each entity that took part, they played different roles in the simulation, and they faced different challenges,

39:27.660 --> 39:32.660
and each came away with their own lessons, their own gaps in planning that they could resolve.

39:32.660 --> 39:37.660
I found the after-action summary for the entire exercise from the Department of Homeland Security,

39:37.660 --> 39:42.660
and the Washington Department of Health is just one of 47 state or local agencies that took part in the drill,

39:42.660 --> 39:49.660
along with 41 federal agencies and 21 agencies from Canada that got involved because that bio-attack that hit Chicago,

39:49.660 --> 39:50.660
it ended up spreading to Canada.

39:50.660 --> 39:52.660
Oh, God damn it, Canada.

39:52.660 --> 39:56.660
Yeah. I was reading over this summary, and there's an amazing piece on page 8,

39:56.660 --> 40:03.660
where the exercise ended up teaching everyone who participated about the actual definitions that are in the Stafford Act,

40:03.660 --> 40:06.660
which covers how federal assistance is deployed to states in an emergency.

40:06.660 --> 40:08.660
They found...

40:08.660 --> 40:11.660
I know we were supposed to read it before. I know.

40:11.660 --> 40:15.660
No, they had read it, but it clarified a definition because they hadn't role-played this thing out.

40:15.660 --> 40:16.660
Sure, sure, sure.

40:16.660 --> 40:20.660
They found that as it was written, a terrorist bio-attack, quote,

40:20.660 --> 40:24.660
does not clearly fit the existing definition of a disaster by the act.

40:24.660 --> 40:28.660
This made it so the President couldn't issue a declaration of a disaster in the drill,

40:28.660 --> 40:32.660
but instead the Secretary of HHS could only declare a public health emergency.

40:32.660 --> 40:35.660
They didn't realize this beforehand.

40:35.660 --> 40:41.660
From the report, quote, these two declarations illustrated some of the subtleties of the Stafford Act

40:41.660 --> 40:44.660
that may not have been fully appreciated before the exercise.

40:44.660 --> 40:45.660
Sure, sure.

40:45.660 --> 40:49.660
There's a ton of value to organizations preparing like this,

40:49.660 --> 40:52.660
using fake disasters to learn how to respond better to real disasters.

40:52.660 --> 40:56.660
This exercise was followed by Top-Off 3, which took place in 2005

40:56.660 --> 41:02.660
and expanded to fully include exercises being run by the Canadian and UK governments in collaboration.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.660
Cool, cool.

41:03.660 --> 41:09.660
In that scenario, they came up with 15 scary terrorist ideas and chose three to simulate.

41:09.660 --> 41:12.660
There was a terrorist release of a mnemonic plague in New Jersey,

41:12.660 --> 41:15.660
a mustard gas IED attack in Connecticut,

41:15.660 --> 41:19.660
and then the events in the UK and Canada, which this report doesn't specify,

41:19.660 --> 41:22.660
and that really pissed me off because I want to know what games they were playing.

41:22.660 --> 41:23.660
Yeah, I want to figure it out.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.660
Yeah, absolutely.

41:24.660 --> 41:27.660
This was followed by Top-Off 4 in 2010,

41:27.660 --> 41:32.660
and as of yet, this series of scenario planning exercises has not resulted in martial law.

41:32.660 --> 41:35.660
You would think that if Alex's whole thing about how the globalists used these exercises

41:35.660 --> 41:38.660
to launch their evil plans or something had any merit,

41:38.660 --> 41:43.660
one of these would have resulted in something more nefarious than government employees learning things.

41:43.660 --> 41:44.660
Yeah.

41:46.660 --> 41:51.660
And honestly, I love reading these reports because it's like,

41:51.660 --> 41:53.660
this would be my best day at work.

41:53.660 --> 41:55.660
Yeah, that would be a good day at work.

41:55.660 --> 41:58.660
If I worked in these areas, it would be so much fun.

41:58.660 --> 41:59.660
Oh, totally.

41:59.660 --> 42:03.660
It's the day at school where they're like, okay, today we're going to play Heads Up 7-Up.

42:03.660 --> 42:06.660
You're like, yes, that's my favorite day in school.

42:06.660 --> 42:07.660
Yeah, totally.

42:07.660 --> 42:11.660
Or there was this thing called CASA in Missouri, in Columbia.

42:11.660 --> 42:13.660
It was the Columbia Aeronautic and Space Association.

42:13.660 --> 42:14.660
Okay.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.660
And so what they would do is they would have students come,

42:17.660 --> 42:20.660
and we would simulate running a spacecraft.

42:20.660 --> 42:21.660
Oh, that's cool as shit.

42:21.660 --> 42:24.660
Yeah, and so one of the stations was,

42:24.660 --> 42:27.660
my memories of this are a little bit spotty,

42:27.660 --> 42:31.660
but one of the stations was made to look like the actual shuttle.

42:31.660 --> 42:33.660
And so you're in there and you'd have some responsibilities.

42:33.660 --> 42:34.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:34.660 --> 42:36.660
Another one was command, the command center.

42:36.660 --> 42:37.660
And so you were like...

42:37.660 --> 42:39.660
You're Kobayashi Maru-ing it.

42:39.660 --> 42:40.660
Sure.

42:40.660 --> 42:41.660
Yeah.

42:41.660 --> 42:45.660
And I remember that being, that's a day that sticks out to me in my head

42:45.660 --> 42:49.660
from my entire elementary school career

42:49.660 --> 42:53.660
because of just the excitement of going and role-playing this scenario

42:53.660 --> 42:57.660
of trying to make sure we were able to communicate between the two.

42:57.660 --> 42:59.660
And they obviously would throw some curve balls,

42:59.660 --> 43:00.660
like something's going wrong.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.660
Sure, yeah, of course.

43:01.660 --> 43:02.660
You've got to fix something.

43:02.660 --> 43:03.660
Yeah, it's excitement.

43:03.660 --> 43:04.660
So much fun.

43:04.660 --> 43:10.660
Yeah, we had a small six-foot-tall inflatable planetarium.

43:10.660 --> 43:11.660
Mm-hmm.

43:11.660 --> 43:13.660
You could see the stars.

43:13.660 --> 43:14.660
Not quite as fun.

43:14.660 --> 43:16.660
Not, no.

43:16.660 --> 43:18.660
No, it wasn't.

43:18.660 --> 43:20.660
So, I don't know.

43:20.660 --> 43:25.660
I got really into this, and I got furious that the Canadian

43:25.660 --> 43:27.660
and UK scenarios weren't at me.

43:27.660 --> 43:28.660
Yeah, that sounds pretty fun.

43:28.660 --> 43:29.660
Talk about the document because I was like,

43:29.660 --> 43:31.660
I want to know what they were facing.

43:31.660 --> 43:36.660
I kind of want to see if we can orchestrate like a giant national

43:36.660 --> 43:39.660
role-playing game where we just play the exact same thing,

43:39.660 --> 43:42.660
but we're people inside of the simulations,

43:42.660 --> 43:45.660
and we have to act like we're all dying.

43:45.660 --> 43:49.660
One thing that I found that I actually kind of took a little bit of issue with

43:49.660 --> 43:53.660
was that prior to this there was an exercise, the original Top Off exercise.

43:53.660 --> 43:54.660
Sure, sure, sure.

43:54.660 --> 43:59.660
And that one was unannounced, and so people didn't know it was happening.

43:59.660 --> 44:00.660
Oh, man.

44:00.660 --> 44:01.660
And I would say-

44:01.660 --> 44:04.660
They've learned a lot of lessons from Top Off over the years.

44:04.660 --> 44:05.660
The other ones were announced ahead of time.

44:05.660 --> 44:06.660
Yeah, yeah.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.660
And I don't know why they would do it unannounced.

44:09.660 --> 44:11.660
Like, I mean, everyone who was participating knew.

44:11.660 --> 44:15.660
Yeah, but I mean, that happened with the fucking United States Army

44:15.660 --> 44:17.660
in Russia during the Cold War.

44:17.660 --> 44:19.660
They were like, let's simulate bombing Russia,

44:19.660 --> 44:22.660
and let's not tell Russia about it, you know?

44:22.660 --> 44:23.660
They're dumb people.

44:23.660 --> 44:26.660
It seems like not a wise-

44:26.660 --> 44:29.660
It seems like a possibility for trouble.

44:29.660 --> 44:30.660
Yeah.

44:30.660 --> 44:34.660
Anyway, Alex gets another caller, and this guy brings up a question

44:34.660 --> 44:38.660
about 9-11, and I found this to be troubling.

44:38.660 --> 44:41.660
Well, you know, there's one question on 9-11,

44:41.660 --> 44:44.660
so I just got your DVD last Friday.

44:44.660 --> 44:47.660
I've only gone through it slowly, and then I'll go home and park.

44:47.660 --> 44:51.660
But let me ask you, you say over and over again,

44:51.660 --> 44:54.660
Al-Qaeda is a CIA type of trained people, correct?

44:54.660 --> 44:55.660
Yes.

44:55.660 --> 44:58.660
These types of people don't commit suicide.

44:58.660 --> 44:59.660
Well, let me explain that.

44:59.660 --> 45:00.660
A what?

45:00.660 --> 45:03.660
We believe, all the evidence says, those people weren't even on those aircraft.

45:03.660 --> 45:06.660
You know most of the hijackers have been found alive.

45:06.660 --> 45:07.660
Stay there. We'll talk about all that.

45:07.660 --> 45:09.660
A what now?

45:09.660 --> 45:12.660
This is a great indicator of how seriously Alex takes research

45:12.660 --> 45:16.660
into what's supposed to be his primary field of study, the truth about 9-11.

45:16.660 --> 45:19.660
It's a regular talking point in the 9-11 conspiracy communities

45:19.660 --> 45:22.660
that some of the accused hijackers have been found alive,

45:22.660 --> 45:25.660
but anyone who's looked into this with any depth at all

45:25.660 --> 45:28.660
could tell you that this is a simple case of mistaken identity

45:28.660 --> 45:30.660
and the investigative process being judged in the middle,

45:30.660 --> 45:32.660
as opposed to at its conclusion.

45:32.660 --> 45:33.660
Yeah.

45:33.660 --> 45:37.660
One of the men listed as a suspected hijacker was Walid Al-Shahiri,

45:37.660 --> 45:40.660
and just after the FBI released a photo of him,

45:40.660 --> 45:43.660
he made a pretty big effort to stress that they had the wrong guy.

45:43.660 --> 45:47.660
He is a pilot in Saudi Arabia and had done flight training at the same school

45:47.660 --> 45:50.660
in Daytona Beach that the other 9-11 hijackers had,

45:50.660 --> 45:53.660
but he was definitely alive and was living in Morocco.

45:53.660 --> 45:54.660
Sure, sure, sure.

45:54.660 --> 45:57.660
Hi, I did not fly that plane on account of I am here.

45:57.660 --> 45:58.660
So what happened here?

45:58.660 --> 46:01.660
This was a simple case of mistaken identity.

46:01.660 --> 46:05.660
One of the Flight 11 hijackers was named Walid Mohamed Al-Shahiri.

46:05.660 --> 46:08.660
As the man who was alive protested his innocence,

46:08.660 --> 46:10.660
the BBC made an error in their initial coverage,

46:10.660 --> 46:14.660
reporting that a man listed as one of the hijackers was actually alive,

46:14.660 --> 46:16.660
which, while technically accurate,

46:16.660 --> 46:19.660
gave a different impression from what was actually going on.

46:19.660 --> 46:23.660
If you just live and die by headlines and never look any deeper into things,

46:23.660 --> 46:26.660
you could easily think that the person the FBI claimed was on Flight 11

46:26.660 --> 46:28.660
was actually alive, but you would be wrong.

46:28.660 --> 46:32.660
This is a super easy thread to untangle if you want to know what happened,

46:32.660 --> 46:35.660
and certainly all of this information was fully available in 2003.

46:35.660 --> 46:36.660
Sure.

46:36.660 --> 46:39.660
There are a couple other people who were named as hijackers

46:39.660 --> 46:43.660
who initial reports claimed were alive, who actually were alive,

46:43.660 --> 46:47.660
like Abdulaziz Al-Omari and Salim Al-Hazimi.

46:47.660 --> 46:50.660
These two men had something very specific in common,

46:50.660 --> 46:53.660
which is that at some point in the not-too-distant past,

46:53.660 --> 46:55.660
they had their passports stolen.

46:55.660 --> 46:57.660
Al has me by a pickpocket in Cairo,

46:57.660 --> 47:00.660
and Al-Omari in a burglary when he was living in Denver.

47:00.660 --> 47:01.660
Sure, sure.

47:01.660 --> 47:05.660
Each of the instances Alex has of supposed anomalies like this

47:05.660 --> 47:08.660
are actually instances of bad, miscommunicated information

47:08.660 --> 47:10.660
that he never followed up on.

47:10.660 --> 47:14.660
Unlike Alex, reporters for Der Spiegel actually did look into

47:14.660 --> 47:16.660
some of these coincidences to see what happened.

47:16.660 --> 47:20.660
They reached out to John Bradley, the managing editor of Arab News,

47:20.660 --> 47:23.660
where much of the initial reporting originated, who told them,

47:23.660 --> 47:26.660
quote, all of this is attributable to the chaos that prevailed

47:26.660 --> 47:28.660
during the first few days following the attack.

47:28.660 --> 47:29.660
Yeah.

47:29.660 --> 47:32.660
What we're dealing with are coincidentally identical names.

47:32.660 --> 47:35.660
He also made it clear that these articles were being written after

47:35.660 --> 47:38.660
September 14th, when the FBI had only released a list of names

47:38.660 --> 47:41.660
of suspected hijackers.

47:41.660 --> 47:44.660
If there's one area where Alex really needs to be sure he's covering his bases,

47:44.660 --> 47:46.660
it should be 9-11 conspiracies.

47:46.660 --> 47:51.660
But you can see here how sloppy his work is, even on this trademark subject.

47:51.660 --> 47:55.660
Even in 2003, even about 9-11, you can't go deeper than headlines.

47:55.660 --> 47:57.660
Yeah.

47:57.660 --> 48:04.660
I can't imagine the terrible day you would have if your passport had been stolen

48:04.660 --> 48:09.660
and then you woke up the next day and it was flying into a plane.

48:09.660 --> 48:13.660
That would be a real bummer of a day for you.

48:13.660 --> 48:14.660
Yeah.

48:14.660 --> 48:17.660
Man, oh boy.

48:17.660 --> 48:21.660
Yeah, and so there's a combination of a number of different reasons

48:21.660 --> 48:23.660
for these mistaken identities.

48:23.660 --> 48:27.660
There's some that's like identity theft, or at least very strongly

48:27.660 --> 48:28.660
suspected identity theft.

48:28.660 --> 48:29.660
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

48:29.660 --> 48:35.660
And then some of it is this other element, this misreported similar names

48:35.660 --> 48:36.660
or the same names.

48:36.660 --> 48:37.660
There's a lot of people in the world.

48:37.660 --> 48:38.660
Right.

48:38.660 --> 48:39.660
Some of them have the same names.

48:39.660 --> 48:40.660
Right, I don't.

48:40.660 --> 48:43.660
And that period of time between when the FBI released names

48:43.660 --> 48:47.660
and when they released photos, there was a great deal of confusion

48:47.660 --> 48:50.660
and sort of the fog of unclarity.

48:50.660 --> 48:54.660
As we see after every great disaster.

48:54.660 --> 48:55.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:55.660 --> 49:00.660
So Alex takes another call and this one does not go well at all.

49:00.660 --> 49:01.660
I have one more question.

49:01.660 --> 49:02.660
I'm sorry to take so long.

49:02.660 --> 49:04.660
Are you aware of a guy by the name of William Cooper?

49:04.660 --> 49:05.660
Of course I am.

49:05.660 --> 49:06.660
Okay.

49:06.660 --> 49:07.660
I stole my career from him.

49:07.660 --> 49:13.660
There's something on his website and he has all his recordings from way back.

49:13.660 --> 49:14.660
Yeah, I know.

49:14.660 --> 49:17.660
But he has one thing about you being a liar.

49:17.660 --> 49:18.660
I understand, sir.

49:18.660 --> 49:19.660
That's a diversion.

49:19.660 --> 49:20.660
Total diversion.

49:20.660 --> 49:22.660
I appreciate your call.

49:22.660 --> 49:26.660
Frankly, my show is not about, and most other shows are,

49:26.660 --> 49:28.660
and that's why we never get anywhere,

49:28.660 --> 49:32.660
my show is not about what this talk show host says

49:32.660 --> 49:36.660
or what that talk show host says in the Patriot movement.

49:36.660 --> 49:37.660
I'm sorry.

49:37.660 --> 49:39.660
My show is not the gossip column.

49:39.660 --> 49:42.660
Even before it descended to the trash that it is now,

49:42.660 --> 49:45.660
even in 2009 he spent all his time yelling about Glenn Beck.

49:45.660 --> 49:46.660
Oh, man.

49:46.660 --> 49:49.660
So yeah, I mean, he quickly became the gossip column.

49:49.660 --> 49:50.660
Oh, yeah, yeah.

49:50.660 --> 49:52.660
Well, a lot of people, as he stated,

49:52.660 --> 49:54.660
a lot of people really like to listen to the gossip shows.

49:54.660 --> 49:55.660
It's true.

49:55.660 --> 49:56.660
So he was looking more for that.

49:56.660 --> 50:01.660
So this caller has made Alex introspective and he decides,

50:01.660 --> 50:05.660
well, the name William Cooper has been evoked on my show.

50:05.660 --> 50:07.660
I'd better lie about it.

50:07.660 --> 50:08.660
Okay.

50:08.660 --> 50:12.660
William Cooper became unstable in the last years of his life

50:12.660 --> 50:15.660
before he was gunned down by a SWAT team in his Arizona home.

50:15.660 --> 50:18.660
I called the guy up when he was in trouble with the IRS calling

50:18.660 --> 50:20.660
for help and said, I'd like to interview you.

50:20.660 --> 50:23.660
And he began cussing and yelling and saying,

50:23.660 --> 50:24.660
only I have the answers.

50:24.660 --> 50:26.660
Well, I want to just tell folks,

50:26.660 --> 50:28.660
I never got into UFOs and stuff you can't prove.

50:28.660 --> 50:29.660
Cooper did.

50:29.660 --> 50:31.660
And I don't know what Cooper's problem was,

50:31.660 --> 50:32.660
and I'm sad he's dead.

50:32.660 --> 50:34.660
I'm not going to sit here and talk about somebody who's dead.

50:34.660 --> 50:36.660
Here's the issue.

50:36.660 --> 50:39.660
Alex is totally right that Bill Cooper was incredibly unstable

50:39.660 --> 50:41.660
and was a nut.

50:41.660 --> 50:44.660
He's lying about the appearance on the show, though.

50:44.660 --> 50:45.660
We did an entire episode.

50:45.660 --> 50:47.660
Oh, I thought he was lying about how long William Cooper

50:47.660 --> 50:49.660
had been unstable for.

50:49.660 --> 50:51.660
Oh, yeah, probably a bit longer.

50:51.660 --> 50:52.660
The last few years of his life.

50:52.660 --> 50:54.660
Oh, boy, it was a lot longer than that.

50:54.660 --> 50:55.660
I think he did get much worse, though.

50:55.660 --> 50:57.660
Yeah, I believe that.

50:57.660 --> 51:01.660
Yeah, we did an episode that covered Bill Cooper's appearance

51:01.660 --> 51:04.660
on Alex's show, and it does not match up at all

51:04.660 --> 51:06.660
with the way that Alex presents it.

51:06.660 --> 51:07.660
Nope.

51:07.660 --> 51:09.660
Alex was an asshole to him, if anything.

51:09.660 --> 51:10.660
Yep, 100%.

51:10.660 --> 51:12.660
But, you know, Alex doesn't get...

51:12.660 --> 51:14.660
I'd be rich for a guy to criticize somebody

51:14.660 --> 51:16.660
getting into aliens later on in life,

51:16.660 --> 51:18.660
and then later on in life telling me

51:18.660 --> 51:21.660
that interdimensional beings are controlling the globalists.

51:21.660 --> 51:24.660
Oh, and, I mean, he says stuff that's even more ironic.

51:24.660 --> 51:27.660
So, see, what I do on this show is

51:27.660 --> 51:30.660
I don't talk about the visions that some prophet had

51:30.660 --> 51:31.660
out in the desert.

51:31.660 --> 51:32.660
Oh, no.

51:32.660 --> 51:34.660
He said the nukes are going to go off next week.

51:34.660 --> 51:35.660
No.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.660
And I don't talk about Planet X.

51:37.660 --> 51:39.660
And I don't talk about flying saucers.

51:39.660 --> 51:41.660
And I don't talk about psychics.

51:41.660 --> 51:42.660
Oh, no.

51:42.660 --> 51:44.660
And I don't talk about other talk show hosts,

51:44.660 --> 51:46.660
unless there's some national host, like Sean Hannity

51:46.660 --> 51:48.660
saying every child should take a microchip.

51:48.660 --> 51:49.660
Did I get Bingo?

51:49.660 --> 51:50.660
I have a video of Hannity and Combs.

51:50.660 --> 51:52.660
Or if it's Savage saying,

51:52.660 --> 51:54.660
put anyone who disagrees with the government

51:54.660 --> 51:55.660
in a forced labor camp.

51:55.660 --> 51:58.660
I occasionally break my rule for that.

51:58.660 --> 52:03.660
But I don't talk about rumors and trash.

52:03.660 --> 52:06.660
I don't talk about psychics, and then in the future,

52:06.660 --> 52:07.660
I'm a psychic.

52:07.660 --> 52:08.660
I'm a psychic.

52:08.660 --> 52:09.660
I'm a psychic.

52:09.660 --> 52:10.660
Come on, now.

52:10.660 --> 52:11.660
I don't talk about visions.

52:11.660 --> 52:13.660
I have visions all the time.

52:13.660 --> 52:16.660
Actually, the universe was revealed to me,

52:16.660 --> 52:19.660
and my prediction of 9-11 was actually based on a vision.

52:19.660 --> 52:21.660
I have dreams that are prophetic.

52:21.660 --> 52:23.660
Yeah, and a lot of the time, they happen

52:23.660 --> 52:25.660
whenever I'm out in the middle of nowhere.

52:25.660 --> 52:26.660
Ah, what a dick.

52:26.660 --> 52:27.660
What an asshole.

52:27.660 --> 52:29.660
So Alex takes another call,

52:29.660 --> 52:31.660
and this person brings up prison labor.

52:31.660 --> 52:32.660
Sure.

52:32.660 --> 52:36.660
This is bizarre, because I think that Alex's

52:36.660 --> 52:39.660
opposition to prison labor might not come from

52:39.660 --> 52:41.660
the same place that yours or mine might.

52:41.660 --> 52:44.660
Yeah, I would say slave labor is bad,

52:44.660 --> 52:47.660
and I somehow feel like Alex would disagree

52:47.660 --> 52:48.660
with me on that point.

52:48.660 --> 52:50.660
I think he agrees, but the reason why

52:50.660 --> 52:54.660
is where we get into a little bit of a...

52:54.660 --> 52:58.660
I saw him on a colloquy with Mark Saldor

52:58.660 --> 53:02.660
Thursday a week ago concerning the prison industries

53:02.660 --> 53:04.660
and how they're putting our small businesses

53:04.660 --> 53:06.660
out of business, so our people are not...

53:06.660 --> 53:09.660
A lot of good old boys, Jones, say,

53:09.660 --> 53:10.660
hey, make them prisoners work.

53:10.660 --> 53:13.660
The problem is most of the industry is now privatized.

53:13.660 --> 53:14.660
It is an industry.

53:14.660 --> 53:17.660
They're working for an average of 23 cents an hour

53:17.660 --> 53:21.660
competing against your jobs from the lumber

53:21.660 --> 53:24.660
to electronics to furniture to...

53:24.660 --> 53:26.660
To uniforms for our military.

53:26.660 --> 53:28.660
Customer service, everything.

53:28.660 --> 53:29.660
It's taking our jobs.

53:29.660 --> 53:30.660
It's slave camps.

53:30.660 --> 53:31.660
Exactly.

53:31.660 --> 53:33.660
Seven and a half million people in the system now.

53:33.660 --> 53:37.660
I think that opposition to prison labor

53:37.660 --> 53:40.660
shouldn't be it's putting other people out of business.

53:40.660 --> 53:43.660
Yeah, I would say that Alex is now a union man

53:43.660 --> 53:48.660
in about 1845 saying that slavery is great,

53:48.660 --> 53:50.660
but you're competing with our wages.

53:50.660 --> 53:54.660
Yeah, because it does imply that this kind of thing

53:54.660 --> 53:58.660
would be okay were it not to jeopardize

53:58.660 --> 54:01.660
the success of other businesses.

54:01.660 --> 54:03.660
Yeah, and I think...

54:03.660 --> 54:04.660
And I don't agree with that.

54:04.660 --> 54:06.660
The way to put it on an equal playing field

54:06.660 --> 54:10.660
is if they're competing with your business

54:10.660 --> 54:13.660
where you pay people, say, $9 an hour,

54:13.660 --> 54:17.660
what you should do is convert them into slaves for you

54:17.660 --> 54:19.660
and then everybody's on an equal playing field.

54:19.660 --> 54:21.660
That's Alex's solution, I think.

54:21.660 --> 54:23.660
I'm not sure if that is his solution.

54:23.660 --> 54:24.660
I think that's what he said.

54:24.660 --> 54:29.660
But I find this to be an unthought through position.

54:29.660 --> 54:31.660
Or at least...

54:31.660 --> 54:35.660
A psychopathic, self-involved, and beneficial solution.

54:35.660 --> 54:39.660
If that is where his opposition to prison labor

54:39.660 --> 54:41.660
and the system that is in place,

54:41.660 --> 54:44.660
if that is where it derives from, it's shallow.

54:44.660 --> 54:49.660
It has nothing to do with the act

54:49.660 --> 54:54.660
of making people in prison work for very low wages.

54:54.660 --> 54:55.660
Sure.

54:55.660 --> 54:58.660
Just not in industries that compete with American businesses, Dan.

54:58.660 --> 55:00.660
I don't like this.

55:00.660 --> 55:02.660
What makes you not like that?

55:02.660 --> 55:05.660
Anyway, so this caller has heard about a bill.

55:05.660 --> 55:06.660
Maybe. Possibly.

55:06.660 --> 55:08.660
Doesn't remember the bill, but it did something.

55:08.660 --> 55:10.660
And maybe it has to do with prison labor.

55:10.660 --> 55:11.660
Could be.

55:11.660 --> 55:18.660
Well, I wanted to give you the number of H.R. 1829.

55:18.660 --> 55:20.660
What does that bill do?

55:20.660 --> 55:22.660
Well, you know, to tell you the truth,

55:22.660 --> 55:24.660
I was away from my 50th class reunion.

55:24.660 --> 55:32.660
I didn't take notes, but Sauter and the other fellow, Mark Sauter and...

55:32.660 --> 55:34.660
Okay, what did they say the bill did?

55:34.660 --> 55:37.660
They were trying to restrict it in some way.

55:37.660 --> 55:40.660
So it's a bill that expands the prison industry.

55:40.660 --> 55:42.660
They admitted, oh, they're not for it.

55:42.660 --> 55:43.660
They're against it.

55:43.660 --> 55:44.660
Okay.

55:44.660 --> 55:46.660
And plus, they said that they're already,

55:46.660 --> 55:50.660
the government is already building new plants,

55:50.660 --> 55:53.660
new buildings for expansion of the plants.

55:53.660 --> 55:55.660
Yeah, I mean, what did camps do in Germany?

55:55.660 --> 55:58.660
You had a bunch of prisoners next door to a plant.

55:58.660 --> 55:59.660
Right.

55:59.660 --> 56:00.660
It's incredible.

56:00.660 --> 56:01.660
Joan, I appreciate the call.

56:01.660 --> 56:05.660
So that caller had sort of heard something about a bill,

56:05.660 --> 56:07.660
but didn't know what it did or really anything about it,

56:07.660 --> 56:12.660
but someone she'd heard talk about it kind of was maybe into it or maybe not.

56:12.660 --> 56:13.660
I don't know what was going on there.

56:13.660 --> 56:17.660
No, I appreciate anybody calling into a political talk show

56:17.660 --> 56:21.660
describing their political views very similarly

56:21.660 --> 56:25.660
to how my grandma would describe the movie that she just saw a couple of days ago.

56:25.660 --> 56:28.660
It was the one with the, and there were the people in it.

56:28.660 --> 56:31.660
What's the opposite of informative?

56:31.660 --> 56:32.660
Because that's what that was.

56:32.660 --> 56:33.660
Ooh, deformative?

56:33.660 --> 56:34.660
Maybe.

56:34.660 --> 56:38.660
So H.R. 1829 in the 108th Congress was also known

56:38.660 --> 56:43.660
as the Federal Prison Industries Competition and Contracting Act of 2003.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.660
Here's what that was about.

56:45.660 --> 56:48.660
There's a government-owned corporation called Federal Prison Industries,

56:48.660 --> 56:52.660
which is used to produce goods using the labor of incarcerated persons.

56:52.660 --> 56:57.660
I'll read to you here from the C.G.O. cost assessment of implementing this bill.

56:57.660 --> 56:58.660
Quote,

56:58.660 --> 57:02.660
Under current law, federal agencies are required to purchase products from F.P.I.

57:02.660 --> 57:05.660
if products are available to meet the agency's needs

57:05.660 --> 57:08.660
and the costs would not exceed current market prices.

57:08.660 --> 57:13.660
Such products include office furniture, textiles, vehicle tags, and fiber optics.

57:13.660 --> 57:16.660
Under the proposed legislation, this requirement would be reduced

57:16.660 --> 57:19.660
over the next several years, and the share of the federal market

57:19.660 --> 57:22.660
that F.P.I. holds for the products and services it provides

57:22.660 --> 57:26.660
would be limited to 20% and 5%, respectively.

57:26.660 --> 57:29.660
If you understand that text properly, what this bill would have done

57:29.660 --> 57:33.660
is actively reduce the government use of products created with prison labor.

57:33.660 --> 57:36.660
The bill aimed to divert some of this productive capacity

57:36.660 --> 57:39.660
towards making goods that would be donated to non-profit organizations

57:39.660 --> 57:42.660
instead of being sold to the government, which honestly still sucks.

57:42.660 --> 57:45.660
Additionally, there were provisions for funding of vocational training

57:45.660 --> 57:48.660
for incarcerated persons and funding for programs

57:48.660 --> 57:53.660
to test rehabilitative activities that could be productive towards helping.

57:53.660 --> 57:56.660
This caller has no idea what this bill is, and she's telling Alex about it

57:56.660 --> 58:00.660
as if it's something that expands the prison system when in actuality

58:00.660 --> 58:04.660
it was designed to limit the profits that are derived from prison labor

58:04.660 --> 58:07.660
and funneled a fair amount of money towards efforts to help people

58:07.660 --> 58:09.660
improve their lives while incarcerated.

58:09.660 --> 58:14.660
In the House, it's completely bizarre to see how split the vote on this was

58:14.660 --> 58:16.660
and not on party lines.

58:16.660 --> 58:21.660
It got yay votes from Steve King, Nancy Pelosi, and Mike Pence.

58:21.660 --> 58:23.660
Well, they all love slave labor.

58:23.660 --> 58:26.660
But it got nay votes from Maxine Waters

58:26.660 --> 58:30.660
and Walter No French Fries and My Cafeteria Jones.

58:30.660 --> 58:32.660
He was one of the guys who did the freedom fries thing.

58:32.660 --> 58:39.660
I am really struggling with the idea that somebody wrote into a bill

58:39.660 --> 58:46.660
before we've used 100% slave labor for our stuff,

58:46.660 --> 58:55.660
but now we want our slaves to make things to give to nonprofit organizations.

58:55.660 --> 58:57.660
Not 100%, but I get what you're saying.

58:57.660 --> 59:06.660
Can you write that down and think of that as not terrifying psychopathy?

59:06.660 --> 59:09.660
Yeah, it's weird.

59:09.660 --> 59:10.660
That's wild.

59:10.660 --> 59:12.660
What do you think Ron Paul voted?

59:12.660 --> 59:15.660
I'm going to go with Ron Paul voted.

59:15.660 --> 59:19.660
Wait, this would have restricted the amount that the government

59:19.660 --> 59:21.660
could have bought from their slaves, right?

59:21.660 --> 59:22.660
Yeah.

59:22.660 --> 59:25.660
Okay, so I'm going to go with Ron voted for it.

59:25.660 --> 59:27.660
He abstained from voting.

59:27.660 --> 59:30.660
Oh, god damn it. That's because it's screwed with his brain.

59:30.660 --> 59:32.660
He has to hate whatever Nancy Pelosi likes,

59:32.660 --> 59:36.660
but he also wants private businesses to...

59:36.660 --> 59:41.660
In the time of polarization that we're in now in the present day,

59:41.660 --> 59:47.660
it is really weird to look at this and see it being pretty mixed

59:47.660 --> 59:50.660
in terms of parties on each side.

59:50.660 --> 59:53.660
The bill ended up passing the House 350 to 65,

59:53.660 --> 59:55.660
but it died immediately upon being received by the Senate,

59:55.660 --> 59:57.660
and no action was taken on it.

59:57.660 --> 59:58.660
Cool.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.660
Good work, government.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.660
Way to do your jobs.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:09.660
So Alex ends up talking to this guy named Colonel Craig Roberts,

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.660
and he's not the same person as Paul Craig Roberts,

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.660
who's a weirdo and guy who wrote for VDARE.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.660
This dude is super into conspiracies like JFK.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.660
Sure.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.660
He loves Oklahoma City.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.660
Sure.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.660
And the Finders.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.660
Gotta love the Finders.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.660
He's big into the Finders.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.660
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.660
So they're talking about some child rings and stuff

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.660
back in 2003.

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.660
Okay.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.660
Alex isn't super into it, and it's not all that lascivious.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.660
Good.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.660
And he doesn't bring up Epstein, so that's interesting.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:39.660
So he didn't know about Epstein.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.660
He might have.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.660
Could have.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.660
It's not proof that he doesn't.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.660
True.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.660
But it's not something that comes up immediately.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.660
Although Alex does say this in their interview.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.660
It's like, ugh, come on.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.660
Governments always get corrupt individuals in control of them.

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:58.660
They always seek to maintain control and expand that control.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:02.660
They always flip out and get on power trips and start exterminating their populations

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.660
for no reason other than the fact that they serve their father.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.660
We know who that is.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.660
God damn it.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660
Infuriating.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.660
Okay.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.660
Still could be a metaphor.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.660
It's very unsatisfying.

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:18.660
That's dark.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.660
How dare he say that?

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:24.660
Stop tippy-toeing around it and dip your balls into Jesus, okay?

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.660
Let's go for it.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.660
He still talks about Jesus from time to time.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.660
I'm less interested in him being religious.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.660
Right, right, right.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.660
Which does exist.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.660
Certainly not as extremist and overt as it is in the present.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.660
Sure, sure.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.660
But I'm not interested in that.

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:47.660
I'm interested in specifically the literalness of his waging war against the devil.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.660
That like turning into a televangelist type deal.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.660
Yes, yes.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:55.660
Where everything we're doing is a fight against the literal Christian devil, you know?

01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:02.660
So the Craig Roberts and Alex have a conversation that it hits on a number of kind of like,

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.660
I don't care, kind of conspiracy topics.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.660
Sure, sure.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.660
And it's, you know, it hits a lot of bases that we've hit before.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:16.660
And I'm not so much interested in a lot of that minutia because of stuff like this.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.660
Once they put laws into effect, they can say,

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.660
well this law is going to sunset for a certain time.

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.660
Well a Brady law sunsetted and it didn't go away.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.660
The assault weapons ban sunsetted.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:30.660
Patriot Act One sunsetted, but now they're saying they're going to get rid of that sunset.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.660
These dudes are being super dishonest about the subject they're covering here.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:37.660
For one thing, this episode is in 2003,

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.660
over a year before the federal assault weapons ban is set to hit its sunset date.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.660
Alex is saying that the ban's sunset provision had just been ignored, which is a lie.

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.660
And even if he was just saying that they were going to ignore the sunset provision in the future,

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.660
he would be wrong.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.660
The Patriot Act was not subject to a complete sunset clause,

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.660
but various sections of the bill were.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:02.660
However, the sunset date for that bill was December 31, 2005,

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.660
more than two years in the future from the point that Alex is speaking here.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.660
In terms of this one, it's a little bit more of a complicated picture.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.660
I'm not in favor of the Patriot Act,

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.660
but I don't think that attacking it from the standpoint of sunset clauses

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.660
is a particularly effective approach.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.660
There have been multiple bills over the years that reexamined

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.660
and reauthorized various provisions and amended some of them as well.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.660
This is a common aspect of bills that have sunset clauses.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:27.660
You know, it's not like they have a self-destruct clause.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:30.660
The idea is to set a date in the future to reassess whether or not

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.660
the particular bill is worth continuing.

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.660
You can take issue with the decision to reauthorize the Patriot Act,

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.660
but pretending that reauthorizing it is somehow cheating?

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.660
That's a silly argument.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.660
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:44.660
Both of these examples that Alex uses to make his point that the bills,

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:48.660
they have these sunset clauses, they just never go away,

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.660
they're bills that haven't reached their sunset dates yet.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.660
He's just making this shit up.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:56.660
Now, the case of the Brady Bill is actually a little bit more interesting.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.660
The bill was first introduced in 1987 and was constantly a non-starter.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.660
The Reagan administration didn't appear all that interested in it,

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.660
and Congress had a lot of trouble with getting it to a floor vote,

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.660
so they would tend to attempt to attach it to larger crime bills,

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.660
which ended up being a losing strategy.

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.660
All this changed when Bill Clinton was elected in 1992

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.660
and voiced support for the Brady Bill

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.660
and indicated that he was willing to sign it if it was passed.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:25.660
This changed the landscape, and the bill made its way through Congress.

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.660
Part of the negotiation to get the bill through Congress

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.660
had to do with the mandatory waiting periods the bill put in place for gun purchases.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.660
With the technology available at the time,

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.660
it could take a while to run a background check,

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.660
so a five-day period was included in the bill.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.660
However, gun proponents wanted to strike a deal.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.660
Their long-standing argument was that a provision should exist

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.660
that this waiting period would be made null and void

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.660
once the technology existed for an instant-check system.

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.660
This made some sense, given that the waiting period was largely predicated

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:58.660
on the technological inability to do the checks quicker.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.660
Instead of this compromise, what was decided was that

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.660
the waiting-period provision of the bill would have a sunset clause

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.660
that would kick in in five years

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:08.660
whether or not there was an instant-check system that worked.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:13.660
This satisfied both sides, and the bill passed the House and Senate in November 1993.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.660
The Brady bill itself didn't have a sunset clause.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.660
This provision of it did.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:21.660
The larger bill was permanent, and put in place requirements for background checks

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.660
for gun sales made by federally licensed gun sellers.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:29.660
In 1998, the NICS system was developed, and that kind of made this whole question moot.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.660
The sunset clause came and went,

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.660
and now there is no federal waiting period required for purchasing a gun.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.660
Each state has the right to make their own rules on that,

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.660
and according to a recent article from ABC News,

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.660
ten states and the District of Columbia have waiting periods,

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.660
whereas most states do not.

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.660
Alex and Craig Roberts are covering the subject from a completely dishonest perspective.

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:50.660
Alex is just making stuff up,

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.660
and Craig is pretending that the entire Brady bill was set to sunset

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:57.660
when in fact it was just the specific provision which did in fact go away.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.660
I understand that there's staunch opponents of any kind of gun regulation,

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.660
but covering the material this inaccurately feels like it's a disservice

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.660
to sincere people who care about gun rights,

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:11.660
and it leads me not to take the stuff that they're saying all that seriously about any other issues.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.660
Yeah, that's frustrating. That's very frustrating.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.660
I don't like it. I don't like it.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:19.660
Also, I don't like that the waiting period expired.

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.660
I think that's stupid.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.660
At the very least, at the very least, here's what we should have.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.660
No bad days waiting period.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.660
You can't have a bad day and then go buy a gun.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.660
You gotta wait at least until your bad day is over.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:34.660
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.660
Yeah, I do. I understand that position,

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.660
and I think that states that decide to pass those things are well within their right.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.660
Makes sense.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.660
The idea of not having a federal mandated waiting period doesn't seem that weird to me.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:53.660
As long as the background check system does work and it is effective,

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:59.660
which I'm not positive it's fully operational and does a perfect job,

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:04.660
yeah, I don't know. I can see both sides of it, but I don't know.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:08.660
I think on a state level it's fine for that to be where that lives.

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.660
Sure, sure, I see that.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.660
Let's call it the no breakfast of champions law.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:19.660
You can't have a sudden outbreak of a syphilitic breakdown and buy a gun on the same day.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.660
I think that's fine.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.660
Yeah, in a perfect world I would be alright with that.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.660
Okay, good. We have come to compromise.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.660
Sure.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.660
Now, Jordan, it's time for you to play the theme song for our new segment.

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.660
Alright, Alex's True Story.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:43.660
The one time I got death-threaded by the government was when Judge Walter Smith in Waco case wouldn't allow a jury.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:47.660
And I don't know who did it, but obviously it was from that quarter.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:53.660
And I went and we protested, we pointed this out, I was billing that Branch Davidian Memorial Church,

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.660
and they got very mad.

01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.660
And I got little messages that couldn't come from anywhere but the government.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.660
You know, the whole voice changer bit, the whole thing.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.660
You know, the stuff from horror movies.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.660
Anybody can do that.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:04.660
Stuff from spy movies.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.660
The news does that.

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.660
I love my country, you know, so be it.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.660
I told them.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.660
Whatever, you know, I don't know.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.660
And I've been left alone.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:17.660
I don't believe Alex's version of this story or that it happened,

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:26.660
but even if you take Alex at his word, in 2003 he had only been threatened once.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:35.660
I just don't like that I know for a fact that they've been doing TV interviews with voice modulators and everything.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:36.660
Oh, they haven't.

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.660
Yes, they have since the 80s.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:39.660
Oh, they haven't.

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:40.660
Even before that.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.660
And Alex is like, only the government has that capability.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.660
Yeah, no one else has a voice box thing.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.660
Yeah, absolutely not.

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:47.660
No, no, no.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.660
There was a fucking vocoder for Peter God-

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.660
This is really high-tech stuff, all right?

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.660
Only the feds have this.

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:06.660
So he's talking, Alex is talking to Craig Roberts, and this clip really, really was a big problem for me.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:09.660
Well, remember Chandra Levy, this was even on Fox and CNN.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:14.660
It ended when it broke that she was involved in some type of weird satanic sex call.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.660
Did you hear that, Colonel?

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:19.660
Yeah, and that didn't surprise me either because of all these other findings we have.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:25.660
And there is a huge satanic underground movement that's linked to the homosexual community in Washington, D.C.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:29.660
And we're not the only ones saying this. I mean, this stuff pops up on TV.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.660
Oh, yeah.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:36.660
Well, here's the first real indication that I've seen that maybe Alex does think he's up against the literal devil at this early stage in his career.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.660
This one sounds pretty serious.

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:43.660
It's still not nearly as overt as he is now, but it's getting close to being disturbing.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:48.660
The issue that I run into is that based on what Alex is saying, he could very well think that he's fighting a group of Satanists,

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.660
and at the same time not think that he's fighting the minions of the literal Christian devil.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.660
True.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:58.660
He could just think that these Satanists are idiots doing dark, pointless rituals to a non-existent deity,

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:02.660
so I regret to inform you that this is not conclusive enough for me to call this case closed.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.660
True.

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:08.660
So I was interested in the idea that Chandra Levy, be it, was involved in a satanic sex cult.

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:12.660
This was news to me, so I decided to poke around and see what Alex is talking about.

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.660
It was also news to me.

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:21.660
This was not a story that broke in the mainstream news, and the reason people stopped talking much about Levy and Gary Condit was because 9-11 happened.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:26.660
It wasn't like the media was worried that people would learn of a secret satanic sex cult, so they buried the story.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.660
9-11 happened.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:33.660
It was, well, I mean, that was, it, look, that happened in the morning.

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:35.660
Otherwise it was a slow news day.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:42.660
I would imagine that not a lot that ranked happened that day after, yeah, I could see that.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:49.660
So this is a bit confusing, but it appears that this traces back to a post on the website of a guy named Tex Mars.

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:57.660
This is upsetting for a number of reasons, and one of them actually dovetails with this stupid conspiracy that Alex is raising here on this episode.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:07.660
Tex Mars died in 2019, but up to that point he was an incredibly prolific conspiracy theorist and extremist Christian speaker, coincidentally also based in Austin.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:16.660
Perhaps one of the most distinctive traits of his, though, is a very clear, very deep, and very consistent anti-Semitism.

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:22.660
Tex still has a website running, and if you go there, you can purchase audio tapes of some of his lectures.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.660
Or maybe they're preaching? I don't know.

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:34.660
Allow me to read some of the titles that you can buy, which I was tempted to buy, but I'm not going to give this asshole or his estate a penny.

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:42.660
Who killed Jesus? How cowardly lukewarm Christians are abandoning the truth and ripping passages out of the Bible in a futile attempt to appease the Jews.

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.660
Was that a sequel to Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.660
Nope.

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.660
Here's another one.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:50.660
All hail the Jewish master race!

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.660
I think that sounds weirdly positive, honestly.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.660
Here's a little snippet of the description of that one.

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.660
OK.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:01.660
Quote, first the Romans asserted their superiority. Then came the Nazis and their exalted Aryan race.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:06.660
Now, now it's the Jews who claim to be the master race.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:14.660
Tex Mars exposes those would-be gods on Earth for what they are. Arrogant, power-grubbing people ferociously opposing God's truth.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.660
Please, one quick second.

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.660
So here's another one.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:25.660
Quote, Obama tells Jews no more. The president finally stands up to the world's tormentors.

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:29.660
What a weird thing to support Obama for.

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.660
This one was apparently about Rahm Emanuel leaving the administration.

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.660
Sure. Good for Rahm Emanuel, I guess.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:38.660
One of them is called, quote, famous anti-Semites whom I admire.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.660
Interestingly, Ron Paul.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.660
That's just a diary entry.

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.660
Yeah.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:47.660
That is just a diary entry. How dare you. Don't you just list that shit. Buzzfeed. Fuck you.

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.660
He includes Ron Paul on his list.

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.660
Oh, wow. Ron Paul is great at anti-Semitism.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:58.660
Then there's one called, quote, chimeras, monsters, pizza gate, and the satanic hoodwink of America and the world.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:01.660
That sounds like a pretty regular TED Talk, to be honest.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:07.660
The description includes, quote, Jewish scientists are working on DNA that will be inserted into the mind of every person at birth,

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:11.660
ending anti-Semitism forever and creating new races that will love Jews.

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:16.660
That's almost a legitimate possible solution for Jews. I think they should try that one.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:20.660
One more is called, quote, should Christians burn the Jewish Talmud?

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:21.660
No.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:25.660
Now, I don't want to order or listen to this one, but I'm guessing the answer Tex comes to is yes.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:31.660
Based on how the description ends. Quote, if Tex Mars were to declare an international burn the Talmud day,

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.660
would you be there to help him toss these trashy devil volumes into the bonfire?

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:37.660
Um.

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.660
Sure.

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:39.660
Uh.

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.660
Do the people burning holy books think they're the good guys?

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.660
Tex does.

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:47.660
Oh, okay.

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:51.660
Also, I should point out that his website also sells a bunch of books about how the Holocaust didn't happen,

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.660
including one by a guy named Brian A. Lewis Sherlebot.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.660
That middle name's probably a coincidence, right?

01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:58.660
That could be.

01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:59.660
Probably a coincidence.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.660
Could be. I doubt there's anything to do with it.

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:02.660
Oh, boy.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:10.660
Tex Mars is a giant pile of shit, and one of the things that's the most constant theme of his is that Judaism is synonymous with Satanism.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.660
It's something that constantly comes up in his lecture titles.

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:21.660
One is just called, quote, inventors of evil things, how the Jews created Freemasonry, Illuminism, Communism, Satanism, Witchcraft,

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:24.660
and the New Age movement, and what they're up to now.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.660
The description of that tape includes this.

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:32.660
Quote, Jesus said of the Jews, you are of your father the devil, and he spoke absolute truth.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.660
The historical record is clear.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.660
Wow. Good work, Bible.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:41.660
Now, this also takes us back to earlier, when Alex used, you know, you are of your father.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:42.660
Little bit.

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:43.660
Little bit of...

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:44.660
Might be some crossover.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.660
...troubling parallels.

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.660
Could be something to do with that.

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:52.660
For someone like Tex Mars, all roads lead back to Jewish people being behind the conspiracies that he promotes.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.660
His brand is antisemitism.

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.660
It's just impossible to engage with his material and not understand that.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:06.660
So if Alex, taking this conspiracy about Chandra Levy being involved in satanic sex cults, you know, that's from Tex Mars's website,

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:14.660
if he's taking that seriously, that's an indication of a very serious trend towards antisemitic content on Alex's part in this period.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.660
Tex wrote at least two columns about Chandra Levy's disappearance and murder,

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.660
and thankfully these are not behind a paywall, so I could read them.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.660
They're fucking ridiculous.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:24.660
Okay.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:28.660
One attempts to make the argument that Levy was a secret Mossad agent.

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:29.660
Okay.

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:35.660
Quote, an accumulation of evidence indicates that the 24-year-old Levy was a youthful recruit in the Israeli Mossad,

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.660
that nation's premier spy agency.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:44.660
In that capacity, she had served as an intern at the executive offices of California Governor Gray Davis, an Illuminati initiate,

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:49.660
and that is where she first met Mr. Condit, also an Illuminati servant.

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.660
This falls just short of being convincing.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.660
Is that an accumulation of evidence or just like a-

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.660
It's piling up.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:56.660
Yeah, okay.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:01.660
Tex, based on literally no evidence other than his imagination, decides that as a Mossad agent,

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:08.660
Chandra had insinuated herself in Gary Condit's life, then used him to get herself access to the CIA headquarters.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:13.660
There, she learned of the Illuminati's plan to use fake Islamic terrorists to do 9-11,

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:16.660
and thus she had to be killed so she couldn't spill the beans.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.660
Wow, she's good.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.660
Tex puts it this way.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:24.660
Quote, as horrifying as the question may be, one must now contemplate the mind-numbing possibility-

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.660
No.

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:29.660
That Chandra Levy very well may have been victim to a darkly vicious satanic force.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.660
Damn.

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.660
My response to this is, must one?

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.660
Yes.

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.660
I don't think one must contemplate that possibility.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.660
I don't know, have you started contemplating it yet?

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.660
I have.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.660
Okay, see, then you did.

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.660
According to Tex, these darkly vicious satanic forces are the work of, quote,

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:50.660
DC's exclusive satanic brotherhood, to which he claims literally all members of Congress have to be a part.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.660
Not that exclusive.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:58.660
When Tex Mars is discussing these satanic forces, you'd have to be a monumental idiot to not understand he's demonizing Jewish people.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.660
Yeah.

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.660
It's really fucking obvious if you know anything about his work.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:07.660
You could just check out his lecture titled, quote, The Jews Are Preparing a Grave for America,

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:14.660
which warns that, quote, powerful Jewish interests have a stranglehold on American government, the economy, and our culture.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.660
We are in grave danger!

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.660
What's the anti-Semitic about that?

01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:25.660
On the one hand, it's kind of intriguing to have this first step towards Alex talking about his feelings about the devil and Satanism in 2003.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:31.660
But on the other, and much more serious hand, it's a real problem when you pull the thread of what he's talking about

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:37.660
and it leads back to another Austin-based conspiracy theory who believes that Satanism is a plot of the Jews.

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:45.660
Yeah, it would be hard to believe that, living in Austin simultaneously, no one brought him up to Alex.

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:50.660
No one brought this guy up, so Alex has no idea who this is, and this is all coming from his own brain.

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:53.660
I know that Tex Mars has been on Alex's show before.

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.660
Of course.

01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:59.660
Yeah, although I don't think that he plays as much of a role in later times.

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:05.660
I know that the name has come up, but one of the problems is there's another guy who's a conspiracy theorist named Jim Mars.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.660
Damn.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:15.660
I know he was on Alex's show a lot, and I think that Tex Mars had a lesser, but definitely a still-existing presence.

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:16.660
Right.

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:19.660
And they both created M&Ms together?

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:20.660
Mm-hmm.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:21.660
Mm-hmm.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:22.660
Good joke.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:32.660
Sorry. That was shitty.

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:38.660
So yeah, I'm really troubled by this.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:47.660
I did not expect that the first sort of fuller overture towards talking about satanic forces and what have you

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:53.660
would be in the context of a story that was widely disseminated primarily by Tex Mars,

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:59.660
who has a tendency towards satanism and stuff being coded ways for him to be antisemitic.

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:00.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:07.660
That leads me to be very worried about how much more antisemitic Alex's show may have been in the past.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.660
Yeah, it does seem like...

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:13.660
And it's making me clear that I need to, when I'm looking at these past episodes,

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.660
I need to be a little bit more cognizant of that.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:17.660
Right, right.

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:23.660
Because the question could be raised like, with the globalists,

01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:30.660
is he stealing obviously effective antisemitic propaganda in order to rebrand it

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:34.660
and use what is a very effective way to make his own money?

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.660
Right.

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:42.660
Or is he antisemitic and he's just camouflaging that same propaganda under the term globalists?

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.660
Yeah.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.660
So it's that kind of appropriation versus...

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:50.660
It's a question that we've never really been able to find definitive answers to.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:51.660
Right.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.660
This does seem like a good...

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.660
It's more troubling.

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:55.660
Yeah.

01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:02.660
Because I don't believe that anybody, anybody could engage with the work that Tex Mars puts out

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.660
and not be aware of the particular character of antisemitism.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.660
Yeah.

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.660
And a bunch of other stuff too, anti-Catholic.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.660
He just hates a lot of people.

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:14.660
But I don't think that you could.

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:21.660
And for Alex to, you know, seem to take information from his website seriously,

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.660
it makes you worried about what other stuff he might.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.660
Yeah, that's not good.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:26.660
Yeah.

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.660
That's not good.

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:32.660
So we now jump to the 13th because they have such a good time, Craig and Alex,

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.660
that they just take calls and...

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:35.660
Sure.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:36.660
It's boring.

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.660
Yeah.

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.660
So we jump to the 13th and overnight there was a bombing in Saudi Arabia.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.660
There was a series of bombings.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:46.660
And based on nothing, Alex has decided that this was a false flag.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:47.660
Sure.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:48.660
Sure.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.660
And he has a list of suspects.

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:50.660
Go for it.

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:51.660
Now, this could be the CIA.

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.660
It could be Mossad.

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:58.660
Or it really could be Palestinians that got into the country, got explosives and did this.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:01.660
There are real suicide bombers.

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.660
There are real terror groups.

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.660
They are few and far between.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:06.660
We don't know right now.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:07.660
We probably never will.

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:12.660
We know Vladimir Putin blew up three apartment buildings to get martial law going in Russia.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.660
That's admitted though.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:14.660
So that keeps going.

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:15.660
Yeah.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.660
Again.

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:17.660
Yeah, you just gotta toss that in there.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.660
Yeah, that's pretty constant.

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:25.660
It is a really great example of a false flag effectively turning a man into a dictator.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.660
So, there's that.

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:31.660
Yeah, so Alex has these suspects for this bombing and it's just based on nothing.

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:38.660
Like, he has nothing to demonstrate or prove that this was in any way anything other than

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:39.660
suicide bombings.

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.660
I don't know.

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:43.660
It feels like maybe it's the CIA or Mossad.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.660
Yeah, probably.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:45.660
Feels like it could be, Dan.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:54.660
So, one of the things that we've heard Alex say in various periods of time is conditional

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.660
acceptance of wars of regime change.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.660
Sure, sure.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:21:59.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.660
It's something he actually really does believe.

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:06.160
You know, if the government was leaving our liberties alone, leaving our guns alone, leaving

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.660
our freedoms alone, controlling our borders, and they said, let's invade Iraq because they're

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.660
bad.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.660
Let's invade Syria, Iran.

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:16.140
I could say, well, that violates what George Washington said.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.140
But you know what?

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.580
You can't really argue with it too much.

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:21.980
If they were really bringing freedom and all this, but they're not.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:22.980
They're mowing down protesters.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.700
They're giving them $20 a month to live on.

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.940
They're totally enslaving them.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.420
They're grabbing all the oil.

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:30.300
They're enslaving us here domestically.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.940
They got gun bills that dwarf all gun control ever seen that Bush says he's gonna sign.

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:41.180
Again, this is the same thing as the thing about prison labor.

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:46.220
It's somebody who has the same position as you being opposed to prison labor or being

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:53.780
opposed to the war in Iraq, but the reasons are not the same, and that's bad.

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:57.700
Because Alex is conditionally fine with regime change wars as long as people will just leave

01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.700
him alone.

01:22:58.700 --> 01:22:59.700
Yeah.

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:00.700
No, no, no.

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.700
Apartheid is bad.

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:02.700
Sometimes.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.700
That's not a good take.

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.700
That's not a good take, Dan.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.700
No.

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:06.700
Not a good take.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:10.020
No, because if you solve the wrong problem, then the bigger problem is okay.

01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:11.020
It's still there.

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.020
Hooray.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.020
It's okay with Alex.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.020
Yeah.

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:15.020
Yeah.

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.020
No, we can't have a dictator in this country.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.500
Well, I mean, we can have my dictator.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:18.500
Yeah.

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.500
That's a good dictator.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.780
I don't mind a dictator as long as they leave me alone.

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:23.100
It's gotta be my dictator who's gonna do what I say.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.100
Yeah.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.100
That's how I want things to work.

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.860
I tell people how to live.

01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:32.980
Now, I should tell you, I have studied everything about tyranny and I am probably the only person

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:37.660
who really understands it and is a voice against all forms of despotism.

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.740
Except for the women that I do.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:40.740
Right.

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:43.260
Because if you do my dictatorship, you'll never have another dictator.

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.260
Yeah.

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.260
Duh.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:50.700
And I think that this is indicative of the shallowness of Alex's opposition and the shallowness

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:57.340
of his beliefs, at least surrounding the issues that he presents himself as being on the marquee

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.340
of that.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:23:59.340
100 certain.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.340
Yeah.

01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.340
Yeah.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.340
Yeah.

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:03.340
Yeah.

01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.340
It's really troubling to me.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:08.140
And one of the things that I can't really get past is like how obvious it is listening

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:13.060
to this, that even if you didn't know that Alex turned into the biggest piece of shit

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.060
in the world.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:15.060
Right.

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:19.260
If I heard him say that back then, I would be like, wait a second.

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.260
Sure.

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.260
Wait a second.

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:25.900
You would be fine with this war if you didn't have your guns hypothetically needing to be

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:26.900
registered?

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:27.980
I don't know.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:28.980
You know?

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:29.980
That's one of those things.

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:37.000
And I think what it is not so much that as it is like I think about going back and watching

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.660
a movie from the 90s now and stuff pops up and you're like, I remember this movie as

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:43.660
being one thing.

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.660
Yeah.

01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.940
And now I saw this and I'm like, holy shit.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:47.940
That's definitely true.

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:51.860
I think if you give somebody the benefit of the doubt, especially during the time period,

01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:56.340
you're going to wind up missing or like skipping over in your brain just stuff and being like,

01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:58.420
he wasn't really thinking about that.

01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.420
He's on the radio.

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:00.420
He's just talking shit.

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.700
You know, like that kind of stuff.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:02.740
I guess that's true.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:08.420
And you can also, you can't account for like how differently you engage with things based

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:09.420
on the time.

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:10.420
Totally.

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:15.580
You know, like watching, I went back and I watched some of the like attitude era wrestling

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.580
not too long ago, a couple of years back.

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:18.580
And I was watching it.

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.580
I was horrified.

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.580
Yeah.

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:28.260
Some of the stuff was like, wow, not realize, oh, you go back and you're like, Jesus Christ.

01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.260
Yeah.

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.260
Yeah.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.260
So Alex has this, this story.

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:37.820
The main story of the episode is the bombing in Saudi Arabia.

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:41.460
There is no real actual discussion of it.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:46.360
There's no, I mean, there's discussion of it, but there's no information that he provides.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360
There's nothing.

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.360
You can't really discuss that.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360
It's a false flag.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.900
Every information that you get would be false information, Dan.

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.340
So you just got to speculate, right?

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:58.660
There's a lot of speculation and then also this, this is what I think is the most important

01:25:58.660 --> 01:25:59.660
thing.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:04.140
We'll be right back and I'll get into the NRA finally admitting the ultra gun grabbing

01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:05.140
is going on.

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:11.460
More on the bombings, more on the terror drills that coincide with the bombings, final control

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:12.460
is needed.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:19.740
See what happens when you don't become our slaves, the Batman come and eat boom, boom

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:20.740
you.

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:24.220
Operation Northwoods will be back.

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:28.700
So I have to say that this is a pretty desperate attempt to grasp at straws on Alex's part.

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:33.180
In order for his theories to make any sense, terrorist attacks have to match up with drills

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:37.980
and you can see here because he's already covered the top off drill, he'll accept any

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:41.260
event as connected regardless of how weak the argument is.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.260
Oh, totally.

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.500
His belief about the whole drill thing is that the globalists use drills so they can

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:50.300
have plausible deniability in case one of their plans goes wrong or, you know, someone

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.380
involved in the attack gets caught.

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:55.760
For instance, they'll run a bombing drill when they plan to carry out a bombing because

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.180
that way they can plan out the details of the bombing and if anybody asks what they're

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.740
doing, they can say it's for the drill.

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:01.740
Sure.

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:04.820
There are also ideas about how the globalists have to tell you what they're doing before

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.980
they do it according to some dumb intergalactic contract law.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:11.560
But generally speaking, this concept that the drills are used as cover is central to

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.300
why the connection between drill and event means anything.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.900
Alex's theories about the London 7-7 bombing rely on a misunderstanding about news reports

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:24.220
about a consultant giving a brainstorming presentation to business executives where

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:28.860
he had a scenario planned that closely mirrored the actual events of the bombing.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.980
That's a thin connection to draw, but at least the subject matter of the scenario and the

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:36.860
attack were similar enough that you could see what Alex is trying to say.

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:42.660
In this instance, there were a number of suicide bombings in residential compounds in Riyadh

01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:47.380
that were generally known to be occupied by foreigners, particularly Westerners.

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:52.500
Meanwhile, in Chicago and Seattle, there was an interagency exercise going on that simulated

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:57.140
a simultaneous biological attack in one city and a dirty bomb in another.

01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:01.340
These two situations lack the primary piece of the whole drill conspiracy puzzle, which

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:03.860
is that they're used to plan the attacks.

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.860
Yeah, that's what they're supposed to be.

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860
Or that there's a connection between the two.

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:06.860
That's what they're supposed to be used for.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:11.500
This is sloppy shit, and I'm kind of shocked that Alex's listeners wouldn't realize this.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.500
I can kind of understand buying the whole drill conspiracy when there's overlap between

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:20.720
the drill and the event, but even when you accept this nonsense, now Alex expects you

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.700
to believe this extends this far?

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:32.840
These completely unrelated and not even thematically connected scenarios in Seattle and Chicago

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:43.300
are somehow related to bombings in Riyadh, like when there's a very unpopular war happening

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.060
in Iraq.

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:51.580
That is probably one of the benefits for him of having constant global news at all times

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.980
because something is always happening.

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:57.540
So there's always something coincidentally happening with something else that he wants

01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:58.540
to claim.

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:01.180
Yeah, but this is, this is soft.

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:03.140
Oh, it's weak shit.

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:06.380
It is weak tea.

01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.660
It's a ways off.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:14.180
I wouldn't even, if I were Alex, I wouldn't even try this.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.340
He's a young gun.

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:16.620
He's inexperienced.

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:18.380
He's really giving a shot.

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:23.180
You gotta find your boundaries, and the only way to find your boundaries is to step beyond

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.180
them.

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:25.180
Fine.

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:28.500
So anyway, Alex talks about this a little bit more, and my only note on this is that

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:32.060
this is unfair.

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:36.660
Already into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast, wide open phones in the shower.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:44.660
We talk about the tragic, convenient, right on time bombings to legitimize the police

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:49.740
state and these drills they're running, the FEMA takeover drills, the martial law preparation

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:52.960
activation tests that's going on for the FEMA takeover.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:59.100
So now the bombings themselves are meant to give credibility to the exercises that are

01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.780
being run in Seattle and Chicago.

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:02.780
What the fuck?

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.780
No, I'm very tired.

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:05.020
You can't.

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.020
That exhausts me.

01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.020
Yeah.

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.020
This is pretzel shit, dude.

01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.020
Yeah, no.

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.900
No, you cannot eat your own tail at me.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:12.540
That's not possible.

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.800
Yeah, it's not, it's not fair.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.800
It's not fair.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:21.420
Either these exercises are used to provide cover and planning for the globalists or they're

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:28.580
part of contract law or they're not actually what's like, sometimes the terrorist attack

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.660
is actually about the exercise.

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:31.660
It's actually the reverse.

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:32.660
Sure.

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.660
Yeah.

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.660
That's what I was thinking.

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.660
He like twisted it around.

01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:40.600
So now that the, now the terrorist attack is providing cover for the drills instead

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.600
of the drills.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.840
I mean, I guess the reality is that when anything is fake, it doesn't matter.

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.840
That's a good point.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:52.180
If you believe or like your editorial line for these narratives is that all this stuff

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:57.540
is fake, it's no longer disrespectful to take something like this and use it however you

01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:59.600
want because who cares?

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:02.780
Your editorial position is just expediency.

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:09.660
Whatever's the, I, yeah, I don't know if anybody's ever really truly made a career out of taking

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:13.040
the path of least resistance quite like Alex.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.480
It's just like, I'm just flowing.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:20.000
You know, he's almost reached a zen position of just flowing through the river.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.480
Whatever bullshit comes out of his mouth, he just rides along it behind him.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:28.520
He's self-sustaining a fart blimp.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.760
That's what he is, Dan.

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.880
I have become one with the wind.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:36.240
He is the Hindenburg.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:42.320
So Alex takes some calls and he gets a call from a guy who gets pretty religious with

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.320
him.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320
Sure.

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:45.920
So quick, Alex hangs up on this guy.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:46.920
Okay.

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:52.880
But I also spend my life also in the scriptures and what's amazing to me, the things that

01:31:52.880 --> 01:32:00.000
are being spoken, not only by yourself, but there's a few others like you out there that

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.640
the scripture speaks of.

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:06.320
I hear you and I appreciate your call, Nante, and it's good to have you as a listener.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.320
Take care.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:15.440
If you're dead in Pennsylvania and you're on the air, go ahead.

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.280
This caller was saying that you're in the Bible.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.760
Alex, I am calling to say that you're a prophet.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.240
Listen, I don't have that kind of stuff on my show.

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:26.240
Cut to, I am the Messiah!

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.240
Yeah.

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.240
Yeah.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.240
Yeah.

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.240
Wow.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240
Quite a change.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240
God damn.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.240
Quite a change.

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.240
God damn that is fast.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.240
Yep.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:46.080
In 2003, one of his sort of primary positions and branding strategies is anti-police brutality

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.080
and anti-police stuff.

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.080
Yes.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.080
Yeah.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.080
Yeah.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.680
It's a quick, easy way to look above the left-right paradigm.

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:52.680
Yes.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:57.000
Because I mentioned it and it's online at info-wars.com right now.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.320
Councilwoman criticizes action by constables.

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:06.120
This is out of the Morning Call Online mainstream newspaper.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:11.960
They shot three dogs too fatally when they went to serve a warrant in Allentown for unpaid

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.120
parking tickets.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:19.560
Saying there is a doozy of a problem here, Allentown Councilwoman Gail Hoover expressed

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:24.780
outrage Sunday over the shooting of three dogs too fatally by constables serving a warrant

01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:27.400
on a man who had not paid parking tickets.

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:30.400
Obviously, this is not something I'm okay with.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.840
Police should never behave this way, and I think we can all agree on that.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.620
I just find it interesting that Alex ends up taking almost an entire segment on the

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:42.580
show to rant about this story, which is honestly tragic, but definitely doesn't seem like something

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.520
that needs to be front and center of the show's news that day.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.680
It just makes me really sad to see him spending like ten minutes decrying the evils of the

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:54.400
police killing two dogs, when in his later career he rationalizes that sometimes police

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.840
are right when they shoot unarmed black people.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.960
Personally, I'm opposed to all acts of police violence, but I don't think a story like this

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.800
actually ranks as important news for a number of reasons.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.480
The first is that even from Alex's headline, you can tell that the city council person

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.640
is upset about this event, and is pushing to take appropriate steps to address the issue.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.240
No, all globalists are evil.

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.440
In this instance, you can see unacceptable behavior from the police, but you can also

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.920
almost be certain that the victim is going to win a civil suit and have some kind of

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.920
restitution.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.040
And that's exactly what did end up happening, when they settled a claim against the cops

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.240
who shot their dogs for $320,000.

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.640
Money can never make up for the loss of a loved pet, but what can you do after the fact?

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.800
Hold people responsible and pay the victims.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:46.680
Even this story that came out in the morning call about this shooting prior to this episode

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:51.160
that Alex is recording quotes another cop who quote, said he wanted the family to know

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.440
that constables carry up to $500,000 in liability insurance.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.880
Quote, we're walking cash cows for a good lawyer, he said.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.840
Even other cops in the department were saying that they needed to do what needed to be done

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.840
to make things right.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.840
Wow.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.840
And they had a lot of insurance.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:12.120
That cop reminds me so much of that Kyle Kinane bit, where he's like, you know, you meet somebody,

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:16.660
you meet enough, you live an interesting enough life, you meet plenty of cops in your day.

01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:21.000
And every now and again, you find one who's just like there but for the grace of God,

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.080
he's like, I could have been working at the gas station or I could be in a cop pays five

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.080
bucks better.

01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.120
So, oh, man, that's great.

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.040
That cop just being like, hey, man, sue the shit out of me.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.400
I don't got to worry about shit.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.800
You got a lot of insurance.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.260
Come on.

01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.760
So we have one last clip here.

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:44.880
It's another story that Alex is sort of touching on, but he doesn't really know the details.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:50.080
And I'm driving along listening when I left to the, you know, seven o'clock news or whatever.

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:57.840
But I'm listening and they said that the that the governor with the Speaker of the House

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:05.360
has ordered the arrest of over 80 members of the legislature.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.360
And I'm listening.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.580
No, I'm not kidding.

01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:14.760
I'm listening to them reading this, this AP headline national headline, because they say

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.800
they've been ordered basically under Homeland Security to follow all orders, the voters

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.920
they're told by Washington.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.360
And then you hear this state rep from Houston saying they're taking over.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.600
We won't be part of this.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.600
And that's all it said.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.120
We don't know what they're talking about.

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.180
I typed in the article.

01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.180
It popped up.

01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.680
It just said they've been ordered to be arrested.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:42.380
See, I'm so conditioned in this la la land that I'm hearing that members of the House

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:46.680
have been ordered in the Senate to be arrested.

01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.880
I don't know how you do it.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.680
I mean, that's the fact people are listening right now in Texas, you heard this was on

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.520
national AP news, call into the show if you heard it, why I didn't print that article.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.640
I read it online last night when I got home, didn't print it didn't cover it.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.920
I can't keep track of it anymore.

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.480
Seems like if it's this kind of story, you probably should have thought to print it.

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:07.480
Yeah.

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.480
All right.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.880
So what happened here is that the Republicans had taken control of the Texas legislature

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:16.080
in the most recent election, and they were pushing a hard agenda that included harsh

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.480
spending cuts and redistricting.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:23.600
How funny is it that we no longer live in a world where I can assume after you say the

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:29.360
Texas Republicans took control of the legislature, that it would end in, in an election.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:33.960
The Texas House requires a quorum of at least a hundred of their members to actually meet

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.040
and vote on things.

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:40.620
So 58 of the Democrats in office decided just to not show up, to boycott the agenda that

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:43.560
they were essentially powerless to stop in a vote.

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:48.080
This is something they can do, and in response, the House Speaker has the authority to send

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:51.880
the Texas Rangers out to find them and bring them in to vote.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.360
It's basically hide and seek, but with the government.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.360
Exactly.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.060
52 of the lawmakers decided to get out of the state in order to avoid being arrested,

01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:03.160
so the Speaker requested help from other states to get them back into chambers.

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:04.160
Naturally.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.680
An Associated Press article includes an amazingly dishy response from New Mexico Attorney General

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:13.220
Patricia Madrid, who said that she had, quote, no authority to arrest lawmakers who show

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:18.360
up there, but went on to say, quote, nevertheless, I have put out an all-points bulletin for

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:22.480
law enforcement to be on the lookout for politicians in favor of health care for the needy and

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.600
against tax cuts for the wealthy.

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.440
Ha ha ha ha!

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.440
Goddamn!

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440
Woo!

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.440
Get her!

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.000
Oh, get her on Roast Battle!

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Shit!

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Yeah.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Goddamn!

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.880
The Democrats returned when the time had elapsed for the bill, but it didn't matter.

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:40.340
Governor Rick Perry held repeated special sessions to push through the redistricting

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:44.320
plan and eventually got it passed, thereby gerrymandering the hell out of the state house

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:48.960
districts and giving a very strong advantage to Republicans to remain in power.

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.640
Alex is pretending that this is an instance of power-mad folks having their political

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:57.540
opponents arrested and sent to the hole, but the reality is it's part of political maneuvering

01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:02.280
that's uncommon, but it's not really outside of the standard rules set forth by the Texas

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.280
House.

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.920
Yeah, it's power-mad politicians so corrupt that they're willing to destroy their entire

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.880
state in order to ensure that right-wing politics rules the day.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.880
Listen.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:16.400
It has nothing to do with putting your political enemies in the hooskout.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.240
Listen, the gerrymandering and the redistricting stuff is the real issue.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.240
That's the real problem.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.520
That's the conversation.

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:23.840
That's corrupt and power-hungry.

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:32.540
The sending Texas Rangers out to bring people back to vote is a silly portion of the rules

01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:33.540
of –

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:34.540
Yeah, we live in a weird world.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:35.540
Yes.

01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:38.040
It's a sort of government procedure.

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:44.640
Yeah, there is that, like, I understand that we have those rules, but this is childish.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.640
Sure.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640
This is silly.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.280
Like how you have to say, like, the good, gentlewoman from New Hampshire.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280
Totally.

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.280
Shut the fuck up.

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.280
I don't need this bullshit.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.280
Yeah.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.280
So, we reached the end of this.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.560
I mean, that was a pretty boring episode, the 13th, I gotta say.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560
Yeah.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.560
Not much goes on.

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.560
It did not feel like it.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560
A lot of talk about that bombing.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560
Sure.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.040
A lot of actual information.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:10.360
But I think that we stumbled upon something fairly important here, and this is –

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:16.120
The satanic cabal, living underneath DC, swallowing the blood of our children.

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:22.760
The way that this is characterized, the way this sort of has a little bit of a clue leading

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:27.640
back to Tex Mars is a bit troubling.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:34.400
And I'm worried about what we're actually going to find through this fanciful and seemingly

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:39.160
fun investigation into when Alex started thinking he was fighting the devil.

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:40.160
Yeah.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:48.680
The uncovering that maybe this, too, is all rooted in appropriated or exploited anti-Semitic

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:52.100
ideals is not what I would have liked.

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:59.220
It does feel a lot like that day you're like, hey, Carrie Cassidy, kind of an anti-Semite.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:04.840
And then it all crumbled down and you're like, fuck, all fun things just wind up with anti-Semitism

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:05.840
at the bottom.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.840
Brutal.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:14.560
It does seem that this might be another indication or another example of that, and we will see.

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.040
We will check back in and, you know, we'll see what we find.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.000
I hope it really goes well for him.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Alex?

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.520
I have bad news.

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.520
He shows up.

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.520
I hope he gets his act together.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.520
Oh, no.

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.360
Right now, I feel like 2003, there's a bright future ahead of him.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.680
Eighteen years later, he will be on air threatening to eat his neighbors.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.680
There's that.

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:35.680
There is that.

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.680
Okay.

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.680
I don't think it goes well.

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.600
It's at best lateral because he's richer.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.600
That's true.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.600
He's much richer.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.600
That's true.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:45.600
That's true.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:46.600
That's true.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.600
In some ways.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.600
Yeah.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.680
Anyway, we'll check back in, but until then, we have a website.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.680
We do have a website.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:51.680
It's at knowledgefight.com.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.680
Yep.

01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:53.680
We're also on Twitter.

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:54.680
We are on Twitter.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.680
It's at knowledge underscore fight.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:56.680
And I go to bed.

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.680
And we're on iTunes.

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.200
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area.

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.200
Yep.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.200
We'll be back.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.200
I'm Leo.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.200
I'm DZX.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.200
Clark.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.200
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:10.200
I kind of think that steak knife is a fine code name.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.200
Andy in Kansas.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.200
You're on the air.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.200
Thanks for holding.

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.200
Hello, Alex.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.200
I'm a first time caller.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.200
I'm a huge fan.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200
I love your work.

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.200
I love you.
