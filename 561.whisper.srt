00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,480
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,920
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

Andy and Chanzas, you're on the air.

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Thanks for holding.

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Hello, Alex.

28
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm a first-time caller.

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
I'm a huge fan.

30
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
I love your room.

34
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,680
Hey, everybody.

35
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,600
Welcome back to Fight Knowledge.

36
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
I am Jordan.

37
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm Dan.

38
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,520
This is the podcast where Celine worships at the altar of Dan Friesen, and we talk about

39
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,560
anybody but Alex Jones.

40
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,120
Me and Celine have a collaborative worship relationship.

41
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,440
It's a real mutual worship kind of thing.

43
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Very symbiotic.

45
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
If you will.

46
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,920
Jordan, I have a question for you.

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
What's that, Dan?

48
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,120
What is your bright spot for today?

49
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,440
My bright spot for today is... I'm not trying to plug.

50
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
I have no interest in plugging.

51
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Oh, shit.

52
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,000
This sounds like it's a lead-in to a plug.

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,800
We did an episode of the other show that we do, the D&D show.

54
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
The Dungeons and Dragons.

55
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Yes.

56
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
God's damn wizard.

57
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
God's damn wizard.

58
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
You are the dungeon master.

59
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Yeah.

60
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
And last night-

61
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Slightly competent dungeon master.

62
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,480
Oh, boy.

63
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,840
Flailing about dungeon master.

64
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,880
But last night we recorded, and it had been a couple of weeks since we recorded, and it

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
was so fucking great.

66
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
It was a lot of fun.

67
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,600
To hang out with all of the... with Marty and Liz and Sarah and you.

68
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,480
It's just so much fun to hang out.

69
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Yeah, it is.

70
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
It is.

71
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,200
It's a fun social thing that we don't get enough of these days, and we could have been

72
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
doing stuff like it this whole time.

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
The whole time?

74
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Yeah.

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
It turns out it was always there.

76
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah.

77
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Yeah.

78
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,000
And I admire your effort that you've put into that.

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,120
You know, we shit on you a bit, but it wouldn't work if you didn't have a story-

80
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
No, that's true.

81
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
For it.

82
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
That is true.

83
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
No, and it's just so much fun.

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,200
If you like it, you like it.

85
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
That's great.

86
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,960
But I like it, so everybody else can go to hell.

87
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
That kind of thing.

88
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,140
Well, your bright spot actually kind of weaves into mine a little bit, and that is that we

89
00:02:51,140 --> 00:03:00,580
did do that Dungeons & Dragons-ish role-playing thing, and it got away from me a little bit.

90
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,560
I had a few drinks, and I watched the White Rapper show on VH1.

91
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,740
For a long time, it was not available anywhere.

92
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,760
I couldn't find the actual episodes, and I started watching some of it on YouTube.

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,720
It's now available on YouTube.

94
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,280
Thank God for internet archivists who are just like, yeah, I guess it was a show in

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
2003.

96
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,080
We're going to find it, and we're going to put it up.

97
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
It's going to be out there.

98
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,640
It doesn't matter what it is.

99
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,680
I watched the finale, and John Brown is great.

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
That's my bright spot.

101
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
John Brown.

102
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
John Brown.

103
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
King of the burbs.

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,200
King of the burbs, and king of murdering slave owners.

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
The two greats of John Browning.

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
You know what I say about murdering slave owners?

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Hooray!

108
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Hallelujah, holla back.

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,080
Yeah, there we go.

110
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:59,960
Well, Dan, for today's episode, episode number six of Jordan Takes the... Well, 5.1 since

111
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
we lost five.

112
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Yeah.

113
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
I think we have to call this five.

114
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
We'll call this five.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,120
But I am engineering this to make sure that audio doesn't disappear.

116
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, I did notice that.

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,520
So today we are going to be talking about Nazis and aliens, Dan.

118
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Oh, thank God.

119
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
That's what I'm all about.

120
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh my God.

121
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,160
I will say this.

122
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
I went through-

123
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,040
You told me that you had found something that was really exciting and really interesting.

124
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,800
I didn't know what to expect, and you telling me that it's Nazis and aliens, that is as

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,840
good as it could have been as a reveal.

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
It's about as good as it can get, then.

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
Thank you, Jordan.

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,500
So we will be talking about one, maybe or maybe not, Dr. Joseph Ferrell.

129
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,720
But I think before we do that, we're going to need to say thank you to some people who

130
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
have-

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,220
Yes, I think we would agree to do that.

132
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,720
So first, let's say what's up to Peaches are Nasty, Plums are Supreme.

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,960
You're now a policy wonk.

134
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
I'm a policy wonk.

135
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Thank you very much.

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
I totally agree with that too.

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Plums are underrated.

138
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Yeah, wrong.

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Next, SirMcSwagins III.

140
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840

180
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,480
mixed up Dan Snyder and Dennis Hastert in my head okay and they're both

181
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,000
monsters so that sure sure and then also Newt I got a fantastic lovely email from

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Newt and I'd like to wish Newt a happy birthday although you could go with a

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,520
Gingrich on this one but you shouldn't no actually that's my grandfather's name

184
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,920
is that right it is his name I didn't know that oh yeah yeah it's a strange

185
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,040
name it is well he's his birth name I believe is not I believe his birth name

186
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,080
is noble okay and somehow they just started calling him I guess at a certain

187
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,440
point in time Newt was short for noble and so that's how he goes Wow yeah how

188
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,120
about that I don't dislike it as a name and also while we're in Hawaii I will be

189
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,920
chasing down a ton of lizards and newts and for shows oh you got so iguana I

190
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,000
might come back with a bunch of iguanas oh yeah we're gonna get a new thing of

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
luggage we're gonna poke some holes in it and you're just gonna have a bag of

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,920
lizards that you're wandering around with I think that that was one of the

193
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,960
most important parts of my childhood in Hawaii was fine it was so we will

194
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,360
reclaim a little bit of that anyway fun than the plains of central Midwest I

195
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,640
will say that so Jordan I hear I hear that we have a conversation about Nazis

196
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,000
and aliens indeed we do today we will be talking about an interview that Joseph

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,440
Farrell gave with Richard Surrett who does the conspiracy show with Richard

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,640
Surrett he is also a regular guest host on coast to coast okay so so he's he's

199
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,240
that kind of one of the junior varsity guys yeah yeah I don't keep track of

200
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,120
those guys unfortunately no and we're yeah there he's he's pretty I don't know

201
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:26,880
we'll see how how much you like him but Joseph Farrell is called a doctor a has

202
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,920
from what his bio says a doctorate of patristics from Oxford University okay

203
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,760
which is basically a theology kind of thing if you go by what many people who

204
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,320
of interviewing have given him credits for he has a doctorate of physics if you

205
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,880
go by other people he has a doctorate of what was it not patristics either

206
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,360
philosophy none of which I think he has uh-huh I kind of don't think that he

207
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,440
went to Oxford mainly because he has one story about his time at Oxford and I can

208
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,520
find no evidence that this Joseph Farrell went to Oxford however there's

209
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,840
another Joseph Farrell with a doctorate of economics from Oxford okay that's

210
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,640
possible and his story from Oxford his years there is he was at a debate at the

211
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,440
Oxford Union Society that lasted for eight days oh my god and it was

212
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,600
sponsored by Heineken for the Ethiopia food relief right right around live aid

213
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,600
all of that stuff and endurance debate yes and here's the thing here's the

214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,000
thing if this is true then Boris fucking Johnson was there whoa because they were

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,320
but Boris was running the Union debate society uh-huh and so we should know

216
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,400
about this were they on opposite sides of the issue or they don't know allegedly

217
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,480
no no what I'm saying is he doesn't mention Boris Johnson at all it seems

218
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,040
like it would be a headline seems like you would know if you were at a eight

219
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,520
day debate with the future fucking Prime Minister of the United Kingdom yeah

220
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,720
the debate went so long that I had to break pencils and make a little fire in

221
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,360
order to keep warm yeah like Wade Boggs exactly yes absolutely he also according

222
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,280
to himself grew up in South Dakota and one fun story he tells is that when he

223
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,640
was growing up he was around six or seven years old and his best friends

224
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:38,560
there were more than one of them who had fathers who fought for the Germans in

225
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:48,240
World War two so great bread yeah so he grew up around Nazis yeah now here is

226
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,240
the kind of thing you generally want to keep a close to the vest I don't want to

227
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,960
tell people cuz he and he tosses it off like hey they fought for the Germans

228
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,760
yeah it's weird enough that like you know we we do a show where Alex talks

229
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,080
about like being Confederate Royal yeah exactly that's weird enough but I would

230
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,120
I would think that like I know people and I hung out who's who were not we're

231
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:17,000
not they were just Nazis yeah no big deal um but he is however a scholar I

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,120
think the fact that he grew up around Nazis will explain a lot of his later on

233
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,000
his later life however he is definitely a scholar he's got at least a master's

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,680
degree that I can confirm and he has written a total of maybe 40 45 books

235
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,960
that's too many books way too many here's the strangest part though okay

236
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,720
his first books are all about religion he translated the mystagogy of the Holy

237
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,360
Spirit by patriarch Phodios from the Greek and apparently it's a really good

238
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,080
translation and he he's cited writing the foreword in in Christian circles of

239
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:01,840
the well holy cow this is foreign to our show totally totally he wrote free will

240
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,040
in st. Maximus the confessor which is him trying to deal with Calvinism he

241
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,920
does not do well and then the disputation of Pyrrhus as well as what

242
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:20,000
was the other one do God history and dialectic which is his final religious

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,240
book now that was published in 1997 in 2002 he published his next book which

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,720
would begin the future of his career hmm would you like to guess what the title

245
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,080
of that book might be well I mean you've already sort of tilted some of these

246
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:47,080
cards indeed and I think there's aliens involved probably so I would I would say

247
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,320
that likely it has something to do with space Raptors being involved with the

248
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,120
Holocaust he's a Death Star okay that's right if you thought that the pyramids

249
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,900
were just tombs you're an idiot totally that pyramid is a Death Star exactly

250
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,000
like well the one from Star Wars I would like to bring up that they were for

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,680
storing grain during the presidential debates from there he went on an

252
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,720
absolute terror that continues to this day he keeps cranking out books some of

253
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,800
which the titles can be like this grid of the gods the aftermath of the cosmic

254
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,920
war and the physics of the pyramid peoples who not a bad title uh Reich of

255
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,000
the Black Sun Nazi secret weapons and the Cold War Allied legend oh boy yeah

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,720
let's see financial vipers in Venice alchemical money magical physics and

257
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,200
banking in the Middle Ages and Renaissance of all of his titles there's

258
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,800
four of them in his early life that are like I am a good Christian I read

259
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,480
theology I'm focused on this and he's a good historian and then he something

260
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,680
happens and he's just off the map yeah like completely off the map and winds

261
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:18,680
up on the SPLC's hate watch list because he is oh why well you know

262
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,440
that's something that I have been struggling with because I think if

263
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:30,680
you'll listen to him as we go along he's not a Nazi what I think he is is a Nazi

264
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:39,880
fanboy that's that can be as bad it is it is weird it is really weird yeah it's

265
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,160
a strange and it's it's not a big distinction it's a strange one in that I

266
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,880
don't think he wants the Nazis to win mm-hmm but I do think he's amazed at how

267
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:57,280
good the Nazis were at finding alien technology hmm which is a very strange

268
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,920
a subset of anti-semitism sure but it's there it's definitely I'm interested to

269
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,040
see how you lay out this argument well I mean so so he's he's another of the he

270
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,240
talks about globalists makes the makes a bunch of puns about them he's he

271
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,080
fancies himself a bit of a Dennis Miller type sure but yeah I don't know we'll

272
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,320
see we'll see how that goes um then there are another thing there are

273
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,720
another few things that are incredibly annoying about him for instance he

274
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,440
always wears a hat and it is always it is either a Indiana Jones hat or a

275
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,160
classic English bowler this guy's from South Dakota yeah I went to Oxford yeah

276
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,360
I think he might be playing that a little bit well I wore I wore a bowler

277
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,120
for a little while in high school tell people you went to Oxford I had no I

278
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:02,520
but it was a desperate affectation yeah yeah and here's one that's even worse he

279
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,320
chain smokes chain smokes with a Cruella Deville cigarette holder oh my god I

280
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,060
love this and he does not inhale he chain smokes and he just puffs the smoke

281
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:20,160
out the whole time so it's it's so infuriating to watch this man I'm just

282
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,280
screaming at him like I quit smoking stop doing this there's a part of me

283
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,520
that kind of enjoys that because it's so intentional yeah it's it's not so

284
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:38,000
obvious yeah like no it couldn't be more pathetic or or his life is art and this

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,840
is a piece of the there's also there's a well we'll see if he was parodying the

286
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:53,920
type of it's oh if he is doing like a Kaufman thing so say that what happened

287
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,720
after his religious books ended is he was like oh shit actually religion

288
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,120
might be stupid I'm going to create this character and pull off a decades-long

289
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,760
scam to show people just how easy and how similar religion and Giza Death Star

290
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,440
really are what what if he just saw Andy Kaufman do his wrestling totally sort of

291
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,200
stretch it was like totally I could do this but with religion it's not hard he

292
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,520
he was he was on his translating game yeah and he came across a text he didn't

293
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,360
tell anybody about it translated it up right and he's like oh no oh no I must

294
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,600
satirize I got it somebody's got to do it yeah if nobody else is stepping up to

295
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,700
the plate it's got to be me mm-hmm yeah he's he's a he's a real like professor

296
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,680
type but the kind who kind of creepily talks to his students and chain smokes

297
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:00,280
with a thing but doesn't inhale he says so on and so forth almost at the end of

298
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,200
everything he says it is the most he's just an annoying guy he's just such an

299
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,640
annoying guy you know what though I mean I say be that as it may and totally

300
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,000
interesting like I you can't fault somebody necessarily for their tics those

301
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,120
that you know cliches and now no problem but after every sentence people people

302
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,920
just have ways of speaking and so on and so forth that's fair that's fair and so

303
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:32,000
forth so on we go I what is going to happen I've listened to probably like

304
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,480
15 hours of this guy talk and none of it was it all remotely usable yeah little

305
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,360
behind the scenes yeah George you you were telling me how interesting this

306
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,720
person is and how much you wanted to talk about him but he's so boring yes

307
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,480
you'd watched hours and hours of stuff there's nothing here and then and then

308
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,800
last night he goes on Richard Surrett show surprisingly enough and there is a

309
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:07,200
lot of interesting stuff there also in this particular interview Joseph Pharrell

310
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,080
is looking into the webcam on his computer and he is holding an old-time

311
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,920
phone up to his ear like a big old-timey phone like the the peach ones that you

312
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,040
could really slam with a wire cord the ones that had like that you had to put

313
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,760
your finger in and and go around the rotary the whole thing yeah it was it is

314
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,960
it is so ridiculous to watch a man in a webcam holding a phone up to his ear I

315
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,000
like that I kind of do but old man house phone would have been like that's tacky

316
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,960
you should have just done audio that's actually got some Intel on this he has a

317
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,280
hamburger phone it's a house phone but it's a hamburger okay so he threw away

318
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:57,080
his old Bart Simpson phone yes it upgrade oh yeah so we are going to

319
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,800
begin this interview and you are going to hear Richard Surrett give you some

320
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,120
whiplash if we get they're doing they're gonna open up they say in phases so the

321
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,080
first phase if 60% of the population is vaccinated will give you a little bit of

322
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,120
your normal back if then in phase two if 70% you'll get a little sliver of your

323
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,600
normal life back and then finally phase three we need 80% of you vaccinated I

324
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,920
mean I don't want to argue the efficacy or the safety of vaccines and people

325
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,520
want to have the vaccine that's certainly their business and those that

326
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,280
don't that's their business but this this level of coercion you know have we

327
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,440
forgotten about the Nuremberg Code I mean how can how can people have such

328
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:51,880
short memories that's I mean that's that's very yeah what's fun about that I

329
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,160
find it so interesting that he is reasonable all the way like you know

330
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,080
what if you want to get the vaccine I'm not gonna be a huge answer it's killing

331
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,520
you and if you don't want to get the vaccine I'm not gonna be like I'll kill

332
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,520
you if you don't well I think that but the Nuremberg Code you know like that

333
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,320
kind of reasonableness is kind of a facade though like I don't want to argue

334
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,200
the time for it right yeah that's not somebody being like I'm on board yeah

335
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,920
that's just like I don't want to I don't want to deal yeah um but like the

336
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:31,280
Nuremberg Code kind of argument is is very present in Infowars world yeah like

337
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,880
Francis Boyle brings that up a lot yeah it's annoying it is it's just them

338
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,280
saying hey this is how science and math works if we have this level of

339
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,240
protection then you can do this number of things yeah it's not hard the

340
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,320
argument that I would make back to this I think would be like all right let's

341
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,920
imagine a scenario where this isn't all fake or whatever this is an actual

342
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,640
pandemic how does what's going on now look different than what would be the

343
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,680
best thing to do what what is the like do you do you do you accept this

344
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:15,400
vaccination Quotia quota or quotient is appropriate in the case of a real

345
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:23,000
outbreak yeah if so then yeah what that that's that's what I would I would like

346
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,200
to do could you plan a better way yeah right so we open the interview and of

347
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,740
course we're gonna talk about you know kovat denialism and the like well we

348
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,460
brought up Nuremberg and that has a new Nazis so I assume you got it so Joseph

349
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:49,320
p4l has some things he would like to say is he happy sorry Pharrell joke if these

350
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,080
vaccines were so safe why why are they resorting to such draconian measures to

351
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:06,040
push people into receiving them they're not exactly and the answer to that even

352
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,240
if they were is because of assholes like you who are telling everybody not to get

353
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,600
them I feel like they're being like people are being pretty aware that like

354
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,480
it's important but like you know I I don't know I don't think I've ever seen

355
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,520
anything that would indicate to me like coercion of vaccination I think that

356
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,720
most of the people who I am in social circles with have been chomping at the

357
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,120
bit yeah yeah and and have hunted down no we almost drove five hours to get you

358
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,120
a vaccine yeah and and now you know the CDC had that that recommendation that

359
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,720
people can stop wearing masks in public that that if they've been vaccinated and

360
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,640
that is just a measure of trust yeah you know like if you like that's not like

361
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,920
everyone must wear a special shirt that they only get from vaccination centers

362
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,960
and then they cannot wear masks right or whatever like there's no coercion no

363
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,760
what draconian policies are you talking about recommendation exactly like what

364
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,000
is going on here yeah I honestly think that it could be more dry would almost

365
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,600
agree yes you're totally right you're totally right and it's just that it's

366
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,200
just it's always a trap it doesn't matter it doesn't matter especially with

367
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,080
this guy anything that you say confidently you are either right about

368
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,760
but here's what you're missing or you are completely wrong about and I have a

369
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,680
completely different idea so here is let's go ahead and play this is a long

370
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,600
clip because I want everybody to get an idea of what this dude talks like and

371
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:55,680
how he talks so just see if he answers this question Richard is going to ask

372
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,440
him how much of this is preparing us for a world without jobs here is how that

373
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,160
goes well I think a lot of it is at least in their thinking but I'll tell

374
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,680
you something Richard there's something very peculiar going on in in railroads

375
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,120
and and people that know me know where I'm gonna go with this because my dad

376
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,920
was a railroad engineer not you know not the locomotive kind but the engineer

377
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,800
that inspects the tracks and so on and so forth when I was very very young and

378
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,400
he got me fascinated with with steam locomotives and if you have been

379
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,960
following what's been happening with railroads in this country the Union

380
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Pacific Railroad has been restoring the steam locomotives at a breathtaking rate

381
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,520
they just finished restoration of an articulated big-boy steam locomotive

382
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,320
4884 to you know haul freight and so on and so forth now the interesting thing

383
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,920
is Union Pacific isn't investing all this money to basically create a

384
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,960
locomotive works in Cheyenne Wyoming to to enhance railroad heritage days

385
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,840
there's something else going on and my suspicion is that with the increasing

386
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,200
reliance of global technology on digital systems they've suddenly realized that

387
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,000
they've exposed themselves and there's their precious systems to a little thing

388
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,040
called electromagnetic pulse or for that matter hacking cyber hacking and so on

389
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,680
and so forth we just saw the colonial pipeline takedown so I think mr.

390
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,300
global Oni is also kind of hoist by his own petard they're trying to put in

391
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,600
digital systems and particularly digital currencies so what you're seeing has

392
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,240
pushback at least here in the States I can't speak for up there for the

393
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Canadian provinces but in in several states in this country we've seen some

394
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,280
pushback of a very unusual nature against this idea of digital currency

395
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,940
South Carolina passed a measure recently to acknowledge as legal tender for all

396
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:10,720
transactions interestingly enough that the coin had to be denominated in

397
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,600
dollars Texas opened its own state bullion depository and so on and so

398
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,480
forth so you're seeing some very unusual pushback that tells me that somebody at

399
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,680
least in some of these states knows what the game is and they're acting

400
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:32,680
accordingly to to secure some sort of basis for a currency should they try to

401
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,680
roll out a digital system with their helicopter money and the missing jobs

402
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:45,360
and a universal basic income and so on and so forth look did he answer the

403
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,080
question yeah no I forgot what the question was right I was I was going

404
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,200
along with what he was saying about railroads railroads rare earths I think

405
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,580
he was speculating that steam engine locomotives could get hacked and I don't

406
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,280
know what was going on with that and that was interesting I was I was

407
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,200
thrilled to find out about steam hacking and then it pivoted to digital currency

408
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,600
yeah I don't know what's going on anymore so the question was how much of

409
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,220
this whole lockdown is preparing us for a world without jobs his answer was all

410
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,080
the railroads well I think yeah a lot of it is at least the way that they say it

411
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,320
and then he goes on for two full minutes about something completely unrelated

412
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,360
actually but I'm not something who is the multiple things that are completely

413
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,080
unrelated I resent this because I'm not interested in the cryptocurrency

414
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,960
nonsense but I am interested in the locomotives would you like to know

415
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,200
about the locomotive yes I would all righty I definitely would like to hear

416
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,120
him talk more about hacking trains well here it well his his thoughts and and he

417
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,160
said that anybody who knows me knows this oh yeah so it's like maybe it's a

418
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,080
big thing this is a big thing of his this is a huge thing of his you know

419
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,920
what you know it's very hackable cool ah you're you've got it backwards he's

420
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,400
saying that Union Pacific is restoring old steam engine trains because they

421
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,040
know that eventually all the electromagnetic trains are going to be

422
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,080
disabled by an EMP oh yeah that actually makes more sense like as a coherent

423
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,760
thought than I thought it yeah yeah yeah well I mean kind of because I thought

424
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,960
he was speculating that like steam would be hacked right it makes sense that it's

425
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,040
like all these trains are digital then we have to have these as a backup

426
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,720
raise these steam yeah it's steampunk yeah yeah and then of course futuristic

427
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,960
giant mechanical robot spiders if we could get some flying steam engines

428
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,660
Allah back to the future 3 I'm gonna be stoked yeah so would you like to know

429
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,040
what's going on with Union Pacific rebuilding those trains this is from

430
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,480
Justin Franz of Atlas Obscura I'll just go ahead and read you the headline real

431
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,100
quick one of the world's largest steam locomotives is about to make a

432
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,560
triumphant return hold on to your engineer caps railroad history lovers

433
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:20,800
choo-choo does that sound like a nefarious so it's very very simple six

434
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,120
days after six decades after the last big boy was taken off the rails the

435
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,800
Union Pacific is rebuilding one of the famous locomotives in honor of the

436
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,880
upcoming sesquicentennial celebration of the first transcontinental railroad

437
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,840
yeah it's kind of like a tourist attraction yeah or something yeah

438
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,440
absolutely it's a celebration as far as the digital currencies go what he's

439
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,960
talking about is states having repositories for gold bullion and you

440
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,120
know like certain states saying you have to take gold if somebody gives it to

441
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,480
right right and I don't know why he's a bothering about that because you'll

442
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,760
notice what states specifically he's referencing they are states that one are

443
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,560
filled with people who say would rather have the state have a gold bullion

444
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,400
depository then sending a large amount of money to Ted Anderson hmm that would

445
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,160
be that would be smart sure and then of course with South Carolina and the like

446
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,800
they're filled with people who are like the money the dollar is gonna explode so

447
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,360
they might they pass all these laws all the time it's just random-ass nonsense I

448
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,440
would really love for you to sit me down uh-huh with a map of the United States

449
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:47,560
and tell me state by state what it's full of people who are like ad dollars

450
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:54,360
gonna explode and this one I know it's just potatoes my version of the

451
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:03,760
Animaniacs song Africa Panama yeah so yeah that is that is kind of the way

452
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,760
that he talks so past that I've tried to kind of edit it down for clarity yeah as

453
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,040
you will seems he seems like a guy who is boring as hell uh-huh but also is

454
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,440
teasing like slightly interesting thoughts yes yes in a way that's

455
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,960
frustrating and now you realize why I was like I gotta talk about this guy but

456
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,400
he's so goddamn bored yeah yeah yeah so uh this is this next clip is basically

457
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:38,880
another in a very similar stretch so you mentioned the colonial pipeline and the

458
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,640
the cyber criminals that effectively shut that down and caused you know long

459
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,960
lineups at the the gas stations and so forth and and really kind of a I think a

460
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,160
warning shot of things to come and then then colonial admits that they ended up

461
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:03,160
paying five million dollars in ransom in cryptocurrency I think we're probably

462
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,680
not getting a full story here what what are you hearing about what really

463
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,560
happened I mean was this really just an isolated you know an incident of some

464
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,000
gang of cyber criminals that decided you know to roll the dice and see what would

465
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,920
happen and lo and behold yeah they paid up I mean what what are you hearing

466
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,840
about okay so that is the question mm-hmm okay yeah very simple long-winded

467
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,160
question it's a long-winded question everybody on these shows also every show

468
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,180
that I think I've seen him do an interview on is at least three hours

469
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:38,360
long mm-hmm this one was thankfully only an hour and 51 minutes I'll say that

470
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,860
like in terms of like a lot of the stuff that I listen to in conspiracy that that

471
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:50,720
that sort of sphere I will at least this guy's being precise yes and like it it's

472
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,880
it's not good or all that like I don't know if we're gonna get to any truth

473
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,360
sure sure asking a specific question right right no no I'm going to be said

474
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,560
for that I kind of I I won I like that Richard Surratt is doing a Casey Kasem

475
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,240
impression yes uh so much so much I'm waiting for him to do top 40 hits we're

476
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:18,980
gonna talk about the going to the left and the right I suspect they paid seven

477
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:29,600
million dollars and ransom what about you and also here is 303 so why did it

478
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,320
come with 303 really don't know where'd that one come from I don't know man

479
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,280
okay it's trying to think of bad music and it was the first thing you could

480
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,040
have done worse now um so simple question what do you think is what are

481
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,840
you hearing what's going on do you have do you feelers out yeah well I've heard

482
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,240
basically the same thing but I'm like you I don't think that we've heard all

483
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,840
of the story and one of the interesting things about the colonial thing that I

484
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,040
don't know what how it was reported up there but there's some of the media down

485
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,880
here was reciting government officials and so on saying things to the effect

486
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:14,480
that this is there there will be more of this so yeah yeah so he's citing

487
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,200
government officials saying that there will be more of this and all he's really

488
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,720
responding to him with is yeah I think you're about right there and then he

489
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,000
goes off on a different thing that you didn't know about like that kind of

490
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,400
every time you introduce something or ask a direct question it is immediate

491
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,800
like well maybe and then going off into whatever it is he really wants to talk

492
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,160
about right everybody just listens to him like that's fine

493
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,360
I have watched him talk for almost 10 minutes uninterrupted and people are

494
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,720
wrapped by this and it's blowing me away by people you mean you no no I mean the

495
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,720
the interviewers right right they're all sitting there there's YouTube like this

496
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,320
is not a small thing neither uh-huh these are there's a plenty of people

497
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,500
like constantly doing all those things people aren't cutting him off no like

498
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:12,880
three minutes in your answer totally you should absolutely be doing that so I the

499
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,320
answer is yes it'll probably happen again obviously well that's that I mean

500
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,440
like what he's doing is playing that game of like the the the government is

501
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,840
is being like hey this is a new threat yeah this is something that we can't

502
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,800
expect might happen again we need to prepare strategies to deal with this

503
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,640
right you are a business like the colonial pipeline that has like maybe

504
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:45,200
infrastructure related necessity yeah in your operations be aware yeah and

505
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,720
instead he's prepared he's presenting that as like the government being like

506
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,840
and do this yeah this is happening all the time now again I would I would ask

507
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:01,600
if like this is real and there are these hackers doing this how is that statement

508
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,120
from the government any different than the best-case scenario of a statement

509
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,720
that they would make as a warning what is the differentiation between it uh

510
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,680
well they never do that well fine yeah now I assume you would think hey that

511
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,000
answer is over you've answered the question yes probably and it's probably

512
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,560
a false flag he is not done he's not nope he keeps going about a week after

513
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,240
that story broke there was a story about the interstate bridge on Interstate 40

514
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:38,600
from the bridge Tennessee the bridge was shut down because they had discovered a

515
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,200
crack in one of the pylons on that bridge and I think pictures of this

516
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,760
crack and the top of the crack is is a perfect straight line now the effect of

517
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,040
that bridge shut down was that barge traffic on the Mississippi River south

518
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,760
and north of Memphis Tennessee came to an absolute standstill so somebody

519
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,920
appears to me to be working awfully hard to take down the the infrastructure of

520
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,640
the United States and in these kinds of creative ways so I think colonial

521
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,840
pipeline is kind of the tip of an iceberg that that they're getting ready

522
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:26,400
to do something major in order to push their agenda all right yeah get it yeah

523
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,160
see what happened was the colonial pipeline was hacked now what also

524
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,920
happened was surprisingly enough very near to where he lives there was a crack

525
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,760
in the bridge right but the reason that the government gave for repairing it was

526
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,320
pesky barges need to get in and out because it's a massive actually water

527
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,440
ways this is genius okay do you realize tell me on that for the last like 10

528
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,360
years the globalists have been planting stories in the media about how bad our

529
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:07,880
bridges are subtly warning right that they're gonna hack the bridge you have

530
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,000
to you have to tell everyone you have to give them that cosmic choice there have

531
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,400
been these op-eds about how more resources should be funneled towards

532
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,340
bridge repair that's what they do so sneaky now the real story behind the

533
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,600
hack is actually really really fascinating and if they had bothered to

534
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,800
look into it well that's not the bridge right no not the okay no the bridge is

535
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,600
not interesting just that's just a regular old bridge that's just

536
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,120
maintenance yeah they were just maintaining the bridge I had a hunch

537
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,440
yeah it was fine but you can turn anything you want into a conspiracy

538
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,800
theory if you just go well they hacked the pipeline and there's a crack in my

539
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,800
bridge right the government's working against if you just if you if you play

540
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,320
the insinuation game you can you can make a lot of mileage yeah exactly but

541
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:03,020
the real story is not obviously they didn't mention any names of the people

542
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,440
who were hacking they they were like oh is it a one-off event or anything like

543
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,040
that this is a hacking group called dark side who've done this they are

544
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:20,240
ransomware masters they have been taken shit ton of money and then they

545
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,600
disbanded immediately following the colonial pipeline smart theoretically

546
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,400
from what people are saying is after they got paid six million the small

547
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,700
collective of the hackers disbanded and then just took all the money mm-hmm the

548
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,080
way that they normally work is almost 70% of the money goes to all of these

549
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:42,520
like subsidiary hackers who do all of the the grunt work and and then they

550
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,120
take their cut at the end not so this time so what did they they left the

551
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:58,640
grunts out to dry yep Wow yeah brutal right no honor not too surprising so

552
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,140
this story actually begins before the colonial pipeline hack whatsoever so

553
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,240
from technology review by Renee Dudley and Daniel golden on January 11th

554
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,260
antivirus company bitdefender said it was happy to announce a startling

555
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,360
breakthrough it had found a flaw in the ransomware that a gang known as dark

556
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,780
side was using to freeze computer networks of dozens of businesses in the

557
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,520
u.s. in Europe companies facing demands from dark side could download a free

558
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,060
tool from bitdefender and avoid paying millions of dollars in ransom to the

559
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:35,180
hackers that's a great thing right it's a good idea now Dan what should you do

560
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,240
when you find a flaw in a hackers programming wait who am I am I a hacker

561
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,940
you were bitdefender your job is to protect people from hackers well you

562
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,480
find a flaw you should probably try and patch it fix it up they did that they

563
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,160
patched it and they fixed it up okay now here's the problem they released it as a

564
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:04,720
public relations statement and within 12 hours dark side was like oh they found a

565
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,560
hole in our software let's find another hole find it they fixed it it was over

566
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,600
with mm-hmm so bitdefender has basically and this is happening over and over and

567
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,180
over again yeah it's constant back and forth well and here's the thing though

568
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,400
people who are good at this stuff don't tell anyone and all of these antivirus

569
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,320
scammers basically announced the moment publicly like hey we fixed this the

570
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,400
hackers can no longer get to us and then five hours later it's all right right

571
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,960
so all of these antivirus companies are trying to get the positive you know like

572
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,600
look at how great we are press of like we fix this hole actually antithetical

573
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:52,960
to their goal exactly yeah you got it they continue to go on and here's it

574
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,600
there's a bunch of really kind of interesting little details here Aaron

575
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:04,120
Tantliff a Chicago cybersecurity attorney he is he consulted with 10

576
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,480
companies attacked by dark side he said that dark sides representatives were

577
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,640
shrewd bargainers if a victim said it couldn't afford the ransom because of

578
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,600
the pandemic dark side was ready with data showing that the company's revenue

579
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,640
was up like they had all of this they were ready this was a fortune 500

580
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,560
hackers yeah yeah absolutely look I'd like to refer you to the accounting wing

581
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,920
of our hacker collective yeah and not only that but the they have this like

582
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,840
halfway we're we're only attacking corporations that we know can Robin Hood

583
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:45,680
that kind of thing yeah and yeah they even came up with like actually we do

584
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,920
know how much kovat has impacted your bottom line and we have adjusted our

585
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,760
ransom accordingly so even if you don't want to pay the ransom it's like god

586
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,680
damn it they make a lot of sense listen we're not heartless for hackers we're

587
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:07,760
not heartless yeah so what wound up happening is a dark side just blew ever

588
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,840
blew them away because bitdefender is very very stupid and they're gonna

589
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,600
continue doing it mm-hmm it's just how it goes and all of this they're talking

590
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,640
about like oh it's conspiracy are these rogue actors or anything if you look

591
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,440
into it you'll see that this is a hugely sophisticated operation right with

592
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,080
people who are incredibly successful at all of this and it's kind of an

593
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,840
inevitability of like digital progression you know like as as there is

594
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,400
more stuff that is is is online and digital mm-hmm there will be the the

595
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:51,320
highwaymen of yeah the the online space like it's it's just like it's exactly

596
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:57,440
what you would expect to grow and and get more sophisticated as people who

597
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,960
would robbed stagecoaches turned into people who robbed trains yeah and then

598
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,040
it would turn into a mafia exactly things get more sophisticated and more

599
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,800
organized mm-hmm it makes sense that the inevitability would be something like

600
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,880
this totally and instead they just say they're so boring it's so much more

601
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,600
boring they're bad conspiracy theories then what is a real conspiracy yeah I

602
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,440
feel like this is the exact same thing that we talked about with like that guy

603
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,100
in the IRA yeah you know like it's the reality of it is fascinating and it is a

604
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:37,240
really interesting piece of how like history and like human interaction works

605
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,800
yeah and instead you're turning this into a conspiracy that's actually more

606
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,400
boring than the actual total world you're trying to fit it into your large

607
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,120
conspiracy theory where it doesn't belong no just be interested just be

608
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,400
curious yeah that kind of thing it's just not hard you don't have to

609
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,400
distrust everything yeah exactly so real soon we're gonna get into space but this

610
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:08,400
one I just have to this is just silly st. Michael asks Joseph what about the

611
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,560
Apollo oh he wants to to go a secret space program I guess here or something

612
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,760
related to maybe the lunar landing hoax Joseph what about the the Apollo 12

613
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,400
ascent stage experiment crashing into the lunar surface and it rang like a

614
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,720
bell for a long period of time well I don't know that it rang see I'm

615
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:35,200
accidentally cut it off just a little bit early but he is saying he's he got a

616
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,280
question from the audience Michael st. Michael he's asking Joseph hey how is

617
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,400
this possible and as Richard is answer is asking the question he's like they

618
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,800
say it rang like a bell and he's like oh well that sounds silly it didn't yeah so

619
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,760
would you like to answer the question that I have just negated exactly and

620
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:01,720
here is the answer dong anyway with Joseph any thoughts on the Apollo 12

621
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,440
ascent stage experiment crashing into the lunar surface yeah that individual

622
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,640
is is actually citing the the language of the scientists that that reported on

623
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,040
that experiment that was their word hello I'm a scientist it rang like a

624
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:25,480
bell excuse me mr. Surratt it did ring like a goddamn Bell okay immediate

625
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,400
immediate response is just no it read like it rang like a bell that's literal

626
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:37,080
verbatim yes from this scientific literature despite being physically

627
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,960
impossible in the world we inhabit uh-huh you mean in space yes yeah yeah

628
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:50,520
in the universe we inhabit apologize so then we have introduced space and this

629
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:57,160
do what what is the conspiracy here that the moon is hollow you're about to find

630
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:02,120
out is that the is that the the thrust of it ringing like a bell because there

631
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,880
would be sound vibrations right if it was hollow but then it would also have

632
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,880
to have an opening yes so it's sort of hollow earth but the moon yeah so the

633
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,320
moon is a base okay I'm putting the pieces together okay here I'm gonna spit

634
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,320
ball okay the Nazis are inside the moon okay um you're not far off in fact

635
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:30,000
you're terrifyingly close go ahead this is basically that movie iron sky he's

636
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,880
almost all like a movie guy yeah love it yeah I think in the early 70s I don't

637
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:42,080
remember exactly when it was but Sputnik magazine the old Soviet periodical

638
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:49,040
published a set of articles by some Soviet scientists that actually had the

639
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,360
thesis that the moon was a big huge artificial spaceship because it was you

640
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,640
know it was impossible to explain the physics of how it got there doing what

641
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,600
it's doing on any of the natural models for for its existence you know the

642
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,920
capture model the fission from Earth model and so on and so forth so I you

643
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,800
know I give some credence to those stories and even to that theory because

644
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,880
you know it's it's like Isaac Newton said about the moon the moon's the only

645
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,440
thing that gives me a headache because you have a good way of explaining how it

646
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,080
got there doing what it's doing I mean the guy quoted Sputnik yeah yeah

647
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,080
Sputnik magazine from the 70s or 80s some Russian scientists speculated that

648
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:38,680
maybe the moon is a spaceship 50 years later Joseph P for L thinks that that's

649
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:46,840
probably true my friend have you heard that cheese yeah yeah it is it is that

650
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,560
that's the type of thing that we're dealing with you are absolutely right

651
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:57,520
there are Nazis up there I mean I feel like you know in the 70s it's the late

652
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,160
70s this might have been after a particular Death Star

653
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:16,960
look sort of like the moon that's not a moon Dan it's a space station they're

654
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,480
really biding their time with like doing anything with it yeah 70s and 80s you

655
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,200
don't know what it's for just yet huh um so yeah at least like the second Death

656
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,280
Star was like under construction and that made yes made sense for like why it

657
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:40,960
wasn't doing like a space station would have blown up a planet by now or done

658
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,800
something I do I do like the idea that instead of whatever in Star Wars they

659
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,780
like the it's fully operational instead they're like listen we're gonna have to

660
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,840
hang out here for about 50 60 years and then we'll get to him I swear to God

661
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:06,480
well right there don't fucking move don't leave the moon not just that but

662
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:13,160
you would need to have like MREs to like so much food but not just that you have

663
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,520
to then say that the moon has always been a space station right so for someone

664
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,920
had to have created exactly I've had to built it pre-earth because everybody is

665
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:30,920
yeah and there needs to be like some kind of like a biome inside that has

666
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,160
like something there's no light source so you can't like plants having

667
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,120
photosynthesis I don't know how you would keep animals alive that seems like

668
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:45,280
it would be prohibitive yeah on the moon or in the moon I guess you could

669
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,920
have like an elaborate fungus kind of economy that's true it could be like a

670
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,480
like a lost world scenario where you go in the moon and it turns out that

671
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,400
there's actually brush and beautiful verdant tropical island there I think

672
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:08,920
you would still need something to give for like energy to that that that flora

673
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:16,560
and fauna Atlantis and fine oh oh and also Atlantis is also magic Atlantis is

674
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,080
in play thank God so we're at the midpoint they just started talking

675
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:26,320
about space and now I'm just I love this clip I just love this hey thanks for

676
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:31,560
inviting me into your home long-haul truck RV camper taxi your parents

677
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,200
well-appointed rec room with the simulated wood paneling electric

678
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,520
fireplace and the painting of dogs playing poker your loft that greasy

679
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,720
spoon just off the interstate and your cabin in the woods hello to everyone

680
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,080
listening in on our flagship station am 749 6.7 FM

681
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:54,400
zoomer radio here in Toronto and hiya to those of you tuning I just love it it

682
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,680
just reminds me so much of Casey case of yes it's just so much Casey case if I

683
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,640
just love it let me describe a Norman Rockwell painting give a shout out to

684
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:10,480
the only station I'm on I there's something about that that just reminds

685
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,560
me of literally a long road trip in the middle of the night listening to some

686
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,920
terrible radio station and you hear that and you're like yeah that's what radios

687
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,360
about yeah you're you were saying this guy's one of the like junior varsity

688
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,760
guys on coast to coast and it it shows it smells like totally so the reason

689
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,520
that I wanted to do space is aliens are obviously in the news these days and we

690
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,800
don't get enough of it these these days on the podcast no we just don't um and

691
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,200
then this guy's obsessed with Nazis so why not put them both together now how

692
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,000
might you think that cuz I this is one question that I was interested in

693
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,880
especially is everybody normal now everybody who is not a space weirdo

694
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,480
before is now like holy shit government's saying there's aliens or

695
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,560
something going on here how is the UFO community taking this and false light

696
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:08,840
and the fact that the government stole UFO from them and changed it out of

697
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,080
nowhere just because they didn't want them to look stupid it's fake yeah right

698
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,600
so let's see okay we have this technology now and and maybe you know

699
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:28,120
that might explain these the tic-tac UFO videos even though the the Pentagon is

700
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,920
saying they're not ours they're not ours well maybe that kind of blows that out

701
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,800
of the water well the the tic-tac videos you know and all of this stuff I you

702
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,640
know you can go look up patents online for triangular shaped vehicles that use

703
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,880
some form of field propulsion what bothers me about all of this is not so

704
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,520
much that the technology apparently does exist what bothers me is the constant

705
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:04,680
rush to attribute it to ET and well I mean that's a thought yeah the guy who

706
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,200
just told us that the moon was a fucking spaceship rang like a bell that the

707
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,760
Pyramid of Giza is actually a Death Star right that the Nazis are just fucking

708
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,440
everywhere cloning people all this stuff sure he's telling you people are rushing

709
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,640
to judgment on this ET stuff yeah you don't know you can't tell that sure yeah

710
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:32,000
yeah he's being real dismissive of this and I will admit if this is one of those

711
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,520
situations too where I've looked into it and these the original UFO folks are now

712
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,680
debunking the government's videos right because it doesn't work for the stories

713
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:50,440
that they write the folklore exactly but in this situation they're doing a good

714
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:56,960
job the the government's videos can very easily be explained and it's kind of

715
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,600
disappointing whenever you look into the simplicity of their explanations and

716
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:06,200
you're like oh shit what a surprise human error and machine error that's

717
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,400
never happened in the military before yeah yeah like a lot of like headlines

718
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:17,120
and like excitement can get ahead of yourself a little bit and and that's

719
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,800
that's something that I actually think is really fascinating is that like a lot

720
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,480
of these communities are capable of decent critical thinking it's just

721
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,520
misdirected if you're attacking their bullshit yeah they will apply very

722
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,840
rigorous and solid critical thinking skills to your bullshit they can yeah

723
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:42,920
it's just not usually done exactly yes it is very much never done so that's why

724
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,720
when I hear that clip it's like okay people are really eager to attribute

725
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:53,560
this to aliens yes they are yes I agree with you I don't disagree with that

726
00:57:53,560 --> 00:58:00,240
statement coming from you exactly yeah exactly and he is he is getting he's

727
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:08,080
getting a little bit salty these days oh no about his UFO information the the

728
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,160
idea that this was a vehicle reconstructed on the basis of what they

729
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:19,640
had they had recovered from crashed and recovered UF vehicle UFO vehicles that

730
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,200
to me could be a cover story for what they're really up to in other words if

731
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,920
this might be wholly a human product I don't know but I'm increasingly

732
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,480
skeptical Richard about the ET narrative particularly from governments that have

733
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,680
been willing to lie to our faces about you know masks and vaccines and so on

734
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:47,680
and so forth so yeah yeah he thinks everybody's job bad what if it's an

735
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:54,440
actual tic-tac what if it's just with buzz marketing yeah I think it's a do

736
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,000
you think it's like that that time aqua teen hunger force put pictures up places

737
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,840
and then they got bomb threats from whatever what the tic-tac's been biting

738
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:13,400
their time sure there's a secret program yeah to give tic-tac the power to create

739
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,040
extraterrestrial vehicles I believe it I don't think that's terribly wrong but

740
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:22,080
yeah everything that you think is wrong everything that they think is wrong and

741
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:27,320
if you know something you're wrong about it and here's why oh and now he's

742
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:33,360
starting to get a little bit possessive as well are you thinking that the the

743
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:40,000
technology exists and that that these are made in the good old USA or are did

744
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,320
this technology find its way into the hands of our adversaries Russia China

745
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:50,200
well I think a lot of it I go back to what I've been writing about in my

746
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:55,400
Nazi series of books I wrote a book a few years ago that ufology loves to

747
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,040
ignore it's called Roswell and the Reich and it's about the Roswell incident I

748
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:10,280
pray that I never do anything that the UFO community loves to ignore I pray I

749
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:19,200
pray that that is not a fate that I have my career where I'm pissed off community

750
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,960
ignores my book it's very strange that the UFO community is not also willing to

751
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,360
toss the Nazis in with the Roswell circumstances some of them do though

752
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:35,040
that's true I feel like this guy is being a little bit I don't know salty

753
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,120
like you said yeah I mean like there are that is a that is a conspiracy that I've

754
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:44,120
heard before sure it's not something that's like verboten in conspiracy and

755
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,520
space communities I have read a little bit of his book though and they made a

756
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:55,840
movie called I read a little bit of that book and not iron sky the

757
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:02,480
novelization of the movie iron sky no it's it's just nobody reads my books

758
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:10,120
that's that's kind of words I relate yeah no I have professional misgivings

759
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:16,960
about more people could listen or the ufology community is no oh no no no you

760
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,760
would prefer just generally like I think anybody who creates things like we could

761
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,600
have a wider audience or I feel like that's what he's saying yeah yeah but

762
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:31,760
he's more saying they don't respect me so on and so forth exactly I I'm I just

763
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,320
love it this is this is kind of fun for me just because everything is

764
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,800
everything's obviously a false flag Nazis obviously had et Giza pyramid is a

765
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:49,320
death star all all of this stuff is true simultaneously but somehow these guys

766
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:55,080
don't take it to a mean place like even for all their COVID denialism which is

767
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,660
inherently mean and cruel it's not like they're they're not the type of person

768
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,840
that I'm used to hearing talk about this where they almost relish like the the

769
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,760
inflicting of cruelty or the expression of cruelty right like for someone like

770
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:13,160
Alex it's less about the point and it's more about getting to yell at somebody

771
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:18,800
about how they're wearing a mask yeah and I think that is kind of a feature of

772
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,760
a lot of the stuff that we see yeah yeah totally and for him you don't think it's

773
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:31,200
it's not malicious he strikes me more as almost a hoarder of Nazi bullshit like

774
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,920
instead of somebody collecting beanie babies he's collected lore and he's just

775
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:43,880
hoarded it and so I don't know how much of it is anything about how he feels or

776
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,640
thinks or even has like prescriptions or what we should do I don't think he

777
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,600
takes any of his like here's what we should do seriously right all he's

778
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,560
really interested in is hoarding all of this information mm-hmm none of it is

779
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,900
true but he's so hoarded it over the you know it's just like he did with when he

780
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:08,920
was a theologian he hoarded all of this biblical knowledge all of this history

781
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:15,660
and and tightened he wants to be the dungeon master of Nazi space exactly he

782
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,620
wants everybody to kiss the ring because he's hoarded the most knowledge yeah

783
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:24,800
that's the way that he operates and so yeah in this situation it's just just

784
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:31,720
ridiculous all right let's see oh you betcha you betcha asks Joseph how do you

785
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:36,480
compare kovat vaccine passports compared to the long-standing requirement to have

786
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,400
your kids get a vaccine to go to school or vaccines for yellow fever to travel

787
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,940
which is an interesting point so you know in other words why are we getting

788
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:50,600
all upset about and worked up about vaccine passports right mm-hmm that's a

789
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,480
good question hmm that's a really good question I got excited when I heard that

790
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,100
question because that would be a moment if that shows up on info Wars where Alex

791
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,160
is like I'm sorry we gotta let you go and hangs up real quick cuz it's a very

792
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:08,480
solid question yeah I I honestly was listening to it and I got lost because

793
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:17,720
it bored me all right yeah so I was thinking this is great because it's a

794
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,400
reasonable question so the only way out of it is you got to take a big swing

795
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,780
yeah you know I got really excited you got hit hard I got hit hard I simply

796
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:32,720
don't buy the universality of vaccines I grew up as many people in the United

797
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:38,920
States did in a state where this was not a requirement in fact the only vaccine

798
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,600
I've ever had in my life is the polio vaccine the Sabin vaccine when I was

799
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:51,440
very young I've not had any vaccine ever since that so it's not a an entirely

800
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,440
universal experience huh nope no big swing at all he just says I grew up and

801
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,040
I didn't have to get vaccines except for the polio except for the polio one now

802
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,840
why are we not talking about how the polio vaccine is also evil let's not

803
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,560
worry about it he's already had it he got it was he was a kid we're not gonna

804
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,880
deal with that sure that does beg the question are some vaccines good right

805
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:17,480
but we're not gonna deal with that sure isn't that a real I was so disappointed

806
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,080
I was so disappointed because his answer is just basically like well maybe if I

807
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,400
had grown up in that culture I would understand what you're saying but since

808
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:30,560
I didn't I don't care mm-hmm that's I wanted I wanted Nazis to be behind it

809
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:36,240
yeah yeah yeah it is a little bit of a swing and a miss yeah it's a real bummer

810
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,000
it's a real bummer yeah now they that is the interview with the conspiracy

811
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,320
theorist equivalent of stepping on a banana yeah somebody should have thrown

812
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,280
a pie in his face immediately following that yeah put a little comedy in there

813
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:58,680
come on guys so now we get to some of the things that Pharrell is writing so

814
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,600
he also has a blog and he posts stuff all the way all there and now if you

815
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,840
looked at his blog oh yeah I've read a lot of it does he have any posts about

816
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,000
how no one ever really dies um I don't think he has posts about how no one ever

817
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:20,040
really dies but any RD the group that Pharrell was oh my god sorry oh my god

818
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,520
sorry you're killing me I'm trying to do this I'm not great at running a show and

819
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:31,680
dealing with references this is what I have to put up with and you've done it

820
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:39,640
several hundred times true so yeah they talk about one of the things that Joseph

821
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:45,720
has written you posted a blog I'm not sure how long ago it wasn't too long ago

822
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:51,560
discussing some rather interesting formations that you've spotted on on

823
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:57,720
Mars first there there was some discussion about some ice formations on

824
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:02,520
the planet and that led you to look a little further and and what did you spy

825
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:07,740
where you buried the lead yeah you didn't tell me this guy maybe has a

826
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:13,840
telescope oh he does because that's enough to get him on unfortunately he

827
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,680
does not have a telescope he is talking about pictures posted from 2001 by the

828
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:25,320
Mars Odyssey spacecraft and Richard sets this up as though this is a very

829
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,400
important article and Joseph's response we're not gonna listen to because it's

830
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,920
eight minutes long and all he's really saying is nothing he's saying stuff like

831
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,240
hey it looks like it could be let me let me read you the caption so the pictures

832
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,000
that Richard is talking about hmm saying this article is very good let me read

833
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,320
you the captions on these pictures quote when I look at this with my layman's

834
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:54,800
eyes I'm not seeing much about Antarctic ice flows and a whole lot of weird stuff

835
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,080
that borders on things that look like nearly perfect circular whatchamacallits

836
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:06,200
huh good you think that's good stuff yeah okay I mean look the scientist said

837
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,240
that the moon rang like a bell true and so this seems like scientific language

838
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:17,080
that's true the doodads well it goes on quote and then there are lots of odd

839
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,520
little bumpy things often neatly arranged in rectangles triangles and so

840
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:27,720
on and then finally we have lots and lots and lots of rectilinear and

841
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:33,160
structural looking things as somebody who spends a fair amount of time reading

842
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:38,320
things in journals I'm used to things being described as bumpy little bumpy

843
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,880
little things whatchamacallits yeah okay so we're gonna have to cut your chest

844
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,040
open and we're gonna perform some surgery on your who's it and then we'll

845
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:52,640
take the what's a and put it in your whole wall and you'll be good you fell

846
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:58,360
off this high place and the problem is that really hard thing inside your arm

847
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:07,640
it's got a you got a crick in your heart thing see all I all I hear is an

848
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:15,000
unfamiliarity with scholarly writing on your part unfamiliarity with research

849
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,560
wow I mean that's that does that doesn't not sound very it doesn't sound like

850
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,400
somebody should bring it up in an interview and be like now you just wrote

851
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,120
this interesting thing I mean you have an uphill battle whenever you're

852
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:34,200
starting an interview and being like you wrote a blog yeah that alone is a tough

853
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:44,000
sell whatchamacallits whatchamacallits great now I'm assuming you're asking how

854
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,240
is it that they can pay for these whatchamacallits bumpy things and

855
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:55,960
structural looking things who they mr. mr. global annoyed as I think he likes

856
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,640
to instead of saying globalist he likes to Dennis Miller it up with mr. global

857
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,800
annoyed or whatever avoid the global annoyed yeah exactly there we go that

858
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:11,280
one I got so yeah so now we're gonna talk about how everybody pays for it we

859
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,640
were talking about Mars and a little bit about the secret space program you

860
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,680
mentioned Catherine Austin fits earlier and the missing trillion something like

861
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:27,640
21 trillion dollars missing from the US government so is it your belief that

862
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:32,680
that much of this money is being funneled into the secret space the

863
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,800
secret space program for what the construction of deep space platforms and

864
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,480
so forth I know Catherine Austin fits Oh do you a lot personally okay yeah she's

865
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:49,560
she comes up in various places yeah so she's a former HUD official in the

866
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:55,680
W administration and then when she left she created a brokerage firm and she

867
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:02,120
started business doing business with you guessed it the HUD now what was going on

868
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:07,280
is while she was doing the accounting for these contracts with the HUD and the

869
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:13,680
Pentagon and that kind of stuff stuff didn't look right it didn't look right

870
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:19,240
at all things are going wrong and so Joseph is going to tell us what it is

871
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:24,840
she found so if we go back to to let's say the day about some 2008 they pumped

872
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:34,280
an enormous amount of money into the system or did they I like that yeah well

873
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:42,120
they bailouts yeah were for like upgrades to the moon basically now his

874
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:46,680
theory I guess is that if the bailouts happened then inflation should have

875
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:56,320
skyrocketed which okay that doesn't exactly work but that's fine what he is

876
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:01,760
completely ignoring is that the 21 trillion that we're we're talking about

877
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,560
is not missing in the sense that it's like it was taken away and now it could

878
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,640
be anywhere right right it's missing in the sense that the Pentagon by design

879
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,600
does not keep track of where it spends money mm-hmm it doesn't keep track of it

880
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,800
it doesn't they you can't audit it you can't nothing happens they've tried to

881
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,400
have so many accountants go in and just give it a shot right and you can't do it

882
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,400
by design because if you know exactly how much money you're spending you

883
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,480
might get less well there's that and then also I would assume that there's

884
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,520
probably some kind of like national security reasons why you wouldn't want

885
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,960
that information being somewhere where people could possibly get a hold of it

886
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:47,120
sure sure that I would assume that maybe there's some of that right but I even

887
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:52,120
then you would have a budget and they do not right they just have money and then

888
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:56,200
they spend it so even whenever they're talking about passing a military budget

889
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,620
it does it's just it's just there mm-hmm and they spend money and if they spend

890
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,680
more than that budget the government's still gonna pay for it nobody cares

891
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:10,360
right yeah right that sort of like missing money is is the the same kind of

892
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:16,320
thing that people talk about with like there's this unfunded social security

893
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,160
and totally totally it's the same misunderstanding of like it's not

894
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,480
unfunded it's just money isn't there yet because it's future exactly it's people

895
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,800
paying into it will pay for it in the future you know like that it's the same

896
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:34,160
sort of semantical trick that people use to try and argue against any kind of

897
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:39,120
government spending exactly now although in this case maybe there's more to it

898
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,320
oh no everybody who has looked into it everybody who has looked into the

899
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:48,820
Pentagon budget has like immediately like they they open their computer they

900
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:52,820
look at one line and they raise a red flag up into the fucking sky and shoot

901
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:57,760
flares and they're like this is not good yeah this is a problem it's a it's a

902
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,420
it's a it's a misunderstanding based on like the way it's being described yes

903
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:07,320
but it's an extra this this is a problem for a different reason yes yeah you got

904
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:14,080
it now Joseph has a different theory than that so I've actually speculated

905
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:21,160
that somehow this money may actually be going off world yeah how I don't know

906
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:28,720
sure sure I'm in yeah I just love that yeah I just love that he does not go

907
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,440
this is the one time that he really doesn't go on further cool here's his

908
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:37,240
response well um I think it's probably off world and I don't know how it got

909
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:45,000
there now I should say I got no idea right I'm not even gonna give you a gas

910
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,360
no but I will say that I'm just speculating yeah I don't know it's

911
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,240
probably off world I might be in that empty moon up there I would love to be

912
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,220
the guy doing this interview because my response would be like oh you're

913
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:07,520
speculating oh oh are you interesting I'm speculating that that money stayed

914
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:17,240
on world now what we have reached an impasse we must agree to disagree yeah I

915
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:23,920
mean it's just it's just that so often so what he always is money in space

916
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:30,240
moon rocks no no no it doesn't mean anything oh yeah yeah no intergalactic

917
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:34,240
treaties recognize money all right yeah yeah otherwise how could we do business

918
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:39,480
with the ET if they don't recognize our currency I would suggest we don't please

919
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:48,680
go on yeah and so that's exactly what Joseph does a with everything speculate

920
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:54,000
yes the only difference between that clip and what he normally does is the

921
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,440
tricks he uses of being like I'm gonna flood you with names I'm gonna flood you

922
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,140
with information because he's an incredibly knowledgeable guy he's

923
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:06,360
hoarded all of this information right so he hits you with so much references all

924
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:11,840
the time that people skip over the fact that most of his responses to questions

925
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,680
are essentially I'm speculating here yeah I don't know anything I might be

926
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:23,560
making this up yeah totally and it's it it's just mind-boggling how popular this

927
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:28,400
guy really is it's nuts hmm cuz he's boring and he doesn't have anything to

928
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,640
say it doesn't seem like it and then this is the I believe this is the last

929
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:39,520
clip because I just couldn't do this after this do one of your blogs recent

930
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:46,800
blogs on Giza death star calm and this it's entitled precognition and as you

931
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,600
point out it's a it's a wild article that I guess someone shared with you and

932
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,720
it has to do with these scientists who have discovered that the heart and brain

933
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:03,880
can respond to future events obviously before they happen tell me more well I

934
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,400
find that very interesting because it it seems to present a physiological case

935
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:14,360
that that the structure of the brain and the heart and they're very very similar

936
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:21,800
somehow represent or mirror the the fabric of the universe and the reason I

937
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:27,560
find that very interesting is you can go online and look at pictures of galactic

938
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:32,400
clusters and what they think are the plasma strands that connect them and

939
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,640
then compare those pictures to actual neural mapping of neurons in the brain

940
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,400
and they're remarkably similar yes you ever see a fractal man yeah that's

941
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:48,960
that's what I was I was listening to that just going supposedly I'm supposed

942
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,880
to take you as an authority on Eve and this and you're telling me your response

943
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,920
to precognition possibility is to say look at the pictures of the stars and

944
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:06,840
people very similar yeah maybe we're little little bugs inside a brain like

945
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,920
the universe universe is a big brain yeah and that's just another person or

946
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:16,360
something fine man but come on come on you're supposed to be the expert in this

947
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:21,120
shit and you cannot come at me with you know they look alike sure it's so

948
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,360
disappointing to me and I just can't handle it I couldn't handle it past that

949
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,880
point I was like I've heard too many times you just go oh it looks like a

950
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,240
whatchamacallit and then be done with your with your evidence when I tilt my

951
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,860
head up I see the whatchamacallit and it looks like the doodad and so

952
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:42,700
precognition is probably true or not or whatever yeah it doesn't mean anything

953
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,740
no and he just keeps getting listened to as though he's an authority wearing his

954
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:51,800
dumb Indiana Jones hat smoking his Cruella de Vil cigarette and he's not

955
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,520
even smoking and so on and so forth I feel like you shouldn't be mad at the

956
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,680
hat and the affectations those are kind of charming do you think that's why he

957
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:07,520
keeps getting invited probably yeah I might talk to him I might be tricked

958
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:13,580
yeah no he's uh he's not interesting enough to trick you I don't think you'll

959
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:17,680
need to worry too much about that oh so yeah talking that he has not been on

960
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:24,920
project Camelot hey don't think he had well he was interviewed by not carry Oh

961
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:32,440
by Bill Ryan yes okay I remember seeing that okay and so I was going to talk

962
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:37,320
about bill is less fun he's much less fun yeah yeah yeah that was not good

963
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:41,520
it was done in a weird hotel room that looked like a motel six yeah those

964
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:48,960
they're early aesthetic yeah yeah so that is Joseph P Pharrell the possible

965
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,880
doctor definite shitbag and mediocre writer

966
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:58,520
Nazis did not factor into this as much as I expected no the problem with the

967
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:05,280
Nazis is that that is his like I guess mid period work uh-huh you know like now

968
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:13,500
he's more into banks are killing everybody okay um and I it was about 10

969
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:18,840
15 years ago that he was all into Nazis all talking Nazis all the time before

970
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:24,680
the era of podcasts exactly yeah a lot of available audio sorry there were

971
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,040
there were there wasn't more Nazi talk but it was teased but you know what

972
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,000
we're never we never need more Nazi I mean he grew up next to Nazis so we

973
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,080
could probably ask them sure yeah I bet they've got a lot of Nazi content yeah

974
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,340
well this is interesting Jordan yeah I thought it was fairly interesting I

975
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:45,560
