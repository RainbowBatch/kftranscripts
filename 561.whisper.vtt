I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
Knowledgefight.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.120

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
Thanks for holding.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
Hello, Alex.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.120
I'm a first-time caller.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
I'm a huge fan.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.120

00:55.120 --> 00:56.120
I love you.

00:56.120 --> 01:00.680
Hey, everybody.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.600
Welcome back to Fight Knowledge.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.600
I am Jordan.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.960
I'm Dan.

01:05.960 --> 01:13.520
This is the podcast where Celine worships at the altar of Dan Friesen, and we talk about

01:13.520 --> 01:15.560
anybody but Alex Jones.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.120
Me and Celine have a collaborative worship relationship.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.440
It's a real mutual worship kind of thing.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.440
Very symbiotic.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.440
If you will.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.920
Jordan, I have a question for you.

01:27.920 --> 01:28.920
What's that, Dan?

01:28.920 --> 01:32.120
What is your bright spot for today?

01:32.120 --> 01:36.440
My bright spot for today is... I'm not trying to plug.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.440
I have no interest in plugging.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.440
Oh, shit.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.000
This sounds like it's a lead-in to a plug.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.800
We did an episode of the other show that we do, the D&D show.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
The Dungeons and Dragons.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
Yes.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
God's damn wizard.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
God's damn wizard.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.800
You are the dungeon master.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.800
Yeah.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.800
And last night-

01:52.800 --> 01:54.360
Slightly competent dungeon master.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.480
Oh, boy.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.840
Flailing about dungeon master.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.880
But last night we recorded, and it had been a couple of weeks since we recorded, and it

02:02.880 --> 02:03.880
was so fucking great.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.880
It was a lot of fun.

02:04.880 --> 02:10.600
To hang out with all of the... with Marty and Liz and Sarah and you.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.480
It's just so much fun to hang out.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.480
Yeah, it is.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.480
It is.

02:14.480 --> 02:20.200
It's a fun social thing that we don't get enough of these days, and we could have been

02:20.200 --> 02:23.200
doing stuff like it this whole time.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
The whole time?

02:24.200 --> 02:25.200
Yeah.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
It turns out it was always there.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
Yeah.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
Yeah.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.000
And I admire your effort that you've put into that.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.120
You know, we shit on you a bit, but it wouldn't work if you didn't have a story-

02:37.120 --> 02:38.120
No, that's true.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.120
For it.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.120
That is true.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.120
No, and it's just so much fun.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.200
If you like it, you like it.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
That's great.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.960
But I like it, so everybody else can go to hell.

02:45.960 --> 02:46.960
That kind of thing.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.140
Well, your bright spot actually kind of weaves into mine a little bit, and that is that we

02:51.140 --> 03:00.580
did do that Dungeons & Dragons-ish role-playing thing, and it got away from me a little bit.

03:00.580 --> 03:07.560
I had a few drinks, and I watched the White Rapper show on VH1.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.740
For a long time, it was not available anywhere.

03:09.740 --> 03:15.760
I couldn't find the actual episodes, and I started watching some of it on YouTube.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.720
It's now available on YouTube.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.280
Thank God for internet archivists who are just like, yeah, I guess it was a show in

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
2003.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.080
We're going to find it, and we're going to put it up.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.920
It's going to be out there.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.640
It doesn't matter what it is.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.680
I watched the finale, and John Brown is great.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.680
That's my bright spot.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.680
John Brown.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.680
John Brown.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.680
King of the burbs.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.200
King of the burbs, and king of murdering slave owners.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.360
The two greats of John Browning.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.400
You know what I say about murdering slave owners?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Hooray!

03:47.400 --> 03:48.400
Hallelujah, holla back.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.080
Yeah, there we go.

03:51.080 --> 03:59.960
Well, Dan, for today's episode, episode number six of Jordan Takes the... Well, 5.1 since

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
we lost five.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
Yeah.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
I think we have to call this five.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.000
We'll call this five.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.120
But I am engineering this to make sure that audio doesn't disappear.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.000
Yes, I did notice that.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.520
So today we are going to be talking about Nazis and aliens, Dan.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.520
Oh, thank God.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.520
That's what I'm all about.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.800
Oh my God.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.160
I will say this.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.160
I went through-

04:23.160 --> 04:28.040
You told me that you had found something that was really exciting and really interesting.

04:28.040 --> 04:32.800
I didn't know what to expect, and you telling me that it's Nazis and aliens, that is as

04:32.800 --> 04:35.840
good as it could have been as a reveal.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.600
It's about as good as it can get, then.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.680
Thank you, Jordan.

04:39.680 --> 04:47.500
So we will be talking about one, maybe or maybe not, Dr. Joseph Ferrell.

04:47.500 --> 04:51.720
But I think before we do that, we're going to need to say thank you to some people who

04:51.720 --> 04:52.720
have-

04:52.720 --> 04:54.220
Yes, I think we would agree to do that.

04:54.220 --> 04:58.720
So first, let's say what's up to Peaches are Nasty, Plums are Supreme.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.960

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960

05:02.960 --> 05:04.560

05:04.560 --> 05:05.560
Plums are underrated.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.560
Yeah, wrong.

06:40.800 --> 06:47.120
you to my ghost home I knew it's too good to be true Dan Friesen has been

06:47.120 --> 06:56.000
dead for 17 years no I you know it seemed like just a random vacation it's

06:56.000 --> 07:00.920
like it's overdue let's take some time and have have some fun sure the reality

07:00.920 --> 07:13.680
is that I'm celebrating a couple of walks birthdays okay so I wish I had

07:13.680 --> 07:18.920
birthday to just another Dan okay great name great name I feel like every Dan

07:18.920 --> 07:22.600
should not feel like they're just another day this is another Dan I think

07:22.600 --> 07:31.680
every Dan is special except for Dan Hastert no Dennis Hastert I somehow

07:31.680 --> 07:36.480
mixed up Dan Snyder and Dennis Hastert in my head okay and they're both

07:36.480 --> 07:43.000
monsters so that sure sure and then also Newt I got a fantastic lovely email from

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Newt and I'd like to wish Newt a happy birthday although you could go with a

07:47.000 --> 07:51.520
Gingrich on this one but you shouldn't no actually that's my grandfather's name

07:51.520 --> 07:55.920
is that right it is his name I didn't know that oh yeah yeah it's a strange

07:55.920 --> 08:01.040
name it is well he's his birth name I believe is not I believe his birth name

08:01.040 --> 08:06.080
is noble okay and somehow they just started calling him I guess at a certain

08:06.080 --> 08:12.440
point in time Newt was short for noble and so that's how he goes Wow yeah how

08:12.440 --> 08:16.120
about that I don't dislike it as a name and also while we're in Hawaii I will be

08:16.120 --> 08:21.920
chasing down a ton of lizards and newts and for shows oh you got so iguana I

08:21.920 --> 08:26.000
might come back with a bunch of iguanas oh yeah we're gonna get a new thing of

08:26.000 --> 08:28.720
luggage we're gonna poke some holes in it and you're just gonna have a bag of

08:28.720 --> 08:32.920
lizards that you're wandering around with I think that that was one of the

08:32.920 --> 08:39.960
most important parts of my childhood in Hawaii was fine it was so we will

08:39.960 --> 08:44.360
reclaim a little bit of that anyway fun than the plains of central Midwest I

08:44.360 --> 08:50.640
will say that so Jordan I hear I hear that we have a conversation about Nazis

08:50.640 --> 08:56.000
and aliens indeed we do today we will be talking about an interview that Joseph

08:56.000 --> 09:02.440
Farrell gave with Richard Surrett who does the conspiracy show with Richard

09:02.440 --> 09:07.640
Surrett he is also a regular guest host on coast to coast okay so so he's he's

09:07.640 --> 09:12.240
that kind of one of the junior varsity guys yeah yeah I don't keep track of

09:12.240 --> 09:18.120
those guys unfortunately no and we're yeah there he's he's pretty I don't know

09:18.120 --> 09:26.880
we'll see how how much you like him but Joseph Farrell is called a doctor a has

09:26.880 --> 09:34.920
from what his bio says a doctorate of patristics from Oxford University okay

09:34.920 --> 09:40.760
which is basically a theology kind of thing if you go by what many people who

09:40.760 --> 09:46.320
of interviewing have given him credits for he has a doctorate of physics if you

09:46.320 --> 09:52.880
go by other people he has a doctorate of what was it not patristics either

09:52.880 --> 09:59.360
philosophy none of which I think he has uh-huh I kind of don't think that he

09:59.360 --> 10:05.440
went to Oxford mainly because he has one story about his time at Oxford and I can

10:05.440 --> 10:10.520
find no evidence that this Joseph Farrell went to Oxford however there's

10:10.520 --> 10:14.840
another Joseph Farrell with a doctorate of economics from Oxford okay that's

10:14.840 --> 10:20.640
possible and his story from Oxford his years there is he was at a debate at the

10:20.640 --> 10:25.440
Oxford Union Society that lasted for eight days oh my god and it was

10:25.440 --> 10:31.600
sponsored by Heineken for the Ethiopia food relief right right around live aid

10:31.600 --> 10:37.600
all of that stuff and endurance debate yes and here's the thing here's the

10:37.600 --> 10:44.000
thing if this is true then Boris fucking Johnson was there whoa because they were

10:44.000 --> 10:49.320
but Boris was running the Union debate society uh-huh and so we should know

10:49.320 --> 10:54.400
about this were they on opposite sides of the issue or they don't know allegedly

10:54.400 --> 10:58.480
no no what I'm saying is he doesn't mention Boris Johnson at all it seems

10:58.480 --> 11:02.040
like it would be a headline seems like you would know if you were at a eight

11:02.040 --> 11:06.520
day debate with the future fucking Prime Minister of the United Kingdom yeah

11:06.520 --> 11:12.720
the debate went so long that I had to break pencils and make a little fire in

11:12.720 --> 11:20.360
order to keep warm yeah like Wade Boggs exactly yes absolutely he also according

11:20.360 --> 11:27.280
to himself grew up in South Dakota and one fun story he tells is that when he

11:27.280 --> 11:31.640
was growing up he was around six or seven years old and his best friends

11:31.640 --> 11:38.560
there were more than one of them who had fathers who fought for the Germans in

11:38.560 --> 11:48.240
World War two so great bread yeah so he grew up around Nazis yeah now here is

11:48.240 --> 11:53.240
the kind of thing you generally want to keep a close to the vest I don't want to

11:53.240 --> 11:56.960
tell people cuz he and he tosses it off like hey they fought for the Germans

11:56.960 --> 12:00.760
yeah it's weird enough that like you know we we do a show where Alex talks

12:00.760 --> 12:05.080
about like being Confederate Royal yeah exactly that's weird enough but I would

12:05.080 --> 12:10.120
I would think that like I know people and I hung out who's who were not we're

12:10.120 --> 12:17.000
not they were just Nazis yeah no big deal um but he is however a scholar I

12:17.000 --> 12:22.120
think the fact that he grew up around Nazis will explain a lot of his later on

12:22.120 --> 12:27.000
his later life however he is definitely a scholar he's got at least a master's

12:27.000 --> 12:32.680
degree that I can confirm and he has written a total of maybe 40 45 books

12:32.680 --> 12:36.960
that's too many books way too many here's the strangest part though okay

12:36.960 --> 12:43.720
his first books are all about religion he translated the mystagogy of the Holy

12:43.720 --> 12:49.360
Spirit by patriarch Phodios from the Greek and apparently it's a really good

12:49.360 --> 12:55.080
translation and he he's cited writing the foreword in in Christian circles of

12:55.080 --> 13:01.840
the well holy cow this is foreign to our show totally totally he wrote free will

13:01.840 --> 13:07.040
in st. Maximus the confessor which is him trying to deal with Calvinism he

13:07.040 --> 13:12.920
does not do well and then the disputation of Pyrrhus as well as what

13:12.920 --> 13:20.000
was the other one do God history and dialectic which is his final religious

13:20.000 --> 13:29.240
book now that was published in 1997 in 2002 he published his next book which

13:29.240 --> 13:34.720
would begin the future of his career hmm would you like to guess what the title

13:34.720 --> 13:39.080
of that book might be well I mean you've already sort of tilted some of these

13:39.080 --> 13:47.080
cards indeed and I think there's aliens involved probably so I would I would say

13:47.080 --> 13:53.320
that likely it has something to do with space Raptors being involved with the

13:53.320 --> 13:59.120
Holocaust he's a Death Star okay that's right if you thought that the pyramids

13:59.120 --> 14:05.900
were just tombs you're an idiot totally that pyramid is a Death Star exactly

14:05.900 --> 14:11.000
like well the one from Star Wars I would like to bring up that they were for

14:11.000 --> 14:18.680
storing grain during the presidential debates from there he went on an

14:18.680 --> 14:24.720
absolute terror that continues to this day he keeps cranking out books some of

14:24.720 --> 14:30.800
which the titles can be like this grid of the gods the aftermath of the cosmic

14:30.800 --> 14:36.920
war and the physics of the pyramid peoples who not a bad title uh Reich of

14:36.920 --> 14:43.000
the Black Sun Nazi secret weapons and the Cold War Allied legend oh boy yeah

14:43.000 --> 14:48.720
let's see financial vipers in Venice alchemical money magical physics and

14:48.720 --> 14:54.200
banking in the Middle Ages and Renaissance of all of his titles there's

14:54.200 --> 14:58.800
four of them in his early life that are like I am a good Christian I read

14:58.800 --> 15:03.480
theology I'm focused on this and he's a good historian and then he something

15:03.480 --> 15:09.680
happens and he's just off the map yeah like completely off the map and winds

15:09.680 --> 15:18.680
up on the SPLC's hate watch list because he is oh why well you know

15:18.680 --> 15:22.440
that's something that I have been struggling with because I think if

15:22.440 --> 15:30.680
you'll listen to him as we go along he's not a Nazi what I think he is is a Nazi

15:30.680 --> 15:39.880
fanboy that's that can be as bad it is it is weird it is really weird yeah it's

15:39.880 --> 15:44.160
a strange and it's it's not a big distinction it's a strange one in that I

15:44.160 --> 15:49.880
don't think he wants the Nazis to win mm-hmm but I do think he's amazed at how

15:49.880 --> 15:57.280
good the Nazis were at finding alien technology hmm which is a very strange

15:57.280 --> 16:03.920
a subset of anti-semitism sure but it's there it's definitely I'm interested to

16:03.920 --> 16:09.040
see how you lay out this argument well I mean so so he's he's another of the he

16:09.040 --> 16:14.240
talks about globalists makes the makes a bunch of puns about them he's he

16:14.240 --> 16:20.080
fancies himself a bit of a Dennis Miller type sure but yeah I don't know we'll

16:20.080 --> 16:25.320
see we'll see how that goes um then there are another thing there are

16:25.320 --> 16:29.720
another few things that are incredibly annoying about him for instance he

16:29.720 --> 16:37.440
always wears a hat and it is always it is either a Indiana Jones hat or a

16:37.440 --> 16:44.160
classic English bowler this guy's from South Dakota yeah I went to Oxford yeah

16:44.160 --> 16:49.360
I think he might be playing that a little bit well I wore I wore a bowler

16:49.360 --> 16:55.120
for a little while in high school tell people you went to Oxford I had no I

16:55.120 --> 17:02.520
but it was a desperate affectation yeah yeah and here's one that's even worse he

17:02.520 --> 17:08.320
chain smokes chain smokes with a Cruella Deville cigarette holder oh my god I

17:08.320 --> 17:14.060
love this and he does not inhale he chain smokes and he just puffs the smoke

17:14.060 --> 17:20.160
out the whole time so it's it's so infuriating to watch this man I'm just

17:20.160 --> 17:26.280
screaming at him like I quit smoking stop doing this there's a part of me

17:26.280 --> 17:30.520
that kind of enjoys that because it's so intentional yeah it's it's not so

17:30.520 --> 17:38.000
obvious yeah like no it couldn't be more pathetic or or his life is art and this

17:38.000 --> 17:45.840
is a piece of the there's also there's a well we'll see if he was parodying the

17:45.840 --> 17:53.920
type of it's oh if he is doing like a Kaufman thing so say that what happened

17:53.920 --> 17:59.720
after his religious books ended is he was like oh shit actually religion

17:59.720 --> 18:06.120
might be stupid I'm going to create this character and pull off a decades-long

18:06.120 --> 18:11.760
scam to show people just how easy and how similar religion and Giza Death Star

18:11.760 --> 18:18.440
really are what what if he just saw Andy Kaufman do his wrestling totally sort of

18:18.440 --> 18:23.200
stretch it was like totally I could do this but with religion it's not hard he

18:23.200 --> 18:29.520
he was he was on his translating game yeah and he came across a text he didn't

18:29.520 --> 18:37.360
tell anybody about it translated it up right and he's like oh no oh no I must

18:37.360 --> 18:42.600
satirize I got it somebody's got to do it yeah if nobody else is stepping up to

18:42.600 --> 18:47.700
the plate it's got to be me mm-hmm yeah he's he's a he's a real like professor

18:47.700 --> 18:53.680
type but the kind who kind of creepily talks to his students and chain smokes

18:53.680 --> 19:00.280
with a thing but doesn't inhale he says so on and so forth almost at the end of

19:00.280 --> 19:05.200
everything he says it is the most he's just an annoying guy he's just such an

19:05.200 --> 19:09.640
annoying guy you know what though I mean I say be that as it may and totally

19:09.640 --> 19:16.000
interesting like I you can't fault somebody necessarily for their tics those

19:16.000 --> 19:21.120
that you know cliches and now no problem but after every sentence people people

19:21.120 --> 19:24.920
just have ways of speaking and so on and so forth that's fair that's fair and so

19:24.920 --> 19:32.000
forth so on we go I what is going to happen I've listened to probably like

19:32.000 --> 19:38.480
15 hours of this guy talk and none of it was it all remotely usable yeah little

19:38.480 --> 19:43.360
behind the scenes yeah George you you were telling me how interesting this

19:43.360 --> 19:46.720
person is and how much you wanted to talk about him but he's so boring yes

19:46.720 --> 19:53.480
you'd watched hours and hours of stuff there's nothing here and then and then

19:53.480 --> 19:59.800
last night he goes on Richard Surrett show surprisingly enough and there is a

19:59.800 --> 20:07.200
lot of interesting stuff there also in this particular interview Joseph Pharrell

20:07.200 --> 20:13.080
is looking into the webcam on his computer and he is holding an old-time

20:13.080 --> 20:19.920
phone up to his ear like a big old-timey phone like the the peach ones that you

20:19.920 --> 20:24.040
could really slam with a wire cord the ones that had like that you had to put

20:24.040 --> 20:28.760
your finger in and and go around the rotary the whole thing yeah it was it is

20:28.760 --> 20:33.960
it is so ridiculous to watch a man in a webcam holding a phone up to his ear I

20:33.960 --> 20:39.000
like that I kind of do but old man house phone would have been like that's tacky

20:39.000 --> 20:44.960
you should have just done audio that's actually got some Intel on this he has a

20:44.960 --> 20:50.280
hamburger phone it's a house phone but it's a hamburger okay so he threw away

20:50.280 --> 20:57.080
his old Bart Simpson phone yes it upgrade oh yeah so we are going to

20:57.080 --> 21:02.800
begin this interview and you are going to hear Richard Surrett give you some

21:02.800 --> 21:09.120
whiplash if we get they're doing they're gonna open up they say in phases so the

21:09.120 --> 21:14.080
first phase if 60% of the population is vaccinated will give you a little bit of

21:14.080 --> 21:20.120
your normal back if then in phase two if 70% you'll get a little sliver of your

21:20.120 --> 21:25.600
normal life back and then finally phase three we need 80% of you vaccinated I

21:25.600 --> 21:30.920
mean I don't want to argue the efficacy or the safety of vaccines and people

21:30.920 --> 21:33.520
want to have the vaccine that's certainly their business and those that

21:33.520 --> 21:39.280
don't that's their business but this this level of coercion you know have we

21:39.280 --> 21:44.440
forgotten about the Nuremberg Code I mean how can how can people have such

21:44.440 --> 21:51.880
short memories that's I mean that's that's very yeah what's fun about that I

21:51.880 --> 21:57.160
find it so interesting that he is reasonable all the way like you know

21:57.160 --> 22:01.080
what if you want to get the vaccine I'm not gonna be a huge answer it's killing

22:01.080 --> 22:04.520
you and if you don't want to get the vaccine I'm not gonna be like I'll kill

22:04.520 --> 22:08.520
you if you don't well I think that but the Nuremberg Code you know like that

22:08.520 --> 22:12.320
kind of reasonableness is kind of a facade though like I don't want to argue

22:12.320 --> 22:19.200
the time for it right yeah that's not somebody being like I'm on board yeah

22:19.200 --> 22:23.920
that's just like I don't want to I don't want to deal yeah um but like the

22:23.920 --> 22:31.280
Nuremberg Code kind of argument is is very present in Infowars world yeah like

22:31.280 --> 22:36.880
Francis Boyle brings that up a lot yeah it's annoying it is it's just them

22:36.880 --> 22:42.280
saying hey this is how science and math works if we have this level of

22:42.280 --> 22:46.240
protection then you can do this number of things yeah it's not hard the

22:46.240 --> 22:50.320
argument that I would make back to this I think would be like all right let's

22:50.320 --> 22:55.920
imagine a scenario where this isn't all fake or whatever this is an actual

22:55.920 --> 23:01.640
pandemic how does what's going on now look different than what would be the

23:01.640 --> 23:08.680
best thing to do what what is the like do you do you do you accept this

23:08.680 --> 23:15.400
vaccination Quotia quota or quotient is appropriate in the case of a real

23:15.400 --> 23:23.000
outbreak yeah if so then yeah what that that's that's what I would I would like

23:23.000 --> 23:30.200
to do could you plan a better way yeah right so we open the interview and of

23:30.200 --> 23:34.740
course we're gonna talk about you know kovat denialism and the like well we

23:34.740 --> 23:39.460
brought up Nuremberg and that has a new Nazis so I assume you got it so Joseph

23:39.460 --> 23:49.320
p4l has some things he would like to say is he happy sorry Pharrell joke if these

23:49.320 --> 23:57.080
vaccines were so safe why why are they resorting to such draconian measures to

23:57.080 --> 24:06.040
push people into receiving them they're not exactly and the answer to that even

24:06.040 --> 24:10.240
if they were is because of assholes like you who are telling everybody not to get

24:10.240 --> 24:14.600
them I feel like they're being like people are being pretty aware that like

24:14.600 --> 24:20.480
it's important but like you know I I don't know I don't think I've ever seen

24:20.480 --> 24:25.520
anything that would indicate to me like coercion of vaccination I think that

24:25.520 --> 24:30.720
most of the people who I am in social circles with have been chomping at the

24:30.720 --> 24:37.120
bit yeah yeah and and have hunted down no we almost drove five hours to get you

24:37.120 --> 24:43.120
a vaccine yeah and and now you know the CDC had that that recommendation that

24:43.120 --> 24:48.720
people can stop wearing masks in public that that if they've been vaccinated and

24:48.720 --> 24:54.640
that is just a measure of trust yeah you know like if you like that's not like

24:54.640 --> 24:59.920
everyone must wear a special shirt that they only get from vaccination centers

24:59.920 --> 25:04.960
and then they cannot wear masks right or whatever like there's no coercion no

25:04.960 --> 25:11.760
what draconian policies are you talking about recommendation exactly like what

25:11.760 --> 25:17.000
is going on here yeah I honestly think that it could be more dry would almost

25:17.000 --> 25:22.600
agree yes you're totally right you're totally right and it's just that it's

25:22.600 --> 25:27.200
just it's always a trap it doesn't matter it doesn't matter especially with

25:27.200 --> 25:34.080
this guy anything that you say confidently you are either right about

25:34.080 --> 25:38.760
but here's what you're missing or you are completely wrong about and I have a

25:38.760 --> 25:44.680
completely different idea so here is let's go ahead and play this is a long

25:44.680 --> 25:48.600
clip because I want everybody to get an idea of what this dude talks like and

25:48.600 --> 25:55.680
how he talks so just see if he answers this question Richard is going to ask

25:55.680 --> 26:01.440
him how much of this is preparing us for a world without jobs here is how that

26:01.440 --> 26:07.160
goes well I think a lot of it is at least in their thinking but I'll tell

26:07.160 --> 26:11.680
you something Richard there's something very peculiar going on in in railroads

26:11.680 --> 26:17.120
and and people that know me know where I'm gonna go with this because my dad

26:17.120 --> 26:20.920
was a railroad engineer not you know not the locomotive kind but the engineer

26:20.920 --> 26:26.800
that inspects the tracks and so on and so forth when I was very very young and

26:26.800 --> 26:33.400
he got me fascinated with with steam locomotives and if you have been

26:33.400 --> 26:38.960
following what's been happening with railroads in this country the Union

26:38.960 --> 26:43.960
Pacific Railroad has been restoring the steam locomotives at a breathtaking rate

26:43.960 --> 26:49.520
they just finished restoration of an articulated big-boy steam locomotive

26:49.520 --> 26:56.320
4884 to you know haul freight and so on and so forth now the interesting thing

26:56.320 --> 26:59.920
is Union Pacific isn't investing all this money to basically create a

26:59.920 --> 27:04.960
locomotive works in Cheyenne Wyoming to to enhance railroad heritage days

27:04.960 --> 27:10.840
there's something else going on and my suspicion is that with the increasing

27:10.840 --> 27:16.200
reliance of global technology on digital systems they've suddenly realized that

27:16.200 --> 27:21.000
they've exposed themselves and there's their precious systems to a little thing

27:21.000 --> 27:26.040
called electromagnetic pulse or for that matter hacking cyber hacking and so on

27:26.040 --> 27:31.680
and so forth we just saw the colonial pipeline takedown so I think mr.

27:31.680 --> 27:37.300
global Oni is also kind of hoist by his own petard they're trying to put in

27:37.300 --> 27:41.600
digital systems and particularly digital currencies so what you're seeing has

27:41.600 --> 27:45.240
pushback at least here in the States I can't speak for up there for the

27:45.240 --> 27:50.080
Canadian provinces but in in several states in this country we've seen some

27:50.080 --> 27:54.280
pushback of a very unusual nature against this idea of digital currency

27:54.280 --> 28:00.940
South Carolina passed a measure recently to acknowledge as legal tender for all

28:00.940 --> 28:10.720
transactions interestingly enough that the coin had to be denominated in

28:10.720 --> 28:15.600
dollars Texas opened its own state bullion depository and so on and so

28:15.600 --> 28:21.480
forth so you're seeing some very unusual pushback that tells me that somebody at

28:21.480 --> 28:26.680
least in some of these states knows what the game is and they're acting

28:26.680 --> 28:32.680
accordingly to to secure some sort of basis for a currency should they try to

28:32.680 --> 28:37.680
roll out a digital system with their helicopter money and the missing jobs

28:37.680 --> 28:45.360
and a universal basic income and so on and so forth look did he answer the

28:45.360 --> 28:52.080
question yeah no I forgot what the question was right I was I was going

28:52.080 --> 28:59.200
along with what he was saying about railroads railroads rare earths I think

28:59.200 --> 29:05.580
he was speculating that steam engine locomotives could get hacked and I don't

29:05.580 --> 29:09.280
know what was going on with that and that was interesting I was I was

29:09.280 --> 29:15.200
thrilled to find out about steam hacking and then it pivoted to digital currency

29:15.200 --> 29:20.600
yeah I don't know what's going on anymore so the question was how much of

29:20.600 --> 29:26.220
this whole lockdown is preparing us for a world without jobs his answer was all

29:26.220 --> 29:31.080
the railroads well I think yeah a lot of it is at least the way that they say it

29:31.080 --> 29:37.320
and then he goes on for two full minutes about something completely unrelated

29:37.320 --> 29:41.360
actually but I'm not something who is the multiple things that are completely

29:41.360 --> 29:45.080
unrelated I resent this because I'm not interested in the cryptocurrency

29:45.080 --> 29:48.960
nonsense but I am interested in the locomotives would you like to know

29:48.960 --> 29:53.200
about the locomotive yes I would all righty I definitely would like to hear

29:53.200 --> 29:59.120
him talk more about hacking trains well here it well his his thoughts and and he

29:59.120 --> 30:03.160
said that anybody who knows me knows this oh yeah so it's like maybe it's a

30:03.160 --> 30:08.080
big thing this is a big thing of his this is a huge thing of his you know

30:08.080 --> 30:12.920
what you know it's very hackable cool ah you're you've got it backwards he's

30:12.920 --> 30:18.400
saying that Union Pacific is restoring old steam engine trains because they

30:18.400 --> 30:23.040
know that eventually all the electromagnetic trains are going to be

30:23.040 --> 30:29.080
disabled by an EMP oh yeah that actually makes more sense like as a coherent

30:29.080 --> 30:32.760
thought than I thought it yeah yeah yeah well I mean kind of because I thought

30:32.760 --> 30:36.960
he was speculating that like steam would be hacked right it makes sense that it's

30:36.960 --> 30:41.040
like all these trains are digital then we have to have these as a backup

30:41.040 --> 30:47.720
raise these steam yeah it's steampunk yeah yeah and then of course futuristic

30:47.720 --> 30:51.960
giant mechanical robot spiders if we could get some flying steam engines

30:51.960 --> 30:57.660
Allah back to the future 3 I'm gonna be stoked yeah so would you like to know

30:57.660 --> 31:02.040
what's going on with Union Pacific rebuilding those trains this is from

31:02.040 --> 31:06.480
Justin Franz of Atlas Obscura I'll just go ahead and read you the headline real

31:06.480 --> 31:10.100
quick one of the world's largest steam locomotives is about to make a

31:10.100 --> 31:14.560
triumphant return hold on to your engineer caps railroad history lovers

31:14.560 --> 31:20.800
choo-choo does that sound like a nefarious so it's very very simple six

31:20.800 --> 31:25.120
days after six decades after the last big boy was taken off the rails the

31:25.120 --> 31:28.800
Union Pacific is rebuilding one of the famous locomotives in honor of the

31:28.800 --> 31:33.880
upcoming sesquicentennial celebration of the first transcontinental railroad

31:33.880 --> 31:38.840
yeah it's kind of like a tourist attraction yeah or something yeah

31:38.840 --> 31:44.440
absolutely it's a celebration as far as the digital currencies go what he's

31:44.440 --> 31:49.960
talking about is states having repositories for gold bullion and you

31:49.960 --> 31:54.120
know like certain states saying you have to take gold if somebody gives it to

31:54.120 --> 31:59.480
right right and I don't know why he's a bothering about that because you'll

31:59.480 --> 32:05.760
notice what states specifically he's referencing they are states that one are

32:05.760 --> 32:10.560
filled with people who say would rather have the state have a gold bullion

32:10.560 --> 32:16.400
depository then sending a large amount of money to Ted Anderson hmm that would

32:16.400 --> 32:21.160
be that would be smart sure and then of course with South Carolina and the like

32:21.160 --> 32:26.800
they're filled with people who are like the money the dollar is gonna explode so

32:26.800 --> 32:31.360
they might they pass all these laws all the time it's just random-ass nonsense I

32:31.360 --> 32:36.440
would really love for you to sit me down uh-huh with a map of the United States

32:36.440 --> 32:47.560
and tell me state by state what it's full of people who are like ad dollars

32:47.560 --> 32:54.360
gonna explode and this one I know it's just potatoes my version of the

32:54.360 --> 33:03.760
Animaniacs song Africa Panama yeah so yeah that is that is kind of the way

33:03.760 --> 33:08.760
that he talks so past that I've tried to kind of edit it down for clarity yeah as

33:08.760 --> 33:15.040
you will seems he seems like a guy who is boring as hell uh-huh but also is

33:15.040 --> 33:19.440
teasing like slightly interesting thoughts yes yes in a way that's

33:19.440 --> 33:23.960
frustrating and now you realize why I was like I gotta talk about this guy but

33:23.960 --> 33:30.400
he's so goddamn bored yeah yeah yeah so uh this is this next clip is basically

33:30.400 --> 33:38.880
another in a very similar stretch so you mentioned the colonial pipeline and the

33:38.880 --> 33:46.640
the cyber criminals that effectively shut that down and caused you know long

33:46.640 --> 33:51.960
lineups at the the gas stations and so forth and and really kind of a I think a

33:51.960 --> 33:56.160
warning shot of things to come and then then colonial admits that they ended up

33:56.160 --> 34:03.160
paying five million dollars in ransom in cryptocurrency I think we're probably

34:03.160 --> 34:06.680
not getting a full story here what what are you hearing about what really

34:06.680 --> 34:11.560
happened I mean was this really just an isolated you know an incident of some

34:11.560 --> 34:16.000
gang of cyber criminals that decided you know to roll the dice and see what would

34:16.000 --> 34:19.920
happen and lo and behold yeah they paid up I mean what what are you hearing

34:19.920 --> 34:25.840
about okay so that is the question mm-hmm okay yeah very simple long-winded

34:25.840 --> 34:30.160
question it's a long-winded question everybody on these shows also every show

34:30.160 --> 34:33.180
that I think I've seen him do an interview on is at least three hours

34:33.180 --> 34:38.360
long mm-hmm this one was thankfully only an hour and 51 minutes I'll say that

34:38.360 --> 34:43.860
like in terms of like a lot of the stuff that I listen to in conspiracy that that

34:43.860 --> 34:50.720
that sort of sphere I will at least this guy's being precise yes and like it it's

34:50.720 --> 34:55.880
it's not good or all that like I don't know if we're gonna get to any truth

34:55.880 --> 35:00.360
sure sure asking a specific question right right no no I'm going to be said

35:00.360 --> 35:05.560
for that I kind of I I won I like that Richard Surratt is doing a Casey Kasem

35:05.560 --> 35:11.240
impression yes uh so much so much I'm waiting for him to do top 40 hits we're

35:11.240 --> 35:18.980
gonna talk about the going to the left and the right I suspect they paid seven

35:18.980 --> 35:29.600
million dollars and ransom what about you and also here is 303 so why did it

35:29.600 --> 35:34.320
come with 303 really don't know where'd that one come from I don't know man

35:34.320 --> 35:40.280
okay it's trying to think of bad music and it was the first thing you could

35:40.280 --> 35:45.040
have done worse now um so simple question what do you think is what are

35:45.040 --> 35:49.840
you hearing what's going on do you have do you feelers out yeah well I've heard

35:49.840 --> 35:53.240
basically the same thing but I'm like you I don't think that we've heard all

35:53.240 --> 35:57.840
of the story and one of the interesting things about the colonial thing that I

35:57.840 --> 36:01.040
don't know what how it was reported up there but there's some of the media down

36:01.040 --> 36:06.880
here was reciting government officials and so on saying things to the effect

36:06.880 --> 36:14.480
that this is there there will be more of this so yeah yeah so he's citing

36:14.480 --> 36:18.200
government officials saying that there will be more of this and all he's really

36:18.200 --> 36:22.720
responding to him with is yeah I think you're about right there and then he

36:22.720 --> 36:28.000
goes off on a different thing that you didn't know about like that kind of

36:28.000 --> 36:34.400
every time you introduce something or ask a direct question it is immediate

36:34.400 --> 36:38.800
like well maybe and then going off into whatever it is he really wants to talk

36:38.800 --> 36:42.160
about right everybody just listens to him like that's fine

36:42.160 --> 36:47.360
I have watched him talk for almost 10 minutes uninterrupted and people are

36:47.360 --> 36:53.720
wrapped by this and it's blowing me away by people you mean you no no I mean the

36:53.720 --> 36:57.720
the interviewers right right they're all sitting there there's YouTube like this

36:57.720 --> 37:01.320
is not a small thing neither uh-huh these are there's a plenty of people

37:01.320 --> 37:06.500
like constantly doing all those things people aren't cutting him off no like

37:06.500 --> 37:12.880
three minutes in your answer totally you should absolutely be doing that so I the

37:12.880 --> 37:17.320
answer is yes it'll probably happen again obviously well that's that I mean

37:17.320 --> 37:21.440
like what he's doing is playing that game of like the the the government is

37:21.440 --> 37:26.840
is being like hey this is a new threat yeah this is something that we can't

37:26.840 --> 37:31.800
expect might happen again we need to prepare strategies to deal with this

37:31.800 --> 37:37.640
right you are a business like the colonial pipeline that has like maybe

37:37.640 --> 37:45.200
infrastructure related necessity yeah in your operations be aware yeah and

37:45.200 --> 37:48.720
instead he's prepared he's presenting that as like the government being like

37:48.720 --> 37:53.840
and do this yeah this is happening all the time now again I would I would ask

37:53.840 --> 38:01.600
if like this is real and there are these hackers doing this how is that statement

38:01.600 --> 38:06.120
from the government any different than the best-case scenario of a statement

38:06.120 --> 38:10.720
that they would make as a warning what is the differentiation between it uh

38:10.720 --> 38:16.680
well they never do that well fine yeah now I assume you would think hey that

38:16.680 --> 38:20.000
answer is over you've answered the question yes probably and it's probably

38:20.000 --> 38:25.560
a false flag he is not done he's not nope he keeps going about a week after

38:25.560 --> 38:31.240
that story broke there was a story about the interstate bridge on Interstate 40

38:31.240 --> 38:38.600
from the bridge Tennessee the bridge was shut down because they had discovered a

38:38.600 --> 38:43.200
crack in one of the pylons on that bridge and I think pictures of this

38:43.200 --> 38:48.760
crack and the top of the crack is is a perfect straight line now the effect of

38:48.760 --> 38:55.040
that bridge shut down was that barge traffic on the Mississippi River south

38:55.040 --> 39:01.760
and north of Memphis Tennessee came to an absolute standstill so somebody

39:01.760 --> 39:08.920
appears to me to be working awfully hard to take down the the infrastructure of

39:08.920 --> 39:14.640
the United States and in these kinds of creative ways so I think colonial

39:14.640 --> 39:18.840
pipeline is kind of the tip of an iceberg that that they're getting ready

39:18.840 --> 39:26.400
to do something major in order to push their agenda all right yeah get it yeah

39:26.400 --> 39:31.160
see what happened was the colonial pipeline was hacked now what also

39:31.160 --> 39:35.920
happened was surprisingly enough very near to where he lives there was a crack

39:35.920 --> 39:40.760
in the bridge right but the reason that the government gave for repairing it was

39:40.760 --> 39:46.320
pesky barges need to get in and out because it's a massive actually water

39:46.320 --> 39:52.440
ways this is genius okay do you realize tell me on that for the last like 10

39:52.440 --> 39:57.360
years the globalists have been planting stories in the media about how bad our

39:57.360 --> 40:07.880
bridges are subtly warning right that they're gonna hack the bridge you have

40:07.880 --> 40:14.000
to you have to tell everyone you have to give them that cosmic choice there have

40:14.000 --> 40:18.400
been these op-eds about how more resources should be funneled towards

40:18.400 --> 40:25.340
bridge repair that's what they do so sneaky now the real story behind the

40:25.340 --> 40:29.600
hack is actually really really fascinating and if they had bothered to

40:29.600 --> 40:33.800
look into it well that's not the bridge right no not the okay no the bridge is

40:33.800 --> 40:36.600
not interesting just that's just a regular old bridge that's just

40:36.600 --> 40:39.120
maintenance yeah they were just maintaining the bridge I had a hunch

40:39.120 --> 40:44.440
yeah it was fine but you can turn anything you want into a conspiracy

40:44.440 --> 40:47.800
theory if you just go well they hacked the pipeline and there's a crack in my

40:47.800 --> 40:51.800
bridge right the government's working against if you just if you if you play

40:51.800 --> 40:57.320
the insinuation game you can you can make a lot of mileage yeah exactly but

40:57.320 --> 41:03.020
the real story is not obviously they didn't mention any names of the people

41:03.020 --> 41:07.440
who were hacking they they were like oh is it a one-off event or anything like

41:07.440 --> 41:14.040
that this is a hacking group called dark side who've done this they are

41:14.040 --> 41:20.240
ransomware masters they have been taken shit ton of money and then they

41:20.240 --> 41:24.600
disbanded immediately following the colonial pipeline smart theoretically

41:24.600 --> 41:28.400
from what people are saying is after they got paid six million the small

41:28.400 --> 41:32.700
collective of the hackers disbanded and then just took all the money mm-hmm the

41:32.700 --> 41:37.080
way that they normally work is almost 70% of the money goes to all of these

41:37.080 --> 41:42.520
like subsidiary hackers who do all of the the grunt work and and then they

41:42.520 --> 41:49.120
take their cut at the end not so this time so what did they they left the

41:49.120 --> 41:58.640
grunts out to dry yep Wow yeah brutal right no honor not too surprising so

41:58.640 --> 42:04.140
this story actually begins before the colonial pipeline hack whatsoever so

42:04.140 --> 42:09.240
from technology review by Renee Dudley and Daniel golden on January 11th

42:09.240 --> 42:13.260
antivirus company bitdefender said it was happy to announce a startling

42:13.260 --> 42:17.360
breakthrough it had found a flaw in the ransomware that a gang known as dark

42:17.360 --> 42:21.780
side was using to freeze computer networks of dozens of businesses in the

42:21.780 --> 42:25.520
u.s. in Europe companies facing demands from dark side could download a free

42:25.520 --> 42:29.060
tool from bitdefender and avoid paying millions of dollars in ransom to the

42:29.060 --> 42:35.180
hackers that's a great thing right it's a good idea now Dan what should you do

42:35.180 --> 42:41.240
when you find a flaw in a hackers programming wait who am I am I a hacker

42:41.240 --> 42:46.940
you were bitdefender your job is to protect people from hackers well you

42:46.940 --> 42:50.480
find a flaw you should probably try and patch it fix it up they did that they

42:50.480 --> 42:56.160
patched it and they fixed it up okay now here's the problem they released it as a

42:56.160 --> 43:04.720
public relations statement and within 12 hours dark side was like oh they found a

43:04.720 --> 43:08.560
hole in our software let's find another hole find it they fixed it it was over

43:08.560 --> 43:14.600
with mm-hmm so bitdefender has basically and this is happening over and over and

43:14.600 --> 43:18.180
over again yeah it's constant back and forth well and here's the thing though

43:18.180 --> 43:24.400
people who are good at this stuff don't tell anyone and all of these antivirus

43:24.400 --> 43:30.320
scammers basically announced the moment publicly like hey we fixed this the

43:30.320 --> 43:35.400
hackers can no longer get to us and then five hours later it's all right right

43:35.400 --> 43:41.960
so all of these antivirus companies are trying to get the positive you know like

43:41.960 --> 43:46.600
look at how great we are press of like we fix this hole actually antithetical

43:46.600 --> 43:52.960
to their goal exactly yeah you got it they continue to go on and here's it

43:52.960 --> 43:57.600
there's a bunch of really kind of interesting little details here Aaron

43:57.600 --> 44:04.120
Tantliff a Chicago cybersecurity attorney he is he consulted with 10

44:04.120 --> 44:08.480
companies attacked by dark side he said that dark sides representatives were

44:08.480 --> 44:12.640
shrewd bargainers if a victim said it couldn't afford the ransom because of

44:12.640 --> 44:16.600
the pandemic dark side was ready with data showing that the company's revenue

44:16.600 --> 44:21.640
was up like they had all of this they were ready this was a fortune 500

44:21.640 --> 44:27.560
hackers yeah yeah absolutely look I'd like to refer you to the accounting wing

44:27.560 --> 44:32.920
of our hacker collective yeah and not only that but the they have this like

44:32.920 --> 44:38.840
halfway we're we're only attacking corporations that we know can Robin Hood

44:38.840 --> 44:45.680
that kind of thing yeah and yeah they even came up with like actually we do

44:45.680 --> 44:49.920
know how much kovat has impacted your bottom line and we have adjusted our

44:49.920 --> 44:55.760
ransom accordingly so even if you don't want to pay the ransom it's like god

44:55.760 --> 45:00.680
damn it they make a lot of sense listen we're not heartless for hackers we're

45:00.680 --> 45:07.760
not heartless yeah so what wound up happening is a dark side just blew ever

45:07.760 --> 45:12.840
blew them away because bitdefender is very very stupid and they're gonna

45:12.840 --> 45:17.600
continue doing it mm-hmm it's just how it goes and all of this they're talking

45:17.600 --> 45:22.640
about like oh it's conspiracy are these rogue actors or anything if you look

45:22.640 --> 45:27.440
into it you'll see that this is a hugely sophisticated operation right with

45:27.440 --> 45:31.080
people who are incredibly successful at all of this and it's kind of an

45:31.080 --> 45:36.840
inevitability of like digital progression you know like as as there is

45:36.840 --> 45:42.400
more stuff that is is is online and digital mm-hmm there will be the the

45:42.400 --> 45:51.320
highwaymen of yeah the the online space like it's it's just like it's exactly

45:51.320 --> 45:57.440
what you would expect to grow and and get more sophisticated as people who

45:57.440 --> 46:02.960
would robbed stagecoaches turned into people who robbed trains yeah and then

46:02.960 --> 46:07.040
it would turn into a mafia exactly things get more sophisticated and more

46:07.040 --> 46:10.800
organized mm-hmm it makes sense that the inevitability would be something like

46:10.800 --> 46:15.880
this totally and instead they just say they're so boring it's so much more

46:15.880 --> 46:21.600
boring they're bad conspiracy theories then what is a real conspiracy yeah I

46:21.600 --> 46:25.440
feel like this is the exact same thing that we talked about with like that guy

46:25.440 --> 46:30.100
in the IRA yeah you know like it's the reality of it is fascinating and it is a

46:30.100 --> 46:37.240
really interesting piece of how like history and like human interaction works

46:37.240 --> 46:41.800
yeah and instead you're turning this into a conspiracy that's actually more

46:41.800 --> 46:46.400
boring than the actual total world you're trying to fit it into your large

46:46.400 --> 46:51.120
conspiracy theory where it doesn't belong no just be interested just be

46:51.120 --> 46:54.400
curious yeah that kind of thing it's just not hard you don't have to

46:54.400 --> 47:01.400
distrust everything yeah exactly so real soon we're gonna get into space but this

47:01.400 --> 47:08.400
one I just have to this is just silly st. Michael asks Joseph what about the

47:08.400 --> 47:13.560
Apollo oh he wants to to go a secret space program I guess here or something

47:13.560 --> 47:18.760
related to maybe the lunar landing hoax Joseph what about the the Apollo 12

47:18.760 --> 47:24.400
ascent stage experiment crashing into the lunar surface and it rang like a

47:24.400 --> 47:29.720
bell for a long period of time well I don't know that it rang see I'm

47:29.720 --> 47:35.200
accidentally cut it off just a little bit early but he is saying he's he got a

47:35.200 --> 47:40.280
question from the audience Michael st. Michael he's asking Joseph hey how is

47:40.280 --> 47:45.400
this possible and as Richard is answer is asking the question he's like they

47:45.400 --> 47:50.800
say it rang like a bell and he's like oh well that sounds silly it didn't yeah so

47:50.800 --> 47:54.760
would you like to answer the question that I have just negated exactly and

47:54.760 --> 48:01.720
here is the answer dong anyway with Joseph any thoughts on the Apollo 12

48:01.720 --> 48:07.440
ascent stage experiment crashing into the lunar surface yeah that individual

48:07.440 --> 48:13.640
is is actually citing the the language of the scientists that that reported on

48:13.640 --> 48:18.040
that experiment that was their word hello I'm a scientist it rang like a

48:18.040 --> 48:25.480
bell excuse me mr. Surratt it did ring like a goddamn Bell okay immediate

48:25.480 --> 48:30.400
immediate response is just no it read like it rang like a bell that's literal

48:30.400 --> 48:37.080
verbatim yes from this scientific literature despite being physically

48:37.080 --> 48:42.960
impossible in the world we inhabit uh-huh you mean in space yes yeah yeah

48:42.960 --> 48:50.520
in the universe we inhabit apologize so then we have introduced space and this

48:50.520 --> 48:57.160
do what what is the conspiracy here that the moon is hollow you're about to find

48:57.160 --> 49:02.120
out is that the is that the the thrust of it ringing like a bell because there

49:02.120 --> 49:06.880
would be sound vibrations right if it was hollow but then it would also have

49:06.880 --> 49:11.880
to have an opening yes so it's sort of hollow earth but the moon yeah so the

49:11.880 --> 49:16.320
moon is a base okay I'm putting the pieces together okay here I'm gonna spit

49:16.320 --> 49:23.320
ball okay the Nazis are inside the moon okay um you're not far off in fact

49:23.320 --> 49:30.000
you're terrifyingly close go ahead this is basically that movie iron sky he's

49:30.000 --> 49:35.880
almost all like a movie guy yeah love it yeah I think in the early 70s I don't

49:35.880 --> 49:42.080
remember exactly when it was but Sputnik magazine the old Soviet periodical

49:42.080 --> 49:49.040
published a set of articles by some Soviet scientists that actually had the

49:49.040 --> 49:53.360
thesis that the moon was a big huge artificial spaceship because it was you

49:53.360 --> 49:57.640
know it was impossible to explain the physics of how it got there doing what

49:57.640 --> 50:02.600
it's doing on any of the natural models for for its existence you know the

50:02.600 --> 50:07.920
capture model the fission from Earth model and so on and so forth so I you

50:07.920 --> 50:11.800
know I give some credence to those stories and even to that theory because

50:11.800 --> 50:16.880
you know it's it's like Isaac Newton said about the moon the moon's the only

50:16.880 --> 50:21.440
thing that gives me a headache because you have a good way of explaining how it

50:21.440 --> 50:26.080
got there doing what it's doing I mean the guy quoted Sputnik yeah yeah

50:26.080 --> 50:32.080
Sputnik magazine from the 70s or 80s some Russian scientists speculated that

50:32.080 --> 50:38.680
maybe the moon is a spaceship 50 years later Joseph P for L thinks that that's

50:38.680 --> 50:46.840
probably true my friend have you heard that cheese yeah yeah it is it is that

50:46.840 --> 50:50.560
that's the type of thing that we're dealing with you are absolutely right

50:50.560 --> 50:57.520
there are Nazis up there I mean I feel like you know in the 70s it's the late

50:57.520 --> 51:04.160
70s this might have been after a particular Death Star

51:05.840 --> 51:16.960
look sort of like the moon that's not a moon Dan it's a space station they're

51:16.960 --> 51:22.480
really biding their time with like doing anything with it yeah 70s and 80s you

51:22.480 --> 51:27.200
don't know what it's for just yet huh um so yeah at least like the second Death

51:27.200 --> 51:32.280
Star was like under construction and that made yes made sense for like why it

51:32.280 --> 51:40.960
wasn't doing like a space station would have blown up a planet by now or done

51:40.960 --> 51:45.800
something I do I do like the idea that instead of whatever in Star Wars they

51:45.800 --> 51:50.780
like the it's fully operational instead they're like listen we're gonna have to

51:50.780 --> 51:54.840
hang out here for about 50 60 years and then we'll get to him I swear to God

51:54.840 --> 52:06.480
well right there don't fucking move don't leave the moon not just that but

52:06.480 --> 52:13.160
you would need to have like MREs to like so much food but not just that you have

52:13.160 --> 52:18.520
to then say that the moon has always been a space station right so for someone

52:18.520 --> 52:22.920
had to have created exactly I've had to built it pre-earth because everybody is

52:22.920 --> 52:30.920
yeah and there needs to be like some kind of like a biome inside that has

52:30.920 --> 52:35.160
like something there's no light source so you can't like plants having

52:35.160 --> 52:40.120
photosynthesis I don't know how you would keep animals alive that seems like

52:40.120 --> 52:45.280
it would be prohibitive yeah on the moon or in the moon I guess you could

52:45.280 --> 52:51.920
have like an elaborate fungus kind of economy that's true it could be like a

52:51.920 --> 52:56.480
like a lost world scenario where you go in the moon and it turns out that

52:56.480 --> 53:01.400
there's actually brush and beautiful verdant tropical island there I think

53:01.400 --> 53:08.920
you would still need something to give for like energy to that that that flora

53:08.920 --> 53:16.560
and fauna Atlantis and fine oh oh and also Atlantis is also magic Atlantis is

53:16.560 --> 53:20.080
in play thank God so we're at the midpoint they just started talking

53:20.080 --> 53:26.320
about space and now I'm just I love this clip I just love this hey thanks for

53:26.320 --> 53:31.560
inviting me into your home long-haul truck RV camper taxi your parents

53:31.560 --> 53:35.200
well-appointed rec room with the simulated wood paneling electric

53:35.200 --> 53:39.520
fireplace and the painting of dogs playing poker your loft that greasy

53:39.520 --> 53:43.720
spoon just off the interstate and your cabin in the woods hello to everyone

53:43.720 --> 53:48.080
listening in on our flagship station am 749 6.7 FM

53:48.080 --> 53:54.400
zoomer radio here in Toronto and hiya to those of you tuning I just love it it

53:54.400 --> 53:58.680
just reminds me so much of Casey case of yes it's just so much Casey case if I

53:58.680 --> 54:03.640
just love it let me describe a Norman Rockwell painting give a shout out to

54:03.640 --> 54:10.480
the only station I'm on I there's something about that that just reminds

54:10.480 --> 54:14.560
me of literally a long road trip in the middle of the night listening to some

54:14.560 --> 54:17.920
terrible radio station and you hear that and you're like yeah that's what radios

54:17.920 --> 54:21.360
about yeah you're you were saying this guy's one of the like junior varsity

54:21.360 --> 54:27.760
guys on coast to coast and it it shows it smells like totally so the reason

54:27.760 --> 54:34.520
that I wanted to do space is aliens are obviously in the news these days and we

54:34.520 --> 54:38.800
don't get enough of it these these days on the podcast no we just don't um and

54:38.800 --> 54:43.200
then this guy's obsessed with Nazis so why not put them both together now how

54:43.200 --> 54:48.000
might you think that cuz I this is one question that I was interested in

54:48.000 --> 54:53.880
especially is everybody normal now everybody who is not a space weirdo

54:53.880 --> 54:58.480
before is now like holy shit government's saying there's aliens or

54:58.480 --> 55:03.560
something going on here how is the UFO community taking this and false light

55:03.560 --> 55:08.840
and the fact that the government stole UFO from them and changed it out of

55:08.840 --> 55:13.080
nowhere just because they didn't want them to look stupid it's fake yeah right

55:13.080 --> 55:18.600
so let's see okay we have this technology now and and maybe you know

55:18.600 --> 55:28.120
that might explain these the tic-tac UFO videos even though the the Pentagon is

55:28.120 --> 55:32.920
saying they're not ours they're not ours well maybe that kind of blows that out

55:32.920 --> 55:39.800
of the water well the the tic-tac videos you know and all of this stuff I you

55:39.800 --> 55:45.640
know you can go look up patents online for triangular shaped vehicles that use

55:45.640 --> 55:50.880
some form of field propulsion what bothers me about all of this is not so

55:50.880 --> 55:56.520
much that the technology apparently does exist what bothers me is the constant

55:56.520 --> 56:04.680
rush to attribute it to ET and well I mean that's a thought yeah the guy who

56:04.680 --> 56:09.200
just told us that the moon was a fucking spaceship rang like a bell that the

56:09.200 --> 56:13.760
Pyramid of Giza is actually a Death Star right that the Nazis are just fucking

56:13.760 --> 56:19.440
everywhere cloning people all this stuff sure he's telling you people are rushing

56:19.440 --> 56:24.640
to judgment on this ET stuff yeah you don't know you can't tell that sure yeah

56:24.640 --> 56:32.000
yeah he's being real dismissive of this and I will admit if this is one of those

56:32.000 --> 56:39.520
situations too where I've looked into it and these the original UFO folks are now

56:39.520 --> 56:44.680
debunking the government's videos right because it doesn't work for the stories

56:44.680 --> 56:50.440
that they write the folklore exactly but in this situation they're doing a good

56:50.440 --> 56:56.960
job the the government's videos can very easily be explained and it's kind of

56:56.960 --> 57:00.600
disappointing whenever you look into the simplicity of their explanations and

57:00.600 --> 57:06.200
you're like oh shit what a surprise human error and machine error that's

57:06.200 --> 57:10.400
never happened in the military before yeah yeah like a lot of like headlines

57:10.400 --> 57:17.120
and like excitement can get ahead of yourself a little bit and and that's

57:17.120 --> 57:20.800
that's something that I actually think is really fascinating is that like a lot

57:20.800 --> 57:25.480
of these communities are capable of decent critical thinking it's just

57:25.480 --> 57:30.520
misdirected if you're attacking their bullshit yeah they will apply very

57:30.520 --> 57:35.840
rigorous and solid critical thinking skills to your bullshit they can yeah

57:35.840 --> 57:42.920
it's just not usually done exactly yes it is very much never done so that's why

57:42.920 --> 57:47.720
when I hear that clip it's like okay people are really eager to attribute

57:47.720 --> 57:53.560
this to aliens yes they are yes I agree with you I don't disagree with that

57:53.560 --> 58:00.240
statement coming from you exactly yeah exactly and he is he is getting he's

58:00.240 --> 58:08.080
getting a little bit salty these days oh no about his UFO information the the

58:08.080 --> 58:12.160
idea that this was a vehicle reconstructed on the basis of what they

58:12.160 --> 58:19.640
had they had recovered from crashed and recovered UF vehicle UFO vehicles that

58:19.640 --> 58:23.200
to me could be a cover story for what they're really up to in other words if

58:23.200 --> 58:27.920
this might be wholly a human product I don't know but I'm increasingly

58:27.920 --> 58:34.480
skeptical Richard about the ET narrative particularly from governments that have

58:34.480 --> 58:39.680
been willing to lie to our faces about you know masks and vaccines and so on

58:39.680 --> 58:47.680
and so forth so yeah yeah he thinks everybody's job bad what if it's an

58:47.680 --> 58:54.440
actual tic-tac what if it's just with buzz marketing yeah I think it's a do

58:54.440 --> 58:59.000
you think it's like that that time aqua teen hunger force put pictures up places

58:59.000 --> 59:03.840
and then they got bomb threats from whatever what the tic-tac's been biting

59:03.840 --> 59:13.400
their time sure there's a secret program yeah to give tic-tac the power to create

59:13.400 --> 59:18.040
extraterrestrial vehicles I believe it I don't think that's terribly wrong but

59:18.040 --> 59:22.080
yeah everything that you think is wrong everything that they think is wrong and

59:22.080 --> 59:27.320
if you know something you're wrong about it and here's why oh and now he's

59:27.320 --> 59:33.360
starting to get a little bit possessive as well are you thinking that the the

59:33.360 --> 59:40.000
technology exists and that that these are made in the good old USA or are did

59:40.000 --> 59:45.320
this technology find its way into the hands of our adversaries Russia China

59:45.320 --> 59:50.200
well I think a lot of it I go back to what I've been writing about in my

59:50.200 --> 59:55.400
Nazi series of books I wrote a book a few years ago that ufology loves to

59:55.400 --> 01:00:01.040
ignore it's called Roswell and the Reich and it's about the Roswell incident I

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:10.280
pray that I never do anything that the UFO community loves to ignore I pray I

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:19.200
pray that that is not a fate that I have my career where I'm pissed off community

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.960
ignores my book it's very strange that the UFO community is not also willing to

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:29.360
toss the Nazis in with the Roswell circumstances some of them do though

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.040
that's true I feel like this guy is being a little bit I don't know salty

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:39.120
like you said yeah I mean like there are that is a that is a conspiracy that I've

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.120
heard before sure it's not something that's like verboten in conspiracy and

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.520
space communities I have read a little bit of his book though and they made a

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:55.840
movie called I read a little bit of that book and not iron sky the

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:02.480
novelization of the movie iron sky no it's it's just nobody reads my books

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:10.120
that's that's kind of words I relate yeah no I have professional misgivings

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:16.960
about more people could listen or the ufology community is no oh no no no you

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.760
would prefer just generally like I think anybody who creates things like we could

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.600
have a wider audience or I feel like that's what he's saying yeah yeah but

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:31.760
he's more saying they don't respect me so on and so forth exactly I I'm I just

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.320
love it this is this is kind of fun for me just because everything is

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:41.800
everything's obviously a false flag Nazis obviously had et Giza pyramid is a

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:49.320
death star all all of this stuff is true simultaneously but somehow these guys

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:55.080
don't take it to a mean place like even for all their COVID denialism which is

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.660
inherently mean and cruel it's not like they're they're not the type of person

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.840
that I'm used to hearing talk about this where they almost relish like the the

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.760
inflicting of cruelty or the expression of cruelty right like for someone like

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:13.160
Alex it's less about the point and it's more about getting to yell at somebody

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:18.800
about how they're wearing a mask yeah and I think that is kind of a feature of

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.760
a lot of the stuff that we see yeah yeah totally and for him you don't think it's

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:31.200
it's not malicious he strikes me more as almost a hoarder of Nazi bullshit like

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.920
instead of somebody collecting beanie babies he's collected lore and he's just

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:43.880
hoarded it and so I don't know how much of it is anything about how he feels or

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.640
thinks or even has like prescriptions or what we should do I don't think he

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.600
takes any of his like here's what we should do seriously right all he's

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.560
really interested in is hoarding all of this information mm-hmm none of it is

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.900
true but he's so hoarded it over the you know it's just like he did with when he

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:08.920
was a theologian he hoarded all of this biblical knowledge all of this history

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:15.660
and and tightened he wants to be the dungeon master of Nazi space exactly he

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.620
wants everybody to kiss the ring because he's hoarded the most knowledge yeah

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:24.800
that's the way that he operates and so yeah in this situation it's just just

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:31.720
ridiculous all right let's see oh you betcha you betcha asks Joseph how do you

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.480
compare kovat vaccine passports compared to the long-standing requirement to have

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.400
your kids get a vaccine to go to school or vaccines for yellow fever to travel

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.940
which is an interesting point so you know in other words why are we getting

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:50.600
all upset about and worked up about vaccine passports right mm-hmm that's a

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.480
good question hmm that's a really good question I got excited when I heard that

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.100
question because that would be a moment if that shows up on info Wars where Alex

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.160
is like I'm sorry we gotta let you go and hangs up real quick cuz it's a very

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.480
solid question yeah I I honestly was listening to it and I got lost because

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:17.720
it bored me all right yeah so I was thinking this is great because it's a

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.400
reasonable question so the only way out of it is you got to take a big swing

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.780
yeah you know I got really excited you got hit hard I got hit hard I simply

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:32.720
don't buy the universality of vaccines I grew up as many people in the United

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.920
States did in a state where this was not a requirement in fact the only vaccine

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.600
I've ever had in my life is the polio vaccine the Sabin vaccine when I was

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:51.440
very young I've not had any vaccine ever since that so it's not a an entirely

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.440
universal experience huh nope no big swing at all he just says I grew up and

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.040
I didn't have to get vaccines except for the polio except for the polio one now

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.840
why are we not talking about how the polio vaccine is also evil let's not

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.560
worry about it he's already had it he got it was he was a kid we're not gonna

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.880
deal with that sure that does beg the question are some vaccines good right

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:17.480
but we're not gonna deal with that sure isn't that a real I was so disappointed

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:22.080
I was so disappointed because his answer is just basically like well maybe if I

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.400
had grown up in that culture I would understand what you're saying but since

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:30.560
I didn't I don't care mm-hmm that's I wanted I wanted Nazis to be behind it

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:36.240
yeah yeah yeah it is a little bit of a swing and a miss yeah it's a real bummer

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.000
it's a real bummer yeah now they that is the interview with the conspiracy

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.320
theorist equivalent of stepping on a banana yeah somebody should have thrown

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.280
a pie in his face immediately following that yeah put a little comedy in there

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:58.680
come on guys so now we get to some of the things that Pharrell is writing so

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.600
he also has a blog and he posts stuff all the way all there and now if you

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.840
looked at his blog oh yeah I've read a lot of it does he have any posts about

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:13.000
how no one ever really dies um I don't think he has posts about how no one ever

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.040
really dies but any RD the group that Pharrell was oh my god sorry oh my god

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:24.520
sorry you're killing me I'm trying to do this I'm not great at running a show and

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:31.680
dealing with references this is what I have to put up with and you've done it

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:39.640
several hundred times true so yeah they talk about one of the things that Joseph

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:45.720
has written you posted a blog I'm not sure how long ago it wasn't too long ago

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:51.560
discussing some rather interesting formations that you've spotted on on

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:57.720
Mars first there there was some discussion about some ice formations on

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:02.520
the planet and that led you to look a little further and and what did you spy

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.740
where you buried the lead yeah you didn't tell me this guy maybe has a

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:13.840
telescope oh he does because that's enough to get him on unfortunately he

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.680
does not have a telescope he is talking about pictures posted from 2001 by the

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:25.320
Mars Odyssey spacecraft and Richard sets this up as though this is a very

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.400
important article and Joseph's response we're not gonna listen to because it's

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.920
eight minutes long and all he's really saying is nothing he's saying stuff like

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.240
hey it looks like it could be let me let me read you the caption so the pictures

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.000
that Richard is talking about hmm saying this article is very good let me read

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.320
you the captions on these pictures quote when I look at this with my layman's

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:54.800
eyes I'm not seeing much about Antarctic ice flows and a whole lot of weird stuff

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.080
that borders on things that look like nearly perfect circular whatchamacallits

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:06.200
huh good you think that's good stuff yeah okay I mean look the scientist said

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.240
that the moon rang like a bell true and so this seems like scientific language

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:17.080
that's true the doodads well it goes on quote and then there are lots of odd

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.520
little bumpy things often neatly arranged in rectangles triangles and so

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:27.720
on and then finally we have lots and lots and lots of rectilinear and

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.160
structural looking things as somebody who spends a fair amount of time reading

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.320
things in journals I'm used to things being described as bumpy little bumpy

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:42.880
little things whatchamacallits yeah okay so we're gonna have to cut your chest

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:48.040
open and we're gonna perform some surgery on your who's it and then we'll

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.640
take the what's a and put it in your whole wall and you'll be good you fell

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.360
off this high place and the problem is that really hard thing inside your arm

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:07.640
it's got a you got a crick in your heart thing see all I all I hear is an

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:15.000
unfamiliarity with scholarly writing on your part unfamiliarity with research

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.560
wow I mean that's that does that doesn't not sound very it doesn't sound like

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.400
somebody should bring it up in an interview and be like now you just wrote

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.120
this interesting thing I mean you have an uphill battle whenever you're

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:34.200
starting an interview and being like you wrote a blog yeah that alone is a tough

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:44.000
sell whatchamacallits whatchamacallits great now I'm assuming you're asking how

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.240
is it that they can pay for these whatchamacallits bumpy things and

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:55.960
structural looking things who they mr. mr. global annoyed as I think he likes

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.640
to instead of saying globalist he likes to Dennis Miller it up with mr. global

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.800
annoyed or whatever avoid the global annoyed yeah exactly there we go that

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:11.280
one I got so yeah so now we're gonna talk about how everybody pays for it we

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.640
were talking about Mars and a little bit about the secret space program you

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:19.680
mentioned Catherine Austin fits earlier and the missing trillion something like

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:27.640
21 trillion dollars missing from the US government so is it your belief that

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.680
that much of this money is being funneled into the secret space the

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.800
secret space program for what the construction of deep space platforms and

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.480
so forth I know Catherine Austin fits Oh do you a lot personally okay yeah she's

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:49.560
she comes up in various places yeah so she's a former HUD official in the

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:55.680
W administration and then when she left she created a brokerage firm and she

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.120
started business doing business with you guessed it the HUD now what was going on

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.280
is while she was doing the accounting for these contracts with the HUD and the

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:13.680
Pentagon and that kind of stuff stuff didn't look right it didn't look right

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.240
at all things are going wrong and so Joseph is going to tell us what it is

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.840
she found so if we go back to to let's say the day about some 2008 they pumped

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:34.280
an enormous amount of money into the system or did they I like that yeah well

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:42.120
they bailouts yeah were for like upgrades to the moon basically now his

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.680
theory I guess is that if the bailouts happened then inflation should have

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:56.320
skyrocketed which okay that doesn't exactly work but that's fine what he is

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.760
completely ignoring is that the 21 trillion that we're we're talking about

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.560
is not missing in the sense that it's like it was taken away and now it could

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.640
be anywhere right right it's missing in the sense that the Pentagon by design

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.600
does not keep track of where it spends money mm-hmm it doesn't keep track of it

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.800
it doesn't they you can't audit it you can't nothing happens they've tried to

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.400
have so many accountants go in and just give it a shot right and you can't do it

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.400
by design because if you know exactly how much money you're spending you

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.480
might get less well there's that and then also I would assume that there's

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.520
probably some kind of like national security reasons why you wouldn't want

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.960
that information being somewhere where people could possibly get a hold of it

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:47.120
sure sure that I would assume that maybe there's some of that right but I even

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.120
then you would have a budget and they do not right they just have money and then

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.200
they spend it so even whenever they're talking about passing a military budget

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.620
it does it's just it's just there mm-hmm and they spend money and if they spend

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.680
more than that budget the government's still gonna pay for it nobody cares

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:10.360
right yeah right that sort of like missing money is is the the same kind of

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:16.320
thing that people talk about with like there's this unfunded social security

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.160
and totally totally it's the same misunderstanding of like it's not

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.480
unfunded it's just money isn't there yet because it's future exactly it's people

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.800
paying into it will pay for it in the future you know like that it's the same

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:34.160
sort of semantical trick that people use to try and argue against any kind of

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.120
government spending exactly now although in this case maybe there's more to it

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.320
oh no everybody who has looked into it everybody who has looked into the

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:48.820
Pentagon budget has like immediately like they they open their computer they

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:52.820
look at one line and they raise a red flag up into the fucking sky and shoot

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:57.760
flares and they're like this is not good yeah this is a problem it's a it's a

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.420
it's a it's a misunderstanding based on like the way it's being described yes

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:07.320
but it's an extra this this is a problem for a different reason yes yeah you got

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:14.080
it now Joseph has a different theory than that so I've actually speculated

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:21.160
that somehow this money may actually be going off world yeah how I don't know

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:28.720
sure sure I'm in yeah I just love that yeah I just love that he does not go

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.440
this is the one time that he really doesn't go on further cool here's his

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.240
response well um I think it's probably off world and I don't know how it got

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:45.000
there now I should say I got no idea right I'm not even gonna give you a gas

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.360
no but I will say that I'm just speculating yeah I don't know it's

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.240
probably off world I might be in that empty moon up there I would love to be

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.220
the guy doing this interview because my response would be like oh you're

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:07.520
speculating oh oh are you interesting I'm speculating that that money stayed

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:17.240
on world now what we have reached an impasse we must agree to disagree yeah I

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:23.920
mean it's just it's just that so often so what he always is money in space

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:30.240
moon rocks no no no it doesn't mean anything oh yeah yeah no intergalactic

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.240
treaties recognize money all right yeah yeah otherwise how could we do business

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.480
with the ET if they don't recognize our currency I would suggest we don't please

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:48.680
go on yeah and so that's exactly what Joseph does a with everything speculate

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:54.000
yes the only difference between that clip and what he normally does is the

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.440
tricks he uses of being like I'm gonna flood you with names I'm gonna flood you

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.140
with information because he's an incredibly knowledgeable guy he's

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:06.360
hoarded all of this information right so he hits you with so much references all

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.840
the time that people skip over the fact that most of his responses to questions

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.680
are essentially I'm speculating here yeah I don't know anything I might be

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:23.560
making this up yeah totally and it's it it's just mind-boggling how popular this

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.400
guy really is it's nuts hmm cuz he's boring and he doesn't have anything to

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.640
say it doesn't seem like it and then this is the I believe this is the last

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:39.520
clip because I just couldn't do this after this do one of your blogs recent

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:46.800
blogs on Giza death star calm and this it's entitled precognition and as you

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.600
point out it's a it's a wild article that I guess someone shared with you and

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.720
it has to do with these scientists who have discovered that the heart and brain

01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:03.880
can respond to future events obviously before they happen tell me more well I

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:09.400
find that very interesting because it it seems to present a physiological case

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:14.360
that that the structure of the brain and the heart and they're very very similar

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:21.800
somehow represent or mirror the the fabric of the universe and the reason I

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:27.560
find that very interesting is you can go online and look at pictures of galactic

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.400
clusters and what they think are the plasma strands that connect them and

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:38.640
then compare those pictures to actual neural mapping of neurons in the brain

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.400
and they're remarkably similar yes you ever see a fractal man yeah that's

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:48.960
that's what I was I was listening to that just going supposedly I'm supposed

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.880
to take you as an authority on Eve and this and you're telling me your response

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.920
to precognition possibility is to say look at the pictures of the stars and

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:06.840
people very similar yeah maybe we're little little bugs inside a brain like

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.920
the universe universe is a big brain yeah and that's just another person or

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:16.360
something fine man but come on come on you're supposed to be the expert in this

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:21.120
shit and you cannot come at me with you know they look alike sure it's so

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.360
disappointing to me and I just can't handle it I couldn't handle it past that

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.880
point I was like I've heard too many times you just go oh it looks like a

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.240
whatchamacallit and then be done with your with your evidence when I tilt my

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:37.860
head up I see the whatchamacallit and it looks like the doodad and so

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.700
precognition is probably true or not or whatever yeah it doesn't mean anything

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:47.740
no and he just keeps getting listened to as though he's an authority wearing his

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:51.800
dumb Indiana Jones hat smoking his Cruella de Vil cigarette and he's not

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:56.520
even smoking and so on and so forth I feel like you shouldn't be mad at the

01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.680
hat and the affectations those are kind of charming do you think that's why he

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.520
keeps getting invited probably yeah I might talk to him I might be tricked

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:13.580
yeah no he's uh he's not interesting enough to trick you I don't think you'll

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:17.680
need to worry too much about that oh so yeah talking that he has not been on

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:24.920
project Camelot hey don't think he had well he was interviewed by not carry Oh

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:32.440
by Bill Ryan yes okay I remember seeing that okay and so I was going to talk

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.320
about bill is less fun he's much less fun yeah yeah yeah that was not good

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.520
it was done in a weird hotel room that looked like a motel six yeah those

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:48.960
they're early aesthetic yeah yeah so that is Joseph P Pharrell the possible

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.880
doctor definite shitbag and mediocre writer

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:58.520
Nazis did not factor into this as much as I expected no the problem with the

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:05.280
Nazis is that that is his like I guess mid period work uh-huh you know like now

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:13.500
he's more into banks are killing everybody okay um and I it was about 10

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:18.840
15 years ago that he was all into Nazis all talking Nazis all the time before

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:24.680
the era of podcasts exactly yeah a lot of available audio sorry there were

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.040
there were there wasn't more Nazi talk but it was teased but you know what

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.000
we're never we never need more Nazi I mean he grew up next to Nazis so we

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.080
could probably ask them sure yeah I bet they've got a lot of Nazi content yeah

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:42.340
well this is interesting Jordan yeah I thought it was fairly interesting I

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:45.560
thought he was an interesting guy and I thought we should talk about him thanks
