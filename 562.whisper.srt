N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,040
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,160
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Dan and Jordan.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
Knowledgefight.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
That'll hurt.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
That'll hurt.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,320
That'll hurt.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
I need money.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
That'll hurt.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
That'll hurt.

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
That'll hurt.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Andy and Kansas.

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Andy and Kansas.

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Stop it.

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Andy and Kansas.

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Andy and Kansas.

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
It's time to pray.

23
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Thanks for holding.

25
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Hello, Alex.

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
I'm a victim caller.

27
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
I'm a huge fan.

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
I love your room.

29
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
Knowledgefight.

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Knowledgefight.com.

31
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,320
I love you.

32
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Hey, everybody.

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

34
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm Dan.

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
I'm Jordan.

36
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
We're a couple dudes.

37
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,160
I'd like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex

38
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Jones.

39
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

40
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Yeah, Jordan.

41
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Dan.

42
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Jordan.

43
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
I have a quick question for you.

44
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
What's up?

45
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
What's your bright spot today?

46
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,120
My bright spot today, honestly, is a little bit of getting back to it, you know?

47
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,120
Yeah.

48
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,200
I think we went on a vacation and getting back to Selene, getting back to work, getting

49
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,840
back into a little bit of... I think one of the things that's one of the undervalued

50
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,060
or underthought about elements of vacations are how much it makes you like, ah, my day-to-day

51
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,600
life is better than I think it is.

52
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,640
You know, I was reading Terry Pratchett while we were on vacation, and he had a really great

53
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,480
quote that I was like, you've never really been anywhere until you get back, you know?

54
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,000
And that, until we got back, I was like, that's kind of a silly thing to say, and now I kind

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
of get it.

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah.

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've been on vacations before.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,240
Granted, it's been a long time, but you know, it's something that I think is also easy to

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
forget.

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,560
It's something that you experience over and over again, and every time you go on a vacation

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,800
too, your life is probably in a different circumstance than it was the last time.

62
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Sure.

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Sure.

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,200
I think it's time for you to come back and listen to this idiot again.

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,200
It was good to take a break.

66
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,680
It really was.

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
Yeah.

68
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,440
And now I really want to get back to work.

69
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,760
I think there's some things that were dangling threads that did not run into any lizards

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
weirdly.

71
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,120
No, that was difficult.

72
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,040
I had a perception in my head that there were lizards everywhere when I was a kid, and maybe

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,320
it's because I was a couple feet shorter and closer to the ground and I could just see

74
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
them everywhere.

75
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
You could see them a lot better.

76
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,880
I did not catch any lizards, not a single one.

77
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,200
I got blisters on my feet the first day we were there, so I didn't shimmy up any poles.

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
Same here.

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,920
My childhood home has been torn down and turned into an apartment complex.

80
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,720
It was a little bit like Gross Point Blank.

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,280
It was a little bit like that.

82
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Yeah.

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
At least it wasn't a convenience store.

84
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,120
No, but it was still a lovely time.

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Sure.

86
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Sure.

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
What about you?

88
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
What's your bright spot?

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,320
You know, I have a hard time saying anything similarly to you.

90
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,120
You know, I feel like the vacation was great, but my bright spot was, when we got back,

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,560
my dogs were still staying with my partner's mother.

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,280
Yeah, you had like a whole other day, right?

93
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:30,960
A whole other day, and they got back today, and the first time I saw, they went so ridiculously

94
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
crazy.

95
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,280
I was like, how did I ever leave these beautiful things?

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
That's very cute.

97
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,440
Oh, you know, you're like, I knew my pets loved me, but after they've been gone for

98
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,720
a week and they saw me again, you're like, ah, this is what it's all about, man.

99
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Yeah.

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Yeah.

101
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,520
I mean, that's fairly similar to the experience I had with Celine, but with a lot more yelling.

102
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Well, there's...

103
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,320
She was yelling at me quite a bit.

104
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,600
I got a few more face licks, I think.

105
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Yeah.

106
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
That might be the case.

107
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,120
I got some snuggles and some aggressive head butts eventually.

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Sure.

109
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Sure.

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,760
And I was coming up the stairs with the luggage, so if I could just hear, meh.

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Well, yeah.

112
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,160
A cat has to teach you a lesson before they can re-give you the...

113
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Grumpy as hell.

114
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,960
But I wouldn't have it any other way.

115
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
No, of course not.

116
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,040
So, Jordan, today we have a difficulty ahead of us, and that is kind of like we missed

117
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
a bit of time.

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Yeah.

119
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,760
And so, and also some stuff happened right when we got back.

120
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,960
Oh, of course.

121
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,840
That's very relevant to our business, so I didn't really know exactly what the strategy

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,240
was going to be in terms of, you know, do we go back and listen to all of last week?

123
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Sure.

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Sure.

125
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Or what do we do?

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Yeah.

127
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Pick and choose, that kind of thing.

128
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Right.

129
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
And it's a little challenging.

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
And so, just spoiler alert, the Fauci emails came out.

131
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Oh, boy.

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Yep.

133
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Yep.

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,900
And so I was like, well, I mean, Alex is gonna go buck wild on this.

135
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Of course.

136
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,820
But since the time we've been back, I haven't had enough time to read all of it.

137
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,200
It's like 3,000 pages.

138
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Jesus.

139
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I've read quite a bit.

140
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Of course.

141
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
It's boring emails.

142
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
I was thinking the same.

143
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,760
I read a few of them and I was like, I'm just not doing this.

144
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,840
I'm not reading business emails, you know?

145
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,260
I've thought that to myself a whole bunch of times because most of what I've read so

146
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,000
far is Fauci forwarding something to another person.

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Honestly.

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,160
Or it's someone sending a nonsensical email to him and him not responding.

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,620
No, half the time I'm looking around, I'm like, the next email is gonna be like, we're

150
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,040
gonna need to refill the toilet paper in the lobby.

151
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
You know?

152
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
It's like that kind of level.

153
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
And then he forwards that to maintenance.

154
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Yes, exactly.

155
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
And you're like, okay.

156
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
That's why it's in the cache.

157
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
All right, we get it.

158
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
He's evil or whatever.

159
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
But come on, man.

160
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,320
So I haven't gotten a full enough view.

161
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,400
And just like, I think it would be almost impossible.

162
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,480
I don't know, unless you had a team reading them in chunks or whatever, to get through

163
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,680
all 3,000 pages and the time that it would take to...

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
It's like the Snowden files, you know?

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
You've got multiple outlets working on that.

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Right.

167
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,280
So that was a big priority, but at the same time, it was something that we couldn't really

168
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
do yet.

169
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,920
So I'm hoping to be able to do some really current stuff for Monday.

170
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,640
So what I did is I just threw an arrow at a dartboard, darted an arrowboard, whatever.

171
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,560
And May 27th, Thursday of last week, came up.

172
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,840
I was like, we'll do Thursday and Friday.

173
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,800
Thursday ended up too silly, and Friday's off the table.

174
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,460
Thursday's just a mess.

175
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,800
The dartboard was wrong.

176
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Yeah.

177
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,840
So here we go, we're going to do May 27th, 2021, Blackjack.

178
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Ah, shit.

179
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm way out of practice.

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
This is going to be interesting.

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,280
Alex is very silly.

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Let's do it.

183
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
That's what I was hoping for.

184
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,440
I want to come back to silly.

185
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,220
Yeah, I also felt like let's not overburden ourselves with something that's going to be

186
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,220
all day.

187
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Yeah.

188
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Yeah.

189
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,920
Nobody wants to come back to the office the first day and really deal with that stack

190
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,200
of paper that built up.

191
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,520
You get to the top few pages.

192
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,160
It has to be taken care of eventually.

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Sure, sure.

194
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
But not today.

195
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Half day.

196
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Yes, exactly.

197
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Or something.

198
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Yeah.

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,040
So, Jordan, before we do that, let's take a little moment to say hello to one wonk and

200
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
then introduce a new development on the podcast.

201
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Interesting.

202
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
So thank you so much.

203
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,320
Random dude from Germany feeling better about his national discourse.

204
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Thanks to Alex.

205
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
You are now a policy wonk.

206
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
I'm a policy wonk.

207
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Oh, thank you very much.

208
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I suppose most of Germany.

209
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
So Jordan.

210
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Yes, sir.

211
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,400
I have decided that, look, these birthday things, they're never going away.

212
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,080
It's going to be a struggle.

213
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,800
So I have a new drop for us.

214
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Okay.

215
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
All right.

216
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
To introduce birthday time.

217
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,080
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

218
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,120
You could say that life is death.

219
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,400
Hey, it's time to give some happy birthday shout outs to folks here on the podcast.

220
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,200
Dan, you never fail to impress me.

221
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Never.

222
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,720
You never fail to impress me.

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
So Josie, my birthday was on the first, Andrew got in touch with us, wanted to wish you a

224
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
happy birthday.

225
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm going to need some time.

226
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm going to need some time.

227
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,540
Also like to say happy birthday, Sean, Stalin, Stritch, may your adapt as a start is bring

228
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,240
glory to the Emperor and justice to the globalists.

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Okay.

230
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Okay.

231
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,360
I'm back at it.

232
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,520
So Kit, I had a 30th birthday, Basil sent me or Basil, not entirely sure.

233
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,040
I do think that I have been told how to pronounce it and I refused.

234
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,920
I think when people tell me how to pronounce things, it's like, I'm deaf to it.

235
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,560
Oh no, we're Americans.

236
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,120
It's our God given right to ignore British pronunciations.

237
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,880
Anyway, Basil or Basil got in touch with me and wanted me to wish Kit a happy birthday.

238
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Happy birthday, Kit.

239
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
Also, the two of them just got engaged.

240
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Congratulations.

241
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Congratulations.

242
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,360
Congratulations on your nuptials, upcoming nuptials, thrilled for you.

243
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,480
And then finally, coming up on the fifth, I guess that's this weekend, this Saturday,

244
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,640
Frank M's got a birthday, 27th birthday, from what I understand.

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
How about that?

246
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
It's almost over for you.

247
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Happy birthday, Frank.

248
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,800
This brings us to a close of the happy birthday shout outs.

249
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,720
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

250
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,000
You can say that life is death.

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Happy birthday.

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,760
I have a feeling that's going to go down in the Rake Effect Hall of Fame.

253
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
Two episodes from now, we're both going to be like, ah, this is normal.

254
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,520
In five episodes from now, I'm going to continue losing my shit every time.

255
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,080
We'll see.

256
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,360
All right.

257
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,560
So the 27th, Alex is in a strange mood and here's another context drop to give you a

258
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,640
little bit of a sense of it.

259
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,040
Oh, my God.

260
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Did I get hired?

261
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,880
No, because that was fake.

262
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
That's true.

263
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
That is fake.

264
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,560
That is fake.

265
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,320
I do kind of feel personally offended by that laugh.

266
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,880
That was Pillsbury Alex.

267
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,240
Someone was tickling him.

268
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
So here we go.

269
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
We're going to start the show.

270
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,280
And this is where I actually got on the hook.

271
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Okay.

272
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,840
And sometimes it takes me a little while when I start up an episode for it to be like, I'm

273
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
listening.

274
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Sure.

275
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
I got on the hook immediately.

276
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Okay.

277
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
All right.

278
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:28,040
I have been brainstorming quite a bit and really thinking about how I want to present

279
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,440
my knowledge, my understanding to the public, what the most important thing for me to do

280
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
is.

281
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,600
And a lot of what I'm going to be covering in parts of the broadcast that you've heard

282
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,840
before, a lot of it you're not going to have heard.

283
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,840
And I really just think it's important that I cut right to the chase up front here before

284
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,680
I tell you who's coming up today and get to it all.

285
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,400
So for my ears, I hear this as Alex saying, let's cut through the bullshit.

286
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Yeah.

287
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,040
Look, I got to shoot straight with you.

288
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah.

289
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Yeah.

290
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
It's time.

291
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Look, I'm 20 years into this.

292
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
It's finally time.

293
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,880
Some of this stuff I've said before, some of it I have not, but it will all be my hand

294
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
to God's ears.

295
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,720
Of course, all will be revealed in the fullness of time.

296
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Yeah.

297
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,120
And actually, see, you're saying that like he's been on air for 20 years and he's been

298
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
fucking around.

299
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Right.

300
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
That's not actually true.

301
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
It sounded like it.

302
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,360
Right before we went live about five minutes before, I just got hit with an extreme clarity

303
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,920
of what I was to go on air and talk about from all the knowledge information we have.

304
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,920
And just you call it a vision, but really it's like a computer program that's been working

305
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,900
on a problem, working on a problem.

306
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,080
And then suddenly it's completed the problem.

307
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,060
Sometimes it takes longer than the computer thinks it will.

308
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,060
Sometimes it happens quicker.

309
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,640
Wait, the computer thinks?

310
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,880
It's like completion in the bell dings and the answer comes sliding out and it was just

311
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,120
a whole nother level of exactly what they're going to do, how they're going to do it, how

312
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
they're operating.

313
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Okay.

314
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,400
So, again, Alex has had a moment of clarity.

315
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,960
You know, here's what I was thinking.

316
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Every single day.

317
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
You know what I was thinking?

318
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,640
This is the first time in a long time that we have taken some time off and Alex hasn't.

319
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,360
So part of me was like, I wonder what he was thinking.

320
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,600
Like I got free reign now.

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
I don't have to worry about shit.

322
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Yeah.

323
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Parents aren't home.

324
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Yeah, exactly.

325
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,480
Now the kids can play all they want.

326
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Hey, Dan and Jordan aren't listening, so I'm going to speak freely.

327
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Yeah, exactly.

328
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
I'm going to cut through the bullshit.

329
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,040
Now it's time to cut through the bullshit.

330
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,480
I wouldn't think that was what was on his mind.

331
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
No, sure.

332
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm sure.

333
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,120
By now, at 27 years, he's realized that recordings exist.

334
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Doesn't matter.

335
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Yeah.

336
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Yeah.

337
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,160
It's just, I can't stand this asshole every single day having a vision.

338
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I've had a new vision.

339
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,200
Oh my God.

340
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,000
It was like finally all the pieces clicked into place.

341
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,040
Like you can't do this every day.

342
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,080
I do like that the computer thinks it's going to be over sooner, but unfortunately the computer

343
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,000
took a little bit longer than it was expecting.

344
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,880
Hey man, I mean you're joking around about that, but I have been in a situation where

345
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,240
let's say I'm downloading a game off the PlayStation network.

346
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Sure.

347
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,640
And it says it's 33% done.

348
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,960
And then it says it's going to be done in 30 minutes, then check back in, 40 minutes.

349
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
40 minutes.

350
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
I mean, who knows?

351
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,480
What was that computer thinking?

352
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,080
All of these computers tell you what they're thinking and it turns out what they're thinking

353
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,040
is wrong.

354
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
It's terrible.

355
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,880
You know, do robots dream of being late for work?

356
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,120
That's what I was thinking.

357
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Yep.

358
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Yep.

359
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,720
Do robots dream of excuses for tardiness?

360
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,640
So here's the deal.

361
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,920
I think this is what Alex's vision or his new bit of clarity is about.

362
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,760
It has to do with the globalists and their new plan.

363
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,200
Mic down for this because it's absurd.

364
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:55,280
The headline I wrote right after I sat there in my office for about a minute staring at

365
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:04,060
the desk is on screen, transcendent transmission.

366
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:12,760
The scientific dictatorship controlling earth is preparing to launch the great lie or the

367
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,380
greatest of lies.

368
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:23,040
And that is to obscure the great truth that is already happening.

369
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:31,040
And that is our human psyche piercing the veil and connecting in an even stronger way

370
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,720
with God and basically mass telekinesis.

371
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,760
And that's what the system's trying to suppress.

372
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay.

373
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
All right.

374
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,720
Now that's a stinger.

375
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,400
That is a stinger right there.

376
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
All right.

377
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
All right.

378
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
All right.

379
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,240
So the globalists are planning something in order to distract from the fact that we've

380
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,280
connected with God and now we can move objects with our minds?

381
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Correct.

382
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,680
Here's, here's my problem.

383
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Here's my problem.

384
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
All right.

385
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
We live in the future.

386
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Yeah.

387
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,800
So I know that despite him saying that the real goal is mass telekinesis, the next day

388
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,240
he's going to be like Fauci released emails like, Oh, would you, there are higher levels

389
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,920
if you've got mass telekinesis on the way.

390
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,640
Well, I want to be clear about something too, because I'm not an idiot.

391
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,040
I know that he means telepathy.

392
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Sure.

393
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Yeah, of course.

394
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Of course.

395
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Of course.

396
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Yeah.

397
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,920
You can, you can find connections in that kind of thing.

398
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Yeah.

399
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Yeah.

400
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
You can, you can speak without speaking.

401
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
So right.

402
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Right.

403
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,280
The way you talked about like how he and Trump have a telepathic connection and like, yeah,

404
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
that's what he means.

405
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,840
But he just says telekinesis and imagining like that, that that's what he meant is hilarious.

406
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes.

407
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh, that's like, that's like Isaac Asimov.

408
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,160
Like all of a sudden our brains just grow a little bit bigger in the right spot.

409
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,480
And it's like, yeah, of course we can move shit with our minds.

410
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Yeah.

411
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
I think it was just misspeaking.

412
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,560
And I know that it is, but it's consistent.

413
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,960
We already have mass telekinesis.

414
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,240
Everybody knows it.

415
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Every woman knows it.

416
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,560
Particularly there's even stronger and it it's here and it's not just telekinesis with

417
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
each other.

418
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Obviously.

419
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Sure.

420
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Obviously.

421
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
So the telekinesis is getting a lot stronger.

422
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Of course.

423
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,520
Whatever reason our genetic development talks to the environment, whatever it is.

424
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,520
The globalists know this, they want to control it and they want to keep the public from understanding

425
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
it.

426
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Okay.

427
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
All right.

428
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,560
I can't get over him saying telekinesis.

429
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,640
Like seven times?

430
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,080
Like the fact that like just saying the word and then saying, obviously women have it stronger.

431
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,280
Like, oh, that's just so good.

432
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,200
That's such a dumb thing to say.

433
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,660
I also like if you take him just literally at his words and don't, you're not giving

434
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,000
the generosity of understanding like he means telepathy.

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,360
Like it's telekinesis, but not just with each other.

436
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Like we can only lift each other.

437
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Exactly.

438
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Yes.

439
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Yes.

440
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Of course.

441
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
It's so fun.

442
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Yeah.

443
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,080
So I think what Alex is gonna get to, I think the point he's trying to make is that humans

444
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,820
have this telepathic connection because of a connection with God and the globalists don't

445
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
like that.

446
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
They want to control it.

447
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,540
And in order to control it, they're going to come up with a big lie.

448
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,720
And I think the big lie that he's going to say is aliens are going to be revealed.

449
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Sure.

450
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,160
And this is what he's getting at because he says this, and I mean, this is just childhood's

451
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
end.

452
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,600
This is really just the book that he read when he was a child.

453
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Oh boy.

454
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,680
The different great lies that they're going to launch is going to be alien transmissions

455
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
first.

456
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Sure.

457
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Aliens are going to be communicating with the earth.

458
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,440
You'll be told these are aliens and then, oh, we already had contact and they gave us

459
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,840
technology and that's really where all this came from and all the upheaval and the Pope

460
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,680
will endorse it and say that's our God and this is our group and this is what they want

461
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
us to do.

462
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,840
And then, oh, there's all these new technologies where you can cure cancer and cure all these

463
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
things.

464
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,480
You've just got to accept and do what these entities want who aren't ready to reveal themselves

465
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
yet.

466
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,760
That's just the plot of childhood zone.

467
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Yeah.

468
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Yep.

469
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
That's basically it.

470
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,420
The aliens that come down and say that we can't reveal ourselves for 50 years until

471
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,360
you're used to us being here because they look like our conception of demons.

472
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Sure.

473
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Sure.

474
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,860
No, I mean, no, the only person who can break through the illusion is obviously Rowdy Roddy

475
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Piper.

476
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,320
You know, naturally that's the way it's got to go.

477
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
Or our generation's Rowdy Roddy Piper.

478
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
Alex Jones.

479
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Yes, of course.

480
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Of course.

481
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Yes.

482
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Yes.

483
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,220
So the aliens are going to come down, they're going to give the Pope all these messages

484
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,080
and they're not going to reveal themselves because they didn't in the book.

485
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,560
Is the Pope still in jail in this scenario?

486
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,280
Is that a tough question?

487
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,800
I feel like I stumped you.

488
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I've flummoxed.

489
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Yes.

490
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,000
To be fair, I don't know if Alex is talking to Steve.

491
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Sure.

492
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sure.

493
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay.

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's fair.

495
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's fair.

496
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's not a problem for him at this point.

497
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay.

498
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
So the plan is then once the Pope is doing all this stuff and telling people they have

499
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,400
to listen to the aliens in order to get this technology or something, then there's a threat.

500
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Okay.

501
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,040
All these wonders will be this leader who is able to talk to them and if you just do

502
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,480
what he says, well then everything's going to be okay.

503
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,120
And then we'll learn that this is one of the scenarios they've got so they can play different

504
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,280
ones at different times or all at once, that there's bad aliens coming and we've got to

505
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,760
do some certain things to stop them.

506
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
So there's bad aliens that are going to be coming.

507
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
Saint Mantis being or shut the fuck up.

508
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
That's what I have to say.

509
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,320
If you say bad aliens, you say fucking non-pliadians.

510
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,520
I'm not fucking around with just alien anymore.

511
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,440
What kind of animal do they look like?

512
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Exactly.

513
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,240
Are these the mercantile dogs?

514
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
What are we talking about?

515
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,920
I need some specificity in order for this to be any fun.

516
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Exactly.

517
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,520
We've been too far past the aliens are fun.

518
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
I've seen people do this better.

519
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Yes, exactly.

520
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,560
Also I thought the plan was plan B and they were just going to give a super bio weapon

521
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,900
in order to kill everyone off.

522
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,080
Why do they need to do that?

523
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,160
Now it's all about theater, Dan.

524
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,640
It's about pageantry, you know, give people a show.

525
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,540
It's bread and circus, man.

526
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
That's what it's about.

527
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,940
Then you blow them up.

528
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,240
If the globalists have a plan that was directed to them by the devil that involves a super

529
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,880
bio weapon release that'll kill off the population.

530
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,160
Why do they need to fake an alien landing to get people to do things?

531
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,440
I think we're living in a galactic make a wish scenario.

532
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,720
We're all about to die.

533
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,280
So aliens are trying to give us a good run before we go.

534
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,800
It makes as much sense as anything Alex is saying.

535
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Exactly.

536
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
No, it doesn't.

537
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Does not make sense.

538
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
No.

539
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,920
So I guess that's the big revelation that Alex had because that's when he starts the

540
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
first segment off.

541
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Why not?

542
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Yep.

543
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Yep.

544
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,800
And then you have some other really big news that he undersells.

545
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
This is huge news.

546
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,060
Frankenstein, the archetype of the mad scientist, chopping different pieces of humans together

547
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:01,160
and running a high powered electricity through it and reanimating a corpse.

548
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,640
Well now they're actually able to do things very, very similar to that in the real world

549
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,960
so many times.

550
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,720
What humans envisioned hundreds and even thousands of years ago, we are now able to build and

551
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,560
we're able to build it on a mass scale.

552
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,200
But great power comes with all of that.

553
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
Sure.

554
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Yeah.

555
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
So we've conquered death.

556
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Well, only a little bit.

557
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,040
See, what has to happen is you have to play music and then the body will be kind of ambulatory

558
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,760
in a little dance-y way towards the source of that music.

559
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
You know what I'm saying?

560
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Sure.

561
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
This is a Weekend at Bernie's 2 scenario.

562
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Okay.

563
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,120
The Weekend at Bernie's 1, we're past that.

564
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,560
Weekend at Bernie's is really kind of like the evolution of human technology towards

565
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
death.

566
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,080
Well, I mean, I dread Alex seeing that movie and thinking it's a documentary.

567
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
It seems a little bit like it.

568
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Maybe he has.

569
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Yeah.

570
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
It seems a little bit like it.

571
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Yeah.

572
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,800
So Frankenstein is real cool.

573
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,360
I don't know where the bottom is in terms of, like, there's just things that I could

574
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,640
say as a joke that he thinks.

575
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
Sure.

576
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
No, he does actually.

577
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
No, no, no.

578
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
He actually is suggesting these things.

579
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,360
I mean, he's going through the universal monsters kind of area, you know?

580
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,240
We've already got Dracula's, right?

581
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,400
We've already got Frankenstein's.

582
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,040
I think mummies are next.

583
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,560
He's just trying to create the monster mash.

584
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,640
He's just trying to...

585
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,160
He's just trying to convince people that that graveyard smash is real.

586
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,760
It's the monster mash, plan B. Everyone dies.

587
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
That's the monster...

588
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,040
There was the monster swim was the second one that Boris Pickett made.

589
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,480
I believe Black Tuesday is called the monster stark market crash.

590
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Stark market...

591
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Ah, damn it.

592
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
I blew it.

593
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
There was a...

594
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, so he had a follow-up called the monster swim.

595
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,120
Yes, that's true.

596
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,880
And then years later, he had the climate mash.

597
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,080
I think he had the birthday mash.

598
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,420
I think he went hard, yeah.

599
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
He did a bunch.

600
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,480
None of them worked out except for the monster mash.

601
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,720
It is a little bit like if Cisco had done just various colors of the thong song, like

602
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
black thong to thong thong thong, and then just released one next month.

603
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:22,400
Or a song about a negligee or different items of underwear.

604
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,920
I could see him doing that.

605
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,320
I watched that making of the song video on YouTube.

606
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,720
There's a documentary series about these hits and how they came to be, and I saw the one

607
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,600
about Cisco's the thong song, and I could see him making a series of songs about different

608
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
undergarments.

609
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Why not?

610
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Yeah.

611
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Why not?

612
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Everything else he's tried hasn't worked.

613
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Give it a go.

614
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,320
So Alex is a little bit bent out of shape about stem cells.

615
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,640
It's like paint by numbers, you ever see those you buy at the art store for like five bucks

616
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,360
and it's got the little ink or markers that come with it, you just fill in the little

617
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,740
numbers like it says, then you finally see the big picture.

618
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:06,960
And so I've just been here on air for 27 years researching for more than 30, and I just started

619
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,240
painting by the numbers, looking at what they were really doing.

620
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,080
And I really learned that when you got to white paper levels and international discussions,

621
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
that you'll hear a headline about, oh, stem cells.

622
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,520
A stem cell means a 150 pound humanoid, a human chimpanzee clone.

623
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,600
That doesn't sound true, but I could be wrong.

624
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Stem cell.

625
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
That's a stem cell, man.

626
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,200
I just don't think so.

627
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Nope.

628
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,720
Sometimes he doesn't paint by the numbers and gets a green unicorn.

629
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
Yeah, it's pretty.

630
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Yeah.

631
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
See, that's the thing about paint by numbers.

632
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,240
You got to follow the rules or else you come up with the wrong picture.

633
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Yeah.

634
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Yeah.

635
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Yeah.

636
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,800
Why does this just look like brown?

637
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Aww.

638
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Yeah.

639
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,160
Paint by numbers is ostensibly creative, but it's also the least creative thing in the

640
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
world.

641
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Yeah.

642
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Because there, if you want the actual picture.

643
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
It's already there.

644
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah.

645
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
There's numbers.

646
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
No.

647
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,560
In the abstract, it exists without you.

648
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,640
You can just imagine that those colors are already there.

649
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
You're supposed to.

650
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
Also, if you're an adult, you can usually tell what the picture is even without coloring

651
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
it in.

652
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
That's true.

653
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
You've been there before.

654
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Yes.

655
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Yeah.

656
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,320
So humans, 150 pounds in a cage, that's a stem cell.

657
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,600
And this is important because there was just that bill that went through Congress.

658
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Yes.

659
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Failed to pass.

660
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah.

661
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
And they go on to say rules on stem cells.

662
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,320
And stem cells are defined as anything that comes from a baby or you can say stem cells

663
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,960
are in fat tissue and other things like that.

664
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,060
But the point is, we're having a debate about stem cells, and what we're talking about is

665
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,220
growing humans or humanoids in labs.

666
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,460
That's the definition here.

667
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,800
And they admit it all right here, and then it gets better.

668
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,840
There's video of this.

669
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Here's the article.

670
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,440
48 to 49, Senate defeats Braun, Republican Indiana amendment to prohibit certain types

671
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,040
of human-animal chimeras.

672
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,920
Sixty votes were needed, but it didn't pass.

673
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
So did you hear that?

674
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,320
It's legal right now to create human-animal hybrids because there's laws against human

675
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,020
clones.

676
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,960
So there's two things that are going on that Alex is kind of playing with and conflating

677
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
in this episode when he's talking about this.

678
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
There's one is the bill that got defeated in the Senate.

679
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,200
That was an attempt by the GOP to criminalize genetic research that involved creating embryos

680
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,880
that were chimeric.

681
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,520
And from what I understand, a good thing that did not pass because it seems like it was

682
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,120
a little bit of a Trojan horsey.

683
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,600
Yeah, it was an excuse to just, something about abortion, you know, it always goes back

684
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
to that.

685
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,160
Also, so the other thing that he's conflating this with is a recent move that was made by

686
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,260
the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

687
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,760
They loosened their rules about how long a human embryo can be used in experiments.

688
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Previously, they had a standard policy that studies that went beyond 14 days would absolutely

689
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,240
not be done.

690
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,160
But now reflecting advances in technology, they say that these experiments could possibly

691
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,360
done to quote Stat News, quote, only if lots of conditions are met first.

692
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,000
Sure, sure.

693
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,320
We're not going to suddenly have horse people drawing our cars around.

694
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
That's we're going to be fine.

695
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,680
So yeah, there's this, Alex is freaking out about these chimeras and what have you, and

696
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,040
it leads him to go to break.

697
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,280
Pretty extreme, pretty extreme.

698
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,360
They're figuring out how to lock you down, how to train you to behave so they can kill

699
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
everybody.

700
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,940
Everybody stay in your houses while that happens, while combat robots go up and down the streets.

701
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,840
And so this isn't something that they're just thinking about doing.

702
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,720
This is all set up very, very soon.

703
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,400
You and your family will be killed soon.

704
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Two years, five years.

705
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
I don't know.

706
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,920
The timeline's moving quick, but if we don't hold them back, everyone listening is dead.

707
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,000
Okay.

708
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,220
They're going to kill you.

709
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
They're going to kill me.

710
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
They're going to kill everybody.

711
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
We'll be right back.

712
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Stay with us.

713
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,220
That's a bummer.

714
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
That's bad.

715
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
That's bad.

716
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:11,240
To some extent, you know, we live in kind of a fairly mundane world.

717
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,040
To suddenly go from that to like, oh, there's robots in the streets and chimeras in my home.

718
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,680
I think that would be at least a little bit more exciting.

719
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:26,640
Four days ago, I was having a fun hot dog and on San Sui Beach, I come back and I got

720
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,720
to hear Alex saying that everyone's dead.

721
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,000
Everyone's dead.

722
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's a jarring.

723
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,060
It's a bit of whiplash.

724
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
You doing all right?

725
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,600
Yeah, because I think this is stupid.

726
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,000
I do see your neck perpetually at a 45 degree angle right now, so that might be trouble.

727
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah.

728
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah.

729
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,160
It's, you know, there's that standard thing about like, you know, if you just keep moving,

730
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,080
it's not hard to keep moving, but when you stop, then you start moving again.

731
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,240
It's like, whoa.

732
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Object at rest.

733
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah.

734
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,360
I think that Alex is obviously full of shit and everything, but it is, it is a little

736
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,400
bit, it's a little bit a nude after a week of not listening to him to come back and hear

737
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,320
like you and your family, everybody listening to the show will be dead within five years

738
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,440
if we don't stop my enemies.

739
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,040
It's comically overt.

740
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,720
It's like when I take time off, I start to doubt myself.

741
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,400
I start to doubt these like, ah, Alex isn't as crazy as I think he is.

742
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,920
It can't be real.

743
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
It cannot be real.

744
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,480
It's not like he says within two to five years, everyone listening will be dead.

745
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Like come back.

746
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,760
Nope, that's exactly what he does.

747
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,240
No, it makes you realize how like, I totally get, when you're, when you've been doing this

748
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,720
nonstop for a long time, you know, you forget how real people react to this kind of stuff

749
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,320
where they're like, you're the one who's a conspiracy theorist.

750
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,640
There's no way that anyone would get away with that.

751
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,920
And then you come back and you're like, I'm a conspiracy theorist.

752
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,280
This can't be real.

753
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,280
This can't be real.

754
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,360
So how do we, how do we discuss this next clip?

755
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Let's see.

756
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,920
Um, the globalists, right?

757
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Sure.

758
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
They have a plan.

759
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Yeah.

760
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Heard it.

761
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
They have a lot of plans.

762
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
At least two.

763
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,160
Apparently super bio weapon kill off.

764
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Sure.

765
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,080
Maybe that's plan A and B. Plan C involves aliens coming down and not

766
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,400
revealing themselves through the post.

767
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,920
Then telling us that there's bad aliens that are coming and we've got to do something in

768
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,120
order to stop the bad aliens that will be counterproductive to us.

769
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Who knows?

770
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Yeah.

771
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Turns out there's a plan D.

772
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Oh no.

773
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
And that is that they're going to replace us with computers.

774
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Oh, that's nice.

775
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,920
But I mean, it's really very simple.

776
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,680
What humans can envision, we can end up building.

777
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:53,320
And what we've gotten to at this point is free energy, massive live extension, super

778
00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:00,160
computers, way more powerful than what you're currently even aware exist.

779
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,400
And the decisions have been made to basically go ahead and go operational with a system

780
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:12,120
that will make us obsolete, obsolete in their words, these computers won't recognize beauty.

781
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,400
These computers won't have our ancient history.

782
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,880
These computers didn't create the computers like we did, but there is a dark anti-human

783
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,440
force pushing this.

784
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:38,600
And by the way, I could have opened the whole show up and just made this very, very simple.

785
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,760
And that's, we're being replaced.

786
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,800
I know that Alex is talking about robots, but still when I hear somebody who has the

787
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,760
politics that Alex has worrying about, we are going to be replaced.

788
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,600
It kind of, you know, it exists in a certain linguistic space.

789
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,760
It's something that isn't without baggage.

790
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Yeah.

791
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,160
You know, the way he's talking is like a person in like the early eighties who was like, computers

792
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,480
are the devil.

793
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,960
You know, computers are going to the soul, but the devil's mark.

794
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
But we don't live there.

795
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,280
He uses computers all the time.

796
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:24,280
He lives in a world where computers are perfectly fine and people are evil, you know, or the

797
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,000
people he wants to tell you are evil.

798
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,440
Computers are ethically neutral.

799
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Yes, exactly.

800
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Yeah.

801
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Yeah.

802
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Yeah.

803
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
I don't know.

804
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,680
I just get, I just get a little worried.

805
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,400
Fears of replacement are generally not, they're not good openings.

806
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,220
Well, you know, what comes after that is usually bad.

807
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,840
It's a little bit like the space racism we deal with where it's like, oh, they're evil

808
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
cat beings.

809
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,800
But you're like, that's code for something else.

810
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,540
Like when the great replacement theory, you can't just be like, nah, nah, nah, nah.

811
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,720
It's computers that we're worried about and not have me be like, is this Jews again?

812
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,160
I feel like this is Jews again, you know?

813
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,000
And I know that Alex doesn't really care that much about workers rights, so it couldn't

814
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,760
really be a conversation about like automation in the workplace.

815
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Totally.

816
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
No, it's not like there's, we need more grocery people.

817
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Yeah.

818
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Yeah.

819
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I don't know.

820
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,760
It's just, it's a word that I don't like hearing.

821
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,440
So we have one, one more thing here about the globalist, okay.

822
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,340
And the globalist argument is if you don't resist this under survival of the fittest

823
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:33,760
and social Darwinism, you deserve what happens to you.

824
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,880
And so it's all about humans being a commodity, mass smuggling of children for sex abuse,

825
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,440
for slave labor.

826
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:50,280
But really it's about committing crimes in God's eyes, having you do nothing so that

827
00:33:50,280 --> 00:34:00,260
the spiritual hedge of protection can be removed from us so that everyone can be attacked.

828
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:08,560
And so this is very sophisticated interdimensional galactic warfare.

829
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,960
And that's what you face.

830
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Oh boy.

831
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,240
Tough, tough to wrestle with that.

832
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Is it?

833
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
No.

834
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
It's not.

835
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
He's so confident.

836
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,480
I feel like I need to ask.

837
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Yeah.

838
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
That's part of the trick.

839
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
That is true.

840
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Yeah.

841
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,240
So the first thought that he has there is that the globalist believe if you don't fight,

842
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,080
you deserve what happens to you.

843
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,720
That's essentially just something to be cribbed from Silent Weapons from Quiet Wars, which

844
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,640
is the first chapter in Bill Cooper's book, Behold a Pale Horse, that the globalist believe

845
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,120
you're a meat on the plate.

846
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Sure.

847
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
You're never meant to be slaughtered.

848
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Yes.

849
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
That kind of thing.

850
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Yeah.

851
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,560
And then the second part is just that if you don't defend God's law, then you make us all

852
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,160
susceptible to God's punishment, which the only thing that could really lead towards

853
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
is a theocracy, right?

854
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
It has to.

855
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,440
I mean, a complete civilization that's designed entirely around adherence to strict religious

856
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
rule.

857
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Yeah.

858
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
You know.

859
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
That's not good.

860
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,680
religious rules are really great when they're in power and allowed to kind of go unchecked.

861
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,120
Everybody knows that from history.

862
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,480
I just hear nonsense here.

863
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Also.

864
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Was the interdimensional galactic warfare part a little bit nonsense or was that the

865
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,440
part where you're like, wow, we don't need to worry about that, obviously.

866
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
That's true.

867
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,620
I mean, that's the closest to like, I'll let it slide.

868
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:37,400
It's arguably hyperbole, you know, it's like, I mean, I know he's not speaking metaphorically,

869
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,760
but you could hear that and be like, eh, whatever.

870
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,960
The other stuff is just like contextually weird.

871
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Yeah.

872
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:51,720
I don't, if Alex believes that doing things that are against his religious rules make

873
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,400
everybody susceptible to God's wrath because God removes the hedge of protection, then

874
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,380
the only way to keep everyone safe is to make sure that everyone is forcibly adhering to

875
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,020
God's rules according to his version of God.

876
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:14,560
And to me, I find that to be an incredibly fucked up way to conceive of how society should

877
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
be organized.

878
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Yeah.

879
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,920
I mean, the ironic part about it, I think is something similar in practice is what we

880
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,080
all tried to do to defeat a disease to a certain extent.

881
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Do you know what I mean?

882
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:35,560
Like we have to, we have to allow a certain amount of like, oh, we are locking down in

883
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,160
order to keep, you know, if everybody, if people don't act in everybody's interest,

884
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,880
then the susceptibility of that disease is spread throughout everybody.

885
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,720
So he's fine with the tactics of, I think, I think, you know what I'm saying?

886
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,320
I think your thought is interesting and I do see a little bit of a parallel.

887
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,560
I'm not saying it's one to one, of course.

888
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Yeah.

889
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,520
And I think what I think is most interesting about Alex's conception is the divine rat.

890
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,000
Yes.

891
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,600
As opposed to the actual genomic rat.

892
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Yes.

893
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,480
The actual causally determinative chain of events.

894
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,840
The obvious wrath.

895
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Yeah.

896
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Yeah.

897
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
I don't know.

898
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,200
I don't, I don't feel like it's possible for Alex to contain this kind of thinking

899
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,040
and this, this idea set and also actually believe in the first amendment.

900
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
That's true.

901
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,640
You can actually believe in freedom of religion if you believe that breaking God's rules makes

902
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,040
the hedge of protection go away.

903
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Wow.

904
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,280
I mean, one of the commandments is you should have no other God than me.

905
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Sure.

906
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,840
You're breaking a commandment if you follow another religion or you don't follow a religion.

907
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Totally.

908
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,280
I mean, how could you follow, how could you believe in freedom of speech if the government

909
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,800
has to, I guess, murder you for taking the Lord's name in vain?

910
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
You know what I'm saying?

911
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,880
The penalty for sin is death, obviously.

912
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,800
It would be, it would be a challenge, certainly, to believe in a republic.

913
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,300
It would take some work.

914
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,000
I think we're seeing a little bit of some flaws.

915
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah.

916
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,360
So Alex has a guest and I just think this is hilarious.

917
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,680
We're not going to talk about him at all, but I think it's really hilarious that this

918
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,720
dude is showing up after the beginning of this bullshit and still expecting to be taken

919
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
seriously.

920
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,640
All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and James O'Keefe is just getting into the

921
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
studio.

922
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Put the sports jacket on, I think.

923
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,000
We're going to get him here on in a moment.

924
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,240
Really big breaking news, but please don't forget that it's listeners and viewers like

925
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,600
you that make this broadcast possible and all the incredible breaking news that we bring

926
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,160
out is just critical to all of our futures and the future of our species and all our

927
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
children.

928
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
So I thank you for your support.

929
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,560
We have a big Memorial Day special to honor the veterans and folks that have served.

930
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,360
So yeah, we got James O'Keefe coming up.

931
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Sure.

932
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,840
James, would you like to talk about how Frankenstein is real?

933
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Yeah.

934
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Um, actually...

935
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,960
Hey, James, you're a real serious reporter.

936
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,880
Let's talk about mass telekinesis.

937
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,480
He did an undercover sting operation inside of Frankenstein's castle, actually.

938
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
You know what's ironic?

939
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,480
He could actually do an amazing sting operation on Alex.

940
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,640
Yes, he really could.

941
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
He really could.

942
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,520
If he just brought a hidden camera into a regular conversation with Alex, he would get

943
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
everything.

944
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,440
Perfectly situated to sting the shit out of Alex.

945
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,640
God damn it.

946
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
God damn it.

947
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Somebody...

948
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
He can be turned, right?

949
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
He can be turned from the dark side.

950
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
It's just a matter of money.

951
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Yeah, right?

952
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,960
Just give him two billion and he'll be like, yeah, I'll fucking kill Alex Jones' career.

953
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
I don't care.

954
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
God, I wish that would happen.

955
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
That'd be interesting at least.

956
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,480
Yeah, we gotta get a billionaire on our side to just throw money at fake people.

957
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,240
The further irony, though, is that if he did sting Alex, I don't think I would believe

958
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
it.

959
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,400
I couldn't trust it because it's still coming from him.

960
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,960
Ah, the dangers of lost credibility.

961
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Yep.

962
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
So I don't care.

963
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,480
Alex O'Keefe has a, I guess, another Facebook story.

964
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I don't care.

965
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Whatever.

966
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Whatever.

967
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,760
And one of the reasons I don't care is because Alex has an interesting story to tell.

968
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,240
They've gone from this all being in white papers and textbooks and, you know, very low

969
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,720
circulation books that these, you know, Zbigniew Brzezinski and people like Klaus Schwab would

970
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,760
write in the past and John P. Holdren and...

971
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Real quick.

972
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,720
John P. Holdren's book, Ecoscience, wasn't a low circulation book.

973
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
It was a textbook.

974
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,720
Yeah.

975
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Yeah.

976
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
It's not like...

977
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
It wasn't a mass market paperback that failed.

978
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
It wasn't like a flop.

979
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,720
It was the front of like Barnes and Noble trying to push Holdren to Ecoscience.

980
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Yeah, exactly.

981
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Yes.

982
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

983
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,480
The rest of them, David Rockefeller, Club of Rum documents, secret documents.

984
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,320
I was given a whole bunch of archive secret documents out of the Bilderberg Group, out

985
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,560
of the Senate archives that pulled up a motorcycle in Virginia when I was covering Bilderberg

986
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,000
there and just said, here, have this.

987
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,760
And it was all how in the 60s, the Bilderberg Group took over the US unions for the deindustrialization

988
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,480
project and explaining why they were going to deindustrialize the US.

989
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,320
And we published them on Infowars and no one even cared.

990
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,200
Probably because you got them from a random guy on a motorcycle.

991
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,400
So a random guy on a motorcycle handed me papers and people don't believe me.

992
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,520
It's basically Deep Throat, isn't it?

993
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,200
You meet in a parking garage or a random dude on a motorcycle drives up towards you.

994
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,440
No big deal.

995
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,960
It's like the Yakuza dropped off some papers.

996
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Yeah.

997
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,840
I think that this is probably just like John Birch Society-esque literature and ideas because

998
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:45,240
it's talking about just like infiltrating the unions, obviously there's workers kind

999
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,080
of ideas of unionization or something that are antithetical to the Patriot movement.

1000
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,720
So you might as well say that there's no point in unionization because it's also owned by

1001
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,520
or yeah, or it's infiltrated.

1002
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,360
Not only infiltrated, it's a plot in order to destroy America.

1003
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,920
Yeah, of course.

1004
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,520
So I just love the idea of Alex sitting there, some guy on a motorcycle comes up, he's like,

1005
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,800
I've got all the archives at the secret globe.

1006
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
He's just standing there in this circumstance?

1007
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,240
He's in Chantilly, Virginia, because I remember when he went there.

1008
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
I do, yeah.

1009
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,200
Also, I don't know, I mean, I've watched the video of him down there.

1010
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,920
Certainly a lot of the video of that is in one of his documentaries, I think.

1011
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
Yeah.

1012
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
Is it Endgame?

1013
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm not sure.

1014
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,360
I've definitely seen the video of him in Chantilly.

1015
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,640
I don't remember a guy on a motorcycle coming up and giving him an archive of secret globalist

1016
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,960
Bilderberg documents.

1017
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,040
I don't remember him going back to his hotel room and freaking out that some guy on a motorcycle

1018
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,240
gave him an archive.

1019
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Okay.

1020
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,320
Now, we're both imagining this.

1021
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,320
How is he holding these documents?

1022
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,760
Does he have a briefcase that's like handcuffed to his wrist and he has to go through a process

1023
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
to give it to him?

1024
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,080
Is he just wearing a messenger bag and he's like, ah, here you go.

1025
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,840
Is it like in Oceans 12 or whatever where the, you know?

1026
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,360
I'm guessing it was Daniel Estelan on a motorcycle and they just gave him his stupid book.

1027
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Yeah.

1028
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,680
So there's big news on the white supremacy front.

1029
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,800
And that is that Alex has found a triangle.

1030
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,480
And I mean, it's super interesting to have the overt white supremacy, socially unacceptable

1031
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,240
stuff written up by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL now being taught in more

1032
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,880
than 20 states.

1033
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:31,360
This particular one is from Maryland and Virginia and it says, fathers are a form of covert

1034
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,260
white supremacy.

1035
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,260
It says parental.

1036
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
Parental.

1037
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,260
Just parental.

1038
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,960
Right here it says parental.

1039
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm going to cover that later.

1040
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Here just zoom in on over here guys.

1041
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,160
Right here is the zoom in area.

1042
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,040
So what he's got is a triangle and it has like at the top there is a line.

1043
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,040
So there's a smaller triangle and then the bottom of the triangle.

1044
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,440
Smaller triangle is the unacceptable white supremacy and it's things like the Klan, lynchings,

1045
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
stuff like that.

1046
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,120
And then underneath is the more subtle, you know, it's like that iceberg metaphor.

1047
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,120
Underneath is the sort of covert forms of white supremacy and Alex thinks that fathers

1048
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
are one of them.

1049
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
Okay.

1050
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,880
However, I went and I watched the video because I can't find this triangle anywhere else and

1051
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,880
I'm like, I got to go find him.

1052
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,120
And I looked at it and it turns out Alex just doesn't know how to read.

1053
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Sure.

1054
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
He thinks it says parental.

1055
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
It says paternalism.

1056
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Oh God.

1057
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
Okay.

1058
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:31,360
Merriam-Webster defines paternalism as quote, a system under which an authority undertakes

1059
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,380
to supply needs or regulate conduct of those under its control and manners affecting them

1060
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,960
as individuals as well in their relations to authority and to each other.

1061
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,720
Paternalism is essentially believing that you can restrict another person or group's

1062
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,160
actions because you understand their own good better than them.

1063
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,900
Alex has no idea about the words, let alone concepts he's covering.

1064
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,080
He's taking a piece of paper that claims that paternalistic attitudes contribute to covert

1065
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,080
white supremacy.

1066
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,780
And the way he reports it is that the SPLC and ADL are saying that having fathers is

1067
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,780
white supremacist.

1068
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,420
This guy's a fucking idiot.

1069
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,460
That's a jump.

1070
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,720
That is a bit of a jump.

1071
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,360
But I honestly don't think he knows that it doesn't say parental.

1072
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,000
That would be most likely I would say.

1073
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah.

1074
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1075
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,360
It feels like he misread that, got mad about it.

1076
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,480
And whether or not he's realized he's wrong, it's too good for him not to be mad about

1077
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
it.

1078
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,480
Yeah, totally.

1079
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
It's embarrassing as hell.

1080
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,280
No, once he got what he wanted, I'm sure he never read it again.

1081
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Yeah.

1082
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,880
It's not like he was like, wait, I got to double check this.

1083
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
That's never happened.

1084
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
True.

1085
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Yeah.

1086
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Yeah.

1087
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Yeah.

1088
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
Whatever that is, is under attack.

1089
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
Sure.

1090
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,880
And you're like, well, that sounds crazy.

1091
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,880
Well, no, it's not crazy.

1092
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,640
They're getting rid of who would protect the family.

1093
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,640
Parentalism.

1094
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,000
I mean, parentalism isn't just supporting a father.

1095
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You can't keep saying it.

1096
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's supporting parents.

1097
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,880
You can't keep saying it.

1098
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,240
Parentalism is believing in the nuclear family.

1099
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,240
You can't invent it.

1100
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,880
And it says that's racist.

1101
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
That's not real.

1102
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,080
I'm not sure that parentalism is a widespread concept.

1103
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,480
I was thinking that he could have misspoken, but still understood the word.

1104
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,480
You know, like telekinesis.

1105
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Sure.

1106
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,680
When he was like, he's using the wrong word.

1107
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
He means telepathy.

1108
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
And then he went further.

1110
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
And said, parentalism.

1111
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,320
And he said, parentalism?

1112
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,680
And it's about parents.

1113
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,640
So we know for a fact, he does not understand what was being said.

1114
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,520
No, but I still think it could be an instance of him misreading the word and then never

1115
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,120
checking again.

1116
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Sure sure.

1117
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,120
Either way, it's embarrassing.

1118
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,120
It's pretty funny.

1119
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,440
But it is also like, yeah, I'm glad you brought that up, because it is so different than the

1120
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,440
other misuse of the word.

1121
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,440
Exactly.

1122
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,120
Like the telekinesis thing is just funny.

1123
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,360
It's like, okay, I get you mean telepathy.

1124
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
With telekinesis.

1125
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,000
Alex is creating parentalism as a thing to be mad about.

1126
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,560
Out of whole cloth.

1127
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,720
That may or may not be an actual word.

1128
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,960
I mean, I could find some uses of it online, but it's definitely not like a word people

1129
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
use.

1130
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
No, it's not.

1131
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,960
You don't find it cited in psychiatry papers.

1132
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:10,120
Covert rights supremacy would not have that as one of the things.

1133
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,960
Parentalistic attitudes, though.

1134
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,160
I mean, oh no, I did the Alex.

1135
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
Paternalistic.

1136
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Yes.

1137
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,340
I stopped him.

1138
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,340
My eyes went wide.

1139
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,080
I was like, what's going to happen now?

1140
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,080
Oh no.

1141
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,800
Alex got into my head.

1142
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,960
So most of the middle of the show, middle to end of the show, is about Alex, well, not

1143
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,480
most of it, but a good chunk is about Alex talking about Joe Biden, the president.

1144
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,480
Sure.

1145
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:46,400
Apparently he's blaming the victims of the Tuskegee experiments for black vaccine hesitancy.

1146
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,840
He's blaming the victim.

1147
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,080
Well that's what Alex says.

1148
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Okay.

1149
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,840
I have a hard time believing that, but let's continue.

1150
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,400
Well, here's Alex talking about it and then the clip of Biden that's used to rationalize

1151
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
this.

1152
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,400
Okay.

1153
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,160
Giving a speech today, Joe Biden blames black vaccine hesitancy on Tuskegee airmen.

1154
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,120
The first blacks since the civil war allowed in combat who did an excellent job.

1155
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,720
So he blamed black men, some of which had their families injected with syphilis that

1156
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,760
came out and killed or tortured over long periods of time, it's very painful.

1157
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,000
These were allowed to be infected overall by the tens of thousands that were injected.

1158
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,920
It wasn't just blacks that got it, it was everybody.

1159
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,200
And Joe Biden now blames them, the victims for what happened.

1160
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,800
You say, well, he's an old man.

1161
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Yeah.

1162
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,160
He should be, you know, at a nursing home, not molesting children, not molesting our

1163
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
country anymore.

1164
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:43,160
So here he is blaming the very blacks from Alabama, many and more from there, Tuskegee

1165
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,520
airmen who were victimized with a secret government experiment telling them it was a vaccine.

1166
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,840
For polio when it was syphilis now blaming them for what they did to him.

1167
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,680
So even as the demon in him just lies so much, you can't stop here.

1168
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:04,960
I asked one person to do nothing but deal with equity, equity, to make sure that we

1169
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,600
were reaching out into minority communities, which by the way, and many of the older members

1170
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,340
of that community had memories of experimentation on black Americans that were not told about

1171
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,680
like what happened to the Tuskegee airmen and all those tests.

1172
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,800
I shouldn't laugh.

1173
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
It's just so sick.

1174
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Yeah.

1175
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,320
The Tuskegee airmen, like when their souls were leaving their bodies, when they died,

1176
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,520
like Casper, the friendly ghost, they were sure flying high up.

1177
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,680
You killed him, huh?

1178
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,220
So what happened is that Biden kind of misspoke and he said Tuskegee airmen, which were the

1179
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,200
group of black fighter pilots in World War II, when he was referencing the Tuskegee experiments.

1180
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,760
This is an unfortunate gaffe and if Alex's point here was that Biden doesn't know the

1181
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,300
difference between the two uses of the word Tuskegee, I'd say that's probably a stretch,

1182
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,300
but whatever.

1183
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,300
I don't really care.

1184
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,300
Yeah.

1185
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,540
Using this clip to argue that Biden is blaming the victims of the experiment for vaccine

1186
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,460
hesitancy though, that's absurd.

1187
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
That's nonsense.

1188
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,780
I was listening to this clip.

1189
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:10,060
It's really, that doesn't say anything close to what Alex is suggesting.

1190
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:15,040
It's very clear that what Biden is saying is that the memory of this, of course, this

1191
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,260
stain on American history.

1192
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,260
Of course.

1193
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:24,800
This shame is what would contribute to people being hesitant to trust rollouts of large

1194
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,060
vaccine programs.

1195
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,780
That thought is, it makes sense.

1196
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,780
Yeah.

1197
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,780
And it's what he's expressing.

1198
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,740
No, it's Alex is not missing the point.

1199
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,980
He is like cutting the points, Achilles tendons, and then burying it alive in the backyard.

1200
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,420
Like this is, this is way, way out of control.

1201
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,420
Yeah.

1202
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,500
And then a little bit later, Alex makes the exact same mistake by of course, what's the

1203
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
name of that major rapper.

1204
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,540
I listened to him in the eighties, but I told my wife that this rap group that does these

1205
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,540
pro vaccines.

1206
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,540
She didn't believe until she saw it.

1207
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,540
Who are they?

1208
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,540
What's the name of the rapper?

1209
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,540
I forget.

1210
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,540
It's super famous.

1211
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,540
Run DMC.

1212
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:07,660
They've got a new one where it shows Tuskegee airmen and our Tuskegee folks and says, yeah,

1213
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,020
we injected you, but we don't do that anymore.

1214
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,020
We don't do experiments anymore when it is an experiment.

1215
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,340
I mean, Alex did the exact same slip that Biden did.

1216
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,200
It's an easy mistake to make.

1217
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,220
It's unacceptable in one circumstance.

1218
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,940
And if you do it like, Oh no, no, no, it was a mistake.

1219
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,100
You know, he, he was blaming them and I made a mistake.

1220
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,100
Yeah.

1221
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,100
Yeah.

1222
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,100
It's just a stupid game.

1223
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,100
Yeah.

1224
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:35,420
So Rand Paul, uh, he's, he's made some disparaging comments about Fauci at this point.

1225
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,420
Sure.

1226
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:41,140
And so Alex believes that he's going head to head with the enemy and maybe that means

1227
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,620
that he should be president.

1228
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:46,340
But Alex had a chance to support 2016 failed.

1229
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,340
Yeah.

1230
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,900
This is Rand Paul who deserves a lot of support on prayers.

1231
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,060
He's going directly at the enemy.

1232
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,380
It's why he's getting death threats.

1233
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,100
He's why he's been shot at twice, been physically attacked twice, twice had his ribs broken,

1234
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,100
his lungs punctured.

1235
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,700
That was a long argument and he has a good heart.

1236
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,700
Very presidential material.

1237
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,700
I'd like to see him president in the future.

1238
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,660
Maybe him and his Santas make a nice mix.

1239
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,300
But I don't care if there were two black guys or two women, I don't give a damn.

1240
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,900
There were two black women like those guys.

1241
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,900
I'd be all for them.

1242
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,780
Vote for them in one second.

1243
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,780
But yeah, they're two white males.

1244
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,780
I mean, who else, who else is there, folks?

1245
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,020
Don't give a damn about them being white.

1246
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:29,740
But the point is, is that, uh, you know, Bolsonaro's white, he's fighting the world order.

1247
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,380
I mean, I'm just saying, uh, get some black folks running for office, talking like them,

1248
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,380
I'll vote for them.

1249
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:42,180
Uh, but, uh, can't believe we even have to have a discussion about that, about who cares

1250
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,180
what color somebody is.

1251
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,300
It's about getting the job done.

1252
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,560
But I digress.

1253
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,560
You do digress.

1254
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,560
That is true.

1255
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,660
You can't believe that we have that conversation?

1256
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,660
Yeah.

1257
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,460
You're the one who brought it up.

1258
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,020
Yeah, I certainly didn't.

1259
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,580
I wasn't like, I wonder if Bolsonaro's white.

1260
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,580
I didn't think that.

1261
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,540
I wasn't like, that's a question I need him to answer before he finishes this sentence.

1262
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,540
I did.

1263
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,540
That was not on the top of my mind.

1264
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,540
It wasn't there.

1265
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:09,700
It certainly wasn't also my first response that I would have to the idea of a Rand Paul

1266
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,100
DeSantis ticket.

1267
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Yeah.

1268
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,900
My primary complaint with them would not be, it's two white dudes.

1269
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,900
There's two white dudes.

1270
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,900
That's a big, yeah.

1271
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,620
I feel like there would be some policies that I would be, uh, really offended by first.

1272
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,760
Yeah.

1273
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,980
All I hear is Alex being like, baby, come back.

1274
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,580
You can blame it all on me.

1275
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,580
That's all I hear.

1276
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,780
It's, um, uh, oh, to Rand?

1277
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,780
Yeah.

1278
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,780
Yeah.

1279
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,780
Yeah.

1280
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,780
Man.

1281
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,900
It's, it's having gone through that, the disenchantment period with Rand Paul during

1282
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,780
the lead up to the 2016 election, it's pretty funny to hear him say stuff like this because

1283
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,820
he knows he blew it.

1284
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:54,480
Yeah, no, there's, there's just, you'll, you'll, he got off the Paul boat.

1285
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:01,800
I wish I could stop being at least a little bit surprised at how Craven, you know, no

1286
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,780
matter how Craven I see them, I'm still like, you're that Craven?

1287
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,060
Oh man.

1288
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,620
Just, well, in a week he's going to pretend that he didn't say that there's a fake alien

1289
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,580
invasion that's coming and they're going to not be able to reveal themselves and then

1290
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,100
they're going to tell us eventually bad aliens are coming.

1291
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,100
Totally.

1292
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,100
Yes.

1293
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,100
How can I be surprised?

1294
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,100
How can I be surprised?

1295
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,600
He expects you to not remember that a week ago he had a big revelation right before he

1296
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
got on air.

1297
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
Yeah.

1298
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,980
He's got a lot of revelations though.

1299
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,260
I think you just expect him to have.

1300
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,980
He's jangling keys the radio show.

1301
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,980
It's ridiculous.

1302
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,860
That'd be a fun, that'd be a more fun radio show to listen to.

1303
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,860
Certainly.

1304
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,860
Less ads.

1305
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,860
Yeah.

1306
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,020
Um, so he said a lot of extreme stuff on this episode.

1307
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,100
Some of it not as hateful as usual, some of it just kind of dumb.

1308
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,100
Right.

1309
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,660
Um, but you should know this.

1310
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,660
We discredit these guys.

1311
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,060
We send them to prison or they're going to kill everybody.

1312
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,060
It's us or them.

1313
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,060
Okay.

1314
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
Seriously.

1315
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,060
I mean every damn word I'm saying.

1316
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,060
Stay with us.

1317
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
It means everything.

1318
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,060
Stay with us.

1319
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,060
It means everything.

1320
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,820
Well, earlier in the show Alex had said that it's going to be open phones in the third

1321
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,820
and fourth hour.

1322
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,580
He's getting really pumped for it.

1323
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,580
Uh.

1324
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,580
Can I guess how many calls he takes?

1325
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,580
Yeah.

1326
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,580
So I'd love that.

1327
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,580
Three.

1328
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,580
Zero.

1329
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,580
Oh.

1330
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,580
Damn it.

1331
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,380
I was, I was really, I was really going out on a limb going more than zero.

1332
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,460
I kind of expected zero, but I was really hoping.

1333
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,380
I feel like whenever you take that bet, it should be zero or the field.

1334
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,740
Yes, exactly.

1335
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,660
The over under is one.

1336
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,660
Is point five.

1337
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,660
Yes, exactly.

1338
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,660
Yeah.

1339
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,660
Uh, yeah.

1340
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,660
So he takes none.

1341
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:39,140
Um, and apparently he couldn't have taken open phones in the fourth hour because initially

1342
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,660
he had Matt Bracken scheduled to host the fourth hour.

1343
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,660
Right, right, right, right.

1344
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,660
But apparently there were problems.

1345
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,660
Oh.

1346
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,660
Matt Bracken had some technical difficulties today.

1347
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:53,180
He does a great job when he hosts Thursday's fourth hour and he's, uh, can't do it.

1348
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,580
So Owen Schroyer's coming in in the fourth hour because I've got a bunch of things I'm

1349
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,580
working on.

1350
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,820
I don't want to host the fourth hour, but I've got big stories we're working on that

1351
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,460
are huge, very important behind the scenes.

1352
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,460
I'm gonna leave it at that.

1353
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,460
I'm gonna leave it at that.

1354
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,020
He had to go to family court.

1355
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,020
Yeah.

1356
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:13,460
Uh, so he's going fishing with my daughter.

1357
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:21,420
This is a, the night I believe that his ex wife was trying to live stream a court appearance

1358
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,420
on YouTube.

1359
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,420
Cool.

1360
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:28,540
Because as I understand, her argument is that these are supposed to be open here.

1361
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,540
Sure.

1362
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:35,940
And people should know what's going on, like what, what's, and so I, I would assume that

1363
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,380
that's more what was on Alex's mind than a big story.

1364
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,380
Yeah.

1365
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,140
He had this court date that was possibly going to be live streamed.

1366
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,900
Yeah, that would be, that would be somewhat, I think, terrifying for him.

1367
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,900
Yeah, I would think so.

1368
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1369
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,180
Uh, but look, that's, even at this point in the show, that's in the future.

1370
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,180
Yeah, sure.

1371
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:57,460
We have to worry about the now because now it's time to cover news.

1372
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,460
Okay.

1373
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,460
I got to hit all this.

1374
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:05,900
Um, I got a bunch of other huge COVID news as well, and some really scary stuff that

1375
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,900
makes me really mad.

1376
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:14,220
And also the abomination stuff, all this cloning because our cells are designed and the ancients

1377
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,700
said this, but now they've mathematically scientifically proven it to resonate with

1378
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,580
the universe that God made.

1379
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:25,100
Like we're a musical instrument and the atmosphere is a musical instrument and trees are a musical

1380
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,060
instrument is the best way to describe it.

1381
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:33,820
But energetically through the dimensions, it's like a sound wave is, is the easiest

1382
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,820
way to describe it.

1383
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,220
It's not what it is, but with our limited senses, it's like trying to teach Helen Keller

1384
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,260
how to read, write and talk when she couldn't hear and couldn't see, but she finally could

1385
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,780
figure it out because there was, it was innately in her.

1386
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,980
The archetypes were there, you know, being a very passionate, very well-spoken person

1387
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:56,020
through communication wild, but it could only, you know, took years to get through to her,

1388
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,020
but it was there.

1389
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:04,220
So trying to describe this in third dimensional terms is, uh, let's just say, uh, it's, it's

1390
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:12,140
limiting, but trying to describe what I, you know, you know, it's weird.

1391
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:17,220
It tastes like, I just don't know how it is.

1392
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:22,420
He could really somehow be offensive towards Helen Keller.

1393
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,620
Like Helen Keller didn't do any work.

1394
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:32,280
It's that the people broke through her, her defenses in order to get to what was already

1395
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,280
there inside.

1396
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,940
She had to do some work to minimize that.

1397
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,940
That's what he said.

1398
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:43,420
Oh, you're being offensive to her efforts that she redoubled and read, you know, like

1399
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:47,340
somehow out of nowhere, you're offensive to Helen Keller.

1400
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,340
Yeah, it is.

1401
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:53,040
It is a little, it's, it seems like a stray thought a little bit.

1402
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:59,020
And I would guess that the people who worked with Helen Keller wouldn't say like, damn

1403
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,020
just thing.

1404
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,020
It's lucky.

1405
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,020
The archetypes were there.

1406
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,020
No kidding.

1407
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,020
Yeah.

1408
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,060
I'm guessing that that wouldn't be the way that they would describe it.

1409
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,060
I doubt it.

1410
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:12,260
Um, so yeah, the universe, yeah.

1411
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,260
Musical instrument.

1412
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,260
Sure.

1413
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,080
I know that when I like, uh, was, I think it was in fourth grade, my parents made me

1414
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,900
learn a musical instrument, but they said I couldn't play like drums or guitar cause

1415
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,380
they didn't want me to be in a rock band.

1416
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,380
Sure.

1417
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,380
So I took up the tree.

1418
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:30,220
I didn't, I didn't know where that was going and you got me.

1419
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,220
You got me?

1420
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,220
I played the tree.

1421
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,940
I'm going to give you that one.

1422
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,420
That one's an unqualified win for you.

1423
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,420
Thanks.

1424
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,900
Um, yeah, so our bodies are musical instruments.

1425
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,900
Sure.

1426
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,900
There's sound waves, the universe, whatever.

1427
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,820
Well, they're not actually sound waves, but that's the best way to describe them.

1428
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:50,060
Look, in the third dimension, it's hard, it's limiting to talk about these things, which

1429
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,260
I don't know what these things are.

1430
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,260
I don't know what's going on.

1431
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,220
I thought we were going to get to COVID news.

1432
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,980
This is, I don't know what's happening.

1433
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,980
I do.

1434
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,420
I do like the, uh, scientists have proved it.

1435
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,420
The ancients.

1436
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,420
Everything's kind of like sound waves.

1437
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,420
Yeah, the ancients said it first.

1438
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,420
Of course.

1439
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,420
Yeah.

1440
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,420
Yeah.

1441
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,420
The music of the spheres, Dan.

1442
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,420
Don't try and cut out the ancients.

1443
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,420
Apologies.

1444
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,420
That's very rude.

1445
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,420
Yeah, it is.

1446
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:13,500
So what I've done now is I have just made cuts.

1447
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,100
Uh, this is just, this is one long statement.

1448
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,100
Yep.

1449
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,100
Yep.

1450
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,100
Okay.

1451
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,100
He is in a weird place.

1452
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,100
We are talking for the news.

1453
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,100
We are not.

1454
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,100
All right.

1455
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,580
We are talking about our bodies being musical instruments in the third dimension or something.

1456
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:31,020
Look, dude, this is a mess.

1457
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:35,040
This is a very primitive level of God's creation.

1458
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:45,740
As fantastic as it is, this, um, when it comes to creational matter, very thin, sure.

1459
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:52,540
This dimension is very, very thin and if you call it below that, that's a human term, but

1460
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:58,340
in the lower dimensions, which again exists and have been proven, uh, it's even more empty.

1461
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,260
It's more empty in the lower dimensions.

1462
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,260
Right.

1463
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,260
But that's a human term.

1464
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,380
The lower it's up and down, you know, it's just a human thing.

1465
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,340
Uh, no.

1466
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,340
Yes.

1467
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,340
Just refuse.

1468
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:13,860
Like it or not, this is happening.

1469
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,860
Refuse.

1470
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,860
Now we go back for vacation.

1471
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,500
I refuse to hear someone say this dimension is thin.

1472
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

1473
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,620
This dimension is thin on a creational level.

1474
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,220
What does that mean?

1475
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,500
Look in the third dimension, third dimensional words are limiting.

1476
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
I don't know what that means.

1477
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
No, neither does he.

1478
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,500
Just saying shit.

1479
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,500
Oh, you know, the space below human term naturally more empty.

1480
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,460
Is it, is, does that mean it's thinner?

1481
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:43,460
I think so.

1482
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,940
But again, that's a human term.

1483
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,940
Right.

1484
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,940
But I mean, let's...

1485
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,940
I suspect.

1486
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,100
Let's engage with it on that level.

1487
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,860
So we're, we're talking all the difference between the levels of dimension is really

1488
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,300
measurable by thin or thickness.

1489
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:00,220
I mean, you know, in the new age communities, whenever they talk about like these higher

1490
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,420
vibrations and stuff, it's often referred to as a higher density.

1491
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,420
Sure.

1492
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,100
So maybe Alex is taking that as like actual denseness.

1493
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,820
I really, I really, okay.

1494
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,380
That could be what's going on.

1495
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,340
You can float easier in the fourth dimension.

1496
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,420
I would assume that you can the third dimension.

1497
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:22,060
No, I would, I would assume if you have a lower density, you'd float more, right?

1498
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:28,020
Oh no, cause you're talking about the environment is denser.

1499
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,020
Yeah.

1500
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,020
Yeah.

1501
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,020
Yeah.

1502
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,020
I had it backwards.

1503
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,020
I had it backwards.

1504
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,020
All right.

1505
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,020
I had to stop and think.

1506
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,020
Yeah.

1507
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,060
Look, we're engaging with too much even cause he's not even taking us there.

1508
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:43,620
He's just saying it's thin creationally.

1509
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,740
You don't just get to say that.

1510
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:45,740
Now.

1511
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,460
I actually think that the next thing he brings up is a good thought.

1512
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,460
Maybe if you're high.

1513
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,460
Interesting.

1514
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:55,180
And you're in college and you're sitting around with your friends and that thought is this.

1515
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:01,100
We always imagine that like if aliens were to come down and contact us, they'd be so

1516
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,860
much more advanced than us, man.

1517
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,860
You know, that kind of thing.

1518
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,980
I think we've, we've experienced this in the Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

1519
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,140
Sure.

1520
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,140
With the Moon Knights.

1521
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,140
Yes.

1522
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:16,020
We've experienced this in plenty of media depictions, but yeah, of course.

1523
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,340
I mean, we have a bias towards anything that would contact us would have to be far more

1524
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:21,340
advanced than us.

1525
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,340
And maybe that's not the case.

1526
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,440
Well, I mean, if we can't contact them, but they can contact us, that would suggest that

1527
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,220
at least on some level, they have an ability that we don't.

1528
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,220
On one level.

1529
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,220
Right.

1530
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,220
The contacting across whatever.

1531
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,220
Right.

1532
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,220
That's all we know for sure.

1533
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:40,660
And we're theoretically opening the possibility to a intergalactic spacefaring race that still

1534
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,260
fights with clubs.

1535
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,260
It's possible.

1536
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,260
I suppose.

1537
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,660
Anything in this great big marble of a world.

1538
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,660
Okay.

1539
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,780
Anyway, that's the decent thought.

1540
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:54,220
I'm going out of my way to give some credibility or credence here because the rest of this

1541
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,220
thought is stupid.

1542
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,220
Okay.

1543
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:02,460
So we tend to think of interfacing with other things and like, oh, it must be advanced.

1544
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:09,700
No, anything that would actually try to interface with us without our free will is low.

1545
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,700
Wow.

1546
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:18,660
Other than Lucifer, who does come from one dimension higher, down to our dimension to

1547
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,820
try to then ally with all the other dark energy or dark's not even the right word, fallen

1548
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,820
energy.

1549
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,820
Dark is a human word.

1550
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,820
Right.

1551
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,820
Right.

1552
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:28,820
Right.

1553
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,820
Fallen.

1554
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:30,820
Right.

1555
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:31,820
That's their word.

1556
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,820
That's their word.

1557
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:37,620
I mean, maybe what he's trying to say is that Satan isn't really a bad guy, but he just

1558
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,180
needs to breathe thinner air.

1559
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,340
I mean, no, I don't think so.

1560
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,340
Okay.

1561
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,340
Although that does kind of...

1562
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,340
Kind of tracks.

1563
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,820
It tracks with some of the other ideas he has.

1564
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:55,180
No, Satan is one level higher and he's allying with the stuff to, who knows why.

1565
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,820
No, I'm not messing with that.

1566
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,820
Right.

1567
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,060
I'm not messing with the why on this one.

1568
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,060
No, certainly not.

1569
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,060
Yeah.

1570
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,060
Yeah.

1571
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,060
I got nothing.

1572
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:05,060
Nope.

1573
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,060
Let's just move on.

1574
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,060
Okay.

1575
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,060
Dark's not even the right word.

1576
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,060
Fallen energy.

1577
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:17,060
I mean, to a human brain seeing it, it means there's no creation.

1578
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,060
What?

1579
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,060
Darkness just means devoid of light.

1580
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,060
Well, that's not like a black road sign.

1581
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,060
That's just absorbing light.

1582
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,060
That's not...

1583
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:31,980
So, it's not the proper term, but we have to create our own terms to even understand

1584
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:37,500
an interface with the cosmos, which itself, again, is just an expression of God.

1585
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,620
And I'm not an animist.

1586
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:43,540
I'm not saying to these troglodyte preachers that aren't really Christians, but think they

1587
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,060
are Pharisees, that I worship the creation.

1588
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,060
No, no, no.

1589
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,700
I don't worship the creation.

1590
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,820
I'm saying God made all this.

1591
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,940
And if I create a piece of art, that is an expression of who I am.

1592
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,420
I made that.

1593
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:03,980
And that is a very primitive form of, imagine God making us, but imagine making something

1594
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,380
that has consciousness and free will.

1595
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,380
Well, guess what?

1596
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,260
God gives you a little taste of that.

1597
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:14,860
It's why the Old Testament tells you quite a few times, we're made the image of God.

1598
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,740
We're not God, but we're little g.

1599
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:17,740
Okay.

1600
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,540
What do you take away from that?

1601
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,820
Let's see.

1602
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,540
What do I take away from...

1603
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,100
I think it's blasphemy.

1604
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,100
Well, interesting.

1605
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,100
Make your case.

1606
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:39,100
Well, the idea of comparing yourself to God by simply changing the size of the g would

1607
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:46,620
still technically really be construed as calling yourself somewhat equal to God, which I think,

1608
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:52,420
now I don't know if I've read the Bible enough times, but that one's pretty big on the don't

1609
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,820
do scale.

1610
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:54,820
Yeah.

1611
01:06:54,820 --> 01:07:00,140
I mean, you know, what is made in the image of really me and phew.

1612
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,140
Telekinesis.

1613
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,140
Totally.

1614
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,140
Yes.

1615
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,180
A million percent.

1616
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,180
Yes.

1617
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,180
Yeah.

1618
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,580
I was looking for a thesis.

1619
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:10,820
I'm not finding it.

1620
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,380
I think that was your mistake.

1621
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,380
That was.

1622
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,700
And it's a mistake I continue to make.

1623
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,020
It's something that, it's a lesson I refuse to learn.

1624
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,100
I accept that.

1625
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,980
So, you know, you have an interesting perspective that you think that changing the capitalization

1626
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:27,700
on God doesn't mean all that much.

1627
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,700
No.

1628
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,420
I think Alex thinks it does.

1629
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,780
Of course he does.

1630
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:37,420
But also he thinks he's got the personal connection to God that gives him visions all the time.

1631
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,680
So there's that.

1632
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,820
But he's not God capital.

1633
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,820
Sure.

1634
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,820
Sure.

1635
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,820
Right?

1636
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,820
Satan.

1637
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,820
Okay.

1638
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,220
He comes down from his address, which is in just the level above us.

1639
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,220
Alex has his address, actually.

1640
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,220
Right.

1641
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,220
No.

1642
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,220
It's in the dimension right above us.

1643
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,220
48.

1644
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,220
Yeah.

1645
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,220
He comes down and he's like, hey.

1646
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,220
Hey.

1647
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,220
How you doing?

1648
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,220
You're God.

1649
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:00,220
Satan tries to convince you that you are God.

1650
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:05,660
Does Satan get a capital S in the fourth dimension and a lowercase s in the third dimension?

1651
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,660
I never thought about it.

1652
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,340
I always considered it to be a proper noun.

1653
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,340
Yeah.

1654
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,340
Me too.

1655
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,340
Like it's a name, right?

1656
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,820
But if God's fungible, I feel like Satan's fungible.

1657
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,940
Oh, it's too confusing.

1658
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,900
We're not God, but we're little g.

1659
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:21,460
And Satan goes all the way and goes, oh, no, no, you're even better than God.

1660
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,460
You act.

1661
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,460
Well, no, you're fallen.

1662
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,860
Okay.

1663
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:29,340
But that's what they tell you in things like 2001 Space Odyssey, that after you go through

1664
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:35,260
this process, you come back as a star child, reincarnated to like a sperm, implant the

1665
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:38,260
egg that is earth and create the new Lucifer race.

1666
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,700
Well, that's just satanic poppycock, ladies and gentlemen.

1667
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,420
Satanic poppycock.

1668
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:49,820
I thought it was maybe a little bit long, but I didn't necessarily construe it as satanic

1669
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,820
poppycock.

1670
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,820
Satanic poppycock.

1671
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,820
Huh?

1672
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,820
Well, that's fair.

1673
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:57,700
I feel like you are not the most reliable cinematic reviewer if you didn't pick up on

1674
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:58,900
the satanic poppycock.

1675
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,900
That's possible.

1676
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:00,900
That's possible.

1677
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,900
Because it was overt.

1678
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:02,900
Yeah.

1679
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,580
I missed that in Ebert's review, but I suppose it was all unspoken.

1680
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,580
Right.

1681
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,140
Siskel was all about the satanic poppycock.

1682
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,660
I give it two thumbs down for Satanism.

1683
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,660
Yeah.

1684
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,660
Develery.

1685
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:22,220
So it turns out, actually, you know, the stuff in 2001 A Space Odyssey might be just as real

1686
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,220
as Frankenstein.

1687
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,220
Okay.

1688
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:25,220
Okay.

1689
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,980
Well, that's that's just satanic poppycock, ladies and gentlemen.

1690
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:34,900
But I am explaining that the devil creates facsimiles or counterfeits of what God has

1691
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,900
actually created.

1692
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,900
And I can tell you the stuff that came up with 2001 Space Odyssey with the primitive

1693
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:50,580
special effects is very close to actually what's going on.

1694
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:51,740
And I'll just leave it at that.

1695
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,220
But don't hit all this news.

1696
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,220
Yeah.

1697
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,220
You need to get back to.

1698
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,220
Yeah.

1699
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,220
Tell me more about that.

1700
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,220
Tell me more about that.

1701
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,220
I want to know more about that.

1702
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:02,900
Well, 2001 A Space Odyssey is actually very real.

1703
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:07,460
They were very close to accurate with their rudimentary special effects.

1704
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:10,460
So I got to get back to the news.

1705
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,460
Yes, you do.

1706
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,540
On a certain level.

1707
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,540
For me.

1708
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,860
Please do not.

1709
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:18,220
So how dare you say something like that?

1710
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:23,660
How dare you introduce this idea and then be like, ah, what's in the news?

1711
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,420
Boo.

1712
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:33,540
So 50 years ago, special effects were very similar to what they had then.

1713
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:39,460
So would you say that special effects have gotten better enough that they are what they

1714
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,700
have now?

1715
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,620
Or is it like proportional?

1716
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:51,840
Are special effects true to what reality was 50 years ago, and now it's 50 years ahead

1717
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,840
of what we have?

1718
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,620
I mean, it would have to be, right?

1719
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,620
Right.

1720
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,620
That's the only thing that makes sense.

1721
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:01,140
If they're implanting, if the evil globalists are implanting secret messages that control

1722
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:07,740
all of cinema and media, it's not like they wouldn't give access to secret technologies

1723
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,380
for special effects.

1724
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,380
Right.

1725
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,380
So Andy Serkis only has a career because of aliens.

1726
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,500
I think that's what I'm hearing.

1727
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,900
I think that's what I'm hearing.

1728
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,900
Yeah.

1729
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:23,340
I don't know about that, that whether or not the cinema world is privy to those futuristic

1730
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,340
technologies.

1731
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,500
I'm just going to go ahead and say Kong vs. Godzilla is real.

1732
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,500
Sure.

1733
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Yeah.

1734
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:34,140
I mean, I'm getting to get back to the news, that's where this sort of excursion into lunacy

1735
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,140
ended.

1736
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,140
Boo.

1737
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,140
I know.

1738
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,420
That weirded me out so much.

1739
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:46,260
Like I was like, what are you trying to express?

1740
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:54,420
It seems like just kind of a bit of standard shit header-y from like new age space conspiracy

1741
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,420
communities.

1742
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,420
Sure.

1743
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,460
I could hear Rogan saying some dumb nonsense like that.

1744
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:02,380
That's not far off from what dumb nonsense Rogan spouts, right?

1745
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:07,780
I could see somebody who wouldn't get invited on Rogan, but really wants to.

1746
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:08,780
Almost there.

1747
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,780
Almost there.

1748
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,180
On that one tier below where you got to be.

1750
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,220
I don't see a lot of depth here.

1751
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,540
I just see killing time, rambling about nonsense.

1752
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,540
Sure.

1753
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,860
And then Alex gets angry about his nonsense.

1754
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:24,860
Sure.

1755
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:29,900
This is only an experience of free will that God created, because the only thing God can

1756
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:36,460
create separate from God's all knowing, all powerful, all controlling, omnipotent, omnipresent,

1757
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:42,540
beyond 12th dimensional total completeness is creatures with free will that create other

1758
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:48,660
creatures with free will and the capacity to interface with this time space continuum

1759
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:52,420
galacticus beyond.

1760
01:12:52,420 --> 01:13:00,380
That is the secret to all of it that we have been made by a all powerful sentient creature

1761
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:07,820
that created everything and doesn't want to be alone.

1762
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:14,780
And so put us on this planet away from other things so we don't kill everything while we

1763
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:18,500
run around inside our nursery.

1764
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:25,860
And what does God put in the nursery to test his creation puts a lot of nasty stuff.

1765
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,060
That's weird.

1766
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,700
What a weird God.

1767
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,340
What a weird guy on the radio.

1768
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:31,340
Yeah.

1769
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,380
You know what I was thinking while I was listening to this?

1770
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:40,740
I was like, this, Alex is turned into like the, like, I remember when I was growing up,

1771
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:47,100
there was the small town church that had like 15 to 20 people in it and everybody avoided

1772
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,100
them.

1773
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,300
And I don't want to know what goes on there.

1774
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,580
It's none of our business and we just stay out of it, you know?

1775
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,580
It's loud.

1776
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,580
Yeah.

1777
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:56,580
Yeah.

1778
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,740
There's, there's something going on, but we just, it's a, it's like a black hole in the

1779
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,460
small town where everybody just kind of avoids it out of instinct.

1780
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:06,820
I think I might've gone to a couple of those churches and I think I know what you mean.

1781
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:11,420
And then there was one moment in his thing that really hit home, like in that way for

1782
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,420
me.

1783
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:18,060
And that is the, like when he's yelling about like, we were created by an all powerful beast.

1784
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:21,300
And then there's the pause and the, who doesn't want to be alone.

1785
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,300
Exactly.

1786
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:27,140
It's the anger, the pause, and then the soft delivery of this idea that like created us

1787
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,700
to keep him company or whatever.

1788
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,700
You can hear it.

1789
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:36,460
Like I've been to a church where there were snakes before.

1790
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,980
I've heard this, you know?

1791
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:38,980
Yeah.

1792
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,980
That rhythm and cadence is, is, is very a tent preacher kind of, kind of vibe.

1793
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:48,700
And then the other thing that I thought about when I heard that clip was about like the

1794
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,460
naming of his website as prison planet.

1795
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:55,500
It's really interesting to me the way that like, if you think that he's just this guy

1796
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:00,180
who's into political conspiracies and like, Hey, if a one world government comes into

1797
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,480
place and they turn into a tyrannical dictatorship, right?

1798
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,020
We are on a prison planet.

1799
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,500
You can't get off.

1800
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:11,140
If there's nowhere to run, if there's a one world government that's in control of everywhere

1801
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,660
on earth, it is a prison planet.

1802
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:19,940
But if you look at it the way he's kind of talking now, it's more like, you know, the

1803
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,900
earth nursery idea.

1804
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:28,300
It's kind of like, he's saying that like, you know, I'm in a crib, I'm in a crib and

1805
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,620
this weird God threw a scorpion in here.

1806
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,620
Sure.

1807
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,620
Yeah.

1808
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:36,980
You know, Hey, I got pushed into the deep end when I was five and you swim or you die,

1809
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,420
you know, it's that kind of thing.

1810
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,420
Yeah.

1811
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:44,900
It also implies that there's a bunch of other aliens on other planets or humans on other

1812
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:48,860
planets that have gone through whatever we're going through right now.

1813
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:56,300
Well, I mean, if God's lonely, it stands to reason that maybe he's lonely enough to make

1814
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,740
more, you know?

1815
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:01,260
And so he's just running this shell game of the universe all the time.

1816
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:07,380
I would, I would suggest that maybe, uh, how is it possible that if the whole thing is

1817
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:11,340
because God's lonely, why is he still lonely?

1818
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:15,420
It's a, you know, it's escalation, you know, you, you get what you want and you find out

1819
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,600
you just want more, you know, that's how it works.

1820
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,700
God's not immune to that kind of thing.

1821
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:27,020
It seems like there's a lot of people who've lived.

1822
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,100
If you need some company, there's plenty of options.

1823
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,100
Yeah.

1824
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,740
You know, on the other hand, why does anybody die at all if he's so lonely?

1825
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:34,740
Hmm.

1826
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,620
Why not just make some people and keep them around and party?

1827
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,620
Well, cause it's a test.

1828
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,900
You gotta, you gotta be in the nursery.

1829
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,900
Sure.

1830
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,900
Gotta deal with the scorpion.

1831
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,900
Right.

1832
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,420
And then get out of the crib or something.

1833
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,420
Yeah.

1834
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,420
It almost kind of...

1835
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,420
It's babyish.

1836
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:49,420
It's a really babyish idea.

1837
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:54,260
Well, I mean, really it's similar, it's more similar, I would say to the wheel of reincarnation

1838
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,420
than anything else.

1839
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:00,420
You know, that idea of like, you're constantly being tested through, throughout time until

1840
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:05,980
you become a full being and then you ascend beyond it.

1841
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:11,140
Yeah, but I don't know, I don't know how Alex's ideas about reincarnation work exactly.

1842
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,140
I know that he thinks that you're literally your ancestors.

1843
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,140
True.

1844
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,140
And all that.

1845
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,140
Right?

1846
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,140
Right?

1847
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:19,820
But I don't know how that works with ancestors that are concurrently alive.

1848
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,460
Hmm, that's fair.

1849
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,780
I don't, I don't, I don't really understand any of that.

1850
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:28,060
And I don't know where you go in between or it doesn't really articulate a lot of that

1851
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,060
stuff.

1852
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:35,780
I mean, I don't know if it is like a situation where, where he believes in, in the reincarnative

1853
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:36,780
tests.

1854
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,780
Right.

1855
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,780
Right.

1856
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,780
Right.

1857
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,780
It's not the good place, you know, that kind of thing.

1858
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,780
Yeah.

1859
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,780
It's weird.

1860
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:43,780
Yeah.

1861
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:44,780
That is weird.

1862
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,780
Anyway.

1863
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:46,780
Yeah.

1864
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,780
I think this is dumb.

1865
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:48,780
Yes.

1866
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,500
So there is some news and Alex has been building up to this news, but I didn't realize it.

1867
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:55,780
I have such a hard time remembering that this has got a news part on it.

1868
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,860
Let me just show you the big news because if I covered this last hour, no one would

1869
01:17:58,860 --> 01:17:59,860
care.

1870
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,260
So I built it up for an hour so that you would care.

1871
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,260
And I'm not mad at you.

1872
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:03,260
I'm the same way.

1873
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,060
I didn't feel like he'd been building this up for an hour.

1874
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,300
He told me all about the fourth dimension.

1875
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,300
Yeah.

1876
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,300
I felt like he got distracted about bullshit.

1877
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,300
Yes.

1878
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,300
Yes.

1879
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,620
He hasn't been teasing it.

1880
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:16,620
No.

1881
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:17,620
He's been ignoring it.

1882
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:19,220
I know teasing Alex.

1883
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,820
We've experienced that over and over again on this show.

1884
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:22,820
It's something that he does.

1885
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:23,820
Roll down your windows.

1886
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:24,820
Yeah.

1887
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,820
Yeah.

1888
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,820
Yeah.

1889
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:31,540
And I will need you to go stand over the highway with your bandung video.

1890
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,540
Totally.

1891
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:33,540
Yeah.

1892
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:34,540
Exactly.

1893
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,540
Yeah.

1894
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,540
Yeah.

1895
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,540
Yeah.

1896
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,540
That's not the behavior he's been engaging in here.

1897
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:39,540
If anything, he's escapist.

1898
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,540
Yes.

1899
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,540
So anyway, here's the big news.

1900
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,540
Here it is.

1901
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:45,980
But this just broke about an hour ago, or at least when I learned about it.

1902
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:51,660
Major study by the University of Louisville.

1903
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:58,560
Masks don't show any signs or any evidence that they helped stop the spread of COVID.

1904
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,560
There it is.

1905
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,740
Masks didn't slow COVID spread.

1906
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,120
New study finds.

1907
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:06,740
So this is a non peer reviewed study that came out.

1908
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:10,340
And there's people who have some questions about the methodology of it.

1909
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:15,300
And even under ideal circumstances and assuming that it goes through peer review and stands

1910
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:20,100
up to scrutiny, it still isn't saying that masks aren't effective.

1911
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:25,900
It was looking at larger populations and making estimates based on whether or not mask mandates

1912
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,620
had an effect on a larger population.

1913
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,020
That's a good study.

1914
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:36,220
As opposed to on an individual level, whether or not masks had any effect in terms of actual

1915
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,220
transmission.

1916
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,220
Right.

1917
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:40,580
There are plenty of studies that have actually looked at the question that Alex is pretending

1918
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,620
this study answers.

1919
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:48,220
And they have routinely shown that they do, they are effective.

1920
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:52,860
Maybe not 100% effective, but they are effective in as much as it's something you can do.

1921
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,860
Right.

1922
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:54,860
Right.

1923
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:55,860
Right.

1924
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,860
Right.

1925
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:57,860
Right.

1926
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:58,860
As opposed to nothing.

1927
01:19:58,860 --> 01:19:59,860
Yeah.

1928
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,860
Anyway.

1929
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:01,860
So this is about something different than what he's saying it is.

1930
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:09,700
And then secondarily, it's too early to really take it as solid, like a bedrock of reporting

1931
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,700
because it's just sloppy.

1932
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,700
Anyway.

1933
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:21,220
If he says studies say, I always hear you say, he's referencing a non peer reviewed study.

1934
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,780
Like that's the next sentence.

1935
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,540
That's something that, it's weird.

1936
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:31,300
You know, like when he says a study, it's some non peer reviewed thing that's on like

1937
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:36,860
a preprint or something and maybe we'll get peer reviewed or maybe won't.

1938
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,420
And then you'll just forget about it and you'll never know where it ends up.

1939
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,420
Yeah.

1940
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,420
It's the same thing with bills.

1941
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:47,500
If you look back at these pastimes on his show and he actually talked about news more,

1942
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,780
he would have these bills that he'd complain about and they are always things that ended

1943
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,180
up dying in committee.

1944
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:56,540
They're always bills that are like, can you believe someone's doing X, Y, or Z?

1945
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:01,860
It's like, I can, but I also know that that is never going to even get a vote.

1946
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,060
It's kind of the same thing.

1947
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:08,060
He's preemptively making everything a huge deal.

1948
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:13,760
And that's one of the reasons why I can't do the coverage of the police state three

1949
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,340
that I wanted to do.

1950
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:26,260
It's almost entirely about Patriot Act Two that doesn't happen.

1951
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:33,500
Studies say next sentence, non peer reviewed, HB 2033 next sentence died in committee.

1952
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:40,020
So we have one last clip here, and this is a good indication and example of why everything

1953
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,340
in Alex's world is a trap.

1954
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:49,000
Biden orders us Intel to analyze information on possible Wuhan lab leak.

1955
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:56,500
That means cover it up, have his hand picked Stooges and now have a 90 day research, which

1956
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,920
he ordered it by the way, killed, but now he can organize a new team to lie to everybody.

1957
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:01,920
That's the translation there.

1958
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:02,920
You don't need me to tell you that.

1959
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:11,820
So if, if Biden doesn't investigate the theory that there was a lab origin to the coronavirus,

1960
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:16,180
and it's a cover up, and if he does do an investigation of it, it's a cover up.

1961
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:17,180
Yeah.

1962
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,180
It doesn't matter.

1963
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,620
The reality and what happens don't matter.

1964
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,900
The spin is intact no matter what.

1965
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:22,900
Yep.

1966
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:29,180
The only way Alex would allow for something to be real would be if Trump himself was running

1967
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:35,540
this commission, and the only conclusion that they even accepted from the beginning is that

1968
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:43,700
not only was this a bioweapon release that came out of that lab, but she single handedly-

1969
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,860
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1970
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,860
Yeah.

1971
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:53,840
And it actually is a special kind of virus that actually, if you look at the molecules,

1972
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,180
it spells out communism.

1973
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,980
Yeah, exactly.

1974
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:03,700
It's got Xi Jinping written on the virus, you know, like that level of bullshit.

1975
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:11,140
Yeah, yeah, and that's why, you know, a lot of this stuff is just, it should be taken

1976
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:14,940
seriously in as much as like there's dangerous consequences of it.

1977
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:15,940
Sure, sure.

1978
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:20,780
And it is illustrative of bad thought patterns, certainly.

1979
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:25,620
But like when you hear stuff like that, like you should recognize that like this is how

1980
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:26,620
he treats everything.

1981
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1982
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:28,740
Everything is a trap.

1983
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:29,740
Yep.

1984
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:30,740
Doesn't matter.

1985
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:31,740
It's pathetic.

1986
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:32,740
Yeah.

1987
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:33,740
I hate it.

1988
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:37,980
Biden could do X, Biden could do Y, either way, the decision tree for what Alex is going

1989
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,100
to say about it is the same.

1990
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,380
Yeah, it's like preparing for a disaster.

1991
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:47,380
You hate, you say that preparing for the disaster makes it happen, if it does happen, or if

1992
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:52,120
it doesn't happen, you say that by revealing that the preparation for the disaster would

1993
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,340
make it happen, you stopped the disaster.

1994
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:58,980
Yeah, or talking about these bills, the die-in committee, or, you know, like, hey, you know,

1995
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,340
the only reason to die-in committee is because we talked about it.

1996
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:02,340
Yeah, totally.

1997
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,060
It's just a trap.

1998
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:09,180
Yeah, you create a universe where you always win, and then you never have to feel bad about

1999
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:12,540
yourself, so why would you go back to the real universe, you know?

2000
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,060
Yeah, sounds fun.

2001
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,060
Anyway, Jordan, this has been fun.

2002
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,060
We're back.

2003
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,060
It's great to be back, Dan.

2004
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,060
You know what?

2005
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,060
We had such a good time.

2006
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:28,100
I want you to play the birthday one again, too.

2007
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,100
That one still tickles me.

2008
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:30,100
Can't do it.

2009
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,100
You have to wait until next time.

2010
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,100
Not yet.

2011
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,100
Not yet.

2012
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,100
Okay.

2013
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:37,380
So yeah, we'll be back, Jordan, on Monday, and I hope to have gotten a little bit more

2014
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,780
through the Fauci emails by then, a little more time.

2015
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:41,820
But until then, we have a website.

2016
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:42,820
We do have a website.

2017
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:43,820
It's knowledgefight.com.

2018
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,420
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

2019
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,420
We are on Twitter.

2020
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,700
It's at knowledge underscore fight, and I go to bed Jordan.

2021
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,700
We're also on Facebook.

2022
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:54,340
If you'd like to tell us, if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your

2023
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,740
area to help out people doing God's work right now.

2024
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,740
Yep, we'll be back.

2025
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,220
But until then, I'm Neo.

2026
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,220
I'm Leo.

2027
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,220
I'm DZXClark.

2028
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:02,220
I'm Daryl Rundis.

2029
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:04,900
I live next door to Satan in the sixth dimension.

2030
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:05,900
Maybe fifth?

2031
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:06,900
I'm not sure.

2032
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:07,900
One above ours.

2033
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:08,900
Andy in Kansas.

2034
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:09,900
You're on the air.

2035
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:10,900
Thanks for holding.

2036
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:11,900
Hello, Alex.

2037
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:12,900
I'm a first time caller.

2038
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,900
I'm a huge fan.

2039
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,900
I love your work.

2040
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:21,900
I love you.
