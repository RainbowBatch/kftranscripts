N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.600
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.040
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.160
Knowledgefight.

00:25.160 --> 00:29.320
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.320
Knowledgefight.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.320
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.320
Knowledgefight.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
That'll hurt.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.320
That'll hurt.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.320
That'll hurt.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.320
I need money.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.320
That'll hurt.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
That'll hurt.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.320
That'll hurt.

00:39.320 --> 00:40.320
Andy and Kansas.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.320
Andy and Kansas.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
Stop it.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
Andy and Kansas.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.320
Andy and Kansas.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.320
It's time to pray.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.320
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.320
Thanks for holding.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.320
Hello, Alex.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.320
I'm a victim caller.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.320
I'm a huge fan.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.320
I love your room.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.320
Knowledgefight.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.320
Knowledgefight.com.

00:53.320 --> 00:59.320
I love you.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
Hey, everybody.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.320
Welcome back to Knowledgefight.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.320
I'm Dan.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
I'm Jordan.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
We're a couple dudes.

01:04.320 --> 01:06.160
I'd like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex

01:06.160 --> 01:07.160
Jones.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.160
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.160
Yeah, Jordan.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.160
Dan.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.160
Jordan.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
I have a quick question for you.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.160
What's up?

01:13.160 --> 01:14.160
What's your bright spot today?

01:14.160 --> 01:20.120
My bright spot today, honestly, is a little bit of getting back to it, you know?

01:20.120 --> 01:21.120
Yeah.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.200
I think we went on a vacation and getting back to Selene, getting back to work, getting

01:26.200 --> 01:30.840
back into a little bit of... I think one of the things that's one of the undervalued

01:30.840 --> 01:39.060
or underthought about elements of vacations are how much it makes you like, ah, my day-to-day

01:39.060 --> 01:40.600
life is better than I think it is.

01:40.600 --> 01:45.640
You know, I was reading Terry Pratchett while we were on vacation, and he had a really great

01:45.640 --> 01:51.480
quote that I was like, you've never really been anywhere until you get back, you know?

01:51.480 --> 01:57.000
And that, until we got back, I was like, that's kind of a silly thing to say, and now I kind

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
of get it.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I've been on vacations before.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.240
Granted, it's been a long time, but you know, it's something that I think is also easy to

02:03.240 --> 02:04.240
forget.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.560
It's something that you experience over and over again, and every time you go on a vacation

02:08.560 --> 02:11.800
too, your life is probably in a different circumstance than it was the last time.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.800
Sure.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
Sure.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.200
I think it's time for you to come back and listen to this idiot again.

02:17.200 --> 02:20.200
It was good to take a break.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.680
It really was.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.680
Yeah.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.440
And now I really want to get back to work.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.760
I think there's some things that were dangling threads that did not run into any lizards

02:29.760 --> 02:30.760
weirdly.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.120
No, that was difficult.

02:32.120 --> 02:37.040
I had a perception in my head that there were lizards everywhere when I was a kid, and maybe

02:37.040 --> 02:40.320
it's because I was a couple feet shorter and closer to the ground and I could just see

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
them everywhere.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
You could see them a lot better.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.880
I did not catch any lizards, not a single one.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.200
I got blisters on my feet the first day we were there, so I didn't shimmy up any poles.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.360
Same here.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.920
My childhood home has been torn down and turned into an apartment complex.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.720
It was a little bit like Gross Point Blank.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.280
It was a little bit like that.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.280
Yeah.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.280
At least it wasn't a convenience store.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.120
No, but it was still a lovely time.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
Sure.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
Sure.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.120
What about you?

03:06.120 --> 03:07.120
What's your bright spot?

03:07.120 --> 03:10.320
You know, I have a hard time saying anything similarly to you.

03:10.320 --> 03:17.120
You know, I feel like the vacation was great, but my bright spot was, when we got back,

03:17.120 --> 03:20.560
my dogs were still staying with my partner's mother.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.280
Yeah, you had like a whole other day, right?

03:22.280 --> 03:30.960
A whole other day, and they got back today, and the first time I saw, they went so ridiculously

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
crazy.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.280
I was like, how did I ever leave these beautiful things?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.280
That's very cute.

03:36.280 --> 03:41.440
Oh, you know, you're like, I knew my pets loved me, but after they've been gone for

03:41.440 --> 03:45.720
a week and they saw me again, you're like, ah, this is what it's all about, man.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
Yeah.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
Yeah.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.520
I mean, that's fairly similar to the experience I had with Celine, but with a lot more yelling.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.520
Well, there's...

03:52.520 --> 03:54.320
She was yelling at me quite a bit.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.600
I got a few more face licks, I think.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.600
Yeah.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
That might be the case.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.120
I got some snuggles and some aggressive head butts eventually.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.120
Sure.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.120
Sure.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.760
And I was coming up the stairs with the luggage, so if I could just hear, meh.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.760
Well, yeah.

04:08.760 --> 04:12.160
A cat has to teach you a lesson before they can re-give you the...

04:12.160 --> 04:13.160
Grumpy as hell.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.960
But I wouldn't have it any other way.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.960
No, of course not.

04:15.960 --> 04:20.040
So, Jordan, today we have a difficulty ahead of us, and that is kind of like we missed

04:20.040 --> 04:21.040
a bit of time.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.040
Yeah.

04:22.040 --> 04:25.760
And so, and also some stuff happened right when we got back.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.960
Oh, of course.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.840
That's very relevant to our business, so I didn't really know exactly what the strategy

04:31.840 --> 04:37.240
was going to be in terms of, you know, do we go back and listen to all of last week?

04:37.240 --> 04:38.240
Sure.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.240
Sure.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
Or what do we do?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
Yeah.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.240
Pick and choose, that kind of thing.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
Right.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
And it's a little challenging.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.240
And so, just spoiler alert, the Fauci emails came out.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.240
Oh, boy.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.240
Yep.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.240
Yep.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.900
And so I was like, well, I mean, Alex is gonna go buck wild on this.

04:51.900 --> 04:52.900
Of course.

04:52.900 --> 04:56.820
But since the time we've been back, I haven't had enough time to read all of it.

04:56.820 --> 04:58.200
It's like 3,000 pages.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
Jesus.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.200
I've read quite a bit.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
Of course.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
It's boring emails.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.520
I was thinking the same.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.760
I read a few of them and I was like, I'm just not doing this.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.840
I'm not reading business emails, you know?

05:08.840 --> 05:14.260
I've thought that to myself a whole bunch of times because most of what I've read so

05:14.260 --> 05:19.000
far is Fauci forwarding something to another person.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Honestly.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.160
Or it's someone sending a nonsensical email to him and him not responding.

05:24.160 --> 05:29.620
No, half the time I'm looking around, I'm like, the next email is gonna be like, we're

05:29.620 --> 05:32.040
gonna need to refill the toilet paper in the lobby.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
You know?

05:33.040 --> 05:34.040
It's like that kind of level.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.040
And then he forwards that to maintenance.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
Yes, exactly.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
And you're like, okay.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
That's why it's in the cache.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
All right, we get it.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
He's evil or whatever.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
But come on, man.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.320
So I haven't gotten a full enough view.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.400
And just like, I think it would be almost impossible.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.480
I don't know, unless you had a team reading them in chunks or whatever, to get through

05:51.480 --> 05:53.680
all 3,000 pages and the time that it would take to...

05:53.680 --> 05:55.600
It's like the Snowden files, you know?

05:55.600 --> 05:58.160
You've got multiple outlets working on that.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.160
Right.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.280
So that was a big priority, but at the same time, it was something that we couldn't really

06:02.280 --> 06:03.280
do yet.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.920
So I'm hoping to be able to do some really current stuff for Monday.

06:07.920 --> 06:14.640
So what I did is I just threw an arrow at a dartboard, darted an arrowboard, whatever.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.560
And May 27th, Thursday of last week, came up.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.840
I was like, we'll do Thursday and Friday.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.800
Thursday ended up too silly, and Friday's off the table.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.460
Thursday's just a mess.

06:24.460 --> 06:25.800
The dartboard was wrong.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
Yeah.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.840
So here we go, we're going to do May 27th, 2021, Blackjack.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.840
Ah, shit.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.000
I'm way out of practice.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.160
This is going to be interesting.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.280
Alex is very silly.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.280
Let's do it.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.280
That's what I was hoping for.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.440
I want to come back to silly.

06:40.440 --> 06:46.220
Yeah, I also felt like let's not overburden ourselves with something that's going to be

06:46.220 --> 06:47.220
all day.

06:47.220 --> 06:48.220
Yeah.

06:48.220 --> 06:49.220
Yeah.

06:49.220 --> 06:51.920
Nobody wants to come back to the office the first day and really deal with that stack

06:51.920 --> 06:53.200
of paper that built up.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.520
You get to the top few pages.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.160
It has to be taken care of eventually.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.160
Sure, sure.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
But not today.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.160
Half day.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.160
Yes, exactly.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.160
Or something.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
Yeah.

07:02.160 --> 07:07.040
So, Jordan, before we do that, let's take a little moment to say hello to one wonk and

07:07.040 --> 07:10.040
then introduce a new development on the podcast.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.040
Interesting.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.040
So thank you so much.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.320
Random dude from Germany feeling better about his national discourse.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.320
Thanks to Alex.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
You are now a policy wonk.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
I'm a policy wonk.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.320
Oh, thank you very much.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.320
I suppose most of Germany.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.320
So Jordan.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
Yes, sir.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.400
I have decided that, look, these birthday things, they're never going away.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.080
It's going to be a struggle.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.800
So I have a new drop for us.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.800
Okay.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.800
All right.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.800
To introduce birthday time.

07:34.800 --> 07:41.080
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

07:41.080 --> 07:46.120
You could say that life is death.

07:46.120 --> 07:52.400
Hey, it's time to give some happy birthday shout outs to folks here on the podcast.

07:52.400 --> 07:58.200
Dan, you never fail to impress me.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
Never.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.720
You never fail to impress me.

08:00.720 --> 08:05.520
So Josie, my birthday was on the first, Andrew got in touch with us, wanted to wish you a

08:05.520 --> 08:06.520
happy birthday.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.520
I'm going to need some time.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.520
I'm going to need some time.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.540
Also like to say happy birthday, Sean, Stalin, Stritch, may your adapt as a start is bring

08:13.540 --> 08:16.240
glory to the Emperor and justice to the globalists.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.240
Okay.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.240
Okay.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.360
I'm back at it.

08:20.360 --> 08:25.520
So Kit, I had a 30th birthday, Basil sent me or Basil, not entirely sure.

08:25.520 --> 08:30.040
I do think that I have been told how to pronounce it and I refused.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.920
I think when people tell me how to pronounce things, it's like, I'm deaf to it.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.560
Oh no, we're Americans.

08:36.560 --> 08:39.120
It's our God given right to ignore British pronunciations.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.880
Anyway, Basil or Basil got in touch with me and wanted me to wish Kit a happy birthday.

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
Happy birthday, Kit.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.200
Also, the two of them just got engaged.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
Congratulations.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.200
Congratulations.

08:49.200 --> 08:54.360
Congratulations on your nuptials, upcoming nuptials, thrilled for you.

08:54.360 --> 09:00.480
And then finally, coming up on the fifth, I guess that's this weekend, this Saturday,

09:00.480 --> 09:04.640
Frank M's got a birthday, 27th birthday, from what I understand.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.640
How about that?

09:05.640 --> 09:06.640
It's almost over for you.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.640
Happy birthday, Frank.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.800
This brings us to a close of the happy birthday shout outs.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.720
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

09:15.720 --> 09:21.000
You can say that life is death.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Happy birthday.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.760
I have a feeling that's going to go down in the Rake Effect Hall of Fame.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.040
Two episodes from now, we're both going to be like, ah, this is normal.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.520
In five episodes from now, I'm going to continue losing my shit every time.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.080
We'll see.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.360
All right.

09:36.360 --> 09:41.560
So the 27th, Alex is in a strange mood and here's another context drop to give you a

09:41.560 --> 09:44.640
little bit of a sense of it.

09:44.640 --> 09:50.040
Oh, my God.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.040
Did I get hired?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.880
No, because that was fake.

09:53.880 --> 09:54.880
That's true.

09:54.880 --> 09:55.880
That is fake.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.560
That is fake.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.320
I do kind of feel personally offended by that laugh.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.880
That was Pillsbury Alex.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.240
Someone was tickling him.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.240
So here we go.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.240
We're going to start the show.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.280
And this is where I actually got on the hook.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.280
Okay.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.840
And sometimes it takes me a little while when I start up an episode for it to be like, I'm

10:15.840 --> 10:16.840
listening.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.840
Sure.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.840
I got on the hook immediately.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.840
Okay.

10:19.840 --> 10:20.840
All right.

10:20.840 --> 10:28.040
I have been brainstorming quite a bit and really thinking about how I want to present

10:28.040 --> 10:32.440
my knowledge, my understanding to the public, what the most important thing for me to do

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
is.

10:33.440 --> 10:38.600
And a lot of what I'm going to be covering in parts of the broadcast that you've heard

10:38.600 --> 10:41.840
before, a lot of it you're not going to have heard.

10:41.840 --> 10:46.840
And I really just think it's important that I cut right to the chase up front here before

10:46.840 --> 10:50.680
I tell you who's coming up today and get to it all.

10:50.680 --> 10:54.400
So for my ears, I hear this as Alex saying, let's cut through the bullshit.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
Yeah.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.040
Look, I got to shoot straight with you.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.040
Yeah.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.040
Yeah.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.040
It's time.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.040
Look, I'm 20 years into this.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.240
It's finally time.

11:03.240 --> 11:07.880
Some of this stuff I've said before, some of it I have not, but it will all be my hand

11:07.880 --> 11:08.880
to God's ears.

11:08.880 --> 11:12.720
Of course, all will be revealed in the fullness of time.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.720
Yeah.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.120
And actually, see, you're saying that like he's been on air for 20 years and he's been

11:16.120 --> 11:17.120
fucking around.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.120
Right.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
That's not actually true.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.120
It sounded like it.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.360
Right before we went live about five minutes before, I just got hit with an extreme clarity

11:24.360 --> 11:28.920
of what I was to go on air and talk about from all the knowledge information we have.

11:28.920 --> 11:35.920
And just you call it a vision, but really it's like a computer program that's been working

11:35.920 --> 11:37.900
on a problem, working on a problem.

11:37.900 --> 11:40.080
And then suddenly it's completed the problem.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.060
Sometimes it takes longer than the computer thinks it will.

11:43.060 --> 11:44.060
Sometimes it happens quicker.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.640
Wait, the computer thinks?

11:45.640 --> 11:49.880
It's like completion in the bell dings and the answer comes sliding out and it was just

11:49.880 --> 11:55.120
a whole nother level of exactly what they're going to do, how they're going to do it, how

11:55.120 --> 11:56.120
they're operating.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.120
Okay.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.400
So, again, Alex has had a moment of clarity.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.960
You know, here's what I was thinking.

12:02.960 --> 12:03.960
Every single day.

12:03.960 --> 12:04.960
You know what I was thinking?

12:04.960 --> 12:09.640
This is the first time in a long time that we have taken some time off and Alex hasn't.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.360
So part of me was like, I wonder what he was thinking.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.600
Like I got free reign now.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.880
I don't have to worry about shit.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.880
Yeah.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.880
Parents aren't home.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
Yeah, exactly.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.480
Now the kids can play all they want.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.480
Hey, Dan and Jordan aren't listening, so I'm going to speak freely.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.480
Yeah, exactly.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.480
I'm going to cut through the bullshit.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.040
Now it's time to cut through the bullshit.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.480
I wouldn't think that was what was on his mind.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.480
No, sure.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
I'm sure.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.120
By now, at 27 years, he's realized that recordings exist.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.120
Doesn't matter.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
Yeah.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.120
Yeah.

12:38.120 --> 12:43.160
It's just, I can't stand this asshole every single day having a vision.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.160
I've had a new vision.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.200
Oh my God.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.000
It was like finally all the pieces clicked into place.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.040
Like you can't do this every day.

12:51.040 --> 12:56.080
I do like that the computer thinks it's going to be over sooner, but unfortunately the computer

12:56.080 --> 12:58.000
took a little bit longer than it was expecting.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.880
Hey man, I mean you're joking around about that, but I have been in a situation where

13:01.880 --> 13:05.240
let's say I'm downloading a game off the PlayStation network.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.240
Sure.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.640
And it says it's 33% done.

13:07.640 --> 13:11.960
And then it says it's going to be done in 30 minutes, then check back in, 40 minutes.

13:11.960 --> 13:12.960
40 minutes.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.960
I mean, who knows?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.480
What was that computer thinking?

13:15.480 --> 13:20.080
All of these computers tell you what they're thinking and it turns out what they're thinking

13:20.080 --> 13:22.040
is wrong.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
It's terrible.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.880
You know, do robots dream of being late for work?

13:26.880 --> 13:28.120
That's what I was thinking.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
Yep.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.120
Yep.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.720
Do robots dream of excuses for tardiness?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.640
So here's the deal.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.920
I think this is what Alex's vision or his new bit of clarity is about.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.760
It has to do with the globalists and their new plan.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.200
Mic down for this because it's absurd.

13:47.200 --> 13:55.280
The headline I wrote right after I sat there in my office for about a minute staring at

13:55.280 --> 14:04.060
the desk is on screen, transcendent transmission.

14:04.060 --> 14:12.760
The scientific dictatorship controlling earth is preparing to launch the great lie or the

14:12.760 --> 14:14.380
greatest of lies.

14:14.380 --> 14:23.040
And that is to obscure the great truth that is already happening.

14:23.040 --> 14:31.040
And that is our human psyche piercing the veil and connecting in an even stronger way

14:31.040 --> 14:35.720
with God and basically mass telekinesis.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.760
And that's what the system's trying to suppress.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.760
Okay.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.760
All right.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.720
Now that's a stinger.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.400
That is a stinger right there.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
All right.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.400
All right.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
All right.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.240
So the globalists are planning something in order to distract from the fact that we've

14:49.240 --> 14:52.280
connected with God and now we can move objects with our minds?

14:52.280 --> 14:53.280
Correct.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.680
Here's, here's my problem.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
Here's my problem.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
All right.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.680
We live in the future.

14:58.680 --> 14:59.680
Yeah.

14:59.680 --> 15:05.800
So I know that despite him saying that the real goal is mass telekinesis, the next day

15:05.800 --> 15:10.240
he's going to be like Fauci released emails like, Oh, would you, there are higher levels

15:10.240 --> 15:12.920
if you've got mass telekinesis on the way.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.640
Well, I want to be clear about something too, because I'm not an idiot.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.040
I know that he means telepathy.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.040
Sure.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.040
Yeah, of course.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.040
Of course.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
Of course.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.040
Yeah.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.920
You can, you can find connections in that kind of thing.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.920
Yeah.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.920
Yeah.

15:25.920 --> 15:26.920
You can, you can speak without speaking.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.920
So right.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.920
Right.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.280
The way you talked about like how he and Trump have a telepathic connection and like, yeah,

15:32.280 --> 15:33.280
that's what he means.

15:33.280 --> 15:39.840
But he just says telekinesis and imagining like that, that that's what he meant is hilarious.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.840
Yes.

15:40.840 --> 15:45.040
Oh, that's like, that's like Isaac Asimov.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.160
Like all of a sudden our brains just grow a little bit bigger in the right spot.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.480
And it's like, yeah, of course we can move shit with our minds.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.480
Yeah.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
I think it was just misspeaking.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.560
And I know that it is, but it's consistent.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.960
We already have mass telekinesis.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.240
Everybody knows it.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.240
Every woman knows it.

15:59.240 --> 16:06.560
Particularly there's even stronger and it it's here and it's not just telekinesis with

16:06.560 --> 16:07.560
each other.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.560
Obviously.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.560
Sure.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.560
Obviously.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.560
So the telekinesis is getting a lot stronger.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.560
Of course.

16:12.560 --> 16:19.520
Whatever reason our genetic development talks to the environment, whatever it is.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.520
The globalists know this, they want to control it and they want to keep the public from understanding

16:23.520 --> 16:24.520
it.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.520
Okay.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.520
All right.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.560
I can't get over him saying telekinesis.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.640
Like seven times?

16:29.640 --> 16:35.080
Like the fact that like just saying the word and then saying, obviously women have it stronger.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.280
Like, oh, that's just so good.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.200
That's such a dumb thing to say.

16:39.200 --> 16:44.660
I also like if you take him just literally at his words and don't, you're not giving

16:44.660 --> 16:48.000
the generosity of understanding like he means telepathy.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.360
Like it's telekinesis, but not just with each other.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.360
Like we can only lift each other.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.360
Exactly.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.360
Yes.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.360
Yes.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.360
Of course.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.360
It's so fun.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
Yeah.

16:58.360 --> 17:02.080
So I think what Alex is gonna get to, I think the point he's trying to make is that humans

17:02.080 --> 17:05.820
have this telepathic connection because of a connection with God and the globalists don't

17:05.820 --> 17:06.820
like that.

17:06.820 --> 17:07.820
They want to control it.

17:07.820 --> 17:10.540
And in order to control it, they're going to come up with a big lie.

17:10.540 --> 17:15.720
And I think the big lie that he's going to say is aliens are going to be revealed.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
Sure.

17:16.720 --> 17:22.160
And this is what he's getting at because he says this, and I mean, this is just childhood's

17:22.160 --> 17:23.160
end.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.600
This is really just the book that he read when he was a child.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
Oh boy.

17:26.600 --> 17:32.680
The different great lies that they're going to launch is going to be alien transmissions

17:32.680 --> 17:33.680
first.

17:33.680 --> 17:34.680
Sure.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.680
Aliens are going to be communicating with the earth.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.440
You'll be told these are aliens and then, oh, we already had contact and they gave us

17:39.440 --> 17:43.840
technology and that's really where all this came from and all the upheaval and the Pope

17:43.840 --> 17:47.680
will endorse it and say that's our God and this is our group and this is what they want

17:47.680 --> 17:48.680
us to do.

17:48.680 --> 17:52.840
And then, oh, there's all these new technologies where you can cure cancer and cure all these

17:52.840 --> 17:53.840
things.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.480
You've just got to accept and do what these entities want who aren't ready to reveal themselves

17:58.480 --> 17:59.480
yet.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.760
That's just the plot of childhood zone.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.760
Yeah.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.760
Yep.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.760
That's basically it.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.420
The aliens that come down and say that we can't reveal ourselves for 50 years until

18:06.420 --> 18:10.360
you're used to us being here because they look like our conception of demons.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.360
Sure.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.360
Sure.

18:12.360 --> 18:18.860
No, I mean, no, the only person who can break through the illusion is obviously Rowdy Roddy

18:18.860 --> 18:19.860
Piper.

18:19.860 --> 18:22.320
You know, naturally that's the way it's got to go.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.240
Or our generation's Rowdy Roddy Piper.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.240
Alex Jones.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.240
Yes, of course.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.240
Of course.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
Yes.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.240
Yes.

18:29.240 --> 18:33.220
So the aliens are going to come down, they're going to give the Pope all these messages

18:33.220 --> 18:36.080
and they're not going to reveal themselves because they didn't in the book.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.560
Is the Pope still in jail in this scenario?

18:39.560 --> 18:43.280
Is that a tough question?

18:43.280 --> 18:44.800
I feel like I stumped you.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.800
I've flummoxed.

18:45.800 --> 18:46.800
Yes.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.000
To be fair, I don't know if Alex is talking to Steve.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Sure.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Sure.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Okay.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
That's fair.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
That's fair.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
That's not a problem for him at this point.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Okay.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.680
So the plan is then once the Pope is doing all this stuff and telling people they have

18:57.680 --> 19:03.400
to listen to the aliens in order to get this technology or something, then there's a threat.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.400
Okay.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.040
All these wonders will be this leader who is able to talk to them and if you just do

19:08.040 --> 19:12.480
what he says, well then everything's going to be okay.

19:12.480 --> 19:18.120
And then we'll learn that this is one of the scenarios they've got so they can play different

19:18.120 --> 19:22.280
ones at different times or all at once, that there's bad aliens coming and we've got to

19:22.280 --> 19:25.760
do some certain things to stop them.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.760
So there's bad aliens that are going to be coming.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.720
Saint Mantis being or shut the fuck up.

19:30.720 --> 19:31.720
That's what I have to say.

19:31.720 --> 19:35.320
If you say bad aliens, you say fucking non-pliadians.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.520
I'm not fucking around with just alien anymore.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.440
What kind of animal do they look like?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.440
Exactly.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.240
Are these the mercantile dogs?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.240
What are we talking about?

19:45.240 --> 19:48.920
I need some specificity in order for this to be any fun.

19:48.920 --> 19:49.920
Exactly.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.520
We've been too far past the aliens are fun.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.440
I've seen people do this better.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.440
Yes, exactly.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.560
Also I thought the plan was plan B and they were just going to give a super bio weapon

19:59.560 --> 20:00.900
in order to kill everyone off.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.080
Why do they need to do that?

20:02.080 --> 20:04.160
Now it's all about theater, Dan.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.640
It's about pageantry, you know, give people a show.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.540
It's bread and circus, man.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.540
That's what it's about.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.940
Then you blow them up.

20:10.940 --> 20:15.240
If the globalists have a plan that was directed to them by the devil that involves a super

20:15.240 --> 20:17.880
bio weapon release that'll kill off the population.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.160
Why do they need to fake an alien landing to get people to do things?

20:21.160 --> 20:25.440
I think we're living in a galactic make a wish scenario.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.720
We're all about to die.

20:26.720 --> 20:30.280
So aliens are trying to give us a good run before we go.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.800
It makes as much sense as anything Alex is saying.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.800
Exactly.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.800
No, it doesn't.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
Does not make sense.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
No.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.920
So I guess that's the big revelation that Alex had because that's when he starts the

20:40.920 --> 20:41.920
first segment off.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.920
Why not?

20:42.920 --> 20:43.920
Yep.

20:43.920 --> 20:44.920
Yep.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.800
And then you have some other really big news that he undersells.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.800
This is huge news.

20:47.800 --> 20:54.060
Frankenstein, the archetype of the mad scientist, chopping different pieces of humans together

20:54.060 --> 21:01.160
and running a high powered electricity through it and reanimating a corpse.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.640
Well now they're actually able to do things very, very similar to that in the real world

21:04.640 --> 21:05.960
so many times.

21:05.960 --> 21:12.720
What humans envisioned hundreds and even thousands of years ago, we are now able to build and

21:12.720 --> 21:15.560
we're able to build it on a mass scale.

21:15.560 --> 21:19.200
But great power comes with all of that.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.200
Sure.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.200
Yeah.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.200
So we've conquered death.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.400
Well, only a little bit.

21:23.400 --> 21:29.040
See, what has to happen is you have to play music and then the body will be kind of ambulatory

21:29.040 --> 21:32.760
in a little dance-y way towards the source of that music.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.760
You know what I'm saying?

21:33.760 --> 21:34.760
Sure.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.760
This is a Weekend at Bernie's 2 scenario.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.760
Okay.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.120
The Weekend at Bernie's 1, we're past that.

21:39.120 --> 21:43.560
Weekend at Bernie's is really kind of like the evolution of human technology towards

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
death.

21:44.560 --> 21:50.080
Well, I mean, I dread Alex seeing that movie and thinking it's a documentary.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
It seems a little bit like it.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.080
Maybe he has.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.080
Yeah.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.080
It seems a little bit like it.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.080
Yeah.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.800
So Frankenstein is real cool.

21:58.800 --> 22:04.360
I don't know where the bottom is in terms of, like, there's just things that I could

22:04.360 --> 22:06.640
say as a joke that he thinks.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.640
Sure.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.640
No, he does actually.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.640
No, no, no.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.640
He actually is suggesting these things.

22:10.640 --> 22:15.360
I mean, he's going through the universal monsters kind of area, you know?

22:15.360 --> 22:17.240
We've already got Dracula's, right?

22:17.240 --> 22:19.400
We've already got Frankenstein's.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.040
I think mummies are next.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.560
He's just trying to create the monster mash.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.640
He's just trying to...

22:26.640 --> 22:32.160
He's just trying to convince people that that graveyard smash is real.

22:32.160 --> 22:36.760
It's the monster mash, plan B. Everyone dies.

22:36.760 --> 22:37.760
That's the monster...

22:37.760 --> 22:42.040
There was the monster swim was the second one that Boris Pickett made.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.480
I believe Black Tuesday is called the monster stark market crash.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.480
Stark market...

22:46.480 --> 22:47.480
Ah, damn it.

22:47.480 --> 22:48.480
I blew it.

22:48.480 --> 22:49.480
There was a...

22:49.480 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, so he had a follow-up called the monster swim.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.120
Yes, that's true.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.880
And then years later, he had the climate mash.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.080
I think he had the birthday mash.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.420
I think he went hard, yeah.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.420
He did a bunch.

23:01.420 --> 23:03.480
None of them worked out except for the monster mash.

23:03.480 --> 23:08.720
It is a little bit like if Cisco had done just various colors of the thong song, like

23:08.720 --> 23:12.240
black thong to thong thong thong, and then just released one next month.

23:12.240 --> 23:22.400
Or a song about a negligee or different items of underwear.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.920
I could see him doing that.

23:23.920 --> 23:28.320
I watched that making of the song video on YouTube.

23:28.320 --> 23:34.720
There's a documentary series about these hits and how they came to be, and I saw the one

23:34.720 --> 23:40.600
about Cisco's the thong song, and I could see him making a series of songs about different

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
undergarments.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
Why not?

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Yeah.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Why not?

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
Everything else he's tried hasn't worked.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
Give it a go.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.320
So Alex is a little bit bent out of shape about stem cells.

23:50.320 --> 23:54.640
It's like paint by numbers, you ever see those you buy at the art store for like five bucks

23:54.640 --> 23:58.360
and it's got the little ink or markers that come with it, you just fill in the little

23:58.360 --> 24:01.740
numbers like it says, then you finally see the big picture.

24:01.740 --> 24:06.960
And so I've just been here on air for 27 years researching for more than 30, and I just started

24:06.960 --> 24:10.240
painting by the numbers, looking at what they were really doing.

24:10.240 --> 24:16.080
And I really learned that when you got to white paper levels and international discussions,

24:16.080 --> 24:18.320
that you'll hear a headline about, oh, stem cells.

24:18.320 --> 24:25.520
A stem cell means a 150 pound humanoid, a human chimpanzee clone.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.600
That doesn't sound true, but I could be wrong.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.600
Stem cell.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
That's a stem cell, man.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.200
I just don't think so.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
Nope.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.720
Sometimes he doesn't paint by the numbers and gets a green unicorn.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.840
Yeah, it's pretty.

24:36.840 --> 24:37.840
Yeah.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.840
See, that's the thing about paint by numbers.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.240
You got to follow the rules or else you come up with the wrong picture.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.240
Yeah.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.240
Yeah.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.240
Yeah.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.800
Why does this just look like brown?

24:47.800 --> 24:48.800
Aww.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.800
Yeah.

24:49.800 --> 24:55.160
Paint by numbers is ostensibly creative, but it's also the least creative thing in the

24:55.160 --> 24:56.160
world.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.160
Yeah.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.160
Because there, if you want the actual picture.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.160
It's already there.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.160
Yeah.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.160
There's numbers.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.160
No.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.560
In the abstract, it exists without you.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.640
You can just imagine that those colors are already there.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.640
You're supposed to.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.840
Also, if you're an adult, you can usually tell what the picture is even without coloring

25:11.840 --> 25:12.840
it in.

25:12.840 --> 25:13.840
That's true.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.840
You've been there before.

25:14.840 --> 25:15.840
Yes.

25:15.840 --> 25:16.840
Yeah.

25:16.840 --> 25:20.320
So humans, 150 pounds in a cage, that's a stem cell.

25:20.320 --> 25:24.600
And this is important because there was just that bill that went through Congress.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
Yes.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.600
Failed to pass.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
Yeah.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.840
And they go on to say rules on stem cells.

25:29.840 --> 25:35.320
And stem cells are defined as anything that comes from a baby or you can say stem cells

25:35.320 --> 25:36.960
are in fat tissue and other things like that.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.060
But the point is, we're having a debate about stem cells, and what we're talking about is

25:40.060 --> 25:43.220
growing humans or humanoids in labs.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.460
That's the definition here.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.800
And they admit it all right here, and then it gets better.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.840
There's video of this.

25:48.840 --> 25:49.840
Here's the article.

25:49.840 --> 25:57.440
48 to 49, Senate defeats Braun, Republican Indiana amendment to prohibit certain types

25:57.440 --> 26:00.040
of human-animal chimeras.

26:00.040 --> 26:04.920
Sixty votes were needed, but it didn't pass.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.920
So did you hear that?

26:05.920 --> 26:12.320
It's legal right now to create human-animal hybrids because there's laws against human

26:12.320 --> 26:14.020
clones.

26:14.020 --> 26:18.960
So there's two things that are going on that Alex is kind of playing with and conflating

26:18.960 --> 26:20.720
in this episode when he's talking about this.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.000
There's one is the bill that got defeated in the Senate.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.200
That was an attempt by the GOP to criminalize genetic research that involved creating embryos

26:28.200 --> 26:29.880
that were chimeric.

26:29.880 --> 26:34.520
And from what I understand, a good thing that did not pass because it seems like it was

26:34.520 --> 26:36.120
a little bit of a Trojan horsey.

26:36.120 --> 26:40.600
Yeah, it was an excuse to just, something about abortion, you know, it always goes back

26:40.600 --> 26:41.600
to that.

26:41.600 --> 26:46.160
Also, so the other thing that he's conflating this with is a recent move that was made by

26:46.160 --> 26:49.260
the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

26:49.260 --> 26:53.760
They loosened their rules about how long a human embryo can be used in experiments.

26:53.760 --> 26:58.760
Previously, they had a standard policy that studies that went beyond 14 days would absolutely

26:58.760 --> 27:00.240
not be done.

27:00.240 --> 27:04.160
But now reflecting advances in technology, they say that these experiments could possibly

27:04.160 --> 27:09.360
done to quote Stat News, quote, only if lots of conditions are met first.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.000
Sure, sure.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.320
We're not going to suddenly have horse people drawing our cars around.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.320
That's we're going to be fine.

27:16.320 --> 27:23.680
So yeah, there's this, Alex is freaking out about these chimeras and what have you, and

27:23.680 --> 27:25.040
it leads him to go to break.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.280
Pretty extreme, pretty extreme.

27:27.280 --> 27:31.360
They're figuring out how to lock you down, how to train you to behave so they can kill

27:31.360 --> 27:32.360
everybody.

27:32.360 --> 27:36.940
Everybody stay in your houses while that happens, while combat robots go up and down the streets.

27:36.940 --> 27:41.840
And so this isn't something that they're just thinking about doing.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.720
This is all set up very, very soon.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.400
You and your family will be killed soon.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.400
Two years, five years.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.400
I don't know.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.920
The timeline's moving quick, but if we don't hold them back, everyone listening is dead.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.000
Okay.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.220
They're going to kill you.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.220
They're going to kill me.

27:56.220 --> 27:57.220
They're going to kill everybody.

27:57.220 --> 27:58.220
We'll be right back.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.220
Stay with us.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.220
That's a bummer.

28:02.220 --> 28:03.220
That's bad.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.220
That's bad.

28:04.220 --> 28:11.240
To some extent, you know, we live in kind of a fairly mundane world.

28:11.240 --> 28:17.040
To suddenly go from that to like, oh, there's robots in the streets and chimeras in my home.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.680
I think that would be at least a little bit more exciting.

28:19.680 --> 28:26.640
Four days ago, I was having a fun hot dog and on San Sui Beach, I come back and I got

28:26.640 --> 28:29.720
to hear Alex saying that everyone's dead.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.000
Everyone's dead.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
It's a jarring.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.060
It's a bit of whiplash.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.060
You doing all right?

28:36.060 --> 28:38.600
Yeah, because I think this is stupid.

28:38.600 --> 28:43.000
I do see your neck perpetually at a 45 degree angle right now, so that might be trouble.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Yeah.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.160
It's, you know, there's that standard thing about like, you know, if you just keep moving,

28:51.160 --> 28:55.080
it's not hard to keep moving, but when you stop, then you start moving again.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.240
It's like, whoa.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.240
Object at rest.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.240
Yeah.

28:58.240 --> 28:59.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:59.240 --> 29:04.360
I think that Alex is obviously full of shit and everything, but it is, it is a little

29:04.360 --> 29:10.400
bit, it's a little bit a nude after a week of not listening to him to come back and hear

29:10.400 --> 29:15.320
like you and your family, everybody listening to the show will be dead within five years

29:15.320 --> 29:19.440
if we don't stop my enemies.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.040
It's comically overt.

29:21.040 --> 29:25.720
It's like when I take time off, I start to doubt myself.

29:25.720 --> 29:30.400
I start to doubt these like, ah, Alex isn't as crazy as I think he is.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.920
It can't be real.

29:31.920 --> 29:32.920
It cannot be real.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.480
It's not like he says within two to five years, everyone listening will be dead.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.480
Like come back.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.760
Nope, that's exactly what he does.

29:39.760 --> 29:45.240
No, it makes you realize how like, I totally get, when you're, when you've been doing this

29:45.240 --> 29:50.720
nonstop for a long time, you know, you forget how real people react to this kind of stuff

29:50.720 --> 29:54.320
where they're like, you're the one who's a conspiracy theorist.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.640
There's no way that anyone would get away with that.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.920
And then you come back and you're like, I'm a conspiracy theorist.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.280
This can't be real.

30:02.280 --> 30:05.280
This can't be real.

30:05.280 --> 30:09.360
So how do we, how do we discuss this next clip?

30:09.360 --> 30:10.360
Let's see.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.920
Um, the globalists, right?

30:11.920 --> 30:12.920
Sure.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
They have a plan.

30:13.920 --> 30:14.920
Yeah.

30:14.920 --> 30:15.920
Heard it.

30:15.920 --> 30:16.920
They have a lot of plans.

30:16.920 --> 30:17.920
At least two.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.160
Apparently super bio weapon kill off.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.160
Sure.

30:20.160 --> 30:24.080
Maybe that's plan A and B. Plan C involves aliens coming down and not

30:24.080 --> 30:26.400
revealing themselves through the post.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.920
Then telling us that there's bad aliens that are coming and we've got to do something in

30:29.920 --> 30:33.120
order to stop the bad aliens that will be counterproductive to us.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.120
Who knows?

30:34.120 --> 30:35.120
Yeah.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.120
Turns out there's a plan D.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.120
Oh no.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.120
And that is that they're going to replace us with computers.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.120
Oh, that's nice.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.920
But I mean, it's really very simple.

30:41.920 --> 30:46.680
What humans can envision, we can end up building.

30:46.680 --> 30:53.320
And what we've gotten to at this point is free energy, massive live extension, super

30:53.320 --> 31:00.160
computers, way more powerful than what you're currently even aware exist.

31:00.160 --> 31:05.400
And the decisions have been made to basically go ahead and go operational with a system

31:05.400 --> 31:12.120
that will make us obsolete, obsolete in their words, these computers won't recognize beauty.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.400
These computers won't have our ancient history.

31:14.400 --> 31:20.880
These computers didn't create the computers like we did, but there is a dark anti-human

31:20.880 --> 31:22.440
force pushing this.

31:22.440 --> 31:38.600
And by the way, I could have opened the whole show up and just made this very, very simple.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.760
And that's, we're being replaced.

31:42.760 --> 31:47.800
I know that Alex is talking about robots, but still when I hear somebody who has the

31:47.800 --> 31:53.760
politics that Alex has worrying about, we are going to be replaced.

31:53.760 --> 31:58.600
It kind of, you know, it exists in a certain linguistic space.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.760
It's something that isn't without baggage.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.760
Yeah.

32:01.760 --> 32:08.160
You know, the way he's talking is like a person in like the early eighties who was like, computers

32:08.160 --> 32:09.480
are the devil.

32:09.480 --> 32:14.960
You know, computers are going to the soul, but the devil's mark.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.200
But we don't live there.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.280
He uses computers all the time.

32:18.280 --> 32:24.280
He lives in a world where computers are perfectly fine and people are evil, you know, or the

32:24.280 --> 32:26.000
people he wants to tell you are evil.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.440
Computers are ethically neutral.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.440
Yes, exactly.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.440
Yeah.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.440
Yeah.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.440
Yeah.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.440
I don't know.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.680
I just get, I just get a little worried.

32:34.680 --> 32:39.400
Fears of replacement are generally not, they're not good openings.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.220
Well, you know, what comes after that is usually bad.

32:42.220 --> 32:47.840
It's a little bit like the space racism we deal with where it's like, oh, they're evil

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
cat beings.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.800
But you're like, that's code for something else.

32:50.800 --> 32:54.540
Like when the great replacement theory, you can't just be like, nah, nah, nah, nah.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.720
It's computers that we're worried about and not have me be like, is this Jews again?

32:58.720 --> 33:01.160
I feel like this is Jews again, you know?

33:01.160 --> 33:05.000
And I know that Alex doesn't really care that much about workers rights, so it couldn't

33:05.000 --> 33:07.760
really be a conversation about like automation in the workplace.

33:07.760 --> 33:08.760
Totally.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.760
No, it's not like there's, we need more grocery people.

33:10.760 --> 33:11.760
Yeah.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.760
Yeah.

33:12.760 --> 33:13.760
I don't know.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.760
It's just, it's a word that I don't like hearing.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.440
So we have one, one more thing here about the globalist, okay.

33:20.440 --> 33:25.340
And the globalist argument is if you don't resist this under survival of the fittest

33:25.340 --> 33:33.760
and social Darwinism, you deserve what happens to you.

33:33.760 --> 33:40.880
And so it's all about humans being a commodity, mass smuggling of children for sex abuse,

33:40.880 --> 33:42.440
for slave labor.

33:42.440 --> 33:50.280
But really it's about committing crimes in God's eyes, having you do nothing so that

33:50.280 --> 34:00.260
the spiritual hedge of protection can be removed from us so that everyone can be attacked.

34:00.260 --> 34:08.560
And so this is very sophisticated interdimensional galactic warfare.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.960
And that's what you face.

34:09.960 --> 34:10.960
Oh boy.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.240
Tough, tough to wrestle with that.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.240
Is it?

34:14.240 --> 34:15.240
No.

34:15.240 --> 34:16.240
It's not.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.240
He's so confident.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.480
I feel like I need to ask.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.480
Yeah.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.480
That's part of the trick.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.480
That is true.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.480
Yeah.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.240
So the first thought that he has there is that the globalist believe if you don't fight,

34:26.240 --> 34:28.080
you deserve what happens to you.

34:28.080 --> 34:32.720
That's essentially just something to be cribbed from Silent Weapons from Quiet Wars, which

34:32.720 --> 34:36.640
is the first chapter in Bill Cooper's book, Behold a Pale Horse, that the globalist believe

34:36.640 --> 34:38.120
you're a meat on the plate.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
Sure.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
You're never meant to be slaughtered.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.120
Yes.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.120
That kind of thing.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
Yeah.

34:43.120 --> 34:49.560
And then the second part is just that if you don't defend God's law, then you make us all

34:49.560 --> 34:55.160
susceptible to God's punishment, which the only thing that could really lead towards

34:55.160 --> 34:56.160
is a theocracy, right?

34:56.160 --> 34:57.160
It has to.

34:57.160 --> 35:03.440
I mean, a complete civilization that's designed entirely around adherence to strict religious

35:03.440 --> 35:04.440
rule.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.440
Yeah.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.440
You know.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.440
That's not good.

35:07.440 --> 35:11.680
religious rules are really great when they're in power and allowed to kind of go unchecked.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.120
Everybody knows that from history.

35:13.120 --> 35:16.480
I just hear nonsense here.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.480
Also.

35:17.480 --> 35:21.480
Was the interdimensional galactic warfare part a little bit nonsense or was that the

35:21.480 --> 35:24.440
part where you're like, wow, we don't need to worry about that, obviously.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.440
That's true.

35:25.440 --> 35:29.620
I mean, that's the closest to like, I'll let it slide.

35:29.620 --> 35:37.400
It's arguably hyperbole, you know, it's like, I mean, I know he's not speaking metaphorically,

35:37.400 --> 35:39.760
but you could hear that and be like, eh, whatever.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.960
The other stuff is just like contextually weird.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.960
Yeah.

35:43.960 --> 35:51.720
I don't, if Alex believes that doing things that are against his religious rules make

35:51.720 --> 35:57.400
everybody susceptible to God's wrath because God removes the hedge of protection, then

35:57.400 --> 36:03.380
the only way to keep everyone safe is to make sure that everyone is forcibly adhering to

36:03.380 --> 36:07.020
God's rules according to his version of God.

36:07.020 --> 36:14.560
And to me, I find that to be an incredibly fucked up way to conceive of how society should

36:14.560 --> 36:15.560
be organized.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.560
Yeah.

36:16.560 --> 36:23.920
I mean, the ironic part about it, I think is something similar in practice is what we

36:23.920 --> 36:28.080
all tried to do to defeat a disease to a certain extent.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.080
Do you know what I mean?

36:29.080 --> 36:35.560
Like we have to, we have to allow a certain amount of like, oh, we are locking down in

36:35.560 --> 36:41.160
order to keep, you know, if everybody, if people don't act in everybody's interest,

36:41.160 --> 36:45.880
then the susceptibility of that disease is spread throughout everybody.

36:45.880 --> 36:50.720
So he's fine with the tactics of, I think, I think, you know what I'm saying?

36:50.720 --> 36:54.320
I think your thought is interesting and I do see a little bit of a parallel.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.560
I'm not saying it's one to one, of course.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.560
Yeah.

36:57.560 --> 37:02.520
And I think what I think is most interesting about Alex's conception is the divine rat.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.000
Yes.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.600
As opposed to the actual genomic rat.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.600
Yes.

37:08.600 --> 37:13.480
The actual causally determinative chain of events.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.840
The obvious wrath.

37:14.840 --> 37:15.840
Yeah.

37:15.840 --> 37:16.840
Yeah.

37:16.840 --> 37:17.840
I don't know.

37:17.840 --> 37:23.200
I don't, I don't feel like it's possible for Alex to contain this kind of thinking

37:23.200 --> 37:28.040
and this, this idea set and also actually believe in the first amendment.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.040
That's true.

37:29.040 --> 37:36.640
You can actually believe in freedom of religion if you believe that breaking God's rules makes

37:36.640 --> 37:38.040
the hedge of protection go away.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.040
Wow.

37:39.040 --> 37:42.280
I mean, one of the commandments is you should have no other God than me.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.280
Sure.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.840
You're breaking a commandment if you follow another religion or you don't follow a religion.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.840
Totally.

37:47.840 --> 37:51.280
I mean, how could you follow, how could you believe in freedom of speech if the government

37:51.280 --> 37:55.800
has to, I guess, murder you for taking the Lord's name in vain?

37:55.800 --> 37:56.800
You know what I'm saying?

37:56.800 --> 37:59.880
The penalty for sin is death, obviously.

37:59.880 --> 38:05.800
It would be, it would be a challenge, certainly, to believe in a republic.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.300
It would take some work.

38:08.300 --> 38:11.000
I think we're seeing a little bit of some flaws.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Yeah.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.360
So Alex has a guest and I just think this is hilarious.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.680
We're not going to talk about him at all, but I think it's really hilarious that this

38:17.680 --> 38:21.720
dude is showing up after the beginning of this bullshit and still expecting to be taken

38:21.720 --> 38:22.720
seriously.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.640
All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and James O'Keefe is just getting into the

38:26.640 --> 38:27.640
studio.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.640
Put the sports jacket on, I think.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.000
We're going to get him here on in a moment.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.240
Really big breaking news, but please don't forget that it's listeners and viewers like

38:35.240 --> 38:40.600
you that make this broadcast possible and all the incredible breaking news that we bring

38:40.600 --> 38:45.160
out is just critical to all of our futures and the future of our species and all our

38:45.160 --> 38:46.160
children.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.160
So I thank you for your support.

38:47.160 --> 38:51.560
We have a big Memorial Day special to honor the veterans and folks that have served.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.360
So yeah, we got James O'Keefe coming up.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.360
Sure.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.840
James, would you like to talk about how Frankenstein is real?

38:57.840 --> 38:58.840
Yeah.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.840
Um, actually...

38:59.840 --> 39:01.960
Hey, James, you're a real serious reporter.

39:01.960 --> 39:03.880
Let's talk about mass telekinesis.

39:03.880 --> 39:08.480
He did an undercover sting operation inside of Frankenstein's castle, actually.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.560
You know what's ironic?

39:10.560 --> 39:13.480
He could actually do an amazing sting operation on Alex.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.640
Yes, he really could.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.640
He really could.

39:16.640 --> 39:20.520
If he just brought a hidden camera into a regular conversation with Alex, he would get

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
everything.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.440
Perfectly situated to sting the shit out of Alex.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.640
God damn it.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.640
God damn it.

39:25.640 --> 39:26.640
Somebody...

39:26.640 --> 39:27.640
He can be turned, right?

39:27.640 --> 39:28.640
He can be turned from the dark side.

39:28.640 --> 39:29.640
It's just a matter of money.

39:29.640 --> 39:30.640
Yeah, right?

39:30.640 --> 39:33.960
Just give him two billion and he'll be like, yeah, I'll fucking kill Alex Jones' career.

39:33.960 --> 39:34.960
I don't care.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.240
God, I wish that would happen.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.240
That'd be interesting at least.

39:37.240 --> 39:41.480
Yeah, we gotta get a billionaire on our side to just throw money at fake people.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.240
The further irony, though, is that if he did sting Alex, I don't think I would believe

39:45.240 --> 39:46.240
it.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.400
I couldn't trust it because it's still coming from him.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.960
Ah, the dangers of lost credibility.

39:51.960 --> 39:52.960
Yep.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
So I don't care.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.480
Alex O'Keefe has a, I guess, another Facebook story.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.480
I don't care.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.480
Whatever.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.480
Whatever.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.760
And one of the reasons I don't care is because Alex has an interesting story to tell.

40:02.760 --> 40:08.240
They've gone from this all being in white papers and textbooks and, you know, very low

40:08.240 --> 40:15.720
circulation books that these, you know, Zbigniew Brzezinski and people like Klaus Schwab would

40:15.720 --> 40:19.760
write in the past and John P. Holdren and...

40:19.760 --> 40:20.760
Real quick.

40:20.760 --> 40:24.720
John P. Holdren's book, Ecoscience, wasn't a low circulation book.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.720
It was a textbook.

40:25.720 --> 40:26.720
Yeah.

40:26.720 --> 40:27.720
Yeah.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.720
It's not like...

40:28.720 --> 40:29.720
It wasn't a mass market paperback that failed.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.720
It wasn't like a flop.

40:30.720 --> 40:36.720
It was the front of like Barnes and Noble trying to push Holdren to Ecoscience.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.720
Yeah, exactly.

40:37.720 --> 40:38.720
Yes.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:39.720 --> 40:44.480
The rest of them, David Rockefeller, Club of Rum documents, secret documents.

40:44.480 --> 40:50.320
I was given a whole bunch of archive secret documents out of the Bilderberg Group, out

40:50.320 --> 40:55.560
of the Senate archives that pulled up a motorcycle in Virginia when I was covering Bilderberg

40:55.560 --> 40:58.000
there and just said, here, have this.

40:58.000 --> 41:06.760
And it was all how in the 60s, the Bilderberg Group took over the US unions for the deindustrialization

41:06.760 --> 41:10.480
project and explaining why they were going to deindustrialize the US.

41:10.480 --> 41:13.320
And we published them on Infowars and no one even cared.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.200
Probably because you got them from a random guy on a motorcycle.

41:16.200 --> 41:21.400
So a random guy on a motorcycle handed me papers and people don't believe me.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.520
It's basically Deep Throat, isn't it?

41:24.520 --> 41:29.200
You meet in a parking garage or a random dude on a motorcycle drives up towards you.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.440
No big deal.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.960
It's like the Yakuza dropped off some papers.

41:32.960 --> 41:33.960
Yeah.

41:33.960 --> 41:38.840
I think that this is probably just like John Birch Society-esque literature and ideas because

41:38.840 --> 41:45.240
it's talking about just like infiltrating the unions, obviously there's workers kind

41:45.240 --> 41:50.080
of ideas of unionization or something that are antithetical to the Patriot movement.

41:50.080 --> 41:54.720
So you might as well say that there's no point in unionization because it's also owned by

41:54.720 --> 41:56.520
or yeah, or it's infiltrated.

41:56.520 --> 42:00.360
Not only infiltrated, it's a plot in order to destroy America.

42:00.360 --> 42:01.920
Yeah, of course.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.520
So I just love the idea of Alex sitting there, some guy on a motorcycle comes up, he's like,

42:05.520 --> 42:09.800
I've got all the archives at the secret globe.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.800
He's just standing there in this circumstance?

42:11.800 --> 42:15.240
He's in Chantilly, Virginia, because I remember when he went there.

42:15.240 --> 42:16.240
I do, yeah.

42:16.240 --> 42:19.200
Also, I don't know, I mean, I've watched the video of him down there.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.920
Certainly a lot of the video of that is in one of his documentaries, I think.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.920
Yeah.

42:23.920 --> 42:24.920
Is it Endgame?

42:24.920 --> 42:25.920
I'm not sure.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.360
I've definitely seen the video of him in Chantilly.

42:27.360 --> 42:32.640
I don't remember a guy on a motorcycle coming up and giving him an archive of secret globalist

42:32.640 --> 42:34.960
Bilderberg documents.

42:34.960 --> 42:39.040
I don't remember him going back to his hotel room and freaking out that some guy on a motorcycle

42:39.040 --> 42:40.240
gave him an archive.

42:40.240 --> 42:41.240
Okay.

42:41.240 --> 42:44.320
Now, we're both imagining this.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.320
How is he holding these documents?

42:47.320 --> 42:51.760
Does he have a briefcase that's like handcuffed to his wrist and he has to go through a process

42:51.760 --> 42:52.760
to give it to him?

42:52.760 --> 42:57.080
Is he just wearing a messenger bag and he's like, ah, here you go.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.840
Is it like in Oceans 12 or whatever where the, you know?

43:00.840 --> 43:06.360
I'm guessing it was Daniel Estelan on a motorcycle and they just gave him his stupid book.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.360
Yeah.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.680
So there's big news on the white supremacy front.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.800
And that is that Alex has found a triangle.

43:12.800 --> 43:18.480
And I mean, it's super interesting to have the overt white supremacy, socially unacceptable

43:18.480 --> 43:22.240
stuff written up by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL now being taught in more

43:22.240 --> 43:23.880
than 20 states.

43:23.880 --> 43:31.360
This particular one is from Maryland and Virginia and it says, fathers are a form of covert

43:31.360 --> 43:34.260
white supremacy.

43:34.260 --> 43:35.260
It says parental.

43:35.260 --> 43:36.260
Parental.

43:36.260 --> 43:37.260
Just parental.

43:37.260 --> 43:39.960
Right here it says parental.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.080
I'm going to cover that later.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.080
Here just zoom in on over here guys.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.160
Right here is the zoom in area.

43:45.160 --> 43:51.040
So what he's got is a triangle and it has like at the top there is a line.

43:51.040 --> 43:54.040
So there's a smaller triangle and then the bottom of the triangle.

43:54.040 --> 43:59.440
Smaller triangle is the unacceptable white supremacy and it's things like the Klan, lynchings,

43:59.440 --> 44:00.440
stuff like that.

44:00.440 --> 44:06.120
And then underneath is the more subtle, you know, it's like that iceberg metaphor.

44:06.120 --> 44:11.120
Underneath is the sort of covert forms of white supremacy and Alex thinks that fathers

44:11.120 --> 44:12.120
are one of them.

44:12.120 --> 44:13.120
Okay.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.880
However, I went and I watched the video because I can't find this triangle anywhere else and

44:15.880 --> 44:17.880
I'm like, I got to go find him.

44:17.880 --> 44:21.120
And I looked at it and it turns out Alex just doesn't know how to read.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.120
Sure.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.120
He thinks it says parental.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.120
It says paternalism.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.120
Oh God.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.120
Okay.

44:26.120 --> 44:31.360
Merriam-Webster defines paternalism as quote, a system under which an authority undertakes

44:31.360 --> 44:35.380
to supply needs or regulate conduct of those under its control and manners affecting them

44:35.380 --> 44:39.960
as individuals as well in their relations to authority and to each other.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.720
Paternalism is essentially believing that you can restrict another person or group's

44:42.720 --> 44:46.160
actions because you understand their own good better than them.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.900
Alex has no idea about the words, let alone concepts he's covering.

44:49.900 --> 44:54.080
He's taking a piece of paper that claims that paternalistic attitudes contribute to covert

44:54.080 --> 44:55.080
white supremacy.

44:55.080 --> 44:58.780
And the way he reports it is that the SPLC and ADL are saying that having fathers is

44:58.780 --> 44:59.780
white supremacist.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.420
This guy's a fucking idiot.

45:01.420 --> 45:02.460
That's a jump.

45:02.460 --> 45:03.720
That is a bit of a jump.

45:03.720 --> 45:08.360
But I honestly don't think he knows that it doesn't say parental.

45:08.360 --> 45:11.000
That would be most likely I would say.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Yeah.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.360
It feels like he misread that, got mad about it.

45:15.360 --> 45:19.480
And whether or not he's realized he's wrong, it's too good for him not to be mad about

45:19.480 --> 45:20.480
it.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.480
Yeah, totally.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
It's embarrassing as hell.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.280
No, once he got what he wanted, I'm sure he never read it again.

45:25.280 --> 45:26.280
Yeah.

45:26.280 --> 45:28.880
It's not like he was like, wait, I got to double check this.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.880
That's never happened.

45:29.880 --> 45:30.880
True.

45:30.880 --> 45:31.880
Yeah.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.880
Yeah.

45:32.880 --> 45:33.880
Yeah.

45:33.880 --> 45:34.880
Whatever that is, is under attack.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.880
Sure.

45:35.880 --> 45:36.880
And you're like, well, that sounds crazy.

45:36.880 --> 45:37.880
Well, no, it's not crazy.

45:37.880 --> 45:42.640
They're getting rid of who would protect the family.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.640
Parentalism.

45:43.640 --> 45:49.000
I mean, parentalism isn't just supporting a father.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
You can't keep saying it.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
It's supporting parents.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.880
You can't keep saying it.

45:53.880 --> 45:57.240
Parentalism is believing in the nuclear family.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.240
You can't invent it.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.880
And it says that's racist.

45:59.880 --> 46:00.880
That's not real.

46:00.880 --> 46:07.080
I'm not sure that parentalism is a widespread concept.

46:07.080 --> 46:10.480
I was thinking that he could have misspoken, but still understood the word.

46:10.480 --> 46:11.480
You know, like telekinesis.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.480
Sure.

46:12.480 --> 46:13.680
When he was like, he's using the wrong word.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.680
He means telepathy.

46:14.680 --> 46:15.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.680
And then he went further.

46:16.680 --> 46:17.680
And said, parentalism.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.320
And he said, parentalism?

46:19.320 --> 46:20.680
And it's about parents.

46:20.680 --> 46:25.640
So we know for a fact, he does not understand what was being said.

46:25.640 --> 46:29.520
No, but I still think it could be an instance of him misreading the word and then never

46:29.520 --> 46:31.120
checking again.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.120
Sure sure.

46:32.120 --> 46:33.120
Either way, it's embarrassing.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.120
It's pretty funny.

46:34.120 --> 46:37.440
But it is also like, yeah, I'm glad you brought that up, because it is so different than the

46:37.440 --> 46:39.440
other misuse of the word.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.440
Exactly.

46:40.440 --> 46:43.120
Like the telekinesis thing is just funny.

46:43.120 --> 46:46.360
It's like, okay, I get you mean telepathy.

46:46.360 --> 46:47.360
With telekinesis.

46:47.360 --> 46:50.000
Alex is creating parentalism as a thing to be mad about.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.560
Out of whole cloth.

46:51.560 --> 46:53.720
That may or may not be an actual word.

46:53.720 --> 46:58.960
I mean, I could find some uses of it online, but it's definitely not like a word people

46:58.960 --> 46:59.960
use.

46:59.960 --> 47:00.960
No, it's not.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.960
You don't find it cited in psychiatry papers.

47:03.960 --> 47:10.120
Covert rights supremacy would not have that as one of the things.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.960
Parentalistic attitudes, though.

47:12.960 --> 47:16.160
I mean, oh no, I did the Alex.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.160
Paternalistic.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.160
Yes.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.340
I stopped him.

47:19.340 --> 47:20.340
My eyes went wide.

47:20.340 --> 47:22.080
I was like, what's going to happen now?

47:22.080 --> 47:23.080
Oh no.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.800
Alex got into my head.

47:24.800 --> 47:31.960
So most of the middle of the show, middle to end of the show, is about Alex, well, not

47:31.960 --> 47:37.480
most of it, but a good chunk is about Alex talking about Joe Biden, the president.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.480
Sure.

47:38.480 --> 47:46.400
Apparently he's blaming the victims of the Tuskegee experiments for black vaccine hesitancy.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.840
He's blaming the victim.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.080
Well that's what Alex says.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.080
Okay.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.840
I have a hard time believing that, but let's continue.

47:51.840 --> 47:56.400
Well, here's Alex talking about it and then the clip of Biden that's used to rationalize

47:56.400 --> 47:57.400
this.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.400
Okay.

47:58.400 --> 48:04.160
Giving a speech today, Joe Biden blames black vaccine hesitancy on Tuskegee airmen.

48:04.160 --> 48:10.120
The first blacks since the civil war allowed in combat who did an excellent job.

48:10.120 --> 48:13.720
So he blamed black men, some of which had their families injected with syphilis that

48:13.720 --> 48:18.760
came out and killed or tortured over long periods of time, it's very painful.

48:18.760 --> 48:22.000
These were allowed to be infected overall by the tens of thousands that were injected.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.920
It wasn't just blacks that got it, it was everybody.

48:24.920 --> 48:29.200
And Joe Biden now blames them, the victims for what happened.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.800
You say, well, he's an old man.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.800
Yeah.

48:31.800 --> 48:35.160
He should be, you know, at a nursing home, not molesting children, not molesting our

48:35.160 --> 48:36.160
country anymore.

48:36.160 --> 48:43.160
So here he is blaming the very blacks from Alabama, many and more from there, Tuskegee

48:43.160 --> 48:48.520
airmen who were victimized with a secret government experiment telling them it was a vaccine.

48:48.520 --> 48:52.840
For polio when it was syphilis now blaming them for what they did to him.

48:52.840 --> 48:57.680
So even as the demon in him just lies so much, you can't stop here.

48:57.680 --> 49:04.960
I asked one person to do nothing but deal with equity, equity, to make sure that we

49:04.960 --> 49:11.600
were reaching out into minority communities, which by the way, and many of the older members

49:11.600 --> 49:18.340
of that community had memories of experimentation on black Americans that were not told about

49:18.340 --> 49:23.680
like what happened to the Tuskegee airmen and all those tests.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.800
I shouldn't laugh.

49:25.800 --> 49:26.800
It's just so sick.

49:26.800 --> 49:27.800
Yeah.

49:27.800 --> 49:32.320
The Tuskegee airmen, like when their souls were leaving their bodies, when they died,

49:32.320 --> 49:35.520
like Casper, the friendly ghost, they were sure flying high up.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.680
You killed him, huh?

49:36.680 --> 49:41.220
So what happened is that Biden kind of misspoke and he said Tuskegee airmen, which were the

49:41.220 --> 49:45.200
group of black fighter pilots in World War II, when he was referencing the Tuskegee experiments.

49:45.200 --> 49:49.760
This is an unfortunate gaffe and if Alex's point here was that Biden doesn't know the

49:49.760 --> 49:54.300
difference between the two uses of the word Tuskegee, I'd say that's probably a stretch,

49:54.300 --> 49:55.300
but whatever.

49:55.300 --> 49:56.300
I don't really care.

49:56.300 --> 49:57.300
Yeah.

49:57.300 --> 50:00.540
Using this clip to argue that Biden is blaming the victims of the experiment for vaccine

50:00.540 --> 50:03.460
hesitancy though, that's absurd.

50:03.460 --> 50:04.460
That's nonsense.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.780
I was listening to this clip.

50:05.780 --> 50:10.060
It's really, that doesn't say anything close to what Alex is suggesting.

50:10.060 --> 50:15.040
It's very clear that what Biden is saying is that the memory of this, of course, this

50:15.040 --> 50:17.260
stain on American history.

50:17.260 --> 50:18.260
Of course.

50:18.260 --> 50:24.800
This shame is what would contribute to people being hesitant to trust rollouts of large

50:24.800 --> 50:28.060
vaccine programs.

50:28.060 --> 50:30.780
That thought is, it makes sense.

50:30.780 --> 50:31.780
Yeah.

50:31.780 --> 50:32.780
And it's what he's expressing.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.740
No, it's Alex is not missing the point.

50:35.740 --> 50:39.980
He is like cutting the points, Achilles tendons, and then burying it alive in the backyard.

50:39.980 --> 50:43.420
Like this is, this is way, way out of control.

50:43.420 --> 50:44.420
Yeah.

50:44.420 --> 50:48.500
And then a little bit later, Alex makes the exact same mistake by of course, what's the

50:48.500 --> 50:49.500
name of that major rapper.

50:49.500 --> 50:53.540
I listened to him in the eighties, but I told my wife that this rap group that does these

50:53.540 --> 50:54.540
pro vaccines.

50:54.540 --> 50:55.540
She didn't believe until she saw it.

50:55.540 --> 50:56.540
Who are they?

50:56.540 --> 50:57.540
What's the name of the rapper?

50:57.540 --> 50:58.540
I forget.

50:58.540 --> 50:59.540
It's super famous.

50:59.540 --> 51:00.540
Run DMC.

51:00.540 --> 51:07.660
They've got a new one where it shows Tuskegee airmen and our Tuskegee folks and says, yeah,

51:07.660 --> 51:10.020
we injected you, but we don't do that anymore.

51:10.020 --> 51:13.020
We don't do experiments anymore when it is an experiment.

51:13.020 --> 51:16.340
I mean, Alex did the exact same slip that Biden did.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.200
It's an easy mistake to make.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.220
It's unacceptable in one circumstance.

51:20.220 --> 51:22.940
And if you do it like, Oh no, no, no, it was a mistake.

51:22.940 --> 51:26.100
You know, he, he was blaming them and I made a mistake.

51:26.100 --> 51:27.100
Yeah.

51:27.100 --> 51:28.100
Yeah.

51:28.100 --> 51:29.100
It's just a stupid game.

51:29.100 --> 51:30.100
Yeah.

51:30.100 --> 51:35.420
So Rand Paul, uh, he's, he's made some disparaging comments about Fauci at this point.

51:35.420 --> 51:36.420
Sure.

51:36.420 --> 51:41.140
And so Alex believes that he's going head to head with the enemy and maybe that means

51:41.140 --> 51:42.620
that he should be president.

51:42.620 --> 51:46.340
But Alex had a chance to support 2016 failed.

51:46.340 --> 51:47.340
Yeah.

51:47.340 --> 51:50.900
This is Rand Paul who deserves a lot of support on prayers.

51:50.900 --> 51:52.060
He's going directly at the enemy.

51:52.060 --> 51:53.380
It's why he's getting death threats.

51:53.380 --> 51:58.100
He's why he's been shot at twice, been physically attacked twice, twice had his ribs broken,

51:58.100 --> 51:59.100
his lungs punctured.

51:59.100 --> 52:04.700
That was a long argument and he has a good heart.

52:04.700 --> 52:05.700
Very presidential material.

52:05.700 --> 52:08.700
I'd like to see him president in the future.

52:08.700 --> 52:11.660
Maybe him and his Santas make a nice mix.

52:11.660 --> 52:14.300
But I don't care if there were two black guys or two women, I don't give a damn.

52:14.300 --> 52:15.900
There were two black women like those guys.

52:15.900 --> 52:16.900
I'd be all for them.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.780
Vote for them in one second.

52:18.780 --> 52:19.780
But yeah, they're two white males.

52:19.780 --> 52:22.780
I mean, who else, who else is there, folks?

52:22.780 --> 52:25.020
Don't give a damn about them being white.

52:25.020 --> 52:29.740
But the point is, is that, uh, you know, Bolsonaro's white, he's fighting the world order.

52:29.740 --> 52:34.380
I mean, I'm just saying, uh, get some black folks running for office, talking like them,

52:34.380 --> 52:35.380
I'll vote for them.

52:35.380 --> 52:42.180
Uh, but, uh, can't believe we even have to have a discussion about that, about who cares

52:42.180 --> 52:43.180
what color somebody is.

52:43.180 --> 52:44.300
It's about getting the job done.

52:44.300 --> 52:45.560
But I digress.

52:45.560 --> 52:46.560
You do digress.

52:46.560 --> 52:47.560
That is true.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.660
You can't believe that we have that conversation?

52:49.660 --> 52:50.660
Yeah.

52:50.660 --> 52:52.460
You're the one who brought it up.

52:52.460 --> 52:54.020
Yeah, I certainly didn't.

52:54.020 --> 52:56.580
I wasn't like, I wonder if Bolsonaro's white.

52:56.580 --> 52:57.580
I didn't think that.

52:57.580 --> 53:01.540
I wasn't like, that's a question I need him to answer before he finishes this sentence.

53:01.540 --> 53:02.540
I did.

53:02.540 --> 53:03.540
That was not on the top of my mind.

53:03.540 --> 53:04.540
It wasn't there.

53:04.540 --> 53:09.700
It certainly wasn't also my first response that I would have to the idea of a Rand Paul

53:09.700 --> 53:11.100
DeSantis ticket.

53:11.100 --> 53:12.100
Yeah.

53:12.100 --> 53:14.900
My primary complaint with them would not be, it's two white dudes.

53:14.900 --> 53:15.900
There's two white dudes.

53:15.900 --> 53:16.900
That's a big, yeah.

53:16.900 --> 53:21.620
I feel like there would be some policies that I would be, uh, really offended by first.

53:21.620 --> 53:22.760
Yeah.

53:22.760 --> 53:25.980
All I hear is Alex being like, baby, come back.

53:25.980 --> 53:29.580
You can blame it all on me.

53:29.580 --> 53:30.580
That's all I hear.

53:30.580 --> 53:32.780
It's, um, uh, oh, to Rand?

53:32.780 --> 53:33.780
Yeah.

53:33.780 --> 53:34.780
Yeah.

53:34.780 --> 53:35.780
Yeah.

53:35.780 --> 53:36.780
Man.

53:36.780 --> 53:41.900
It's, it's having gone through that, the disenchantment period with Rand Paul during

53:41.900 --> 53:45.780
the lead up to the 2016 election, it's pretty funny to hear him say stuff like this because

53:45.780 --> 53:48.820
he knows he blew it.

53:48.820 --> 53:54.480
Yeah, no, there's, there's just, you'll, you'll, he got off the Paul boat.

53:54.480 --> 54:01.800
I wish I could stop being at least a little bit surprised at how Craven, you know, no

54:01.800 --> 54:06.780
matter how Craven I see them, I'm still like, you're that Craven?

54:06.780 --> 54:08.060
Oh man.

54:08.060 --> 54:12.620
Just, well, in a week he's going to pretend that he didn't say that there's a fake alien

54:12.620 --> 54:16.580
invasion that's coming and they're going to not be able to reveal themselves and then

54:16.580 --> 54:19.100
they're going to tell us eventually bad aliens are coming.

54:19.100 --> 54:20.100
Totally.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.100
Yes.

54:21.100 --> 54:22.100
How can I be surprised?

54:22.100 --> 54:23.100
How can I be surprised?

54:23.100 --> 54:26.600
He expects you to not remember that a week ago he had a big revelation right before he

54:26.600 --> 54:27.600
got on air.

54:27.600 --> 54:28.600
Yeah.

54:28.600 --> 54:29.980
He's got a lot of revelations though.

54:29.980 --> 54:31.260
I think you just expect him to have.

54:31.260 --> 54:33.980
He's jangling keys the radio show.

54:33.980 --> 54:34.980
It's ridiculous.

54:34.980 --> 54:38.860
That'd be a fun, that'd be a more fun radio show to listen to.

54:38.860 --> 54:39.860
Certainly.

54:39.860 --> 54:40.860
Less ads.

54:40.860 --> 54:41.860
Yeah.

54:41.860 --> 54:44.020
Um, so he said a lot of extreme stuff on this episode.

54:44.020 --> 54:47.100
Some of it not as hateful as usual, some of it just kind of dumb.

54:47.100 --> 54:48.100
Right.

54:48.100 --> 54:49.660
Um, but you should know this.

54:49.660 --> 54:50.660
We discredit these guys.

54:50.660 --> 54:53.060
We send them to prison or they're going to kill everybody.

54:53.060 --> 54:54.060
It's us or them.

54:54.060 --> 54:55.060
Okay.

54:55.060 --> 54:56.060
Seriously.

54:56.060 --> 54:57.060
I mean every damn word I'm saying.

54:57.060 --> 54:58.060
Stay with us.

54:58.060 --> 54:59.060
It means everything.

54:59.060 --> 55:00.060
Stay with us.

55:00.060 --> 55:01.060
It means everything.

55:01.060 --> 55:04.820
Well, earlier in the show Alex had said that it's going to be open phones in the third

55:04.820 --> 55:05.820
and fourth hour.

55:05.820 --> 55:07.580
He's getting really pumped for it.

55:07.580 --> 55:08.580
Uh.

55:08.580 --> 55:09.580
Can I guess how many calls he takes?

55:09.580 --> 55:10.580
Yeah.

55:10.580 --> 55:11.580
So I'd love that.

55:11.580 --> 55:12.580
Three.

55:12.580 --> 55:13.580
Zero.

55:13.580 --> 55:14.580
Oh.

55:14.580 --> 55:15.580
Damn it.

55:15.580 --> 55:18.380
I was, I was really, I was really going out on a limb going more than zero.

55:18.380 --> 55:21.460
I kind of expected zero, but I was really hoping.

55:21.460 --> 55:25.380
I feel like whenever you take that bet, it should be zero or the field.

55:25.380 --> 55:26.740
Yes, exactly.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.660
The over under is one.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.660
Is point five.

55:30.660 --> 55:31.660
Yes, exactly.

55:31.660 --> 55:32.660
Yeah.

55:32.660 --> 55:33.660
Uh, yeah.

55:33.660 --> 55:34.660
So he takes none.

55:34.660 --> 55:39.140
Um, and apparently he couldn't have taken open phones in the fourth hour because initially

55:39.140 --> 55:41.660
he had Matt Bracken scheduled to host the fourth hour.

55:41.660 --> 55:42.660
Right, right, right, right.

55:42.660 --> 55:43.660
But apparently there were problems.

55:43.660 --> 55:44.660
Oh.

55:44.660 --> 55:45.660
Matt Bracken had some technical difficulties today.

55:45.660 --> 55:53.180
He does a great job when he hosts Thursday's fourth hour and he's, uh, can't do it.

55:53.180 --> 55:57.580
So Owen Schroyer's coming in in the fourth hour because I've got a bunch of things I'm

55:57.580 --> 55:58.580
working on.

55:58.580 --> 56:01.820
I don't want to host the fourth hour, but I've got big stories we're working on that

56:01.820 --> 56:04.460
are huge, very important behind the scenes.

56:04.460 --> 56:05.460
I'm gonna leave it at that.

56:05.460 --> 56:06.460
I'm gonna leave it at that.

56:06.460 --> 56:08.020
He had to go to family court.

56:08.020 --> 56:09.020
Yeah.

56:09.020 --> 56:13.460
Uh, so he's going fishing with my daughter.

56:13.460 --> 56:21.420
This is a, the night I believe that his ex wife was trying to live stream a court appearance

56:21.420 --> 56:22.420
on YouTube.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.420
Cool.

56:23.420 --> 56:28.540
Because as I understand, her argument is that these are supposed to be open here.

56:28.540 --> 56:29.540
Sure.

56:29.540 --> 56:35.940
And people should know what's going on, like what, what's, and so I, I would assume that

56:35.940 --> 56:38.380
that's more what was on Alex's mind than a big story.

56:38.380 --> 56:39.380
Yeah.

56:39.380 --> 56:42.140
He had this court date that was possibly going to be live streamed.

56:42.140 --> 56:45.900
Yeah, that would be, that would be somewhat, I think, terrifying for him.

56:45.900 --> 56:46.900
Yeah, I would think so.

56:46.900 --> 56:47.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:47.900 --> 56:52.180
Uh, but look, that's, even at this point in the show, that's in the future.

56:52.180 --> 56:53.180
Yeah, sure.

56:53.180 --> 56:57.460
We have to worry about the now because now it's time to cover news.

56:57.460 --> 56:58.460
Okay.

56:58.460 --> 56:59.460
I got to hit all this.

56:59.460 --> 57:05.900
Um, I got a bunch of other huge COVID news as well, and some really scary stuff that

57:05.900 --> 57:06.900
makes me really mad.

57:06.900 --> 57:14.220
And also the abomination stuff, all this cloning because our cells are designed and the ancients

57:14.220 --> 57:17.700
said this, but now they've mathematically scientifically proven it to resonate with

57:17.700 --> 57:19.580
the universe that God made.

57:19.580 --> 57:25.100
Like we're a musical instrument and the atmosphere is a musical instrument and trees are a musical

57:25.100 --> 57:27.060
instrument is the best way to describe it.

57:27.060 --> 57:33.820
But energetically through the dimensions, it's like a sound wave is, is the easiest

57:33.820 --> 57:34.820
way to describe it.

57:34.820 --> 57:39.220
It's not what it is, but with our limited senses, it's like trying to teach Helen Keller

57:39.220 --> 57:43.260
how to read, write and talk when she couldn't hear and couldn't see, but she finally could

57:43.260 --> 57:45.780
figure it out because there was, it was innately in her.

57:45.780 --> 57:50.980
The archetypes were there, you know, being a very passionate, very well-spoken person

57:50.980 --> 57:56.020
through communication wild, but it could only, you know, took years to get through to her,

57:56.020 --> 57:57.020
but it was there.

57:57.020 --> 58:04.220
So trying to describe this in third dimensional terms is, uh, let's just say, uh, it's, it's

58:04.220 --> 58:12.140
limiting, but trying to describe what I, you know, you know, it's weird.

58:12.140 --> 58:17.220
It tastes like, I just don't know how it is.

58:17.220 --> 58:22.420
He could really somehow be offensive towards Helen Keller.

58:22.420 --> 58:25.620
Like Helen Keller didn't do any work.

58:25.620 --> 58:32.280
It's that the people broke through her, her defenses in order to get to what was already

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
there inside.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.940
She had to do some work to minimize that.

58:35.940 --> 58:36.940
That's what he said.

58:36.940 --> 58:43.420
Oh, you're being offensive to her efforts that she redoubled and read, you know, like

58:43.420 --> 58:47.340
somehow out of nowhere, you're offensive to Helen Keller.

58:47.340 --> 58:48.340
Yeah, it is.

58:48.340 --> 58:53.040
It is a little, it's, it seems like a stray thought a little bit.

58:53.040 --> 58:59.020
And I would guess that the people who worked with Helen Keller wouldn't say like, damn

58:59.020 --> 59:00.020
just thing.

59:00.020 --> 59:01.020
It's lucky.

59:01.020 --> 59:02.020
The archetypes were there.

59:02.020 --> 59:03.020
No kidding.

59:03.020 --> 59:04.020
Yeah.

59:04.020 --> 59:06.060
I'm guessing that that wouldn't be the way that they would describe it.

59:06.060 --> 59:07.060
I doubt it.

59:07.060 --> 59:12.260
Um, so yeah, the universe, yeah.

59:12.260 --> 59:13.260
Musical instrument.

59:13.260 --> 59:14.260
Sure.

59:14.260 --> 59:18.080
I know that when I like, uh, was, I think it was in fourth grade, my parents made me

59:18.080 --> 59:21.900
learn a musical instrument, but they said I couldn't play like drums or guitar cause

59:21.900 --> 59:23.380
they didn't want me to be in a rock band.

59:23.380 --> 59:24.380
Sure.

59:24.380 --> 59:25.380
So I took up the tree.

59:25.380 --> 59:30.220
I didn't, I didn't know where that was going and you got me.

59:30.220 --> 59:31.220
You got me?

59:31.220 --> 59:32.220
I played the tree.

59:32.220 --> 59:33.940
I'm going to give you that one.

59:33.940 --> 59:36.420
That one's an unqualified win for you.

59:36.420 --> 59:37.420
Thanks.

59:37.420 --> 59:40.900
Um, yeah, so our bodies are musical instruments.

59:40.900 --> 59:41.900
Sure.

59:41.900 --> 59:42.900
There's sound waves, the universe, whatever.

59:42.900 --> 59:45.820
Well, they're not actually sound waves, but that's the best way to describe them.

59:45.820 --> 59:50.060
Look, in the third dimension, it's hard, it's limiting to talk about these things, which

59:50.060 --> 59:51.260
I don't know what these things are.

59:51.260 --> 59:52.260
I don't know what's going on.

59:52.260 --> 59:54.220
I thought we were going to get to COVID news.

59:54.220 --> 59:55.980
This is, I don't know what's happening.

59:55.980 --> 59:56.980
I do.

59:56.980 --> 59:59.420
I do like the, uh, scientists have proved it.

59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.420
The ancients.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.420
Everything's kind of like sound waves.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.420
Yeah, the ancients said it first.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.420
Of course.

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:04.420
Yeah.

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.420
Yeah.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.420
The music of the spheres, Dan.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.420
Don't try and cut out the ancients.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.420
Apologies.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.420
That's very rude.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.420
Yeah, it is.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.500
So what I've done now is I have just made cuts.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.100
Uh, this is just, this is one long statement.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.100
Yep.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.100
Yep.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.100
Okay.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.100
He is in a weird place.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.100
We are talking for the news.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.100
We are not.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.100
All right.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.580
We are talking about our bodies being musical instruments in the third dimension or something.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:31.020
Look, dude, this is a mess.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.040
This is a very primitive level of God's creation.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:45.740
As fantastic as it is, this, um, when it comes to creational matter, very thin, sure.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:52.540
This dimension is very, very thin and if you call it below that, that's a human term, but

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:58.340
in the lower dimensions, which again exists and have been proven, uh, it's even more empty.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.260
It's more empty in the lower dimensions.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.260
Right.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.260
But that's a human term.

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.380
The lower it's up and down, you know, it's just a human thing.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.340
Uh, no.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340
Yes.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340
Just refuse.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.860
Like it or not, this is happening.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.860
Refuse.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.860
Now we go back for vacation.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.500
I refuse to hear someone say this dimension is thin.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.500
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.620
This dimension is thin on a creational level.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.220
What does that mean?

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.500
Look in the third dimension, third dimensional words are limiting.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.500
I don't know what that means.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
No, neither does he.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.500
Just saying shit.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.500
Oh, you know, the space below human term naturally more empty.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.460
Is it, is, does that mean it's thinner?

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.460
I think so.

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.940
But again, that's a human term.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.940
Right.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:46.940
But I mean, let's...

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.940
I suspect.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.100
Let's engage with it on that level.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.860
So we're, we're talking all the difference between the levels of dimension is really

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.300
measurable by thin or thickness.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.220
I mean, you know, in the new age communities, whenever they talk about like these higher

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:03.420
vibrations and stuff, it's often referred to as a higher density.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.420
Sure.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.100
So maybe Alex is taking that as like actual denseness.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.820
I really, I really, okay.

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.380
That could be what's going on.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.340
You can float easier in the fourth dimension.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.420
I would assume that you can the third dimension.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:22.060
No, I would, I would assume if you have a lower density, you'd float more, right?

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:28.020
Oh no, cause you're talking about the environment is denser.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.020
Yeah.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.020
Yeah.

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.020
Yeah.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.020
I had it backwards.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.020
I had it backwards.

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.020
All right.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.020
I had to stop and think.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.020
Yeah.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.060
Look, we're engaging with too much even cause he's not even taking us there.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.620
He's just saying it's thin creationally.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.740
You don't just get to say that.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.740
Now.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:49.460
I actually think that the next thing he brings up is a good thought.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.460
Maybe if you're high.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.460
Interesting.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:55.180
And you're in college and you're sitting around with your friends and that thought is this.

01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:01.100
We always imagine that like if aliens were to come down and contact us, they'd be so

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.860
much more advanced than us, man.

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.860
You know, that kind of thing.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.980
I think we've, we've experienced this in the Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.140
Sure.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.140
With the Moon Knights.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.140
Yes.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:16.020
We've experienced this in plenty of media depictions, but yeah, of course.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.340
I mean, we have a bias towards anything that would contact us would have to be far more

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.340
advanced than us.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.340
And maybe that's not the case.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.440
Well, I mean, if we can't contact them, but they can contact us, that would suggest that

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.220
at least on some level, they have an ability that we don't.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.220
On one level.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.220
Right.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.220
The contacting across whatever.

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.220
Right.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.220
That's all we know for sure.

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:40.660
And we're theoretically opening the possibility to a intergalactic spacefaring race that still

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.260
fights with clubs.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.260
It's possible.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.260
I suppose.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.660
Anything in this great big marble of a world.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.660
Okay.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:50.780
Anyway, that's the decent thought.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.220
I'm going out of my way to give some credibility or credence here because the rest of this

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.220
thought is stupid.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.220
Okay.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:02.460
So we tend to think of interfacing with other things and like, oh, it must be advanced.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:09.700
No, anything that would actually try to interface with us without our free will is low.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.700
Wow.

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:18.660
Other than Lucifer, who does come from one dimension higher, down to our dimension to

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:23.820
try to then ally with all the other dark energy or dark's not even the right word, fallen

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:24.820
energy.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.820
Dark is a human word.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.820
Right.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.820
Right.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.820
Right.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.820
Fallen.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.820
Right.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.820
That's their word.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.820
That's their word.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.620
I mean, maybe what he's trying to say is that Satan isn't really a bad guy, but he just

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.180
needs to breathe thinner air.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.340
I mean, no, I don't think so.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.340
Okay.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.340
Although that does kind of...

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.340
Kind of tracks.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.820
It tracks with some of the other ideas he has.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:55.180
No, Satan is one level higher and he's allying with the stuff to, who knows why.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.820
No, I'm not messing with that.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.820
Right.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:59.060
I'm not messing with the why on this one.

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.060
No, certainly not.

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.060
Yeah.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.060
Yeah.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.060
I got nothing.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.060
Nope.

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.060
Let's just move on.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.060
Okay.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.060
Dark's not even the right word.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.060
Fallen energy.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:17.060
I mean, to a human brain seeing it, it means there's no creation.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.060
What?

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.060
Darkness just means devoid of light.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:24.060
Well, that's not like a black road sign.

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.060
That's just absorbing light.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.060
That's not...

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:31.980
So, it's not the proper term, but we have to create our own terms to even understand

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:37.500
an interface with the cosmos, which itself, again, is just an expression of God.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.620
And I'm not an animist.

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:43.540
I'm not saying to these troglodyte preachers that aren't really Christians, but think they

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.060
are Pharisees, that I worship the creation.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.060
No, no, no.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.700
I don't worship the creation.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.820
I'm saying God made all this.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:55.940
And if I create a piece of art, that is an expression of who I am.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.420
I made that.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:03.980
And that is a very primitive form of, imagine God making us, but imagine making something

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.380
that has consciousness and free will.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.380
Well, guess what?

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.260
God gives you a little taste of that.

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:14.860
It's why the Old Testament tells you quite a few times, we're made the image of God.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.740
We're not God, but we're little g.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.740
Okay.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.540
What do you take away from that?

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.820
Let's see.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.540
What do I take away from...

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:28.100
I think it's blasphemy.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.100
Well, interesting.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.100
Make your case.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:39.100
Well, the idea of comparing yourself to God by simply changing the size of the g would

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:46.620
still technically really be construed as calling yourself somewhat equal to God, which I think,

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:52.420
now I don't know if I've read the Bible enough times, but that one's pretty big on the don't

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.820
do scale.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:54.820
Yeah.

01:06:54.820 --> 01:07:00.140
I mean, you know, what is made in the image of really me and phew.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.140
Telekinesis.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.140
Totally.

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.140
Yes.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.180
A million percent.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.180
Yes.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.180
Yeah.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.580
I was looking for a thesis.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.820
I'm not finding it.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.380
I think that was your mistake.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.380
That was.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.700
And it's a mistake I continue to make.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.020
It's something that, it's a lesson I refuse to learn.

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.100
I accept that.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.980
So, you know, you have an interesting perspective that you think that changing the capitalization

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.700
on God doesn't mean all that much.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:28.700
No.

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.420
I think Alex thinks it does.

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:31.780
Of course he does.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:37.420
But also he thinks he's got the personal connection to God that gives him visions all the time.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.680
So there's that.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.820
But he's not God capital.

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:41.820
Sure.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:42.820
Sure.

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.820
Right?

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:44.820
Satan.

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.820
Okay.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.220
He comes down from his address, which is in just the level above us.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.220
Alex has his address, actually.

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:51.220
Right.

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.220
No.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.220
It's in the dimension right above us.

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.220
48.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.220
Yeah.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.220
He comes down and he's like, hey.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.220
Hey.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.220
How you doing?

01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.220
You're God.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.220
Satan tries to convince you that you are God.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:05.660
Does Satan get a capital S in the fourth dimension and a lowercase s in the third dimension?

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:06.660
I never thought about it.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.340
I always considered it to be a proper noun.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.340
Yeah.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.340
Me too.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.340
Like it's a name, right?

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.820
But if God's fungible, I feel like Satan's fungible.

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.940
Oh, it's too confusing.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.900
We're not God, but we're little g.

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:21.460
And Satan goes all the way and goes, oh, no, no, you're even better than God.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.460
You act.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.460
Well, no, you're fallen.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.860
Okay.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.340
But that's what they tell you in things like 2001 Space Odyssey, that after you go through

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:35.260
this process, you come back as a star child, reincarnated to like a sperm, implant the

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.260
egg that is earth and create the new Lucifer race.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.700
Well, that's just satanic poppycock, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.420
Satanic poppycock.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:49.820
I thought it was maybe a little bit long, but I didn't necessarily construe it as satanic

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.820
poppycock.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.820
Satanic poppycock.

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:52.820
Huh?

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:53.820
Well, that's fair.

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:57.700
I feel like you are not the most reliable cinematic reviewer if you didn't pick up on

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:58.900
the satanic poppycock.

01:08:58.900 --> 01:08:59.900
That's possible.

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.900
That's possible.

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:01.900
Because it was overt.

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:02.900
Yeah.

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:05.580
I missed that in Ebert's review, but I suppose it was all unspoken.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:06.580
Right.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.140
Siskel was all about the satanic poppycock.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.660
I give it two thumbs down for Satanism.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.660
Yeah.

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.660
Develery.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:22.220
So it turns out, actually, you know, the stuff in 2001 A Space Odyssey might be just as real

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.220
as Frankenstein.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.220
Okay.

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:25.220
Okay.

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.980
Well, that's that's just satanic poppycock, ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:34.900
But I am explaining that the devil creates facsimiles or counterfeits of what God has

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.900
actually created.

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.900
And I can tell you the stuff that came up with 2001 Space Odyssey with the primitive

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:50.580
special effects is very close to actually what's going on.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:51.740
And I'll just leave it at that.

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:54.220
But don't hit all this news.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.220
Yeah.

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.220
You need to get back to.

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.220
Yeah.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.220
Tell me more about that.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.220
Tell me more about that.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.220
I want to know more about that.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.900
Well, 2001 A Space Odyssey is actually very real.

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:07.460
They were very close to accurate with their rudimentary special effects.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:10.460
So I got to get back to the news.

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.460
Yes, you do.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.540
On a certain level.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.540
For me.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.860
Please do not.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.220
So how dare you say something like that?

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:23.660
How dare you introduce this idea and then be like, ah, what's in the news?

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.420
Boo.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:33.540
So 50 years ago, special effects were very similar to what they had then.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:39.460
So would you say that special effects have gotten better enough that they are what they

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.700
have now?

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:45.620
Or is it like proportional?

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:51.840
Are special effects true to what reality was 50 years ago, and now it's 50 years ahead

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.840
of what we have?

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.620
I mean, it would have to be, right?

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.620
Right.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.620
That's the only thing that makes sense.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.140
If they're implanting, if the evil globalists are implanting secret messages that control

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:07.740
all of cinema and media, it's not like they wouldn't give access to secret technologies

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.380
for special effects.

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.380
Right.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.380
So Andy Serkis only has a career because of aliens.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.500
I think that's what I'm hearing.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.900
I think that's what I'm hearing.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.900
Yeah.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:23.340
I don't know about that, that whether or not the cinema world is privy to those futuristic

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.340
technologies.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:27.500
I'm just going to go ahead and say Kong vs. Godzilla is real.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.500
Sure.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500
Yeah.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:34.140
I mean, I'm getting to get back to the news, that's where this sort of excursion into lunacy

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.140
ended.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.140
Boo.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.140
I know.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.420
That weirded me out so much.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:46.260
Like I was like, what are you trying to express?

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:54.420
It seems like just kind of a bit of standard shit header-y from like new age space conspiracy

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.420
communities.

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.420
Sure.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.460
I could hear Rogan saying some dumb nonsense like that.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.380
That's not far off from what dumb nonsense Rogan spouts, right?

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.780
I could see somebody who wouldn't get invited on Rogan, but really wants to.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.780
Almost there.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:09.780
Almost there.

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:13.180
On that one tier below where you got to be.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.220
I don't see a lot of depth here.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:20.540
I just see killing time, rambling about nonsense.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.540
Sure.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.860
And then Alex gets angry about his nonsense.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.860
Sure.

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:29.900
This is only an experience of free will that God created, because the only thing God can

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:36.460
create separate from God's all knowing, all powerful, all controlling, omnipotent, omnipresent,

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:42.540
beyond 12th dimensional total completeness is creatures with free will that create other

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:48.660
creatures with free will and the capacity to interface with this time space continuum

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:52.420
galacticus beyond.

01:12:52.420 --> 01:13:00.380
That is the secret to all of it that we have been made by a all powerful sentient creature

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:07.820
that created everything and doesn't want to be alone.

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:14.780
And so put us on this planet away from other things so we don't kill everything while we

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.500
run around inside our nursery.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:25.860
And what does God put in the nursery to test his creation puts a lot of nasty stuff.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.060
That's weird.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:28.700
What a weird God.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.340
What a weird guy on the radio.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.340
Yeah.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.380
You know what I was thinking while I was listening to this?

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:40.740
I was like, this, Alex is turned into like the, like, I remember when I was growing up,

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:47.100
there was the small town church that had like 15 to 20 people in it and everybody avoided

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.100
them.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.300
And I don't want to know what goes on there.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.580
It's none of our business and we just stay out of it, you know?

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:54.580
It's loud.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:55.580
Yeah.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:56.580
Yeah.

01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.740
There's, there's something going on, but we just, it's a, it's like a black hole in the

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.460
small town where everybody just kind of avoids it out of instinct.

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:06.820
I think I might've gone to a couple of those churches and I think I know what you mean.

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:11.420
And then there was one moment in his thing that really hit home, like in that way for

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.420
me.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:18.060
And that is the, like when he's yelling about like, we were created by an all powerful beast.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.300
And then there's the pause and the, who doesn't want to be alone.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.300
Exactly.

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:27.140
It's the anger, the pause, and then the soft delivery of this idea that like created us

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.700
to keep him company or whatever.

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:30.700
You can hear it.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:36.460
Like I've been to a church where there were snakes before.

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.980
I've heard this, you know?

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:38.980
Yeah.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:43.980
That rhythm and cadence is, is, is very a tent preacher kind of, kind of vibe.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:48.700
And then the other thing that I thought about when I heard that clip was about like the

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.460
naming of his website as prison planet.

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:55.500
It's really interesting to me the way that like, if you think that he's just this guy

01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:00.180
who's into political conspiracies and like, Hey, if a one world government comes into

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:03.480
place and they turn into a tyrannical dictatorship, right?

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.020
We are on a prison planet.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.500
You can't get off.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.140
If there's nowhere to run, if there's a one world government that's in control of everywhere

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.660
on earth, it is a prison planet.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:19.940
But if you look at it the way he's kind of talking now, it's more like, you know, the

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.900
earth nursery idea.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:28.300
It's kind of like, he's saying that like, you know, I'm in a crib, I'm in a crib and

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.620
this weird God threw a scorpion in here.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.620
Sure.

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.620
Yeah.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.980
You know, Hey, I got pushed into the deep end when I was five and you swim or you die,

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.420
you know, it's that kind of thing.

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.420
Yeah.

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:44.900
It also implies that there's a bunch of other aliens on other planets or humans on other

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:48.860
planets that have gone through whatever we're going through right now.

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:56.300
Well, I mean, if God's lonely, it stands to reason that maybe he's lonely enough to make

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.740
more, you know?

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:01.260
And so he's just running this shell game of the universe all the time.

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:07.380
I would, I would suggest that maybe, uh, how is it possible that if the whole thing is

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:11.340
because God's lonely, why is he still lonely?

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:15.420
It's a, you know, it's escalation, you know, you, you get what you want and you find out

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.600
you just want more, you know, that's how it works.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.700
God's not immune to that kind of thing.

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:27.020
It seems like there's a lot of people who've lived.

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.100
If you need some company, there's plenty of options.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.100
Yeah.

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.740
You know, on the other hand, why does anybody die at all if he's so lonely?

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:34.740
Hmm.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.620
Why not just make some people and keep them around and party?

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.620
Well, cause it's a test.

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.900
You gotta, you gotta be in the nursery.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.900
Sure.

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:42.900
Gotta deal with the scorpion.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:43.900
Right.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.420
And then get out of the crib or something.

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.420
Yeah.

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.420
It almost kind of...

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.420
It's babyish.

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.420
It's a really babyish idea.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:54.260
Well, I mean, really it's similar, it's more similar, I would say to the wheel of reincarnation

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.420
than anything else.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:00.420
You know, that idea of like, you're constantly being tested through, throughout time until

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:05.980
you become a full being and then you ascend beyond it.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:11.140
Yeah, but I don't know, I don't know how Alex's ideas about reincarnation work exactly.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.140
I know that he thinks that you're literally your ancestors.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.140
True.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.140
And all that.

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.140
Right?

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.140
Right?

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.820
But I don't know how that works with ancestors that are concurrently alive.

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.460
Hmm, that's fair.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.780
I don't, I don't, I don't really understand any of that.

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:28.060
And I don't know where you go in between or it doesn't really articulate a lot of that

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.060
stuff.

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:35.780
I mean, I don't know if it is like a situation where, where he believes in, in the reincarnative

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:36.780
tests.

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:37.780
Right.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.780
Right.

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:39.780
Right.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:40.780
It's not the good place, you know, that kind of thing.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:41.780
Yeah.

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:42.780
It's weird.

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.780
Yeah.

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.780
That is weird.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:45.780
Anyway.

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:46.780
Yeah.

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:47.780
I think this is dumb.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.780
Yes.

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.500
So there is some news and Alex has been building up to this news, but I didn't realize it.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.780
I have such a hard time remembering that this has got a news part on it.

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:58.860
Let me just show you the big news because if I covered this last hour, no one would

01:17:58.860 --> 01:17:59.860
care.

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.260
So I built it up for an hour so that you would care.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.260
And I'm not mad at you.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.260
I'm the same way.

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.060
I didn't feel like he'd been building this up for an hour.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:08.300
He told me all about the fourth dimension.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.300
Yeah.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.300
I felt like he got distracted about bullshit.

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.300
Yes.

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.300
Yes.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.620
He hasn't been teasing it.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.620
No.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:17.620
He's been ignoring it.

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.220
I know teasing Alex.

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:21.820
We've experienced that over and over again on this show.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:22.820
It's something that he does.

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:23.820
Roll down your windows.

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:24.820
Yeah.

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:25.820
Yeah.

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.820
Yeah.

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:31.540
And I will need you to go stand over the highway with your bandung video.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.540
Totally.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.540
Yeah.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.540
Exactly.

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.540
Yeah.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.540
Yeah.

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:37.540
Yeah.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:38.540
That's not the behavior he's been engaging in here.

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:39.540
If anything, he's escapist.

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.540
Yes.

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:41.540
So anyway, here's the big news.

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.540
Here it is.

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:45.980
But this just broke about an hour ago, or at least when I learned about it.

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:51.660
Major study by the University of Louisville.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:58.560
Masks don't show any signs or any evidence that they helped stop the spread of COVID.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.560
There it is.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.740
Masks didn't slow COVID spread.

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:02.120
New study finds.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.740
So this is a non peer reviewed study that came out.

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:10.340
And there's people who have some questions about the methodology of it.

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:15.300
And even under ideal circumstances and assuming that it goes through peer review and stands

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:20.100
up to scrutiny, it still isn't saying that masks aren't effective.

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:25.900
It was looking at larger populations and making estimates based on whether or not mask mandates

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.620
had an effect on a larger population.

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.020
That's a good study.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:36.220
As opposed to on an individual level, whether or not masks had any effect in terms of actual

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.220
transmission.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.220
Right.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.580
There are plenty of studies that have actually looked at the question that Alex is pretending

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.620
this study answers.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:48.220
And they have routinely shown that they do, they are effective.

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.860
Maybe not 100% effective, but they are effective in as much as it's something you can do.

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:53.860
Right.

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:54.860
Right.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:55.860
Right.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.860
Right.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.860
Right.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.860
As opposed to nothing.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:19:59.860
Yeah.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:00.860
Anyway.

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:01.860
So this is about something different than what he's saying it is.

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:09.700
And then secondarily, it's too early to really take it as solid, like a bedrock of reporting

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.700
because it's just sloppy.

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.700
Anyway.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:21.220
If he says studies say, I always hear you say, he's referencing a non peer reviewed study.

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.780
Like that's the next sentence.

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:26.540
That's something that, it's weird.

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:31.300
You know, like when he says a study, it's some non peer reviewed thing that's on like

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:36.860
a preprint or something and maybe we'll get peer reviewed or maybe won't.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.420
And then you'll just forget about it and you'll never know where it ends up.

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.420
Yeah.

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.420
It's the same thing with bills.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:47.500
If you look back at these pastimes on his show and he actually talked about news more,

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.780
he would have these bills that he'd complain about and they are always things that ended

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:52.180
up dying in committee.

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:56.540
They're always bills that are like, can you believe someone's doing X, Y, or Z?

01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:01.860
It's like, I can, but I also know that that is never going to even get a vote.

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.060
It's kind of the same thing.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:08.060
He's preemptively making everything a huge deal.

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:13.760
And that's one of the reasons why I can't do the coverage of the police state three

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.340
that I wanted to do.

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:26.260
It's almost entirely about Patriot Act Two that doesn't happen.

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:33.500
Studies say next sentence, non peer reviewed, HB 2033 next sentence died in committee.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:40.020
So we have one last clip here, and this is a good indication and example of why everything

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.340
in Alex's world is a trap.

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:49.000
Biden orders us Intel to analyze information on possible Wuhan lab leak.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.500
That means cover it up, have his hand picked Stooges and now have a 90 day research, which

01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:00.920
he ordered it by the way, killed, but now he can organize a new team to lie to everybody.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.920
That's the translation there.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.920
You don't need me to tell you that.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:11.820
So if, if Biden doesn't investigate the theory that there was a lab origin to the coronavirus,

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.180
and it's a cover up, and if he does do an investigation of it, it's a cover up.

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:17.180
Yeah.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.180
It doesn't matter.

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.620
The reality and what happens don't matter.

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:21.900
The spin is intact no matter what.

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.900
Yep.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:29.180
The only way Alex would allow for something to be real would be if Trump himself was running

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:35.540
this commission, and the only conclusion that they even accepted from the beginning is that

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:43.700
not only was this a bioweapon release that came out of that lab, but she single handedly-

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.860
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:47.860
Yeah.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:53.840
And it actually is a special kind of virus that actually, if you look at the molecules,

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:56.180
it spells out communism.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.980
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.700
It's got Xi Jinping written on the virus, you know, like that level of bullshit.

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:11.140
Yeah, yeah, and that's why, you know, a lot of this stuff is just, it should be taken

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:14.940
seriously in as much as like there's dangerous consequences of it.

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:15.940
Sure, sure.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:20.780
And it is illustrative of bad thought patterns, certainly.

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:25.620
But like when you hear stuff like that, like you should recognize that like this is how

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.620
he treats everything.

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740
Everything is a trap.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.740
Yep.

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:30.740
Doesn't matter.

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.740
It's pathetic.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:32.740
Yeah.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:33.740
I hate it.

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:37.980
Biden could do X, Biden could do Y, either way, the decision tree for what Alex is going

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.100
to say about it is the same.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.380
Yeah, it's like preparing for a disaster.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:47.380
You hate, you say that preparing for the disaster makes it happen, if it does happen, or if

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:52.120
it doesn't happen, you say that by revealing that the preparation for the disaster would

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.340
make it happen, you stopped the disaster.

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:58.980
Yeah, or talking about these bills, the die-in committee, or, you know, like, hey, you know,

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.340
the only reason to die-in committee is because we talked about it.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.340
Yeah, totally.

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:04.060
It's just a trap.

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:09.180
Yeah, you create a universe where you always win, and then you never have to feel bad about

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:12.540
yourself, so why would you go back to the real universe, you know?

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.060
Yeah, sounds fun.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.060
Anyway, Jordan, this has been fun.

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.060
We're back.

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.060
It's great to be back, Dan.

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:20.060
You know what?

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060
We had such a good time.

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:28.100
I want you to play the birthday one again, too.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.100
That one still tickles me.

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.100
Can't do it.

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.100
You have to wait until next time.

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:32.100
Not yet.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.100
Not yet.

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.100
Okay.

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:37.380
So yeah, we'll be back, Jordan, on Monday, and I hope to have gotten a little bit more

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:40.780
through the Fauci emails by then, a little more time.

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:41.820
But until then, we have a website.

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.820
We do have a website.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:43.820
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:45.420
Yep, we're also on Twitter.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.420
We are on Twitter.

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.700
It's at knowledge underscore fight, and I go to bed Jordan.

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.700
We're also on Facebook.

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:54.340
If you'd like to tell us, if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.740
area to help out people doing God's work right now.

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:57.740
Yep, we'll be back.

01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.220
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.220
I'm Leo.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.220
I'm DZXClark.

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.220
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.900
I live next door to Satan in the sixth dimension.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:05.900
Maybe fifth?

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:06.900
I'm not sure.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:07.900
One above ours.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:08.900
Andy in Kansas.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:09.900
You're on the air.

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:10.900
Thanks for holding.

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:11.900
Hello, Alex.

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:12.900
I'm a first time caller.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:13.900
I'm a huge fan.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:14.900
I love your work.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:21.900
I love you.
