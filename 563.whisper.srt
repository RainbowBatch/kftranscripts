N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,120
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
It's time to pray.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
We are the sustainers.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Knowledgefight.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Dan and Jordan.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
Knowledgefight.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
Riddle art, riddle art, riddle art.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Need money.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Riddle art, riddle art, riddle art.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,280
Andy and channels.

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,700
Andy and channels.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,940
Stop it.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,980
Andy and channels.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,080
Andy and channels.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Andy.

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
It's time to pray.

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
Andy and channels.

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
You're on the air, thanks for holding.

23
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Hello Alex, I'm a system color and I'm a huge fan.

24
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
I love your room.

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Knowledgefight.

26
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Knowledgefight.

27
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
I love you.

28
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
I love you.

29
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Thank you.

30
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
I love you.

31
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
And thank you.

32
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Tried, I'm Dan.

33
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm Jordan.

34
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,680
Our couple dudes like to sit around and worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
about Alex Jones.

36
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Jordan.

38
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Dan.

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Jordan.

40
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Quick question for ya.

41
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
What's up?

42
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
What's your bright spot today?

43
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Speaking of Selene.

44
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Ah.

45
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
It's a Selene oriented bright spot.

46
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Alright.

47
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,140
So one of the things that I've enjoyed over the course of my time living with this animal

48
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,800
is that she finds new places that she likes to hang out, kind of periodically.

49
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Uh huh, uh huh.

50
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,520
Well, you know, like she was on the couch for a while, that was like where I'd always

51
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
find her.

52
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Basic.

53
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Basic stuff.

54
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Sometimes on my bed.

55
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Of course.

56
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Totally basic.

57
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Normal.

58
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
Lately.

59
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Uh huh.

60
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
She's found a new spot that she loves.

61
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Oh, she's going extra.

62
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,120
Every single time I go to the bathroom, she's laying in the tub.

63
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,400
Ha ha ha!

64
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Yes!

65
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,400
That's how you elevate the form of laying in a weird place, Dan.

66
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Yeah, she's a bath cat now.

67
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I like that.

68
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Very excited.

69
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,080
It's gratifying to see sort of this commonality that we have, this bond.

70
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
You're both bath people.

71
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Yeah.

72
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Yeah.

73
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,520
I mean, whether, I doubt she wants as much water, if any.

74
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
I think none.

75
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,400
I think none would probably be the best, but yeah.

76
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
But it's still fun.

77
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Yeah.

78
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,880
It's nice to share things with a cohabitant.

79
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Sure.

80
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
What about you?

81
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
What's your bright spot?

82
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:18,360
My bright spot today is I had the chance to break into Robert Evans' home and steal his

83
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:26,280
manuscript for his book that is being released currently as a podcast or episodic thing,

84
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
and I got to read the whole thing, and it's very, very good.

85
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,280
Well, that's great.

86
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,960
I mean, I'm sure it'll probably be the final version that everybody else hears, unless

87
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,080
he takes my advice and rewrites it to be about Mako Sharkrampant.

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Right.

89
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,720
Mako Sharkrampant must be represented.

90
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,380
I mean, if you don't have a Mark Richards reference in there, it's like, I guess you're

91
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,160
still writing, but I don't know why.

92
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,040
All art must contain sharkramping.

93
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Exactly.

94
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:00,160
No, it's very, very good, and there are a few things he does to not glorify the violence

95
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,640
that is just so great.

96
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,960
It's called After the Revolution, and it's really, really good.

97
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,200
I recommend people read it.

98
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,160
It's coming out, like you said, as chapters in audio format and also in print.

99
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,640
And yeah, you can find that pretty easy.

100
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Just go to his Twitter.

101
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Yeah.

102
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
It's good.

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Yeah.

104
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,080
So, Jordan, today we have an episode to go over, as promised.

105
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Hey.

106
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
An episode.

107
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Okay.

108
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
So I wanted to check out the day after the Fauci emails got released, because to me,

109
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,840
this seems like the biggest bread-making opportunity of Alex's recent career.

110
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Shouldn't be hard.

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,560
There's so many emails, you could say whatever the fuck you want.

112
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
No one's going to read them.

113
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
No.

114
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
No one's going to read them.

115
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,520
So I checked in on June 2nd, 2021, Blackjack.

116
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,720
Now all I'm doing is just screaming Blackjack whenever I realize I'm not going to catch

117
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
up.

118
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
You just say, bah.

119
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
All I've got is vocalizations.

120
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I don't even have words.

121
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
You can't block the shot.

122
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,080
Doesn't work that way.

123
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Okay, fine.

124
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
It's goal-tending.

125
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Fine.

126
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,020
So yeah, I kind of thought the first was when the initial release came out, and I thought,

127
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,380
like the second, by then he's had the evening to come up with whatever bullshit he wants

128
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,380
to say.

129
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,380
He's got to be aligned.

130
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
He's got to run with it.

131
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,960
We're going to see how he responds.

132
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,320
Does he fail even at this?

133
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
We will see.

134
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Okay.

135
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
But first, we've got to take a little moment to say thank you to some new wonks.

136
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
Oh, that's a great idea.

137
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
So first, Varnvlog.

138
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Thank you so much.

139
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
You are now policy wonk.

140
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm a policy wonk.

141
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Thanks, Varnvlog.

142
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Thank you.

143
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Next, use the daddy hole.

144
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Thank you so much.

145
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
You are now policy wonk.

146
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
I'm a policy wonk.

147
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Thank you.

148
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Next.

149
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,960
This is a real name, apparently, and I feel for this person.

150
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,080
Alex Jones, you are now policy wonk.

151
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm a policy wonk.

152
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,200
Thank you very much, AJ is what we'll call you.

153
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,840
Next, Jordan and I, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk.

154
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
I'm a policy wonk.

155
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Thank you very much.

156
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
The sequel to The King and I I'm writing in my brain.

157
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,760
Next, I like this one.

158
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,040
Post-Tribulation Raptor, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk.

159
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm a policy wonk.

160
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I like that one, too.

161
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
That's very good.

162
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Thank you very much.

163
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,720
And Kit and Kiva, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk.

164
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm a policy wonk.

165
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,600
Thank you very much, Kit and Kiva.

166
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Got a couple of technocrats in the mix, too.

167
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,740
First, Erica and Ian, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat and a loyal servant of

168
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,920
Queen Selene, may long she reign.

169
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
Thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

170
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
I'm a policy wonk.

171
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

172
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Have yourself a brew.

173
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
How's your 401k doing, bro?

174
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,920
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

175
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,400
Let's just get down to business.

176
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,480
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

177
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,400
Why are you pimps so good?

178
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,040
My neck is freakishly large.

179
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,840
I declare info war on you.

180
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,040
Thank you so much, Erica, Ian, and the loyal servant of Queen Selene.

181
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,160
Yes, thank you very much.

182
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,720
I like how people are going with the loyal servant of Selene thing.

183
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
I feel like we could spiral this out into a cult a lot faster than I would have it,

184
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,520
but you know what the buttercream gang is to regular gangs?

185
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,800
We would create two regular cults.

186
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Do you know what I'm saying?

187
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
I mean, this is already going to Selene's head.

188
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,560
She's taking over my tub.

189
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
That's true.

190
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,720
This is a mess.

191
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,640
Oh, man, I wonder what her first commandment's gonna be.

192
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,080
Thou shalt stay out of my tub.

193
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Probably.

194
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Thou shalt give me gravy.

195
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,400
I think it's probably actually the first commandment.

196
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
That would be a good one.

197
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,320
So, Jordan, now it has come time to check in with some birthday shout outs.

198
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Okay.

199
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,600
Being born is a condition that leads to death.

200
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,280
You can say that life is a disease that ends in death.

201
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,960
If you're paying attention, that is a different drop.

202
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:36,000
This is a theme that Alex has been hitting lately.

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,320
Okay.

204
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
So Sam.

205
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Happy birthday.

206
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Yeah.

207
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,240
On the 5th, over the weekend, I had a birthday.

208
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,720
Thank you to Sam for having a birthday, and Matthew got in touch and wanted us to give

209
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
you a shout out.

210
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Happy birthday, Sam.

211
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Happy birthday.

212
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
And this one's really delayed.

213
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
This was back in May, I believe.

214
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Steve.

215
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Happy birthday belatedly, but again, life is death.

216
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,160
Life is death, so birthdays are non-birthdays, too, by that logic.

217
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Absolutely.

218
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,480
Being born is a condition that leads to death.

219
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,000
You can say that life is a disease that ends in death.

220
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Happy birthday.

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Happy birthday.

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
So Jordan, I told you.

223
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,280
This is the day that Alex should be responding to the Fauci emails, and here's how he starts.

224
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,640
This is after he played a little bit of a goofy meme video about Scooby-Doo.

225
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,800
It's like Scooby-Doo, but they take the bags off the ghost's head, and it's Fauci and Bill

226
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Gates.

227
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
It's a lot of fun.

228
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
He's promoting that.

229
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
The wheels have completely come off the COVID-19 operation.

230
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,360
The globalists are in deep trouble.

231
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,360
We put out that little dark comedy piece that you just saw, if you're a TV viewer, you just

232
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:55,080
heard if you're a radio listener, that spoof on Scooby-Doo, where Fauci and Gates get caught

233
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,680
running the pandemic, launching the operation, and so they go to prison for it.

234
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,160
And when we put that out a year ago, it was banned on Twitter and Facebook as fake news

235
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,920
when it was obviously a parody, but based on real things they'd done.

236
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,600
But boy, a year later, it's evergreen, isn't it?

237
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,320
Meaning it's more important now than when we first put it out.

238
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Busted Scooby-Doo just solved the COVID-19 mystery.

239
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,640
It's got 200 plus thousand views at Banned.video.

240
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,400
I think it needs a lot more than that, doesn't it?

241
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Wow.

242
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,160
In fact, let's make it the featured video at Banned.video.

243
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,080
Oh, boy.

244
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,720
This is important stuff.

245
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,360
I was a little confused.

246
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,920
I am very saddened by this.

247
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,440
Yes, I was a little underwhelmed by this viewing where we're going.

248
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,420
Not least of which because Scooby-Doo, right there.

249
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Right there.

250
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,840
This old meme spoof is what we need to really push, we need to get this.

251
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,240
Was that in one of Fauci's emails?

252
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
Yes.

253
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Oh, okay.

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Well, then that makes sense.

255
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
The only thing that can bring us down is meme spoofs.

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
That makes sense.

257
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Yeah, that works.

258
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,240
So I've often sort of wrestled with exactly what it is about Alex's show that I think

259
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
is bad.

260
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
And I mean, obviously the answer is there's a lot of them.

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,420
But one of the things that is sort of central that makes it bad is actually what he articulates

262
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,160
in this next clip.

263
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,080
Because this radio slash TV transmission is not just your regular entertainment.

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,200
It's not just your regular news program.

265
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,040
This is a participation sport.

266
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,800
And I think that censored report that you can find only at man.video needs to get shared,

267
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
don't you?

268
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,300
The Scooby-Doo.

269
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,960
But this is a participation sport.

270
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,880
That's kind of bad.

271
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
That's a bad way of looking at this stuff when you, you know, I mean, granted, if you

272
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,320
go to him under oath or in a deposition setting, he might say, I'm just talking about my feelings.

273
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,040
I don't know about sources.

274
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,680
I don't know about any of this stuff.

275
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,600
You'd have to, you'd have to listen to the whole thing.

276
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,520
You know, like, no, but when he's free and he's on air and he's, this is a, this is not

277
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
news.

278
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
This isn't entertainment.

279
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,640
This is a participation sport.

280
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm trying to incite you to do something.

281
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Yeah.

282
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Yeah.

283
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,480
But that implies that information is a win or lose situation.

284
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,240
Not things are real or not.

285
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,000
You can win with information that's not real.

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You know?

287
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's a participation sport.

288
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,320
It's not about finding what's real or what's true or what exists.

289
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
It's about winning.

290
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,900
Don't challenge your notions.

291
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,680
Come up with things that you can misrepresent in the real world that reinforce your predetermined

292
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,640
conclusions and play like hell out on the field to make sure everyone else is forced

293
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
to accept those things too.

294
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,760
No, and if you, if you change your mind, you're just giving up.

295
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
You are.

296
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
You can't give, you can't give up.

297
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,180
You can't be a quitter.

298
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,360
I've watched the challenge.

299
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,920
TJ Lavin doesn't like quitters.

300
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
He hates them.

301
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
He hates quitters.

302
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
You can't throw in the towel.

303
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Uh huh.

304
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
On falsities.

305
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Yeah.

306
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Yeah.

307
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,400
So finally, Alex does end up getting to the Fauci emails and does not cover them that

308
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
much.

309
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,960
Let me just hit the headlines now.

310
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,960
In February of 2020 email that's public now, Fauci wrote face mask, not effective in keeping

311
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
out virus.

312
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,640
Either he wrote though that it has a good psychological effect and even publicly said,

313
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,400
it's about respect, living in fear, keeping everybody scared, total open and shut.

314
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,280
You should be able to use any of this in court.

315
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,760
There's cases all over the country where they're trying to make people still wear mask in schools

316
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
and businesses.

317
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Boo.

318
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,400
So in the emails early on Fauci did say that there wasn't good reason for everyone to wear

319
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
masks.

320
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,040
That was because at the time they were unaware of a number of variables that existed with

321
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,440
COVID-19.

322
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,880
In an interview with CNN after the emails got released, Fauci was asked, quote, a lot

323
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,340
has transpired since then.

324
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,840
If you had to go back and do it all over again, would you tell her something different?

325
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,400
Do you regret that?

326
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,800
Here's his answer, which I think is great.

327
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes.

328
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
Quote, let's get real here.

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,040
If you look at scientific information as it accumulates, what's going on in January and

330
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,880
February, what you know as a fact as data guides you, guides what you tell people and

331
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
your policies.

332
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,640
If March, April may occur, you accumulate a lot more information and you modify and

333
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,920
adjust your opinion and your recommendation based on the current science and current data.

334
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,600
So of course, if we knew back then that a substantial amount of transmission was asymptomatic

335
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,560
people, if we knew that the data showed that masks outside of a hospital setting actually

336
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,820
do work when we didn't know it, then if we realize all those things back then, of course,

337
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,960
you're asking a question, would you do something different if you knew what you knew now?

338
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,480
Of course people would have done that.

339
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,000
That's so obvious, right?

340
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's a great answer.

341
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,560
But do you know what that is, Dan?

342
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,060
That is losing the participation sport.

343
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,000
No wonder we never win because he's learning and growing and then regretting actions from

344
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
before.

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,440
What he should be saying is, no, I'm so stoked all those people died because of stuff.

346
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,880
I didn't know that I told them.

347
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
That's what I wanted.

348
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,560
I just think that there's something to delineate there though, that it's not, I don't think

349
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
it's regret necessarily.

350
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,800
No, I understand.

351
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,820
Maybe a hope that more awareness had or more information had been known at a certain time,

352
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,560
but based on the information that was available, that's what was the solidest recommendation.

353
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Totally.

354
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,720
And then the, the thing about psychological stuff that Alex brings up, from best I can

355
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,880
tell, like that was something that was going on early on.

356
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
I don't remember this.

357
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,000
This was when they were talking about like, so when there, there wasn't an awareness of

358
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,240
the asymptomatic spread, right?

359
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,000
There was discussion of if you're sick, you should wear a mask, but if you're not sick,

360
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,080
you shouldn't, you don't really need to, but that puts a stigma on anybody wearing a mask

361
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,260
because then now if you wear a mask, everyone's going to assume you're sick.

362
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,240
And that could lead to people being disincentivized to wear masks when they should wear masks.

363
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
No, I mean, leper colonies worked well.

364
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,600
Everybody with leprosy was like, I'm definitely going to go right to this leper colony.

365
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,720
I don't want to hide it and keep people from knowing that I'm a leper because you know,

366
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm treated so well in leper colonies.

367
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah.

368
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,560
The, the, the psychological benefit of widespread mask use is that you kind of make it easier

369
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,740
for people who do, are at a higher reason to wear a mask, according to the understanding

370
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,480
at that time, to follow public health advice.

371
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,600
And it works out better for everyone.

372
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,800
If you de-stigmatize these things and make it so everyone just, I don't know, I, I, I,

373
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,080
I have not read all of the Fauci emails.

374
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,680
I've read all of the ones that like get pointed out as like, ah, ha ha.

375
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,680
I've read a bunch of the ones that no one's pointing out.

376
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,080
And I see a nothing here.

377
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,520
And I think Alex does too, because here's what he does immediately instead of going

378
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,720
more into these emails.

379
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,160
And by the way, let me, let me hit the Fauci news here in a minute.

380
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,800
Let me, let me get back into all these COVID news next segment.

381
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,300
And let me just tell you some of the other stuff coming up today.

382
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,360
And then I'll go into each area of the news and tell you about the big guests we've got.

383
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,760
But, but, but, but first I went over to my parents on Memorial day, my dad grilled hamburgers

384
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
and my mom made baked beans and deviled eggs.

385
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,520
It was all delicious.

386
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,800
We swam in their swimming pool, myself and my children and family, my wife.

387
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
This is a great story.

388
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,960
And there's an old family friend that I've done some three years old, she's a great lady.

389
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,600
And she came over to the house and I've been friends with her son and, and, and her daughter

390
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,160
more years old again.

391
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,440
And so when she tells me a story, it's, it's accurate, of course, but I know her sister

392
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,900
very well.

393
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,000
And I know her daughter very well.

394
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I guess I've gotten old, old enough now where, you know, my friends are 70 years old, but

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,360
she has a granddaughter or her sister does, uh, my friend has a granddaughter.

396
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,760
So this is fucking annoying.

397
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,120
I can't, I can't, I stopped it.

398
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I can't listen.

399
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,320
I can't keep track of all the variables.

400
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
There's so many relatives.

401
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,800
There's so many people who don't factor into this story at all.

402
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,120
This is not the Bible.

403
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't care who begat who get to the meat.

404
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,040
Well, you're, you're going to wish for more set up when he finally gets to the actual

405
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
story.

406
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Okay.

407
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Well, but I, I'm, so I'm friends with the family going way back and we vacation together.

408
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
We camp together.

409
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,240
So they're our best friends as a family and they live in Rockwall where I grew up.

410
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,360
That is her sister does, and they're evangelical Christians.

411
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:44,520
They're very nice people, very successful in business and one of the daughters, the

412
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:51,880
granddaughter was arguing with her mother about issues and they weren't even that big

413
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,200
an issue, but the mother said, Hey, why don't you go to your school counselor and ask them

414
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,320
about some of your boyfriend problems?

415
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,600
You know, we're not going to go pay for you to go to some counselor in town or whatever.

416
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
It's not that we're against the money.

417
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,880
It's just, Hey, go to the school counselor.

418
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,200
We pay property taxes for this.

419
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,840
So this is the same high school.

420
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,760
She's a freshman that I went to for the first few years of high school.

421
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, I moved to Austin when I was 16 and she goes into the school in Rockwall and it's

422
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,840
a male counselor to a 13 year old girl.

423
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,000
And she told me the whole conversation because her, her, her niece repeated it to her.

424
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,860
She was shocked and he says to her, well, don't you think your problem is you're really

425
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
a man?

426
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,040
Oh boy.

427
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,720
So this is, this is where the story is.

428
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,880
I would like more preamble please.

429
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Yeah, exactly.

430
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,320
I would definitely like more preamble.

431
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,440
I would like more preamble as opposed to this clearly not true story.

432
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,820
What are you talking about?

433
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,120
This is made up bullshit.

434
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,280
Oh man, it gets so much...

435
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,400
How is it that you can think it's a great idea to give that much of a preamble to a

436
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,160
story where all you want to be is just transphobic and mean?

437
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Right.

438
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,840
You want to be a real dick and, you know, really try and demonize a certain population.

439
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,840
And in order to do that, the best you got is a third hand story maybe?

440
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Maybe?

441
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
A fan?

442
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,680
You have something on the family tree that's a long branch away from you, that's for damn

443
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
sure.

444
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Yeah.

445
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,080
I would believe that there's a possibility that somebody who is in a school counseling

446
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:43,760
position could, you know, if someone were to come to them with gender issues or something

447
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,680
could be empathetic and try and help them.

448
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,280
But I don't believe this.

449
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
She goes, excuse me?

450
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,160
He goes, yes, you're having problems with this boyfriend here at school because you're

451
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,840
really sexually confused.

452
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
And she goes, no.

453
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,400
He goes, yeah, I think you're a boy.

454
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
And she goes, are you joking?

455
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,800
He goes, no, I want to get you in touch with the group.

456
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
We need to put you in counseling.

457
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,360
They'll pay for it off site.

458
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,400
You really need this right now.

459
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
And she goes, no, I'm a girl.

460
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
He goes, no, you're not.

461
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
And she pulls her shirt forward, looks down and says, no, I'm a girl.

462
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,680
And says, I'm getting out of here.

463
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
What?

464
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,560
This is a fucking, this is that same meme where like the, this is a joke meme where

465
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,760
the soldiers and the professor's like, liberals are good.

466
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,720
And the soldiers like, I killed everybody in America's the best thing ever.

467
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,440
And the liberal professor cries and he's like, you're correct all the time.

468
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,600
This is a made up nonsense story conservatives tell themselves.

469
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,200
This is the boogeyman story.

470
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
This is bullshit.

471
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,700
I mean, quite frankly, if this happened the way Alex is describing it, she should own

472
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
that school.

473
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,360
That guy should be sued into oblivion.

474
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,480
This didn't happen because it's such an open and shut clear case of malfeasance by someone

475
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,120
who works at the school.

476
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,960
Like this would be very easy to get to the bottom of.

477
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,240
What a lying piece of shit.

478
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
And it gets worse.

479
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Oh God.

480
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,000
But imagine she's not a troubled child, had a boyfriend issue.

481
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,760
When you're 13, you don't want to so much talk to your mom.

482
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,240
You know, who's the right wing, you know, Christian, but she's conservative too.

483
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,280
So talk to the counselor and you don't even expect in Rockwall, Texas, a suburb of Dallas

484
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,280
that you go there and a man is pushing on you.

485
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,920
It went on and on for like 30 minutes him saying you are by the end of it.

486
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,720
He's like, you are a man.

487
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,120
You are a man.

488
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
You are a me.

489
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,680
You need to go to this place.

490
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
What an odd counselor.

491
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,720
It's a whole agenda to destroy everybody, men, women, everybody.

492
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
It's sick.

493
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
It's how you depopulate.

494
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
This is outrageous.

495
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,880
Um, and the only real question that I have is how much of this is the story that someone

496
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,400
told him at a cookout and how much is just Alex is like, I'm going to punch this up a

497
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
little.

498
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
It was a half hour.

499
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
He was just yelling.

500
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
You're a man.

501
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,680
This is, this is, it's either that or like he's half remembering Austin Powers or something.

502
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,440
You're a man, baby.

503
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
That could be.

504
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,640
He might've taken some scissor and watch some old Mike Myers movies.

505
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,120
What kind of lunatic would believe this ever?

506
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,960
I imagine his audience.

507
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,120
You're a man.

508
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,320
It's a ridiculous story.

509
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,120
And then the, then the entire school got gathered around.

510
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,140
They had a big, uh, assembly.

511
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,400
The principal got up and he's like, everybody champ, you're a man.

512
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
You're a man.

513
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,680
It's all the schools are just out of control now.

514
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,760
They just brainwash all of these kids to scream, whatever the principal tells them to, as we

515
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,080
all know, children do.

516
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Yeah.

517
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
Jesus.

518
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
I don't know.

519
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,680
I don't know if things have changed literally entirely since I was in school, but I do remember

520
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,800
the counselors, um, at every school that I went to, uh, being the sort of folks who just

521
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,480
listen and roll their eyes.

522
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,720
I don't kind of believe you, honestly.

523
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,920
The counselors are not really actively engaged in a lot.

524
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,560
I mean, I'm sure they mean well for the most part, you know, it's a thankless position

525
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,240
to be in school counselor, but, uh, yeah, I don't, I don't remember them being all that

526
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,640
much like working across purposes, trying to make conclusions for you.

527
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,260
I did find it weird when I was in third grade and the school counselor put all of us under

528
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,080
the sorting hat and determined whether we were man or woman.

529
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,800
That was a, that was an interesting day, but I guess that's part of the counselor's job

530
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
now.

531
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,820
So this story, I mean, first of all, a hundred percent, absolutely not true, but it leads

532
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,800
me to believe that Alex doesn't really want to talk about the voucher emails that much.

533
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,520
I think even he might think it's a little bit weak.

534
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Well he read some of the email, well he didn't read them, his actual, uh, great grandfather's

535
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
nephew.

536
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,840
Uh, he knew him from back when they used to go hunting and fishing.

537
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
He knew his son too.

538
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,720
Now his son, you don't even want to know about his son.

540
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,160
That guy got caught, um, you know, with his, uh, diddler and the sheep on the other side

541
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
of the things.

542
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
But that's a different story.

543
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
We don't need to talk about that.

544
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,200
This story is about my great grandfather's nephew and how he had a son and his son was

545
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,420
married to this woman.

546
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,840
That was his first marriage and second marriage.

547
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,660
That was a disaster, but his first marriage, they got married again.

548
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,400
It's like Grover Cleveland, non non-consecutive marriages kind of thing.

549
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Right?

550
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Uh, I don't know how much longer I can keep going.

551
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
You're really letting me, you're leaving me out to dry here.

552
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,520
I was kind of hoping you would get into how the second marriage ended up falling apart

553
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,920
because the woman was in an importing exporting business that was actually getting antiques

554
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,880
and relics from foreign countries that were stolen and being, uh, trafficked.

555
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
They belong in a museum.

556
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Right, right.

557
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,600
But she was only doing that because of her second cousin who was really in debt to the

558
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
mob.

559
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Right, right, right, right.

560
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,000
What was this story about again?

561
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Fauci's emails.

562
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It was great.

563
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It was a good story.

564
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,840
So, also not to do with Fauci's emails, but Alex has a new shirt that's really popular

565
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,640
and Alex is going to plug this and, uh, keep, pay attention to who this shirt is popular

566
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
with.

567
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Okay.

568
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
I designed this shirt.

569
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
I'm just telling you.

570
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Not, not bragging.

571
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,480
Uh, and I think it's one of my better designs.

572
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Looks like an iron cross.

573
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,880
The concept team, Robert and others over there, and it's just incredible.

574
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,720
And I didn't intend for it to basically glow in the dark like a, like a tree frog can do

575
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,600
in the species, but it actually glows, uh, under these lights, under regular lights.

576
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,440
We've got a black shirt, a green shirt, and a cream shirt.

577
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,720
And on the back it says, save the frogs info wars.com.

578
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,200
And on the front of the shirt, it's got the same little symbol over your heart.

579
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,480
And I'm telling you, we've had these shirts in for almost a month.

580
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,640
We hadn't gone on sale until a big shipment came in cause you get a test shirt, see if

581
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
you approve it.

582
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,640
And as soon as I wore this out, everybody goes, what's that shirt?

583
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,000
I liked that shirt.

584
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,360
John the boom operator never talks about my shirts.

585
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
He goes, what's that shirt?

586
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,760
I love that shirt today.

587
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
He wants one.

588
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,640
My son, I was going to shoot an ad for these yesterday.

589
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,200
He works up here.

590
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
He comes in my office.

591
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,160
He's done this since he's been as big as I am for years.

592
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,800
He's 18 now, but by the time he was 15, he's as big as I am now.

593
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
He's huge.

594
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,320
Uh, he wears XXL and I see him walking around in my shirt and I said, Hey, you go to the

595
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,000
warehouse down the road, you get one.

596
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,680
You don't steal my shirt.

597
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,160
So I'm telling you, this shirt is so popular that everybody's going crazy over it.

598
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
I don't know why.

599
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:29,080
This shirt is so popular with my employee and my son, this is not a good market sample.

600
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,160
You've got some brand new market research people who work for me like this shirt.

601
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Yeah.

602
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,760
People who work for me or I created, listen, we can't keep them in stock.

603
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
They're stealing them from us.

604
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,640
My son is stealing them, but they're stealing them.

605
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,680
So like it's just, they're going like hotcakes.

606
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,400
I wore them out and everybody, including the people who work for me only, and only the

607
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,680
people who work for me just love these shirts.

608
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,040
They're just amazing.

609
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,280
It's got a frog.

610
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
The end.

611
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Yeah.

612
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,500
So I think that this was just also a nice way for Alex to weave into talking about some

613
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,840
more of this, you know, like the, you know, they're turning the frogs gay.

614
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,540
That's sort of his bread and butter when everybody loves to, it's the meme machine.

615
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
Don't make memes out of this stuff.

616
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
Memes, memes, memes.

617
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,960
And so I think he's trying to do a little bit more of that.

618
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,440
They were cloning animals and humans before I was born.

619
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,760
Hitler was cloning rabbits in 1944.

620
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,440
They've been splicing animals and humans.

621
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,880
It went on sale this week, salmon that weighed twice as much than our salmon that are part

622
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,640
insect and part asparagus for whatever reason.

623
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Whoa.

624
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,480
So we get part asparagus salmon.

625
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I tried that.

626
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,960
Yeah, Alex is talking about a new genetically modified salmon that's being bred by a company

627
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
called AquaBounty.

628
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,240
And it's actually now really new news, like 2015 they got approval to like create these

629
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,940
genetically modified salmon and it's just like it came to market, but like almost nobody

630
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
is buying it.

631
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
Okay.

632
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,940
So most people are like, I don't know.

633
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
All right.

634
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
I'm going to pitch them on a product real quick.

635
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,520
The quilted puffer upper.

636
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
All right.

637
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,560
It's a puffer fish that also uses a sponge.

638
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Yeah.

639
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,960
So I'm going to say this right off the top here.

640
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,320
I'm not sure that I'm okay with what's going on here for ethical reasons, but Alex is still

641
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,380
way off on the details.

642
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,640
The fish don't grow to twice their normal weight.

643
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,800
They grow to their normal weight twice as fast.

644
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,880
This is achieved by splicing into Atlantic salmon, a gene from Pacific Chinook salmon

645
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,600
that make it so the fish produce growth hormone all year instead of part of the year.

646
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,040
Additionally, they added a gene from another fish, the ocean pout that essentially act

647
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,120
as a stabilizing thing for the hormone.

648
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,740
I've not been able to determine if the salmon is part asparagus, but I do know that if you

649
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,560
look into it, you can find some interesting recipes where salmon is paired with asparagus.

650
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Okay.

651
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
All right.

652
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,920
Alex might have done that at this cookout of his over the weekend.

653
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,480
A little butter asparagus, put some salt and pepper on there.

654
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Maybe braise it even.

655
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,600
That's not a bad idea.

656
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,520
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this stuff entirely.

657
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm not sure.

658
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,280
I'd have to think about it a little bit more, maybe have a conversation with somebody about

659
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
it.

660
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Yeah.

661
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,420
And apparently most food retailers in the United States agree and they aren't selling

662
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
this salmon.

663
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Sure.

664
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,840
This may be like one of those fun instances where I kind of agree with the conclusion

665
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,640
that Alex has that like maybe, maybe this isn't cool, but I think that the way that

666
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,840
he reaches his conclusion is childish, stupid, and a disservice to anyone taking these issues

667
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
seriously.

668
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Yeah.

669
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Yeah.

670
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Yeah.

671
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Ridiculous.

672
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,520
And what I'm really into that is as the science fiction fan, I was when I was eight years

673
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,920
old where I was like, yeah, fucking splice everything together.

674
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,520
Let's see what happens.

675
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,640
And now that I'm an adult, I can realize that maybe that kid shouldn't be in charge of gene

676
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,840
editing research.

677
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Sure.

678
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
So maybe we have to hold off on it.

679
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,800
And one of the things that I am concerned about, obviously, and I don't, I don't know

680
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,900
enough, I tried to look into this a little bit, but I don't know if I could even find

681
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,320
a clear answer.

682
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,280
How much does that growing twice as fast, like affect the life experience of these salmon?

683
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Sure.

684
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,920
You know, cause that seems like it could be hellish.

685
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Yeah.

686
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,440
And I think that I don't know.

687
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Or not.

688
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
I don't know.

689
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Yeah.

690
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,640
And then you unpack that, you open it up to the whole like, well, you're going to eat

691
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
them anyway.

692
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
See, and then you get into, yeah, no.

693
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
It's a mess.

694
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
It's a mess.

695
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Yeah.

696
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,880
I don't want to wade into it with a hard take.

697
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,360
So Alex talks about these salmon and then he jumps into another story about catfish

698
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,480
in Japan.

699
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,400
And I did not actually pull this clip.

700
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,400
I regret to, one of my, one of my bungles.

701
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,680
But I want to talk about it a little bit because it is also fairly interesting.

702
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,680
But again, the thing that Alex is talking about is nonsense.

703
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,360
Is this like the Nigerian email scam?

704
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,280
He got catfished by somebody in Japan and he's creating a story about that?

705
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I wish it was.

706
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:51,360
No, he's found an article in Japanese about a Japanese science research project and what

707
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,760
they did is they found a way to make catfish female.

708
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Okay.

709
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,800
Essentially using something that they derive from soybeans.

710
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:06,360
Already mature catfish are turned into females or in the embryo, no matter what, it will

711
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,000
be a female catfish?

712
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,520
It is, I don't know if it's fully adults, but they are actual catfish.

713
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Okay, gotcha.

714
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,160
This is another story about people trying to find ways to make fish bigger quicker.

715
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,680
Female catfish grow at much faster rates than males and in farming situations, often males

716
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,800
are just thrown out since raising them to the point where they can be used for marketable

717
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,400
product would cost more than would be brought in.

718
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Researchers in Japan recently found that if they kept the fish in a tank that was full

719
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,840
of water with different things dissolved in it, they could create a more female dense

720
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,240
population.

721
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,720
The use of actual female hormones is not allowed for animals being raised for human consumption.

722
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,160
So the researchers explored isoflavone, which is a chemical that's found in soybeans.

723
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,820
They isolated a compound called genistein, and this is derived from isoflavone, and they

724
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,360
found that if you had a tank of water with 400 micrograms per liter, this resulted in

725
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,440
a tank of catfish that were 100% female.

726
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Wow!

727
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,480
That's wild!

728
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,700
This is interesting, and it's obviously of concern to people who raise fish for a living,

729
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,460
but I think that pretending there's a one-to-one parallel between humans and catfish is a little

730
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,040
bit suspect, which is what Alex is doing.

731
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,560
So also, even if the catfish and human were biologically similar to the point where it

732
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,400
was relevant, this would still seem to suggest that humans would need to swim around in and

733
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,000
breathe water full of isoflavone to have this kind of effect happen.

734
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,440
It's nonsense.

735
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,160
This is, as all too often is the case, it's just an attempt by Alex to take a headline

736
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,320
misrepresented and use it as a weapon against trans people.

737
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,640
He's trying to make the fact of trans people's existence into some kind of a conspiracy,

738
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,240
because this is what they're doing with soy, and all that, and it's like, ugh, I don't

739
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
know about this.

740
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
This is bad.

741
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,880
That's, ugh, I don't want to, I want a big no on that one.

742
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,440
Yeah, and it's interesting research from what I was able to find, and I don't think it applies

743
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,700
to humans, but Alex tries to get a little bit closer by taking another soy-related story,

744
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,200
this time about monkeys.

745
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,400
They also tested this on monkeys, three different species, and found that they make the same

746
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,600
weird smiling face, they're aggressive and hateful loners, very unsuccessful, and tend

747
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,080
to try to then kill females.

748
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,520
Think I'm joking?

749
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:31,000
Long-term soy consumption makes monkeys aggressive loners, shocking study with possible human

750
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,300
implications, there they are.

751
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,720
So not surprisingly, Alex has some details on this study wrong, it was done, also this

752
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,600
study is from 2004.

753
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,960
The headline he's reading is from a website called herculeanstrength.com.

754
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,320
Okay, well I'm already out.

755
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
Already out.

756
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,440
Seems to be where he's pulling this from.

757
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,180
I'm sorry, a men's rights activist's name is kicking me out.

758
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
Their tagline is, become a demigod.

759
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,800
There we go, that's all I needed to hear.

760
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,160
This is a bodybuilding site that's very into testosterone, and from what I can tell they

761
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,640
have a pretty anti-soy editorial position.

762
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,800
Interestingly, they also posted an article about that catfish study, so maybe Alex just

763
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,440
hangs out on bodybuilding sites to get his health news.

764
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,920
That actually does make sense.

765
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Yeah.

766
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,240
So this is actually an interesting comparative study, but here are some of the things Alex

767
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
fucked up.

768
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,240
One, there wasn't three species of monkeys, there were three groups, two experimental

769
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,680
and one control group, but they were all male macaque monkeys.

770
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,840
Two, all the stuff about the weird faces is made up.

771
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,120
I think Alex is just taking that from pictures of the macaques that were on the bodybuilding

772
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
website.

773
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Right.

774
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
They just put random pictures of monkeys.

775
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,520
So they had weird faces and he was like, they all make weird faces.

776
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,240
They were not pictures from the stuff.

777
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Right, right, right, right.

778
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Of course.

779
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,560
Alex probably just thinks that monkeys look like demons or something.

780
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,360
They were fucking Getty Images, yeah.

781
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,640
Three, I have no idea how Alex is gauging whether or not these monkeys were successful,

782
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,320
regardless of their soil intake.

783
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,160
I don't know what the standard for that is.

784
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,320
I forgot about the successful being part of it.

785
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,600
Or, I don't see anything in there about killing females.

786
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,440
The study itself did find that there appeared to be behavioral changes in macaques based

787
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,240
on the amount of soy that they were eating in their diet.

788
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,400
Alex is focusing on the aggressive tendencies, but the study actually found that the opposite

789
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
was more often the case.

790
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,600
There was a 67% increase in aggressive behaviors, but a 203% increase in submissive ones.

791
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,440
This is an element of the study that Alex is choosing to ignore because he's just going

792
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,200
a different direction with it.

793
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,360
The stuff about increased solitary behavior does match up with some of the stuff found

794
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
in the study.

795
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,440
Like, approximately there was a 30% increase in time spent alone for the group that had

796
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,860
a higher soy intake diet.

797
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,720
One important point to bring up here, though, is that there was almost no difference found

798
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,400
between the control group and the low isoflavin diet group.

799
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,760
So there were two experimental groups, one low and one high, and the control group and

800
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,080
the low group were almost not, you couldn't tell the difference.

801
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,540
In order for humans to mimic the levels of isoflavin consumption in the high diet group

802
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,100
that they were getting for 15 months straight, it would be next to impossible for humans

803
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
to do.

804
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,640
It would be the equivalent of humans swimming around in isoflavin saturated water and breathing

805
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,120
it in our little gills.

806
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:12,800
You're not going to be able to get a diet that controlled to get any of the kind of

807
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,540
marginal effects that were found.

808
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,720
It's interesting, though, still, whatever they're looking at.

809
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,120
I don't know how conclusive it is, and I certainly don't know if it applies to humans.

810
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,000
Yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, that does also have the flavor of a study that's like

811
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,480
a non-consensually changing diet of animals causes different behaviors.

812
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,800
You know, like, no, I get it, but I don't, I mean, okay.

813
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Sure.

814
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Yeah.

815
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Yeah, I don't know.

816
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
I found it really interesting that instead of really getting into the Fauci stuff, Alex

817
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,880
instead goes on all these weird sort of animal genetics news items that some are current

818
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,800
and some are old, and they're all bullshit.

819
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,400
I mean, aside from the transphobia, that's more fun, I suppose, because the emails, talking

820
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,440
about emails is still boring, and we're already, we're still rolling from Hillary's emails.

821
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
You've got a high bar with Hillary's emails.

822
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,800
Yeah, we're not going to beat Hillary's emails.

823
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,240
I don't think you're going to find anything.

824
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,080
You're not going to be able to Podesta this.

825
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Right.

826
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
You're not going to be able to pizza gate it.

827
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,920
You need a pizza gate if you want emails to be exciting, and there's no pizza gate here.

828
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Yeah.

829
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,600
There's just like, I don't know, maybe we don't need masks.

830
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,640
The conspiracy theorist community, I think, has burned out the pleasure centers of their

831
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,800
brain that come from this because they went too hard on pizza gate.

832
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Yeah, totally.

833
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Oh, well.

834
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,520
So, one of the things that we know from listening to various periods of Alex's career is that

835
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
what's the summer for?

836
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Rage.

837
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,320
Let's hit some of these headlines right now.

838
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,960
We'll get more into this after I cover the race war they're trying to trigger this summer.

839
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,360
They got a good chance of doing it.

840
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
We got to stop it.

841
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,760
That's coming up the first 30 minutes of the next hour.

842
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
We got a summer of race war rage.

843
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Oh, boy.

844
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Oh, boy.

845
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Mm-hmm.

846
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,840
For the 27th consecutive year this summer, coming to every city near you, a race war

847
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,040
summer of rage.

848
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,840
It wasn't always a race war, though.

849
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
No, that's true.

850
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,720
There was just like financial collapse or like there was something.

851
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,440
Summer of rage 27, the race war time.

852
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,080
Well, I think the last like five or six have probably all been race war related in his

853
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,240
mind, but yeah, it used to be just kind of like it could be a number of different things

854
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,040
and now it just feels sort of one note.

855
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,240
It's just race war.

856
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Yeah.

857
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,600
Anyway, Alex gets to talking about Fauci, but not about the emails.

858
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,200
Instead, he talks about how he thinks there's a pretty good chance that Fauci is going to

859
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
get hung.

860
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
That's fast.

861
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:38,880
I think when I was listening to this, I feel like this clip is really a good isolation

862
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,440
of why people listen to this show.

863
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,680
This satisfies some emotional needs that these listeners have.

864
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,680
All right.

865
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,440
Under the Nuremberg Code, if you're tried and convicted, you get walked up to the gallows

866
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,720
pole because the time is coming when people that do this stuff will be punished, not by

867
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,520
me, but by justice through the courts, and I told you it would come a year ago and you

868
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
see it starting, don't you?

869
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,000
The snowball's too big, too much energy.

870
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,360
You killed too many people, Fauci Gates.

871
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,080
You will pay.

872
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,720
I see it in the stars.

873
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,200
I see it in the cards.

874
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,800
I see it in the tea leaves.

875
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:26,080
I see it in the bones, in the rooms, my dear, your fall, your destruction.

876
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,840
Violence is right.

877
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,880
It is coming.

878
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,960
I think people just have some sort of a gratification of hearing someone say that violence is coming

879
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,880
to the people that they've been trained not to like.

880
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
Yeah, it seems like it.

881
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,840
That's very televangy, televangelisty to a realty.

882
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,640
Also so false.

883
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Yeah.

884
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,760
It was very, very fake.

885
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Yeah.

886
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,440
At least Sinner in the Hands of an Angry God felt genuine.

887
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah.

888
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Yeah.

889
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Alex knows he doesn't have to try.

890
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
No.

891
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:06,840
So one of the things that I think is always tough to suss out is like, who's on what side?

892
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,880
We've had a lot of changes over the years.

893
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Yeah.

894
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
Yeah.

895
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
So I regret to inform you.

896
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,600
Is Bill Maher still on the side of secret patriots?

897
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,520
No, he had a one day redemption where he was a secret Tucker, and now he's back to being

898
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
evil.

899
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,600
Oh man, I hate it when shows do that.

900
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,560
Listen, I don't want to talk about celebs.

901
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Okay.

902
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
I want to talk about geopolitics.

903
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Okay.

904
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Yeah.

905
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Okay.

906
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,720
Now we know that Alex thinks the literal devil is behind his enemies.

907
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Yes.

908
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,520
So that must mean that all of the people who are on one team, they're with the devil.

909
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Right.

910
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,920
And then the people are on the other team conceivably with God.

911
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Yeah.

912
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,040
They try and avoid moral gray area.

913
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
It's very complicated.

914
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Certainly.

915
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Yeah.

916
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,280
And we did have the UK was looking good when Brexit was going through, but apparently Boris

917
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,680
Johnson is a traitor.

918
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Sure.

919
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Yes, there was that.

920
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,000
And so now they're up in the air.

921
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yeah.

922
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah.

923
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah.

924
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's unclear where the UK is going to fall.

925
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Right.

926
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Right.

927
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So we should not forget that the queen hit the dictator button.

928
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,640
I forgot about that.

929
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
Like a year ago.

930
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,720
There's so many spinning plates these days.

931
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
So many spinning plates.

932
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Yeah.

933
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
The queen is a secret Patriot.

934
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
I forgot about that.

935
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,680
I would like to, I would like to know if the Pope is still in jail.

936
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,160
I need to know, did he, did he change his ways?

937
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,560
You know, or has, is the cause the Pope hasn't said like new things that are more conservative

938
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
than they were before.

939
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,800
So is the fake Pope even a, like an actual clone who's just unable to break the programming

940
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
of being the same old Pope?

941
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I need to know this.

942
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
I don't know.

943
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
We'd have to ask Steve.

944
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,120
Anyway, here are the teams.

945
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,040
We have a, we have a layout of who's, who's good, who's bad.

946
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,400
And boy, it's not surprising because it's the Islamics with communist China, the EU,

947
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,680
Hollywood, the blue cities, the blue states, the UN all against America and Russia.

948
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
Wow.

949
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,800
And that means the American people and the Russian people and the Brazilian people.

950
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Okay.

951
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
So you got Brazil in there.

952
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Wow.

953
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,160
It's Russia, the United States and Brazil, Jesus Christ versus everybody.

954
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,060
And a verse, a lot of people inside the United States, I would say about half the country

955
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
at least.

956
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,920
I would say that it doesn't get more above the left, right paradigm than that.

957
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Yes.

958
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,840
That's about the most, uh, here's, here we, here's what we got going on.

959
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Okay.

960
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,920
We've got, uh, we've got everybody and then we've got Russia, United States and Brazil.

961
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,360
Definitely not the new axis of evil.

962
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,600
That would be a crazy thing for someone to say that these countries are very similar

963
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,120
right now to Italy, Germany.

964
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Okay.

965
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
Yeah.

966
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,160
I, I find, I find it interesting.

967
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,600
I mean, not, not the sort of other countries that Alex feels kinship with.

968
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Sure.

969
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
That doesn't surprise me at all.

970
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
No, of course not.

971
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,080
Those are, those are like his guys, Putin and Bolsonaro dictators, but I find it interesting

972
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,400
the way he, it's the rest of this is so stateless.

973
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,340
It has to do with the blue cities, the blue States, Hollywood, and like so, so much of

974
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,020
it is like half of this country is going to have to go down if you know, we're gonna be

975
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,960
able to make this the America make it America again.

976
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Yeah.

977
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,200
I mean, it's honestly, I, I serious question, uh, that, I mean, obviously you can't answer,

978
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:30,280
but if MBS sent Alex like a letter that was just like, Hey, I'm a secret Christian.

979
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,280
We're not going to pro persecute Christians in Saudi Arabia anymore.

980
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,280
He would totally be like, I love MBS now.

981
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Right?

982
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Yes.

983
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
He would have to.

984
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Yes.

985
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
He loves what MBS does.

986
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,620
He did killing Khashoggi, I think that even if MBS didn't go that far, I think that he

987
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,320
just made an overture and said, you're right about the globalists totally.

988
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
I will.

989
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,020
I will not join your religion, but I will follow you against the demonic globalists

990
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,020
or whatever.

991
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,020
Yeah.

992
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
Alex would be like, yeah, Saudi is pretty cool.

993
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,020
I, you know what?

994
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,960
I heard a lot of stuff about, uh, about them in the past and it turns out that was all

995
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,080
a, that was a psy-op, you know, I didn't like Putin before, but now, you know, I've

996
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,360
seen that Putin is a good Christian.

997
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,920
I might've spent a long time back in 2003 talking about every day about how evil Putin

998
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:22,240
was and never taken back any of those comments or suggested that what I said was not true.

999
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Psy-op.

1000
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Just don't care.

1001
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:33,040
So, uh, Alex spends an entire segment talking about China and it's exhausting because it's

1002
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,440
all kind of the stuff that we've gone over in the past.

1003
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Yeah.

1004
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,200
And his grievances about Chiang Kai-Shek.

1005
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
Right, right.

1006
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
Yes, of course.

1007
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
And what have you.

1008
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Of course.

1009
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Uh, and this is how it ends.

1010
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,520
Apparently China has double-crossed the globalists.

1011
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
Okay.

1012
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Okay.

1013
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,560
And China double-crossed the globalists on multiple fronts.

1014
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,280
They're not doing the one-child policy.

1015
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,400
They're, they're, they're, they're expanding their military, not just dominating economic

1016
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,440
systems and Biden can't serve them enough when he announces, Hey, we won't build any

1017
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
of our own batteries.

1018
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,140
We'll only buy it from China.

1019
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,320
We won't let Americans mine and I'll shut it.

1020
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,280
And now Biden announced a plan to shut down 30 plus other big pipelines, giving the States

1021
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
the power to shut down existing pipelines and to give Whitmer the power to violate a

1022
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,440
U S treaty and shut off the main pipeline to the Midwest out of Canada.

1023
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,840
I mean, we are under child calm attack.

1024
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,280
So of course he's running to Tulsa a hundred years ago.

1025
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,280
People killed each other.

1026
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,280
Hundreds dead.

1027
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,680
Let's have a race war.

1028
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,720
How obvious is this?

1029
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
I'm going to go to break.

1030
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,480
We're going to come back.

1031
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Don't forget.

1032
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,360
We're extending the store, free shipping and double Patriot points until Sunday, DNA force

1033
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,360
plus.

1034
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,360
Yeah.

1035
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:49,040
So apparently Alex is pretty mad about Biden going to Tulsa to celebrate or pay respects

1036
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,560
to the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre.

1037
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,560
Yeah.

1038
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Weird.

1039
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,560
Yeah.

1040
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,520
I'm surprised that Alex would not want to to have that talked about or even mentioned

1041
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,640
or recognized or even have it exist within the records.

1042
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,540
Now you know, what's weird.

1043
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,560
Last year, Trump scheduled a campaign rally in Tulsa on June 19th, which understandably

1044
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:17,440
seemed a little not great because June 19th is Juneteenth, which is the celebration of

1045
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,240
the ending of slavery in Texas, which is the last state where it was still taking place.

1046
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,120
Now Tulsa is the site of the Tulsa massacre, which occurred on May 31st and June 1st in

1047
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,340
1921 when mobs of white people destroyed the Greenwood district in Tulsa, the largest concentration

1048
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,080
of black wealth in the United States.

1049
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,200
So obviously the combination of Trump going to Tulsa on June 19th seemed like a little

1050
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,480
bit of a eh.

1051
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,680
And not just mobs of white people, organized mobs of white people with the fucking military

1052
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
on their side.

1053
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
So yeah.

1054
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,200
So Trump ended up rescheduling that event after some very understandable backlash, but

1055
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,000
he did say in a subsequent interview, quote, I did something good.

1056
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,420
I made Juneteenth very famous.

1057
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,760
It's actually an important event, an important time, but nobody had ever heard of it.

1058
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Wow.

1059
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Ah, man.

1060
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,200
Alex didn't have any problem with any of that, but for Biden to visit the Greenwood district

1061
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,920
and pay homage to the Tulsa massacre, that's a huge problem apparently because I guess,

1062
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
I don't know.

1063
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,460
I mean, I think one of the main reasons that it is such a huge problem for conservatives

1064
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,280
and why they absolutely do not want to discuss it whatsoever is because it is the marriage

1065
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,280
of two things that they love the most at cross purposes, which is white people and wealth.

1066
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,800
And they can't say that it's okay for the wealth to be wiped out without saying that

1067
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,400
it's their giant fucking racists.

1068
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,800
And they can't say that it's not okay for white people to murder en masse because they're

1069
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,240
giant fucking racists.

1070
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,300
So they're just trapped in this space of like, you can't earn your way out of racism in America.

1071
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,560
That's what they're saying.

1072
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,680
And that's their message is always, you're like, no, you can pull yourself up by your

1073
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
bootstraps.

1074
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,220
No, the real message is if you do that, you will be murdered and slapped down again because

1075
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,220
that's what they need.

1076
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:09,960
And one of the other things too, not to, not to totally jump off subject, but when, when

1077
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,060
he was talking about these pipelines and stuff, shouldn't his politics be that States can

1078
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,200
opt out of pipelines?

1079
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:24,380
Why is he mad that Biden is saying that States can not participate in pipelines?

1080
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,380
I don't know.

1081
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,200
There's just no, there's just nothing.

1082
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,200
There's just nothing.

1083
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,360
I don't understand how that wouldn't be like exactly what he would, like, if Trump did

1084
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,400
that, he'd be like, fuck yeah, everybody needs to have the power in the States.

1085
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,600
So there's a big news breaking in the middle of the show.

1086
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:43,500
And that is that someone in China made a comment, watch out.

1087
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,680
So when you see the communist Chinese come out in their official publication and say,

1088
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,380
if you investigate the lab, we're going to nuke you.

1089
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,380
That's what they said today.

1090
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,720
And China paid American media outlets millions to publish propaganda.

1091
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,200
We're going to list those groups for you when we come back, who the traders are.

1092
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,360
I definitely don't like the idea of someone airing a list of traders on their show, especially

1093
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,980
Alex, someone who has a participation sports philosophy towards his show historically listing

1094
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,760
traders is usually a good idea.

1095
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,760
It's not.

1096
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,360
So this story about China paying for articles and some Western outlets, that's not news.

1097
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,200
That's an old story about an English language paper in China controlled by the government

1098
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,600
called China daily.

1099
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,900
They paid to have articles placed in outlets, but all of those would have had to have an

1100
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,440
alert informing readers that this is paid content.

1101
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,840
I don't like it, but it's definitely not the smoking gun and like huge deal that Alex is

1102
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,520
making it out to be sure.

1103
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,700
As for the nuclear war thing, Alex is lying.

1104
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,920
It's true that there's a Newsweek headline that says, quote, China state media says country

1105
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,100
must prepare for nuclear war with us after Biden asks for COVID probe.

1106
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:48,120
But that's not a statement that's meant to convey a causal relationship between the two

1107
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,280
things, which is what Alex is reporting.

1108
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
Okay.

1109
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,740
He's saying that the Chinese government has said that they'll nuke us if we investigate

1110
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,640
the lab, but that's not what this article is saying at all.

1111
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,600
And this article is his primary source.

1112
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Right, right, right.

1113
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:07,360
The article is about comments made by Hu Zhijin, the editor of the global times.

1114
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,360
The comments had to do with how there was growing tensions in the US-China relations

1115
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,480
and that, quote, China sees much of America's actions and comments to be an encroachment

1116
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,120
on its sovereignty.

1117
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,320
Hu wrote an op-ed that essentially boiled down to this, quote, the number of China's

1118
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,240
nuclear warheads must reach the quantity that makes US elites shiver should they entertain

1119
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,600
the idea of engaging in a military confrontation with China.

1120
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,440
The comments were an escalation and an arms race kind of thing that I think sucks, but

1121
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,880
they also weren't comments that were being made as a threat if we investigate the lab

1122
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,880
theory.

1123
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,880
Jesus.

1124
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
Yeah, that's nonsense.

1125
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,760
But it's right in line with Alex's narratives that he's been building, so that's going to

1126
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,400
take precedence over the reality of the situation that, honestly, we should not be thrilled

1127
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,400
about.

1128
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:56,680
I mean, wild, wild to have the headline be, Chinese man says Reagan had a point.

1129
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,600
You know, like, I don't understand, yeah, of course.

1130
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,880
Historically, you should have more nuclear weapons to keep the United States from invading

1131
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,400
you.

1132
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,720
I don't want people to have any, I don't want nuclear weapons at all.

1133
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
No.

1134
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Absolutely not.

1135
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,040
Absolutely not.

1136
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:20,680
Yeah, it does make sense for a power in the context of, like, heightening tensions to

1137
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,800
be like, we should make it so no one will attack us because it looks like someone might

1138
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
attack us.

1139
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,000
America's on their fucking bullshit again.

1140
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,560
Yeah, everybody's pumping out Iraq war propaganda about the, oh, Jesus.

1141
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,200
I understand that.

1142
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:41,160
I would prefer we take another direction with it and de-escalate things on a larger scale,

1143
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,960
but I get that thinking, and that's the thinking that is behind that comment.

1144
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,960
Not that if you look into the lab, we'll nuke you.

1145
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,960
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1146
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,960
It's so ridiculous.

1147
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,960
Yeah, no, it's global realpolitik that, again, Kissinger was like, we gotta have this.

1148
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,560
And this, too, is why listening to Alex is kind of a dead end, because there is a reality

1149
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:06,760
that you should be aware of in this Newsweek story that is, yeah, these kinds of conversations

1150
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,760
are happening.

1151
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,340
Some people are making comments, be it in official outlets or in op-eds that are like,

1152
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,000
we should bulk up our defenses to make sure that no one attacks us.

1153
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,060
That's fucked up.

1154
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:23,580
It doesn't necessarily reflect a government policy, but it is something that is worthwhile.

1155
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,400
If you listen to Alex, the way that this story is going to be presented to you is, the Chinese

1156
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,760
are so afraid of us investigating the Wuhan lab that they will nuke us if we do it.

1157
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,520
And that is a dead end, because what do you do with that information?

1158
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,240
It's not true.

1159
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,240
It's ridiculous.

1160
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:48,920
No, it's just you saying, see, they're so overreacting to it, it's obviously true.

1161
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,380
He's not asking a question, he's not saying anything.

1162
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,920
What he's really doing is, hey, they wouldn't act like this if they weren't the cause of

1163
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,460
the Wuhan lab leak.

1164
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,460
The end.

1165
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,460
You know?

1166
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,460
Basically.

1167
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,460
It's proof.

1168
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,460
Yep.

1169
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,780
So on this episode, Alex is really obsessed with an interview that Judge Joe Brown did,

1170
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,780
and I don't care.

1171
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,440
No, no, no, you cannot.

1172
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:16,160
The only point of it is that Judge Joe Brown thinks that Biden's a racist, and, all right,

1173
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,160
Joe Brown.

1174
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,160
Yeah.

1175
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,160
I used to watch Joe Brown a lot.

1176
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,160
Did you?

1177
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,160
Judge Joe Brown?

1178
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,160
Yeah.

1179
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,320
And me and my friends would sit around, get high, watch judge shows, and I love Joe Brown

1180
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,040
because he always looked like he just got up from a nap, because he was so annoyed by

1181
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,040
everybody in the courtroom.

1182
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,800
He was very annoyed by everyone.

1183
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,040
It's like, you mean to tell me?

1184
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,080
I liked his demeanor quite a bit.

1185
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,560
Okay, so, but here's my, okay, so Judge Joe Brown says that Biden's a racist.

1186
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,560
Right.

1187
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,660
If Judge Judy comes out and says Biden's not a racist, what show do they go on?

1188
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,840
We got to go to Judge Mills Lane, obviously.

1189
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
My bad, my bad.

1190
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
That was too obvious.

1191
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,880
And settle this in a celebrity death match.

1192
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:04,760
Yeah, I mean, look, no disrespect to Judge Joe Brown.

1193
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,680
He is a judge and all, but I think when it comes to-

1194
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,480
Is he a real judge or is he-

1195
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,600
I don't think you can be on those shows and not be a real judge.

1196
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,240
I think you have to be a judge.

1197
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,840
I don't know if that's true.

1198
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,840
That might not be true.

1199
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,720
I feel like that is definitely not true.

1200
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,860
Judge Judy is a judge.

1201
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,280
She is a judge.

1202
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Right.

1203
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
Ooh.

1204
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,280
Judge Mathis is a judge.

1205
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,200
Judge Mathis is a judge.

1206
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,400
Maybe Judge Joe Brown is a real judge.

1207
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,400
I think he is.

1208
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,080
How do you get to be a judge and then get on TV?

1209
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,680
We should explore this more, but we don't-

1210
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,960
That sounds really fucked up to me now that I think about it.

1211
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,880
So they've been practicing judges on the bench for a long time and then they get a TV show?

1212
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,400
That seems wrong.

1213
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,920
It seems strange, but it also is a good career path.

1214
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
Well, you're not wrong.

1215
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
Okay.

1216
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
Judge Joe Brown.

1217
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,920
Is he-

1218
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,000
Judge Joe Brown.

1219
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Real judge?

1220
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Question mark.

1221
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,440
Judge Joe Brown is a former American lawyer and television personality.

1222
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Aha.

1223
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,860
Oh, he is a former Shelby County, Tennessee criminal court judge and a former arbiter

1224
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,320
of the arbitration based reality show Judge Joe Brown.

1225
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,320
Okay.

1226
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,880
So yeah, he was formerly a judge in Tennessee.

1227
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,880
All right.

1228
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,880
Okay.

1229
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,880
Yeah.

1230
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,120
I would imagine that if you're ever on one of those shows, you're not an active judge.

1231
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,640
I think that's where I got confused.

1232
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,480
You're not moonlighting.

1233
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,520
I think there's a part of me that like when I filled out my Chicago ballot and I was voting

1234
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,960
for judges, then that connected to my mind, well, obviously I was voting for Judge Mathis

1235
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,880
or Joe Brown at some point.

1236
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,280
No, I think it's a good sort of late career move if you're someone who has some charisma

1237
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,840
and can make court hearings fun.

1238
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,840
Absolutely.

1239
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,960
Yeah, we will need a judge to settle this next issue.

1240
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,960
Okay.

1241
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,080
Alex is escalating this whole thing about Fauci getting hung.

1242
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,080
Okay.

1243
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,080
And now it's going to happen in public.

1244
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,080
That's not good.

1245
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,760
Fauci and Bill Gates are being destroyed as we speak.

1246
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,680
I told you months ago, they will be politically annihilated bare minimum.

1247
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:06,120
And I, I just go with my gut and the analysis, I think they're going to go to prison.

1248
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,920
I think if we work hard, we expose them and we're diligent, we pray, I believe they'll

1249
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,080
be convicted and that someday I believe we'll watch them both hung in public.

1250
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,080
I really do.

1251
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,880
They launched this attack with communist China.

1252
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,800
You know, you think that's strong rhetoric and it's not.

1253
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,080
Communist China just threatened to nuke us if we keep investigating the Wuhan lab.

1254
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,040
They did this on purpose with the UN.

1255
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,040
See?

1256
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,040
Wow.

1257
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,440
See how that information ends up being used?

1258
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Yeah.

1259
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,840
Yeah, it's silly.

1260
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:39,900
Does everybody know that, that like now in the, in the modern world when, when they see

1261
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:49,120
like public hangings in a TV show or in a movie or in real life, those are the bad guys.

1262
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,320
The good guys are never doing public hangings.

1263
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,320
Hmm.

1264
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,320
Yeah.

1265
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
It seems rare.

1266
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,320
Yeah.

1267
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
That's fucked up.

1268
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
Yeah.

1269
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:06,140
I mean, look, I, I, I, I, I struggle with this because on the one hand, if anything

1270
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,040
that Alex was saying were true, these people are enemies of humanity.

1271
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
That is true.

1272
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,040
No, you're not wrong.

1273
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,040
You're not wrong.

1274
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,040
That's true.

1275
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,520
I mean, if they are wiping out millions of people, that is true.

1276
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,520
I do think that you should probably, you know, that's a hangable offense.

1277
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,800
I think so.

1278
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
Sure.

1279
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:29,000
I think that there's a narrow area where death penalties might be, maybe we go ahead and...

1280
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,920
Genociders can get the death penalty.

1281
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,920
I'm fine with that.

1282
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,600
I feel like that's inarguable as a, as a relatively fair solution.

1283
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Sure.

1284
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,640
I don't know about the public spectacle part.

1285
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,960
I, oh, I, I certainly don't think that would be healthy.

1286
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,960
Yeah.

1287
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,080
But I also, but if you, but if you didn't do that, everyone would come up with conspiracies

1288
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,400
about how it didn't really happen.

1289
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,080
They're going to come up with, JFK is going to, JFK is still alive, according to some

1290
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,080
people.

1291
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,080
His head blew up on TV.

1292
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,640
Look, we're not going to be able to negotiate this and thankfully we don't have to.

1293
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,640
That's a good point.

1294
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,000
We don't have to because Alex has indicated that he's okay with a lesser punishment.

1295
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Okay, good.

1296
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
You have to say it.

1297
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,200
I don't want any harm against Bill Gates or Fauci.

1298
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,640
That could turn them into heroes.

1299
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,960
That could turn them into martyrs.

1300
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,360
No vigilante violence.

1301
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,980
I want them arrested.

1302
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,520
I want their records brought out.

1303
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:23,560
I want public trial and that I want a jury to find them guilty because the evidence is

1304
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,560
overwhelming.

1305
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,760
And I will take life in prison.

1306
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,800
They are incredible villains.

1307
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,240
And so I don't think execution would turn them into victims, but maybe let them spend

1308
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:43,480
the rest of their miserable lives on public display.

1309
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,960
Like you put animals in a cage, you want us to live in a cage.

1310
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,080
How about we throw Joe Biden in there with them?

1311
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,080
All right, man.

1312
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,080
Okay.

1313
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,080
Yeah.

1314
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,080
All right.

1315
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,080
What a gracious guy though.

1316
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,080
He's offering life in prison.

1317
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,840
It is nice to, to say, look, look, look, this requires a public hanging.

1318
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,640
God's justice demands a public hanging, but we will keep you in a dog cage for the rest

1319
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,360
of your life and have people walk by and spit on you.

1320
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,360
Yes.

1321
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360
Yeah.

1322
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,520
That is what happens when you release plagues.

1323
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,240
We put you in a box.

1324
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,380
Yeah, that's about right.

1325
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:25,480
So Alex has the Hodge twins on who are a couple of twins as their name suggests.

1326
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Yeah.

1327
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,480
Yeah.

1328
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
They are conservatives.

1329
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,880
Is Judge John Hodge been a judge?

1330
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
Nevermind.

1331
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,880
That was a joke.

1332
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,880
It used to be.

1333
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:41,160
So Hodge twins, they have some bad opinions and here's one of them.

1334
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,120
Black people are so upset about Christopher Columbus.

1335
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,920
You don't want to celebrate that, but why y'all want to celebrate something that happened

1336
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,920
over a hundred years ago.

1337
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,640
They're talking about the, uh, the Tulsa massacre.

1338
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
Yeah.

1339
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,600
The only reason why they want to celebrate these things is because they're asking for

1340
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,160
something and they think Joe Biden and the Democrats and people on the left is actually

1341
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,960
going to give them reparations or restitution.

1342
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,000
They're not going to see any, any of that.

1343
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,040
They have not till this day, black folks, black liberals have woken up and realize what

1344
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,480
these people are doing to them.

1345
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,560
They're using them mentally enslaving them or vote.

1346
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,320
That's the only reason why Joe Biden's there.

1347
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
Yeah.

1348
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,560
They're actually asking for reparations for what happened in Tulsa.

1349
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,960
There's only like two survivors left from that.

1350
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,960
Yeah.

1351
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,960
And I say fine.

1352
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,960
Give them, I mean, sure.

1353
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,360
The state or somebody should try to help them out.

1354
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,160
But the point is, is he's there to open old wounds and distract from what he's doing to

1355
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,360
all Americans shutting down the pipelines.

1356
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,080
Now Trump, Trump wasn't opening up old wounds last year.

1357
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
No, no, no, no.

1358
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,080
He wasn't doing that.

1359
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,080
I don't know.

1360
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,080
That'd be weird this time.

1361
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,520
Joe Biden always opens up old wounds.

1362
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,840
I think that it's horseshit that Alex is saying like, yeah, of course.

1363
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,840
Give them repar...

1364
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,840
Why?

1365
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,840
Why?

1366
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,840
Why Alex?

1367
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
Why?

1368
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
Yeah.

1369
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,840
You don't believe that for a second.

1370
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,840
No.

1371
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,520
You're saying that because you know that like saying don't, it would sound like shit.

1372
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
Yeah.

1373
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,520
Absolutely.

1374
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,520
Now.

1375
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,400
A baseball should go whizzing right by his head just as a like warning shot.

1376
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Do it again, man.

1377
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Do it again.

1378
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
Yeah.

1379
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,040
Claim that you're fine with giving some people reparations again.

1380
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,960
Feel that break through the air.

1381
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,360
Now one of the reasons that the Tulsa massacre in particular is something that is brought

1382
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,000
up in the conversation about reparations is because it was not just an attack on people.

1383
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It was an attack on black wealth.

1384
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Exactly.

1385
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,760
And you know, one of the reasons that some of these issues have rippled through our country's

1386
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:36,840
history so resonantly is because of the exclusion of nonwhite people from participation in the

1387
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,840
market.

1388
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Yeah.

1389
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
Exactly.

1390
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
Yeah.

1391
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,640
And this is a, that was a giant attack on exactly that.

1392
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,640
Yeah.

1393
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,120
And I think pretending that you don't understand that is a little bit silly and I think if

1394
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:55,240
you're a commentator then you're going to come around and say that people only remember

1395
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,240
that event because they want something.

1396
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Yeah.

1397
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,040
They want to guilt Biden into giving them something.

1398
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,560
I think you're a piece of shit.

1399
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,200
I think that's a shitty opinion.

1400
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,720
And that, that like idea of Alex even being like, well, you know, there's two survivors,

1401
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,000
so yeah, the government should help them out or something like that.

1402
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,320
That's absolutely missing the point of wiping out generational wealth.

1403
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,600
You did, there are not two survivors of that massacre.

1404
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,480
There are countless survivors of that massacre.

1405
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,480
Yeah.

1406
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,200
And that's, that's the point.

1407
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,200
That is a point.

1408
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
Yeah.

1409
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
Well not, yeah, not the point.

1410
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Apologies.

1411
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1412
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,200
That's the point that he's avoiding.

1413
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,200
Yes.

1414
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,440
That's what he's basically and kind of like detracting from is what I was trying to say.

1415
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,240
While at the same time confusingly saying that it's okay to give something to those

1416
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,240
two people.

1417
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,240
Right.

1418
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,880
Which again, I would just ask if I were, anyway, if I were in a position that these hodge twins

1419
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,760
are in, I would just be like, why?

1420
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,760
Yeah.

1421
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
Please say why.

1422
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
Tell me why these two are fine.

1423
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,760
That's okay and it's not okay in other circumstances.

1424
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,760
Absolutely.

1425
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,320
So, so these people, these people had something taken from them.

1426
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,320
Right, right.

1427
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,040
And so they deserve recompense in some form.

1428
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,040
Correct.

1429
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,040
Okay.

1430
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,280
Let's take this a step further.

1431
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,280
I don't understand.

1432
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
There are more steps?

1433
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,280
Let's not.

1434
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
Hmm.

1435
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,000
So there's been a lot of talk about how there's a coming indictment for Trump.

1436
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Sure.

1437
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Trump's going down.

1438
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Sure.

1439
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,640
Roger Stone's been playing into this quite a bit.

1440
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,960
Alex has been warning people that he's going down on the 4th of July.

1441
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,760
No, I thought he was going to be reinstated.

1442
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,760
No, no, no.

1443
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,740
That's the, maybe who knows.

1444
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:32,020
Maybe they'll indict him and magically like a, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes who

1445
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,200
will become president.

1446
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,200
That could be.

1447
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,200
Maybe.

1448
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,240
Maybe the Democrats just want a third go at impeachment, you know, like they fucked up

1449
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,480
the first two real bad.

1450
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,480
Third tries a charm.

1451
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,480
Third tries a charm.

1452
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,560
However, the Hodge twins, they do not think that this is real and they think it's a distraction.

1453
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,400
I don't, I don't think they're going to get an indictment on him.

1454
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,560
I mean, he's the most vetted president we've ever had.

1455
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,560
Everybody's investigated this man.

1456
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,560
They have found nothing.

1457
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,560
I'd be shocked if they found anything.

1458
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,560
Yeah.

1459
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,160
I think more than anything, Alex, it's just a distraction because they're doing the audits

1460
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,220
in Arizona, in Nevada.

1461
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,220
That's what they're really doing.

1462
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,220
It's just a distraction.

1463
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,640
What Biden's doing in Tulsa.

1464
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,120
I mean, everybody on mainstream media on the left is just lost their minds talking about

1465
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,060
when they started actually auditing the results.

1466
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:20,920
I'm like, I don't understand why they will be so upset unless they trying to hide something.

1467
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:27,840
If you're so sure if Biden won that election, honestly, why don't you let everybody go in

1468
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,360
audit the results and just show and tell everybody that's on the right, how stupid and naive

1469
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,360
they are.

1470
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:39,680
I mean, you have a goal and opportunity to show everybody in America how lost Trump supporters

1471
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,680
are.

1472
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,680
Yeah.

1473
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,680
I don't be willing to show that, Alex.

1474
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,680
Look at the results.

1475
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,680
He won here.

1476
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,680
He won here.

1477
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
He won here, but they don't want to do that.

1478
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,040
They don't even want to investigate the results or audit because they're scared what's going

1479
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,040
to be uncovered.

1480
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,560
I mean, that's just a dumb argument and you can, you can take the exact idea and just

1481
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,040
place it wherever you want with the story that you've written for yourself.

1482
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:02,800
You know, a good example of this, whether or not there's any truth to it is, Oh, why,

1483
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,440
why won't Trump release all of his financial information if he's, Oh, he has to be afraid

1484
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,700
of what's in there.

1485
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,280
And that's a story that you can write for yourself.

1486
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:17,840
It may be more likely than this whole election was a fraud or whatever, but it's, you know,

1487
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,720
pretending that, you know, what would be found if someone looked at something and that's

1488
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,240
why they're not looking at it.

1489
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,240
Sure.

1490
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,240
Sure.

1491
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,240
Sure.

1492
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
Is just a dishonest, uh, kind of game.

1493
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
Yeah.

1494
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,360
I mean, the thing about that though, is it's eminently reasonable from what we do know

1495
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:39,240
is that if you really went through just about any billionaires, no, any billionaires finances

1496
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,640
sooner or later, you would find some crime.

1497
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,640
I understand that.

1498
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,780
Not like, not like maybe not a big crime, maybe not nothing, but you'd be like, there's

1499
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:51,000
no way that you can get to be a billionaire without something along the way being fucked

1500
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
up.

1501
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,500
Yeah, I understand that and I think that you could make an argument for what you might

1502
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,440
expect to find, but I don't think that you could argue definitively in the way that they're

1503
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,440
arguing definitively.

1504
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,440
Sure.

1505
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,440
This is what you would find.

1506
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,440
You would find that Trump won the election.

1507
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,520
And what we know from history about elections though is, especially this one, it is really

1508
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,080
hard to cheat the entire country.

1509
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,080
Yeah.

1510
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,080
Really tough.

1511
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Maybe impossible.

1512
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,080
Yeah.

1513
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:21,120
Also this same pattern of why won't you let everyone investigate this?

1514
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,680
You must be afraid of what's underneath.

1515
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,680
Sure.

1516
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,920
If you were just to apply that to Trump, they'd be like, no, no, no, he can't have it because

1517
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
XYZ.

1518
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,920
Exactly.

1519
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,040
There'd be a hundred reasons why this is not the same thing.

1520
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,040
Yeah.

1521
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,040
Who cares?

1522
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,840
And your, your bullshit argument of like, they have a real opportunity to make conservatives

1523
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,840
look stupid here.

1524
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,000
And you're like, no, get the fuck out of here.

1525
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That's trolling.

1526
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Yeah.

1527
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Shut the fuck up.

1528
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
You dick.

1529
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Speaking of trolling.

1530
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I agree.

1531
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And I don't go off color.

1532
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,240
I go off people, but wouldn't Allen West make a great governor of Texas?

1533
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,840
Oh, hell yeah.

1534
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,840
Yeesh.

1535
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,840
Oh my God.

1536
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,280
Just after this episode was broadcast, Allen West resigned as the chair of the Texas GOP.

1537
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:03,120
It was probably at least partially due to fallout from him attending and speaking at

1538
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,360
that QAnon conference last week, where Mike Flynn said that there's no reason that what

1539
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,040
happened in Myanmar shouldn't happen here.

1540
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,200
He didn't serve for chair as long, uh, for a long time.

1541
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:19,000
Uh, and in his time in that position, he changed the GOP of Texas's slogan to we are the storm,

1542
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,560
which is about as overt a reference to QAnon as you can imagine.

1543
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,560
Wow.

1544
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,400
Allen West is a terrible, terrible choice for a leader, but given Alex's embrace of

1545
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,400
Marjorie Taylor Greene lately, it seems like he's kind of seeing the political utility

1546
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,000
of seeing these folks as like a new tea party.

1547
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,400
I think that you might, uh, you might expect to see more of that.

1548
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,960
50, 50 shot Cornel West could become governor of Texas by accident.

1549
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,840
Like that is honestly, they don't know.

1550
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,240
They don't know.

1551
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,080
So Alex wants, uh, Trump to get back on social media and that's something that they spend

1552
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,360
a good bit of time talking about.

1553
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,480
Everything was better for us when people were constantly talking about Trump.

1554
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,080
And that's the same argument that they make about the media, uh, saying like Trump is

1555
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,080
going to get indicted.

1556
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,000
They're like, Trump is driving ratings.

1557
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
He's good for ratings.

1558
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So they talk about Trump.

1559
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,360
It's like, you know, you're doing the same thing, right?

1560
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,360
You know?

1561
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,360
Yeah.

1562
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,120
So anyway, they want him to get back on social media and the Hodge twins have a interesting

1563
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,560
theory as to why that hasn't happened yet.

1564
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,200
He doesn't even have social media.

1565
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,280
He has 2 million followers on gab.

1566
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,160
If he joined gab tomorrow and get 10 million, the site works good.

1567
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,760
They've gotten the bugs out.

1568
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,400
We need to get a message to Trump.

1569
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,680
I don't have any stock in gab.

1570
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,640
I have a site on gab, hundreds of thousands of followers, but, but, but he's deplatformed.

1571
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,800
He needs to get on these other platforms.

1572
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,560
Now he needs to be on rumble.

1573
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,840
He needs to be on gab.

1574
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,560
He needs to be out there instead of, I know for a fact there are people around him that

1575
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,280
are quietly sabotaging him.

1576
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,280
Right.

1577
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,280
Yeah.

1578
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,280
And big techs behind it.

1579
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,960
That's why they banned him from every social media platform that's out there because they

1580
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,320
don't want him to be able to communicate with other consumers and other like-minded Americans.

1581
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,320
Yeah.

1582
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:02,320
Maybe he's, uh, I thought he had some kind of social media platform in the works.

1583
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:07,260
Maybe that's what he's waiting to let everybody see and not somebody else's platform because

1584
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,640
you know, Trump, he wants his own thing.

1585
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,000
So Trump had claimed he was going to roll out his own social media site, which ultimately

1586
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,400
turned out to be a blog on his website that was so roundly mocked that it was taken down

1587
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,860
permanently less than a month after launching.

1588
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:23,200
It was so poorly done that Trump's staff have had to claim that there's a different social

1589
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,800
media thing he's working on.

1590
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,720
And this actually wasn't an embarrassment after all.

1591
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,480
And it's a mess.

1592
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
Wow.

1593
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,480
Yep.

1594
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,880
It was the blog version of the four seasons, my friend.

1595
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,880
That's what it was.

1596
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,080
So, I mean, this is it for the episode and like, honestly, he just interviews the hodge

1597
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,080
twins for the rest of his time and then Gerald Cilenti takes over.

1598
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:49,920
It's like, there's, this wasn't about Fauci's emails.

1599
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,360
I would say, but his emails, Alex, come on.

1600
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,360
I mean, wow.

1601
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:03,480
That is about as stirring an admission of the emails being a giant nothing as you could

1602
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,000
possibly get.

1603
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,600
Like, yeah, because they don't, it doesn't even need to be true.

1604
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,560
It's never needed to be true.

1605
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,840
That's the, you can lie about any of it.

1606
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:17,880
And they're still just like, I don't think this one has legs.

1607
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,140
That's I feel like that's what people are coming to the conclusion right now.

1608
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:26,000
It does feel like a big whiff.

1609
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,680
And you know what, here's the thing too.

1610
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:32,960
Like the way that it feels like a big whiff from everything that I've been able to tell

1611
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,880
the things that I've read, Alex's response here.

1612
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,680
That's a real problem because there should be something in there that's really damning

1613
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,680
if any of the stuff that Alex was saying is true.

1614
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,700
Like there should be something that is fucked up.

1615
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,160
There should be like a message between him and his Chinese handlers.

1616
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,160
Totally.

1617
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,160
Totally.

1618
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:01,540
Because then what you're saying, like the, okay, okay, so you got all of his private

1619
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,540
emails now.

1620
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,640
They were leaked, man.

1621
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,440
You've got all of this information.

1622
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,680
This is the proof that you are looking for.

1623
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,140
And none of it backs up what you're saying.

1624
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,800
So you then have to say like, no, no, no, no.

1625
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,800
So where is it?

1626
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,520
He's got a secret email address that he can, and it's like, then, then what's the point

1627
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,600
of ever leaking anything if it doesn't prove what you like.

1628
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,720
And then you're just going to say it's secret that it goes back to the goddamn hodge twins

1629
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,740
being like, you've got a real opportunity to prove that conservatives are idiots right

1630
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:27,740
here.

1631
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:30,560
You guys have been doing it for us for so many goddamn years.

1632
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,640
Yeah, if you have this giant tranche is a word that Alex loves to use.

1633
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,440
It's a great word in his defense.

1634
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,680
Of emails that have come out that, you know, you'd think would be something that you could

1635
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:46,520
use to build the narratives that you've been building forever.

1636
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,520
Totally.

1637
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,720
You'd think that this would give you some kind of an insight into what was going on.

1638
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:56,940
And instead, so much of the emails that I've read are very indicative of learning along

1639
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:03,040
the way and like the changing awareness is and like at the beginning, people did not

1640
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:11,480
know a whole lot and it, I don't know, it kind of weirdly reinforces reality.

1641
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:22,640
I mean, from, from what I understand, it is really like reinforced my, I suppose, confidence

1642
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,200
in the people who are doing this, because at every point in time, you know, obviously

1643
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,080
looking back, you would say obvious.

1644
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,600
If we knew everything, we wouldn't have done it differently or be able to handle that better.

1645
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,600
Duh.

1646
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,800
But the way that you see the progression there is exactly how you would want people to do

1647
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,800
it.

1648
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,120
As we get more data, we're finding out whether or not this data is useful or non useful.

1649
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:50,040
We're taking the data that we can use and we're using it to refine our process.

1650
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,040
We're taking that refined process, putting it back into the system, getting useful and

1651
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,740
non useful data, and then refining it still further.

1652
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:00,480
And it's like, that's exactly how I want people to work.

1653
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,640
That's how I want like science to work.

1654
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,640
Exactly.

1655
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,760
It's how it works.

1656
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:09,320
At no point in time, did you hear anybody just making these giant guesses?

1657
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,320
I did.

1658
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,320
I did.

1659
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,320
I heard one guy.

1660
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,320
Oh yeah.

1661
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,320
Alex.

1662
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,320
Yes, exactly.

1663
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,640
No, at no point in time in the emails was it like, Hey, we don't know anything about

1664
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:22,280
hydrochloroquine or how it works just yet, but let's just go ahead and say it's great.

1665
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,240
You know, like it didn't happen like that.

1666
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,960
And the fact that it happened for other people like that should give you giant realizations

1667
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,440
that they're dumb, but that won't happen.

1668
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,440
Probably not.

1669
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,440
Because it would be hard.

1670
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,440
You'd have to think.

1671
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
Yep.

1672
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,960
Anyway, it was kind of a bummer because I was hoping for a little bit more stuff to

1673
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,600
dig into as opposed to just new salmon.

1674
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,600
Yeah.

1675
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,000
Just so that you read all those emails.

1676
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,800
You got a lot of ammo in your gun for a werewolf that ain't coming.

1677
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,800
To be clear.

1678
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,060
First of all, I love that metaphor.

1679
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,060
That was a good metaphor.

1680
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,060
I'm surprised.

1681
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:56,060
That was off the dome.

1682
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,280
Yeah, it was nice.

1683
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,760
But I also like, I didn't read all of them, but I read enough to get a very general sense

1684
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:09,840
of what a lot of these are and what the people are talking about in the conspiracy sites.

1685
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,640
And Alex is just doing nothing here on the second.

1686
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,640
Bummer.

1687
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,640
Yeah.

1688
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,560
Maybe later he'll get to it.

1689
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,960
Maybe Leo Zagami will come up with something for him to work with.

1690
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,960
Let's hope.

1691
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:21,960
Let's hope.

1692
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,680
I need a big swing out of these emails because this isn't even a check swing.

1693
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,680
This is a whiff.

1694
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,680
Yeah.

1695
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,520
And this is also still a little bit on the shorter side of an episode.

1696
