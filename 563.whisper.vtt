N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.120
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.280
It's time to pray.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
We are the sustainers.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.280
Knowledgefight.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
Dan and Jordan.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
Knowledgefight.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.280
Riddle art, riddle art, riddle art.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.280
Need money.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
Riddle art, riddle art, riddle art.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.280
Andy and channels.

00:40.280 --> 00:41.700
Andy and channels.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.940
Stop it.

00:42.940 --> 00:44.980
Andy and channels.

00:44.980 --> 00:46.080
Andy and channels.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
Andy.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.080
It's time to pray.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.080
Andy and channels.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.080
You're on the air, thanks for holding.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.080
Hello Alex, I'm a system color and I'm a huge fan.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
I love your room.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.080
Knowledgefight.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
Knowledgefight.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.080
I love you.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.080
I love you.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.080
Thank you.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
I love you.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.080
And thank you.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.080
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Tried, I'm Dan.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.080
I'm Jordan.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.680
Our couple dudes like to sit around and worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
about Alex Jones.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
Jordan.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.680
Dan.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
Jordan.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
Quick question for ya.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
What's up?

01:12.680 --> 01:13.680
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.680 --> 01:14.680
Speaking of Selene.

01:14.680 --> 01:15.680
Ah.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.680
It's a Selene oriented bright spot.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.680
Alright.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.140
So one of the things that I've enjoyed over the course of my time living with this animal

01:21.140 --> 01:25.800
is that she finds new places that she likes to hang out, kind of periodically.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.800
Uh huh, uh huh.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.520
Well, you know, like she was on the couch for a while, that was like where I'd always

01:29.520 --> 01:30.520
find her.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.520
Basic.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
Basic stuff.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.520
Sometimes on my bed.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.520
Of course.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
Totally basic.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.520
Normal.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.520
Lately.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.520
Uh huh.

01:38.520 --> 01:39.520
She's found a new spot that she loves.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.520
Oh, she's going extra.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.120
Every single time I go to the bathroom, she's laying in the tub.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.400
Ha ha ha!

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Yes!

01:45.400 --> 01:48.400
That's how you elevate the form of laying in a weird place, Dan.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Yeah, she's a bath cat now.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
I like that.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
Very excited.

01:51.400 --> 01:56.080
It's gratifying to see sort of this commonality that we have, this bond.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.080
You're both bath people.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.080
Yeah.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.080
Yeah.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.520
I mean, whether, I doubt she wants as much water, if any.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.520
I think none.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.400
I think none would probably be the best, but yeah.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.400
But it's still fun.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.400
Yeah.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.880
It's nice to share things with a cohabitant.

02:07.880 --> 02:08.880
Sure.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.880
What about you?

02:09.880 --> 02:10.880
What's your bright spot?

02:10.880 --> 02:18.360
My bright spot today is I had the chance to break into Robert Evans' home and steal his

02:18.360 --> 02:26.280
manuscript for his book that is being released currently as a podcast or episodic thing,

02:26.280 --> 02:28.680
and I got to read the whole thing, and it's very, very good.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.280
Well, that's great.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.960
I mean, I'm sure it'll probably be the final version that everybody else hears, unless

02:33.960 --> 02:38.080
he takes my advice and rewrites it to be about Mako Sharkrampant.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.080
Right.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.720
Mako Sharkrampant must be represented.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.380
I mean, if you don't have a Mark Richards reference in there, it's like, I guess you're

02:45.380 --> 02:48.160
still writing, but I don't know why.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.040
All art must contain sharkramping.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
Exactly.

02:52.040 --> 03:00.160
No, it's very, very good, and there are a few things he does to not glorify the violence

03:00.160 --> 03:02.640
that is just so great.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.960
It's called After the Revolution, and it's really, really good.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.200
I recommend people read it.

03:06.200 --> 03:13.160
It's coming out, like you said, as chapters in audio format and also in print.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.640
And yeah, you can find that pretty easy.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.640
Just go to his Twitter.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.640
Yeah.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.640
It's good.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.640
Yeah.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.080
So, Jordan, today we have an episode to go over, as promised.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.080
Hey.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
An episode.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
Okay.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.400
So I wanted to check out the day after the Fauci emails got released, because to me,

03:30.400 --> 03:34.840
this seems like the biggest bread-making opportunity of Alex's recent career.

03:34.840 --> 03:35.840
Shouldn't be hard.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.560
There's so many emails, you could say whatever the fuck you want.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.560
No one's going to read them.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.560
No.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.560
No one's going to read them.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.520
So I checked in on June 2nd, 2021, Blackjack.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.720
Now all I'm doing is just screaming Blackjack whenever I realize I'm not going to catch

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
up.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
You just say, bah.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
All I've got is vocalizations.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.720
I don't even have words.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.720
You can't block the shot.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.080
Doesn't work that way.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
Okay, fine.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.080
It's goal-tending.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.080
Fine.

03:59.080 --> 04:05.020
So yeah, I kind of thought the first was when the initial release came out, and I thought,

04:05.020 --> 04:09.380
like the second, by then he's had the evening to come up with whatever bullshit he wants

04:09.380 --> 04:10.380
to say.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.380
He's got to be aligned.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.380
He's got to run with it.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.960
We're going to see how he responds.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.320
Does he fail even at this?

04:17.320 --> 04:18.320
We will see.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.320
Okay.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.320
But first, we've got to take a little moment to say thank you to some new wonks.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.320
Oh, that's a great idea.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
So first, Varnvlog.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.320
Thank you so much.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.320
You are now policy wonk.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.320
I'm a policy wonk.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.320
Thanks, Varnvlog.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.320
Thank you.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.320
Next, use the daddy hole.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
Thank you so much.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.320
You are now policy wonk.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.320
I'm a policy wonk.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
Thank you.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
Next.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.960
This is a real name, apparently, and I feel for this person.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.080
Alex Jones, you are now policy wonk.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.720
I'm a policy wonk.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.200
Thank you very much, AJ is what we'll call you.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.840
Next, Jordan and I, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk.

04:45.840 --> 04:46.840
I'm a policy wonk.

04:46.840 --> 04:47.840
Thank you very much.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.400
The sequel to The King and I I'm writing in my brain.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.760
Next, I like this one.

04:51.760 --> 04:55.040
Post-Tribulation Raptor, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.040
I'm a policy wonk.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.040
I like that one, too.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
That's very good.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.040
Thank you very much.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.720
And Kit and Kiva, thank you so much, you are now policy wonk.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
I'm a policy wonk.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.600
Thank you very much, Kit and Kiva.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.040
Got a couple of technocrats in the mix, too.

05:07.040 --> 05:11.740
First, Erica and Ian, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat and a loyal servant of

05:11.740 --> 05:13.920
Queen Selene, may long she reign.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.520
Thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
I'm a policy wonk.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
Have yourself a brew.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
How's your 401k doing, bro?

05:19.520 --> 05:23.920
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

05:23.920 --> 05:25.400
Let's just get down to business.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.480
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.400
Why are you pimps so good?

05:29.400 --> 05:31.040
My neck is freakishly large.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.840
I declare info war on you.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.040
Thank you so much, Erica, Ian, and the loyal servant of Queen Selene.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.160
Yes, thank you very much.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.720
I like how people are going with the loyal servant of Selene thing.

05:42.720 --> 05:47.720
I feel like we could spiral this out into a cult a lot faster than I would have it,

05:47.720 --> 05:52.520
but you know what the buttercream gang is to regular gangs?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.800
We would create two regular cults.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
Do you know what I'm saying?

05:55.800 --> 05:57.200
I mean, this is already going to Selene's head.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.560
She's taking over my tub.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
That's true.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.720
This is a mess.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.640
Oh, man, I wonder what her first commandment's gonna be.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.080
Thou shalt stay out of my tub.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.080
Probably.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.080
Thou shalt give me gravy.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.400
I think it's probably actually the first commandment.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.400
That would be a good one.

06:09.400 --> 06:14.320
So, Jordan, now it has come time to check in with some birthday shout outs.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.320
Okay.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.600
Being born is a condition that leads to death.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.280
You can say that life is a disease that ends in death.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.960
If you're paying attention, that is a different drop.

06:25.960 --> 06:36.000
This is a theme that Alex has been hitting lately.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.320
Okay.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.320
So Sam.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.320
Happy birthday.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.320
Yeah.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.240
On the 5th, over the weekend, I had a birthday.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.720
Thank you to Sam for having a birthday, and Matthew got in touch and wanted us to give

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
you a shout out.

06:47.720 --> 06:48.720
Happy birthday, Sam.

06:48.720 --> 06:49.720
Happy birthday.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
And this one's really delayed.

06:50.720 --> 06:51.720
This was back in May, I believe.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.720
Steve.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.600
Happy birthday belatedly, but again, life is death.

06:55.600 --> 07:00.160
Life is death, so birthdays are non-birthdays, too, by that logic.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.160
Absolutely.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.480
Being born is a condition that leads to death.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.000
You can say that life is a disease that ends in death.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Happy birthday.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Happy birthday.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.800
So Jordan, I told you.

07:11.800 --> 07:18.280
This is the day that Alex should be responding to the Fauci emails, and here's how he starts.

07:18.280 --> 07:23.640
This is after he played a little bit of a goofy meme video about Scooby-Doo.

07:23.640 --> 07:27.800
It's like Scooby-Doo, but they take the bags off the ghost's head, and it's Fauci and Bill

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
Gates.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
It's a lot of fun.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
He's promoting that.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.800
The wheels have completely come off the COVID-19 operation.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.360
The globalists are in deep trouble.

07:39.360 --> 07:47.360
We put out that little dark comedy piece that you just saw, if you're a TV viewer, you just

07:47.360 --> 07:55.080
heard if you're a radio listener, that spoof on Scooby-Doo, where Fauci and Gates get caught

07:55.080 --> 08:00.680
running the pandemic, launching the operation, and so they go to prison for it.

08:00.680 --> 08:07.160
And when we put that out a year ago, it was banned on Twitter and Facebook as fake news

08:07.160 --> 08:11.920
when it was obviously a parody, but based on real things they'd done.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.600
But boy, a year later, it's evergreen, isn't it?

08:15.600 --> 08:22.320
Meaning it's more important now than when we first put it out.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.120
Busted Scooby-Doo just solved the COVID-19 mystery.

08:26.120 --> 08:30.640
It's got 200 plus thousand views at Banned.video.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.400
I think it needs a lot more than that, doesn't it?

08:33.400 --> 08:34.400
Wow.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.160
In fact, let's make it the featured video at Banned.video.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.080
Oh, boy.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.720
This is important stuff.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.360
I was a little confused.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.920
I am very saddened by this.

08:43.920 --> 08:48.440
Yes, I was a little underwhelmed by this viewing where we're going.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.420
Not least of which because Scooby-Doo, right there.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.420
Right there.

08:52.420 --> 08:56.840
This old meme spoof is what we need to really push, we need to get this.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.240
Was that in one of Fauci's emails?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
Yes.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.240
Oh, okay.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.240
Well, then that makes sense.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.240
The only thing that can bring us down is meme spoofs.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.240
That makes sense.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.240
Yeah, that works.

09:04.240 --> 09:09.240
So I've often sort of wrestled with exactly what it is about Alex's show that I think

09:09.240 --> 09:10.240
is bad.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.480
And I mean, obviously the answer is there's a lot of them.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.420
But one of the things that is sort of central that makes it bad is actually what he articulates

09:18.420 --> 09:20.160
in this next clip.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.080
Because this radio slash TV transmission is not just your regular entertainment.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.200
It's not just your regular news program.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.040
This is a participation sport.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.800
And I think that censored report that you can find only at man.video needs to get shared,

09:34.800 --> 09:35.800
don't you?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.300
The Scooby-Doo.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.960
But this is a participation sport.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.880
That's kind of bad.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.320
That's a bad way of looking at this stuff when you, you know, I mean, granted, if you

09:46.320 --> 09:53.320
go to him under oath or in a deposition setting, he might say, I'm just talking about my feelings.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.040
I don't know about sources.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.680
I don't know about any of this stuff.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.600
You'd have to, you'd have to listen to the whole thing.

09:58.600 --> 10:03.520
You know, like, no, but when he's free and he's on air and he's, this is a, this is not

10:03.520 --> 10:04.520
news.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.520
This isn't entertainment.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.640
This is a participation sport.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.480
I'm trying to incite you to do something.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.480
Yeah.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.480
Yeah.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.480
But that implies that information is a win or lose situation.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.240
Not things are real or not.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.000
You can win with information that's not real.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
You know?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
It's a participation sport.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.320
It's not about finding what's real or what's true or what exists.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.680
It's about winning.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.900
Don't challenge your notions.

10:31.900 --> 10:37.680
Come up with things that you can misrepresent in the real world that reinforce your predetermined

10:37.680 --> 10:42.640
conclusions and play like hell out on the field to make sure everyone else is forced

10:42.640 --> 10:43.640
to accept those things too.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.760
No, and if you, if you change your mind, you're just giving up.

10:46.760 --> 10:47.760
You are.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
You can't give, you can't give up.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.180
You can't be a quitter.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.360
I've watched the challenge.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.920
TJ Lavin doesn't like quitters.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.920
He hates them.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
He hates quitters.

10:54.920 --> 10:55.920
You can't throw in the towel.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.920
Uh huh.

10:56.920 --> 10:57.920
On falsities.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.920
Yeah.

10:58.920 --> 10:59.920
Yeah.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.400
So finally, Alex does end up getting to the Fauci emails and does not cover them that

11:03.400 --> 11:04.400
much.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.960
Let me just hit the headlines now.

11:05.960 --> 11:11.960
In February of 2020 email that's public now, Fauci wrote face mask, not effective in keeping

11:11.960 --> 11:12.960
out virus.

11:12.960 --> 11:18.640
Either he wrote though that it has a good psychological effect and even publicly said,

11:18.640 --> 11:25.400
it's about respect, living in fear, keeping everybody scared, total open and shut.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.280
You should be able to use any of this in court.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.760
There's cases all over the country where they're trying to make people still wear mask in schools

11:30.760 --> 11:31.760
and businesses.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
Boo.

11:32.760 --> 11:38.400
So in the emails early on Fauci did say that there wasn't good reason for everyone to wear

11:38.400 --> 11:39.400
masks.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.040
That was because at the time they were unaware of a number of variables that existed with

11:43.040 --> 11:44.440
COVID-19.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.880
In an interview with CNN after the emails got released, Fauci was asked, quote, a lot

11:48.880 --> 11:50.340
has transpired since then.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.840
If you had to go back and do it all over again, would you tell her something different?

11:53.840 --> 11:55.400
Do you regret that?

11:55.400 --> 11:57.800
Here's his answer, which I think is great.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.800
Yes.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.040
Quote, let's get real here.

12:01.040 --> 12:05.040
If you look at scientific information as it accumulates, what's going on in January and

12:05.040 --> 12:09.880
February, what you know as a fact as data guides you, guides what you tell people and

12:09.880 --> 12:11.160
your policies.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.640
If March, April may occur, you accumulate a lot more information and you modify and

12:15.640 --> 12:19.920
adjust your opinion and your recommendation based on the current science and current data.

12:19.920 --> 12:24.600
So of course, if we knew back then that a substantial amount of transmission was asymptomatic

12:24.600 --> 12:28.560
people, if we knew that the data showed that masks outside of a hospital setting actually

12:28.560 --> 12:33.820
do work when we didn't know it, then if we realize all those things back then, of course,

12:33.820 --> 12:37.960
you're asking a question, would you do something different if you knew what you knew now?

12:37.960 --> 12:39.480
Of course people would have done that.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.000
That's so obvious, right?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
That's a great answer.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.560
But do you know what that is, Dan?

12:44.560 --> 12:47.060
That is losing the participation sport.

12:47.060 --> 12:53.000
No wonder we never win because he's learning and growing and then regretting actions from

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
before.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.440
What he should be saying is, no, I'm so stoked all those people died because of stuff.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.880
I didn't know that I told them.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
That's what I wanted.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.560
I just think that there's something to delineate there though, that it's not, I don't think

13:04.560 --> 13:05.560
it's regret necessarily.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.800
No, I understand.

13:06.800 --> 13:11.820
Maybe a hope that more awareness had or more information had been known at a certain time,

13:11.820 --> 13:17.560
but based on the information that was available, that's what was the solidest recommendation.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.560
Totally.

13:18.560 --> 13:23.720
And then the, the thing about psychological stuff that Alex brings up, from best I can

13:23.720 --> 13:26.880
tell, like that was something that was going on early on.

13:26.880 --> 13:27.880
I don't remember this.

13:27.880 --> 13:33.000
This was when they were talking about like, so when there, there wasn't an awareness of

13:33.000 --> 13:35.240
the asymptomatic spread, right?

13:35.240 --> 13:40.000
There was discussion of if you're sick, you should wear a mask, but if you're not sick,

13:40.000 --> 13:46.080
you shouldn't, you don't really need to, but that puts a stigma on anybody wearing a mask

13:46.080 --> 13:50.260
because then now if you wear a mask, everyone's going to assume you're sick.

13:50.260 --> 13:56.240
And that could lead to people being disincentivized to wear masks when they should wear masks.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.720
No, I mean, leper colonies worked well.

13:58.720 --> 14:02.600
Everybody with leprosy was like, I'm definitely going to go right to this leper colony.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.720
I don't want to hide it and keep people from knowing that I'm a leper because you know,

14:06.720 --> 14:09.000
I'm treated so well in leper colonies.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Yeah.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.560
The, the, the psychological benefit of widespread mask use is that you kind of make it easier

14:14.560 --> 14:20.740
for people who do, are at a higher reason to wear a mask, according to the understanding

14:20.740 --> 14:25.480
at that time, to follow public health advice.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.600
And it works out better for everyone.

14:27.600 --> 14:32.800
If you de-stigmatize these things and make it so everyone just, I don't know, I, I, I,

14:32.800 --> 14:35.080
I have not read all of the Fauci emails.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.680
I've read all of the ones that like get pointed out as like, ah, ha ha.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.680
I've read a bunch of the ones that no one's pointing out.

14:42.680 --> 14:46.080
And I see a nothing here.

14:46.080 --> 14:52.520
And I think Alex does too, because here's what he does immediately instead of going

14:52.520 --> 14:54.720
more into these emails.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.160
And by the way, let me, let me hit the Fauci news here in a minute.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.800
Let me, let me get back into all these COVID news next segment.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.300
And let me just tell you some of the other stuff coming up today.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.360
And then I'll go into each area of the news and tell you about the big guests we've got.

15:07.360 --> 15:13.760
But, but, but, but first I went over to my parents on Memorial day, my dad grilled hamburgers

15:13.760 --> 15:17.040
and my mom made baked beans and deviled eggs.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.520
It was all delicious.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.800
We swam in their swimming pool, myself and my children and family, my wife.

15:22.800 --> 15:23.800
This is a great story.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.960
And there's an old family friend that I've done some three years old, she's a great lady.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.600
And she came over to the house and I've been friends with her son and, and, and her daughter

15:32.600 --> 15:36.160
more years old again.

15:36.160 --> 15:41.440
And so when she tells me a story, it's, it's accurate, of course, but I know her sister

15:41.440 --> 15:42.900
very well.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.000
And I know her daughter very well.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
I guess I've gotten old, old enough now where, you know, my friends are 70 years old, but

15:50.000 --> 15:56.360
she has a granddaughter or her sister does, uh, my friend has a granddaughter.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.760
So this is fucking annoying.

15:59.760 --> 16:05.120
I can't, I can't, I stopped it.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.120
I can't listen.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.320
I can't keep track of all the variables.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.320
There's so many relatives.

16:09.320 --> 16:12.800
There's so many people who don't factor into this story at all.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.120
This is not the Bible.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.000
I don't care who begat who get to the meat.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.040
Well, you're, you're going to wish for more set up when he finally gets to the actual

16:21.040 --> 16:22.040
story.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.040
Okay.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.040
Well, but I, I'm, so I'm friends with the family going way back and we vacation together.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
We camp together.

16:27.040 --> 16:33.240
So they're our best friends as a family and they live in Rockwall where I grew up.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.360
That is her sister does, and they're evangelical Christians.

16:36.360 --> 16:44.520
They're very nice people, very successful in business and one of the daughters, the

16:44.520 --> 16:51.880
granddaughter was arguing with her mother about issues and they weren't even that big

16:51.880 --> 16:57.200
an issue, but the mother said, Hey, why don't you go to your school counselor and ask them

16:57.200 --> 16:59.320
about some of your boyfriend problems?

16:59.320 --> 17:03.600
You know, we're not going to go pay for you to go to some counselor in town or whatever.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.600
It's not that we're against the money.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.880
It's just, Hey, go to the school counselor.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.200
We pay property taxes for this.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.840
So this is the same high school.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.760
She's a freshman that I went to for the first few years of high school.

17:12.760 --> 17:19.000
Well, I moved to Austin when I was 16 and she goes into the school in Rockwall and it's

17:19.000 --> 17:24.840
a male counselor to a 13 year old girl.

17:24.840 --> 17:30.000
And she told me the whole conversation because her, her, her niece repeated it to her.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.860
She was shocked and he says to her, well, don't you think your problem is you're really

17:36.860 --> 17:37.860
a man?

17:37.860 --> 17:40.040
Oh boy.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.720
So this is, this is where the story is.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.880
I would like more preamble please.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.880
Yeah, exactly.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.320
I would definitely like more preamble.

17:48.320 --> 17:52.440
I would like more preamble as opposed to this clearly not true story.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.820
What are you talking about?

17:55.820 --> 17:57.120
This is made up bullshit.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.280
Oh man, it gets so much...

18:00.280 --> 18:05.400
How is it that you can think it's a great idea to give that much of a preamble to a

18:05.400 --> 18:08.160
story where all you want to be is just transphobic and mean?

18:08.160 --> 18:09.160
Right.

18:09.160 --> 18:15.840
You want to be a real dick and, you know, really try and demonize a certain population.

18:15.840 --> 18:21.840
And in order to do that, the best you got is a third hand story maybe?

18:21.840 --> 18:22.840
Maybe?

18:22.840 --> 18:23.840
A fan?

18:23.840 --> 18:28.680
You have something on the family tree that's a long branch away from you, that's for damn

18:28.680 --> 18:29.680
sure.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.680
Yeah.

18:30.680 --> 18:36.080
I would believe that there's a possibility that somebody who is in a school counseling

18:36.080 --> 18:43.760
position could, you know, if someone were to come to them with gender issues or something

18:43.760 --> 18:48.680
could be empathetic and try and help them.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.280
But I don't believe this.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.280
She goes, excuse me?

18:52.280 --> 18:58.160
He goes, yes, you're having problems with this boyfriend here at school because you're

18:58.160 --> 19:00.840
really sexually confused.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.840
And she goes, no.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.400
He goes, yeah, I think you're a boy.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.400
And she goes, are you joking?

19:05.400 --> 19:07.800
He goes, no, I want to get you in touch with the group.

19:07.800 --> 19:08.800
We need to put you in counseling.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.360
They'll pay for it off site.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.400
You really need this right now.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
And she goes, no, I'm a girl.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.400
He goes, no, you're not.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.400
And she pulls her shirt forward, looks down and says, no, I'm a girl.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.680
And says, I'm getting out of here.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.680
What?

19:22.680 --> 19:27.560
This is a fucking, this is that same meme where like the, this is a joke meme where

19:27.560 --> 19:30.760
the soldiers and the professor's like, liberals are good.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.720
And the soldiers like, I killed everybody in America's the best thing ever.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.440
And the liberal professor cries and he's like, you're correct all the time.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.600
This is a made up nonsense story conservatives tell themselves.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.200
This is the boogeyman story.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
This is bullshit.

19:44.200 --> 19:49.700
I mean, quite frankly, if this happened the way Alex is describing it, she should own

19:49.700 --> 19:50.700
that school.

19:50.700 --> 19:53.360
That guy should be sued into oblivion.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.480
This didn't happen because it's such an open and shut clear case of malfeasance by someone

19:58.480 --> 20:00.120
who works at the school.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.960
Like this would be very easy to get to the bottom of.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.240
What a lying piece of shit.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.240
And it gets worse.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.240
Oh God.

20:07.240 --> 20:12.000
But imagine she's not a troubled child, had a boyfriend issue.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.760
When you're 13, you don't want to so much talk to your mom.

20:14.760 --> 20:19.240
You know, who's the right wing, you know, Christian, but she's conservative too.

20:19.240 --> 20:24.280
So talk to the counselor and you don't even expect in Rockwall, Texas, a suburb of Dallas

20:24.280 --> 20:29.280
that you go there and a man is pushing on you.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.920
It went on and on for like 30 minutes him saying you are by the end of it.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.720
He's like, you are a man.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.120
You are a man.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.120
You are a me.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.680
You need to go to this place.

20:38.680 --> 20:39.680
What an odd counselor.

20:39.680 --> 20:43.720
It's a whole agenda to destroy everybody, men, women, everybody.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.720
It's sick.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.720
It's how you depopulate.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.720
This is outrageous.

20:46.720 --> 20:51.880
Um, and the only real question that I have is how much of this is the story that someone

20:51.880 --> 20:56.400
told him at a cookout and how much is just Alex is like, I'm going to punch this up a

20:56.400 --> 20:57.400
little.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.400
It was a half hour.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.400
He was just yelling.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.400
You're a man.

21:00.400 --> 21:06.680
This is, this is, it's either that or like he's half remembering Austin Powers or something.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.440
You're a man, baby.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.440
That could be.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.640
He might've taken some scissor and watch some old Mike Myers movies.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.120
What kind of lunatic would believe this ever?

21:17.120 --> 21:19.960
I imagine his audience.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.120
You're a man.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.320
It's a ridiculous story.

21:23.320 --> 21:26.120
And then the, then the entire school got gathered around.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.140
They had a big, uh, assembly.

21:28.140 --> 21:31.400
The principal got up and he's like, everybody champ, you're a man.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
You're a man.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.680
It's all the schools are just out of control now.

21:34.680 --> 21:38.760
They just brainwash all of these kids to scream, whatever the principal tells them to, as we

21:38.760 --> 21:40.080
all know, children do.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.080
Yeah.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.080
Jesus.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.080
I don't know.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.680
I don't know if things have changed literally entirely since I was in school, but I do remember

21:46.680 --> 21:52.800
the counselors, um, at every school that I went to, uh, being the sort of folks who just

21:52.800 --> 21:55.480
listen and roll their eyes.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.720
I don't kind of believe you, honestly.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.920
The counselors are not really actively engaged in a lot.

22:01.920 --> 22:06.560
I mean, I'm sure they mean well for the most part, you know, it's a thankless position

22:06.560 --> 22:11.240
to be in school counselor, but, uh, yeah, I don't, I don't remember them being all that

22:11.240 --> 22:15.640
much like working across purposes, trying to make conclusions for you.

22:15.640 --> 22:20.260
I did find it weird when I was in third grade and the school counselor put all of us under

22:20.260 --> 22:24.080
the sorting hat and determined whether we were man or woman.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.800
That was a, that was an interesting day, but I guess that's part of the counselor's job

22:27.800 --> 22:28.800
now.

22:28.800 --> 22:33.820
So this story, I mean, first of all, a hundred percent, absolutely not true, but it leads

22:33.820 --> 22:37.800
me to believe that Alex doesn't really want to talk about the voucher emails that much.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.520
I think even he might think it's a little bit weak.

22:41.520 --> 22:45.520
Well he read some of the email, well he didn't read them, his actual, uh, great grandfather's

22:45.520 --> 22:46.520
nephew.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.840
Uh, he knew him from back when they used to go hunting and fishing.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.840
He knew his son too.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.720
Now his son, you don't even want to know about his son.

22:52.720 --> 22:58.160
That guy got caught, um, you know, with his, uh, diddler and the sheep on the other side

22:58.160 --> 22:59.160
of the things.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.160
But that's a different story.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.160
We don't need to talk about that.

23:01.160 --> 23:05.200
This story is about my great grandfather's nephew and how he had a son and his son was

23:05.200 --> 23:06.420
married to this woman.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.840
That was his first marriage and second marriage.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.660
That was a disaster, but his first marriage, they got married again.

23:11.660 --> 23:15.400
It's like Grover Cleveland, non non-consecutive marriages kind of thing.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.400
Right?

23:16.400 --> 23:18.400
Uh, I don't know how much longer I can keep going.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.200
You're really letting me, you're leaving me out to dry here.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.520
I was kind of hoping you would get into how the second marriage ended up falling apart

23:25.520 --> 23:30.920
because the woman was in an importing exporting business that was actually getting antiques

23:30.920 --> 23:36.880
and relics from foreign countries that were stolen and being, uh, trafficked.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.880
They belong in a museum.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.880
Right, right.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.600
But she was only doing that because of her second cousin who was really in debt to the

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
mob.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Right, right, right, right.

23:44.600 --> 23:48.000
What was this story about again?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Fauci's emails.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
It was great.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
It was a good story.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.840
So, also not to do with Fauci's emails, but Alex has a new shirt that's really popular

23:55.840 --> 24:00.640
and Alex is going to plug this and, uh, keep, pay attention to who this shirt is popular

24:00.640 --> 24:01.640
with.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
Okay.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
I designed this shirt.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
I'm just telling you.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
Not, not bragging.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.480
Uh, and I think it's one of my better designs.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.480
Looks like an iron cross.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.880
The concept team, Robert and others over there, and it's just incredible.

24:12.880 --> 24:18.720
And I didn't intend for it to basically glow in the dark like a, like a tree frog can do

24:18.720 --> 24:24.600
in the species, but it actually glows, uh, under these lights, under regular lights.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.440
We've got a black shirt, a green shirt, and a cream shirt.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.720
And on the back it says, save the frogs info wars.com.

24:31.720 --> 24:36.200
And on the front of the shirt, it's got the same little symbol over your heart.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.480
And I'm telling you, we've had these shirts in for almost a month.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.640
We hadn't gone on sale until a big shipment came in cause you get a test shirt, see if

24:42.640 --> 24:43.640
you approve it.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.640
And as soon as I wore this out, everybody goes, what's that shirt?

24:46.640 --> 24:49.000
I liked that shirt.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.360
John the boom operator never talks about my shirts.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
He goes, what's that shirt?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.760
I love that shirt today.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.760
He wants one.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.640
My son, I was going to shoot an ad for these yesterday.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.200
He works up here.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.200
He comes in my office.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.160
He's done this since he's been as big as I am for years.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.800
He's 18 now, but by the time he was 15, he's as big as I am now.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
He's huge.

25:06.800 --> 25:12.320
Uh, he wears XXL and I see him walking around in my shirt and I said, Hey, you go to the

25:12.320 --> 25:15.000
warehouse down the road, you get one.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.680
You don't steal my shirt.

25:16.680 --> 25:20.160
So I'm telling you, this shirt is so popular that everybody's going crazy over it.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.160
I don't know why.

25:21.160 --> 25:29.080
This shirt is so popular with my employee and my son, this is not a good market sample.

25:29.080 --> 25:34.160
You've got some brand new market research people who work for me like this shirt.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.160
Yeah.

25:35.160 --> 25:39.760
People who work for me or I created, listen, we can't keep them in stock.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.360
They're stealing them from us.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.640
My son is stealing them, but they're stealing them.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.680
So like it's just, they're going like hotcakes.

25:47.680 --> 25:52.400
I wore them out and everybody, including the people who work for me only, and only the

25:52.400 --> 25:54.680
people who work for me just love these shirts.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.040
They're just amazing.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.280
It's got a frog.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.280
The end.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.280
Yeah.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.500
So I think that this was just also a nice way for Alex to weave into talking about some

26:03.500 --> 26:06.840
more of this, you know, like the, you know, they're turning the frogs gay.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.540
That's sort of his bread and butter when everybody loves to, it's the meme machine.

26:10.540 --> 26:11.540
Don't make memes out of this stuff.

26:11.540 --> 26:12.540
Memes, memes, memes.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.960
And so I think he's trying to do a little bit more of that.

26:14.960 --> 26:19.440
They were cloning animals and humans before I was born.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.760
Hitler was cloning rabbits in 1944.

26:22.760 --> 26:25.440
They've been splicing animals and humans.

26:25.440 --> 26:29.880
It went on sale this week, salmon that weighed twice as much than our salmon that are part

26:29.880 --> 26:32.640
insect and part asparagus for whatever reason.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.640
Whoa.

26:33.640 --> 26:37.480
So we get part asparagus salmon.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.480
I tried that.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.960
Yeah, Alex is talking about a new genetically modified salmon that's being bred by a company

26:41.960 --> 26:42.960
called AquaBounty.

26:42.960 --> 26:49.240
And it's actually now really new news, like 2015 they got approval to like create these

26:49.240 --> 26:54.940
genetically modified salmon and it's just like it came to market, but like almost nobody

26:54.940 --> 26:55.940
is buying it.

26:55.940 --> 26:56.940
Okay.

26:56.940 --> 26:57.940
So most people are like, I don't know.

26:57.940 --> 26:58.940
All right.

26:58.940 --> 26:59.940
I'm going to pitch them on a product real quick.

26:59.940 --> 27:03.520
The quilted puffer upper.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.520
All right.

27:04.520 --> 27:08.560
It's a puffer fish that also uses a sponge.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
Yeah.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.960
So I'm going to say this right off the top here.

27:11.960 --> 27:16.320
I'm not sure that I'm okay with what's going on here for ethical reasons, but Alex is still

27:16.320 --> 27:18.380
way off on the details.

27:18.380 --> 27:20.640
The fish don't grow to twice their normal weight.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.800
They grow to their normal weight twice as fast.

27:23.800 --> 27:27.880
This is achieved by splicing into Atlantic salmon, a gene from Pacific Chinook salmon

27:27.880 --> 27:32.600
that make it so the fish produce growth hormone all year instead of part of the year.

27:32.600 --> 27:37.040
Additionally, they added a gene from another fish, the ocean pout that essentially act

27:37.040 --> 27:40.120
as a stabilizing thing for the hormone.

27:40.120 --> 27:43.740
I've not been able to determine if the salmon is part asparagus, but I do know that if you

27:43.740 --> 27:47.560
look into it, you can find some interesting recipes where salmon is paired with asparagus.

27:47.560 --> 27:48.560
Okay.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.560
All right.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.920
Alex might have done that at this cookout of his over the weekend.

27:51.920 --> 27:56.480
A little butter asparagus, put some salt and pepper on there.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.480
Maybe braise it even.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.600
That's not a bad idea.

27:58.600 --> 28:02.520
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this stuff entirely.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.520
I'm not sure.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.280
I'd have to think about it a little bit more, maybe have a conversation with somebody about

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
it.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.280
Yeah.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.420
And apparently most food retailers in the United States agree and they aren't selling

28:10.420 --> 28:11.420
this salmon.

28:11.420 --> 28:12.420
Sure.

28:12.420 --> 28:15.840
This may be like one of those fun instances where I kind of agree with the conclusion

28:15.840 --> 28:19.640
that Alex has that like maybe, maybe this isn't cool, but I think that the way that

28:19.640 --> 28:24.840
he reaches his conclusion is childish, stupid, and a disservice to anyone taking these issues

28:24.840 --> 28:25.840
seriously.

28:25.840 --> 28:26.840
Yeah.

28:26.840 --> 28:27.840
Yeah.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.840
Yeah.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.840
Ridiculous.

28:29.840 --> 28:33.520
And what I'm really into that is as the science fiction fan, I was when I was eight years

28:33.520 --> 28:36.920
old where I was like, yeah, fucking splice everything together.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.520
Let's see what happens.

28:38.520 --> 28:42.640
And now that I'm an adult, I can realize that maybe that kid shouldn't be in charge of gene

28:42.640 --> 28:43.840
editing research.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
Sure.

28:44.840 --> 28:45.840
So maybe we have to hold off on it.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.800
And one of the things that I am concerned about, obviously, and I don't, I don't know

28:49.800 --> 28:52.900
enough, I tried to look into this a little bit, but I don't know if I could even find

28:52.900 --> 28:54.320
a clear answer.

28:54.320 --> 29:00.280
How much does that growing twice as fast, like affect the life experience of these salmon?

29:00.280 --> 29:01.280
Sure.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.920
You know, cause that seems like it could be hellish.

29:02.920 --> 29:03.920
Yeah.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.440
And I think that I don't know.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.440
Or not.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.440
I don't know.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
Yeah.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.640
And then you unpack that, you open it up to the whole like, well, you're going to eat

29:10.640 --> 29:11.640
them anyway.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.640
See, and then you get into, yeah, no.

29:13.640 --> 29:14.640
It's a mess.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.640
It's a mess.

29:15.640 --> 29:16.640
Yeah.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.880
I don't want to wade into it with a hard take.

29:17.880 --> 29:24.360
So Alex talks about these salmon and then he jumps into another story about catfish

29:24.360 --> 29:25.480
in Japan.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.400
And I did not actually pull this clip.

29:27.400 --> 29:31.400
I regret to, one of my, one of my bungles.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.680
But I want to talk about it a little bit because it is also fairly interesting.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.680
But again, the thing that Alex is talking about is nonsense.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.360
Is this like the Nigerian email scam?

29:39.360 --> 29:43.280
He got catfished by somebody in Japan and he's creating a story about that?

29:43.280 --> 29:44.280
I wish it was.

29:44.280 --> 29:51.360
No, he's found an article in Japanese about a Japanese science research project and what

29:51.360 --> 29:54.760
they did is they found a way to make catfish female.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
Okay.

29:55.760 --> 29:59.800
Essentially using something that they derive from soybeans.

29:59.800 --> 30:06.360
Already mature catfish are turned into females or in the embryo, no matter what, it will

30:06.360 --> 30:08.000
be a female catfish?

30:08.000 --> 30:12.520
It is, I don't know if it's fully adults, but they are actual catfish.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.520
Okay, gotcha.

30:13.520 --> 30:18.160
This is another story about people trying to find ways to make fish bigger quicker.

30:18.160 --> 30:22.680
Female catfish grow at much faster rates than males and in farming situations, often males

30:22.680 --> 30:25.800
are just thrown out since raising them to the point where they can be used for marketable

30:25.800 --> 30:29.400
product would cost more than would be brought in.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.400
Researchers in Japan recently found that if they kept the fish in a tank that was full

30:32.400 --> 30:36.840
of water with different things dissolved in it, they could create a more female dense

30:36.840 --> 30:38.240
population.

30:38.240 --> 30:42.720
The use of actual female hormones is not allowed for animals being raised for human consumption.

30:42.720 --> 30:48.160
So the researchers explored isoflavone, which is a chemical that's found in soybeans.

30:48.160 --> 30:54.820
They isolated a compound called genistein, and this is derived from isoflavone, and they

30:54.820 --> 31:00.360
found that if you had a tank of water with 400 micrograms per liter, this resulted in

31:00.360 --> 31:03.440
a tank of catfish that were 100% female.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.440
Wow!

31:04.440 --> 31:05.480
That's wild!

31:05.480 --> 31:08.700
This is interesting, and it's obviously of concern to people who raise fish for a living,

31:08.700 --> 31:12.460
but I think that pretending there's a one-to-one parallel between humans and catfish is a little

31:12.460 --> 31:15.040
bit suspect, which is what Alex is doing.

31:15.040 --> 31:19.560
So also, even if the catfish and human were biologically similar to the point where it

31:19.560 --> 31:24.400
was relevant, this would still seem to suggest that humans would need to swim around in and

31:24.400 --> 31:29.000
breathe water full of isoflavone to have this kind of effect happen.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.440
It's nonsense.

31:30.440 --> 31:34.160
This is, as all too often is the case, it's just an attempt by Alex to take a headline

31:34.160 --> 31:37.320
misrepresented and use it as a weapon against trans people.

31:37.320 --> 31:42.640
He's trying to make the fact of trans people's existence into some kind of a conspiracy,

31:42.640 --> 31:48.240
because this is what they're doing with soy, and all that, and it's like, ugh, I don't

31:48.240 --> 31:49.240
know about this.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.240
This is bad.

31:50.240 --> 31:55.880
That's, ugh, I don't want to, I want a big no on that one.

31:55.880 --> 32:02.440
Yeah, and it's interesting research from what I was able to find, and I don't think it applies

32:02.440 --> 32:08.700
to humans, but Alex tries to get a little bit closer by taking another soy-related story,

32:08.700 --> 32:11.200
this time about monkeys.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.400
They also tested this on monkeys, three different species, and found that they make the same

32:15.400 --> 32:20.600
weird smiling face, they're aggressive and hateful loners, very unsuccessful, and tend

32:20.600 --> 32:24.080
to try to then kill females.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.520
Think I'm joking?

32:25.520 --> 32:31.000
Long-term soy consumption makes monkeys aggressive loners, shocking study with possible human

32:31.000 --> 32:33.300
implications, there they are.

32:33.300 --> 32:37.720
So not surprisingly, Alex has some details on this study wrong, it was done, also this

32:37.720 --> 32:39.600
study is from 2004.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.960
The headline he's reading is from a website called herculeanstrength.com.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.320
Okay, well I'm already out.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.320
Already out.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.440
Seems to be where he's pulling this from.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.180
I'm sorry, a men's rights activist's name is kicking me out.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.180
Their tagline is, become a demigod.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.800
There we go, that's all I needed to hear.

32:56.800 --> 33:01.160
This is a bodybuilding site that's very into testosterone, and from what I can tell they

33:01.160 --> 33:03.640
have a pretty anti-soy editorial position.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.800
Interestingly, they also posted an article about that catfish study, so maybe Alex just

33:07.800 --> 33:10.440
hangs out on bodybuilding sites to get his health news.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.920
That actually does make sense.

33:11.920 --> 33:12.920
Yeah.

33:12.920 --> 33:16.240
So this is actually an interesting comparative study, but here are some of the things Alex

33:16.240 --> 33:17.240
fucked up.

33:17.240 --> 33:21.240
One, there wasn't three species of monkeys, there were three groups, two experimental

33:21.240 --> 33:24.680
and one control group, but they were all male macaque monkeys.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.840
Two, all the stuff about the weird faces is made up.

33:27.840 --> 33:32.120
I think Alex is just taking that from pictures of the macaques that were on the bodybuilding

33:32.120 --> 33:33.120
website.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.120
Right.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.120
They just put random pictures of monkeys.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.520
So they had weird faces and he was like, they all make weird faces.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.240
They were not pictures from the stuff.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.240
Right, right, right, right.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.240
Of course.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.560
Alex probably just thinks that monkeys look like demons or something.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.360
They were fucking Getty Images, yeah.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.640
Three, I have no idea how Alex is gauging whether or not these monkeys were successful,

33:47.640 --> 33:49.320
regardless of their soil intake.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.160
I don't know what the standard for that is.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.320
I forgot about the successful being part of it.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.600
Or, I don't see anything in there about killing females.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.440
The study itself did find that there appeared to be behavioral changes in macaques based

34:00.440 --> 34:03.240
on the amount of soy that they were eating in their diet.

34:03.240 --> 34:07.400
Alex is focusing on the aggressive tendencies, but the study actually found that the opposite

34:07.400 --> 34:09.200
was more often the case.

34:09.200 --> 34:15.600
There was a 67% increase in aggressive behaviors, but a 203% increase in submissive ones.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.440
This is an element of the study that Alex is choosing to ignore because he's just going

34:18.440 --> 34:20.200
a different direction with it.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.360
The stuff about increased solitary behavior does match up with some of the stuff found

34:23.360 --> 34:24.360
in the study.

34:24.360 --> 34:28.440
Like, approximately there was a 30% increase in time spent alone for the group that had

34:28.440 --> 34:31.860
a higher soy intake diet.

34:31.860 --> 34:35.720
One important point to bring up here, though, is that there was almost no difference found

34:35.720 --> 34:40.400
between the control group and the low isoflavin diet group.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.760
So there were two experimental groups, one low and one high, and the control group and

34:44.760 --> 34:50.080
the low group were almost not, you couldn't tell the difference.

34:50.080 --> 34:54.540
In order for humans to mimic the levels of isoflavin consumption in the high diet group

34:54.540 --> 34:59.100
that they were getting for 15 months straight, it would be next to impossible for humans

34:59.100 --> 35:00.100
to do.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.640
It would be the equivalent of humans swimming around in isoflavin saturated water and breathing

35:03.640 --> 35:05.120
it in our little gills.

35:05.120 --> 35:12.800
You're not going to be able to get a diet that controlled to get any of the kind of

35:12.800 --> 35:14.540
marginal effects that were found.

35:14.540 --> 35:17.720
It's interesting, though, still, whatever they're looking at.

35:17.720 --> 35:21.120
I don't know how conclusive it is, and I certainly don't know if it applies to humans.

35:21.120 --> 35:26.000
Yeah, I mean, to a certain extent, that does also have the flavor of a study that's like

35:26.000 --> 35:31.480
a non-consensually changing diet of animals causes different behaviors.

35:31.480 --> 35:35.800
You know, like, no, I get it, but I don't, I mean, okay.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.800
Sure.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.800
Yeah.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.800
Yeah, I don't know.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.320
I found it really interesting that instead of really getting into the Fauci stuff, Alex

35:42.320 --> 35:48.880
instead goes on all these weird sort of animal genetics news items that some are current

35:48.880 --> 35:51.800
and some are old, and they're all bullshit.

35:51.800 --> 35:58.400
I mean, aside from the transphobia, that's more fun, I suppose, because the emails, talking

35:58.400 --> 36:03.440
about emails is still boring, and we're already, we're still rolling from Hillary's emails.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.440
You've got a high bar with Hillary's emails.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.800
Yeah, we're not going to beat Hillary's emails.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.240
I don't think you're going to find anything.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.080
You're not going to be able to Podesta this.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.080
Right.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.080
You're not going to be able to pizza gate it.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.920
You need a pizza gate if you want emails to be exciting, and there's no pizza gate here.

36:16.920 --> 36:17.920
Yeah.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.600
There's just like, I don't know, maybe we don't need masks.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.640
The conspiracy theorist community, I think, has burned out the pleasure centers of their

36:23.640 --> 36:26.800
brain that come from this because they went too hard on pizza gate.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.800
Yeah, totally.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.800
Oh, well.

36:28.800 --> 36:34.520
So, one of the things that we know from listening to various periods of Alex's career is that

36:34.520 --> 36:35.520
what's the summer for?

36:35.520 --> 36:36.520
Rage.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.320
Let's hit some of these headlines right now.

36:39.320 --> 36:43.960
We'll get more into this after I cover the race war they're trying to trigger this summer.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.360
They got a good chance of doing it.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.360
We got to stop it.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.760
That's coming up the first 30 minutes of the next hour.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.440
We got a summer of race war rage.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.440
Oh, boy.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.440
Oh, boy.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.440
Mm-hmm.

36:52.440 --> 36:59.840
For the 27th consecutive year this summer, coming to every city near you, a race war

36:59.840 --> 37:01.040
summer of rage.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.840
It wasn't always a race war, though.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.840
No, that's true.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.720
There was just like financial collapse or like there was something.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.440
Summer of rage 27, the race war time.

37:09.440 --> 37:14.080
Well, I think the last like five or six have probably all been race war related in his

37:14.080 --> 37:18.240
mind, but yeah, it used to be just kind of like it could be a number of different things

37:18.240 --> 37:20.040
and now it just feels sort of one note.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.240
It's just race war.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.240
Yeah.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.600
Anyway, Alex gets to talking about Fauci, but not about the emails.

37:25.600 --> 37:30.200
Instead, he talks about how he thinks there's a pretty good chance that Fauci is going to

37:30.200 --> 37:31.200
get hung.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.200
That's fast.

37:32.200 --> 37:38.880
I think when I was listening to this, I feel like this clip is really a good isolation

37:38.880 --> 37:41.440
of why people listen to this show.

37:41.440 --> 37:44.680
This satisfies some emotional needs that these listeners have.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.680
All right.

37:45.680 --> 37:50.440
Under the Nuremberg Code, if you're tried and convicted, you get walked up to the gallows

37:50.440 --> 37:57.720
pole because the time is coming when people that do this stuff will be punished, not by

37:57.720 --> 38:02.520
me, but by justice through the courts, and I told you it would come a year ago and you

38:02.520 --> 38:03.920
see it starting, don't you?

38:03.920 --> 38:07.000
The snowball's too big, too much energy.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.360
You killed too many people, Fauci Gates.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.080
You will pay.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.720
I see it in the stars.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.200
I see it in the cards.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.800
I see it in the tea leaves.

38:17.800 --> 38:26.080
I see it in the bones, in the rooms, my dear, your fall, your destruction.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.840
Violence is right.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.880
It is coming.

38:29.880 --> 38:34.960
I think people just have some sort of a gratification of hearing someone say that violence is coming

38:34.960 --> 38:36.880
to the people that they've been trained not to like.

38:36.880 --> 38:39.040
Yeah, it seems like it.

38:39.040 --> 38:44.840
That's very televangy, televangelisty to a realty.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.640
Also so false.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.640
Yeah.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.760
It was very, very fake.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.760
Yeah.

38:50.760 --> 38:54.440
At least Sinner in the Hands of an Angry God felt genuine.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.440
Yeah.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.440
Yeah.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.440
Alex knows he doesn't have to try.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.440
No.

38:58.440 --> 39:06.840
So one of the things that I think is always tough to suss out is like, who's on what side?

39:06.840 --> 39:08.880
We've had a lot of changes over the years.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.880
Yeah.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.880
Yeah.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.880
So I regret to inform you.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.600
Is Bill Maher still on the side of secret patriots?

39:14.600 --> 39:18.520
No, he had a one day redemption where he was a secret Tucker, and now he's back to being

39:18.520 --> 39:19.520
evil.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.600
Oh man, I hate it when shows do that.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.560
Listen, I don't want to talk about celebs.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.560
Okay.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.560
I want to talk about geopolitics.

39:24.560 --> 39:25.560
Okay.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.560
Yeah.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
Okay.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.720
Now we know that Alex thinks the literal devil is behind his enemies.

39:29.720 --> 39:30.720
Yes.

39:30.720 --> 39:35.520
So that must mean that all of the people who are on one team, they're with the devil.

39:35.520 --> 39:36.520
Right.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.920
And then the people are on the other team conceivably with God.

39:38.920 --> 39:39.920
Yeah.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.040
They try and avoid moral gray area.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.040
It's very complicated.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.040
Certainly.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.040
Yeah.

39:44.040 --> 39:48.280
And we did have the UK was looking good when Brexit was going through, but apparently Boris

39:48.280 --> 39:49.680
Johnson is a traitor.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.680
Sure.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.680
Yes, there was that.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.000
And so now they're up in the air.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Yeah.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
It's unclear where the UK is going to fall.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Right.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Right.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
So we should not forget that the queen hit the dictator button.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.640
I forgot about that.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.640
Like a year ago.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.720
There's so many spinning plates these days.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.720
So many spinning plates.

40:07.720 --> 40:08.720
Yeah.

40:08.720 --> 40:09.720
The queen is a secret Patriot.

40:09.720 --> 40:10.720
I forgot about that.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.680
I would like to, I would like to know if the Pope is still in jail.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.160
I need to know, did he, did he change his ways?

40:17.160 --> 40:22.560
You know, or has, is the cause the Pope hasn't said like new things that are more conservative

40:22.560 --> 40:24.160
than they were before.

40:24.160 --> 40:30.800
So is the fake Pope even a, like an actual clone who's just unable to break the programming

40:30.800 --> 40:32.400
of being the same old Pope?

40:32.400 --> 40:33.400
I need to know this.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.400
I don't know.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
We'd have to ask Steve.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.120
Anyway, here are the teams.

40:37.120 --> 40:41.040
We have a, we have a layout of who's, who's good, who's bad.

40:41.040 --> 40:46.400
And boy, it's not surprising because it's the Islamics with communist China, the EU,

40:46.400 --> 40:52.680
Hollywood, the blue cities, the blue states, the UN all against America and Russia.

40:52.680 --> 40:53.680
Wow.

40:53.680 --> 40:57.800
And that means the American people and the Russian people and the Brazilian people.

40:57.800 --> 40:58.800
Okay.

40:58.800 --> 40:59.800
So you got Brazil in there.

40:59.800 --> 41:00.800
Wow.

41:00.800 --> 41:05.160
It's Russia, the United States and Brazil, Jesus Christ versus everybody.

41:05.160 --> 41:10.060
And a verse, a lot of people inside the United States, I would say about half the country

41:10.060 --> 41:11.060
at least.

41:11.060 --> 41:15.920
I would say that it doesn't get more above the left, right paradigm than that.

41:15.920 --> 41:16.920
Yes.

41:16.920 --> 41:21.840
That's about the most, uh, here's, here we, here's what we got going on.

41:21.840 --> 41:22.840
Okay.

41:22.840 --> 41:28.920
We've got, uh, we've got everybody and then we've got Russia, United States and Brazil.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.360
Definitely not the new axis of evil.

41:31.360 --> 41:35.600
That would be a crazy thing for someone to say that these countries are very similar

41:35.600 --> 41:39.120
right now to Italy, Germany.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.120
Okay.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.120
Yeah.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.160
I, I find, I find it interesting.

41:43.160 --> 41:47.600
I mean, not, not the sort of other countries that Alex feels kinship with.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.600
Sure.

41:48.600 --> 41:49.600
That doesn't surprise me at all.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.600
No, of course not.

41:50.600 --> 41:56.080
Those are, those are like his guys, Putin and Bolsonaro dictators, but I find it interesting

41:56.080 --> 42:00.400
the way he, it's the rest of this is so stateless.

42:00.400 --> 42:06.340
It has to do with the blue cities, the blue States, Hollywood, and like so, so much of

42:06.340 --> 42:12.020
it is like half of this country is going to have to go down if you know, we're gonna be

42:12.020 --> 42:15.960
able to make this the America make it America again.

42:15.960 --> 42:16.960
Yeah.

42:16.960 --> 42:24.200
I mean, it's honestly, I, I serious question, uh, that, I mean, obviously you can't answer,

42:24.200 --> 42:30.280
but if MBS sent Alex like a letter that was just like, Hey, I'm a secret Christian.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.280
We're not going to pro persecute Christians in Saudi Arabia anymore.

42:33.280 --> 42:35.280
He would totally be like, I love MBS now.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.280
Right?

42:36.280 --> 42:37.280
Yes.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.280
He would have to.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.280
Yes.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.280
He loves what MBS does.

42:40.280 --> 42:46.620
He did killing Khashoggi, I think that even if MBS didn't go that far, I think that he

42:46.620 --> 42:51.320
just made an overture and said, you're right about the globalists totally.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.320
I will.

42:52.320 --> 42:57.020
I will not join your religion, but I will follow you against the demonic globalists

42:57.020 --> 42:58.020
or whatever.

42:58.020 --> 42:59.020
Yeah.

42:59.020 --> 43:00.020
Alex would be like, yeah, Saudi is pretty cool.

43:00.020 --> 43:01.020
I, you know what?

43:01.020 --> 43:03.960
I heard a lot of stuff about, uh, about them in the past and it turns out that was all

43:03.960 --> 43:08.080
a, that was a psy-op, you know, I didn't like Putin before, but now, you know, I've

43:08.080 --> 43:10.360
seen that Putin is a good Christian.

43:10.360 --> 43:14.920
I might've spent a long time back in 2003 talking about every day about how evil Putin

43:14.920 --> 43:22.240
was and never taken back any of those comments or suggested that what I said was not true.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.240
Psy-op.

43:23.240 --> 43:24.240
Just don't care.

43:24.240 --> 43:33.040
So, uh, Alex spends an entire segment talking about China and it's exhausting because it's

43:33.040 --> 43:35.440
all kind of the stuff that we've gone over in the past.

43:35.440 --> 43:36.440
Yeah.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.200
And his grievances about Chiang Kai-Shek.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.200
Right, right.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.200
Yes, of course.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.200
And what have you.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.200
Of course.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.200
Uh, and this is how it ends.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.520
Apparently China has double-crossed the globalists.

43:45.520 --> 43:46.520
Okay.

43:46.520 --> 43:47.520
Okay.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.560
And China double-crossed the globalists on multiple fronts.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.280
They're not doing the one-child policy.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.400
They're, they're, they're, they're expanding their military, not just dominating economic

43:54.400 --> 43:59.440
systems and Biden can't serve them enough when he announces, Hey, we won't build any

43:59.440 --> 44:00.440
of our own batteries.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.140
We'll only buy it from China.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.320
We won't let Americans mine and I'll shut it.

44:04.320 --> 44:09.280
And now Biden announced a plan to shut down 30 plus other big pipelines, giving the States

44:09.280 --> 44:12.880
the power to shut down existing pipelines and to give Whitmer the power to violate a

44:12.880 --> 44:17.440
U S treaty and shut off the main pipeline to the Midwest out of Canada.

44:17.440 --> 44:21.840
I mean, we are under child calm attack.

44:21.840 --> 44:25.280
So of course he's running to Tulsa a hundred years ago.

44:25.280 --> 44:26.280
People killed each other.

44:26.280 --> 44:27.280
Hundreds dead.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.680
Let's have a race war.

44:28.680 --> 44:30.720
How obvious is this?

44:30.720 --> 44:32.480
I'm going to go to break.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.480
We're going to come back.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.480
Don't forget.

44:34.480 --> 44:39.360
We're extending the store, free shipping and double Patriot points until Sunday, DNA force

44:39.360 --> 44:40.360
plus.

44:40.360 --> 44:41.360
Yeah.

44:41.360 --> 44:49.040
So apparently Alex is pretty mad about Biden going to Tulsa to celebrate or pay respects

44:49.040 --> 44:51.560
to the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.560
Yeah.

44:52.560 --> 44:53.560
Weird.

44:53.560 --> 44:54.560
Yeah.

44:54.560 --> 44:59.520
I'm surprised that Alex would not want to to have that talked about or even mentioned

44:59.520 --> 45:03.640
or recognized or even have it exist within the records.

45:03.640 --> 45:06.540
Now you know, what's weird.

45:06.540 --> 45:11.560
Last year, Trump scheduled a campaign rally in Tulsa on June 19th, which understandably

45:11.560 --> 45:17.440
seemed a little not great because June 19th is Juneteenth, which is the celebration of

45:17.440 --> 45:21.240
the ending of slavery in Texas, which is the last state where it was still taking place.

45:21.240 --> 45:27.120
Now Tulsa is the site of the Tulsa massacre, which occurred on May 31st and June 1st in

45:27.120 --> 45:32.340
1921 when mobs of white people destroyed the Greenwood district in Tulsa, the largest concentration

45:32.340 --> 45:34.080
of black wealth in the United States.

45:34.080 --> 45:39.200
So obviously the combination of Trump going to Tulsa on June 19th seemed like a little

45:39.200 --> 45:40.480
bit of a eh.

45:40.480 --> 45:45.680
And not just mobs of white people, organized mobs of white people with the fucking military

45:45.680 --> 45:46.680
on their side.

45:46.680 --> 45:47.680
So yeah.

45:47.680 --> 45:51.200
So Trump ended up rescheduling that event after some very understandable backlash, but

45:51.200 --> 45:56.000
he did say in a subsequent interview, quote, I did something good.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.420
I made Juneteenth very famous.

45:58.420 --> 46:02.760
It's actually an important event, an important time, but nobody had ever heard of it.

46:02.760 --> 46:03.760
Wow.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.760
Ah, man.

46:05.760 --> 46:09.200
Alex didn't have any problem with any of that, but for Biden to visit the Greenwood district

46:09.200 --> 46:14.920
and pay homage to the Tulsa massacre, that's a huge problem apparently because I guess,

46:14.920 --> 46:15.920
I don't know.

46:15.920 --> 46:20.460
I mean, I think one of the main reasons that it is such a huge problem for conservatives

46:20.460 --> 46:26.280
and why they absolutely do not want to discuss it whatsoever is because it is the marriage

46:26.280 --> 46:33.280
of two things that they love the most at cross purposes, which is white people and wealth.

46:33.280 --> 46:37.800
And they can't say that it's okay for the wealth to be wiped out without saying that

46:37.800 --> 46:40.400
it's their giant fucking racists.

46:40.400 --> 46:44.800
And they can't say that it's not okay for white people to murder en masse because they're

46:44.800 --> 46:46.240
giant fucking racists.

46:46.240 --> 46:52.300
So they're just trapped in this space of like, you can't earn your way out of racism in America.

46:52.300 --> 46:53.560
That's what they're saying.

46:53.560 --> 46:56.680
And that's their message is always, you're like, no, you can pull yourself up by your

46:56.680 --> 46:57.680
bootstraps.

46:57.680 --> 47:03.220
No, the real message is if you do that, you will be murdered and slapped down again because

47:03.220 --> 47:04.220
that's what they need.

47:04.220 --> 47:09.960
And one of the other things too, not to, not to totally jump off subject, but when, when

47:09.960 --> 47:15.060
he was talking about these pipelines and stuff, shouldn't his politics be that States can

47:15.060 --> 47:18.200
opt out of pipelines?

47:18.200 --> 47:24.380
Why is he mad that Biden is saying that States can not participate in pipelines?

47:24.380 --> 47:25.380
I don't know.

47:25.380 --> 47:27.200
There's just no, there's just nothing.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.200
There's just nothing.

47:28.200 --> 47:31.360
I don't understand how that wouldn't be like exactly what he would, like, if Trump did

47:31.360 --> 47:36.400
that, he'd be like, fuck yeah, everybody needs to have the power in the States.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.600
So there's a big news breaking in the middle of the show.

47:38.600 --> 47:43.500
And that is that someone in China made a comment, watch out.

47:43.500 --> 47:46.680
So when you see the communist Chinese come out in their official publication and say,

47:46.680 --> 47:49.380
if you investigate the lab, we're going to nuke you.

47:49.380 --> 47:50.380
That's what they said today.

47:50.380 --> 47:53.720
And China paid American media outlets millions to publish propaganda.

47:53.720 --> 47:58.200
We're going to list those groups for you when we come back, who the traders are.

47:58.200 --> 48:02.360
I definitely don't like the idea of someone airing a list of traders on their show, especially

48:02.360 --> 48:07.980
Alex, someone who has a participation sports philosophy towards his show historically listing

48:07.980 --> 48:09.760
traders is usually a good idea.

48:09.760 --> 48:10.760
It's not.

48:10.760 --> 48:15.360
So this story about China paying for articles and some Western outlets, that's not news.

48:15.360 --> 48:19.200
That's an old story about an English language paper in China controlled by the government

48:19.200 --> 48:20.600
called China daily.

48:20.600 --> 48:23.900
They paid to have articles placed in outlets, but all of those would have had to have an

48:23.900 --> 48:27.440
alert informing readers that this is paid content.

48:27.440 --> 48:30.840
I don't like it, but it's definitely not the smoking gun and like huge deal that Alex is

48:30.840 --> 48:32.520
making it out to be sure.

48:32.520 --> 48:35.700
As for the nuclear war thing, Alex is lying.

48:35.700 --> 48:39.920
It's true that there's a Newsweek headline that says, quote, China state media says country

48:39.920 --> 48:44.100
must prepare for nuclear war with us after Biden asks for COVID probe.

48:44.100 --> 48:48.120
But that's not a statement that's meant to convey a causal relationship between the two

48:48.120 --> 48:50.280
things, which is what Alex is reporting.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.280
Okay.

48:51.280 --> 48:54.740
He's saying that the Chinese government has said that they'll nuke us if we investigate

48:54.740 --> 48:57.640
the lab, but that's not what this article is saying at all.

48:57.640 --> 48:59.600
And this article is his primary source.

48:59.600 --> 49:00.600
Right, right, right.

49:00.600 --> 49:07.360
The article is about comments made by Hu Zhijin, the editor of the global times.

49:07.360 --> 49:11.360
The comments had to do with how there was growing tensions in the US-China relations

49:11.360 --> 49:15.480
and that, quote, China sees much of America's actions and comments to be an encroachment

49:15.480 --> 49:17.120
on its sovereignty.

49:17.120 --> 49:21.320
Hu wrote an op-ed that essentially boiled down to this, quote, the number of China's

49:21.320 --> 49:26.240
nuclear warheads must reach the quantity that makes US elites shiver should they entertain

49:26.240 --> 49:29.600
the idea of engaging in a military confrontation with China.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.440
The comments were an escalation and an arms race kind of thing that I think sucks, but

49:33.440 --> 49:37.880
they also weren't comments that were being made as a threat if we investigate the lab

49:37.880 --> 49:38.880
theory.

49:38.880 --> 49:39.880
Jesus.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.880
Yeah, that's nonsense.

49:40.880 --> 49:43.760
But it's right in line with Alex's narratives that he's been building, so that's going to

49:43.760 --> 49:48.400
take precedence over the reality of the situation that, honestly, we should not be thrilled

49:48.400 --> 49:49.400
about.

49:49.400 --> 49:56.680
I mean, wild, wild to have the headline be, Chinese man says Reagan had a point.

49:56.680 --> 50:00.600
You know, like, I don't understand, yeah, of course.

50:00.600 --> 50:04.880
Historically, you should have more nuclear weapons to keep the United States from invading

50:04.880 --> 50:06.400
you.

50:06.400 --> 50:09.720
I don't want people to have any, I don't want nuclear weapons at all.

50:09.720 --> 50:10.720
No.

50:10.720 --> 50:11.720
Absolutely not.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.040
Absolutely not.

50:13.040 --> 50:20.680
Yeah, it does make sense for a power in the context of, like, heightening tensions to

50:20.680 --> 50:24.800
be like, we should make it so no one will attack us because it looks like someone might

50:24.800 --> 50:25.800
attack us.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.000
America's on their fucking bullshit again.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.560
Yeah, everybody's pumping out Iraq war propaganda about the, oh, Jesus.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.200
I understand that.

50:34.200 --> 50:41.160
I would prefer we take another direction with it and de-escalate things on a larger scale,

50:41.160 --> 50:45.960
but I get that thinking, and that's the thinking that is behind that comment.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.960
Not that if you look into the lab, we'll nuke you.

50:47.960 --> 50:48.960
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

50:48.960 --> 50:49.960
It's so ridiculous.

50:49.960 --> 50:54.960
Yeah, no, it's global realpolitik that, again, Kissinger was like, we gotta have this.

50:54.960 --> 51:00.560
And this, too, is why listening to Alex is kind of a dead end, because there is a reality

51:00.560 --> 51:06.760
that you should be aware of in this Newsweek story that is, yeah, these kinds of conversations

51:06.760 --> 51:07.760
are happening.

51:07.760 --> 51:13.340
Some people are making comments, be it in official outlets or in op-eds that are like,

51:13.340 --> 51:17.000
we should bulk up our defenses to make sure that no one attacks us.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.060
That's fucked up.

51:18.060 --> 51:23.580
It doesn't necessarily reflect a government policy, but it is something that is worthwhile.

51:23.580 --> 51:28.400
If you listen to Alex, the way that this story is going to be presented to you is, the Chinese

51:28.400 --> 51:34.760
are so afraid of us investigating the Wuhan lab that they will nuke us if we do it.

51:34.760 --> 51:39.520
And that is a dead end, because what do you do with that information?

51:39.520 --> 51:42.240
It's not true.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.240
It's ridiculous.

51:43.240 --> 51:48.920
No, it's just you saying, see, they're so overreacting to it, it's obviously true.

51:48.920 --> 51:51.380
He's not asking a question, he's not saying anything.

51:51.380 --> 51:56.920
What he's really doing is, hey, they wouldn't act like this if they weren't the cause of

51:56.920 --> 51:58.460
the Wuhan lab leak.

51:58.460 --> 51:59.460
The end.

51:59.460 --> 52:00.460
You know?

52:00.460 --> 52:01.460
Basically.

52:01.460 --> 52:02.460
It's proof.

52:02.460 --> 52:03.460
Yep.

52:03.460 --> 52:06.780
So on this episode, Alex is really obsessed with an interview that Judge Joe Brown did,

52:06.780 --> 52:07.780
and I don't care.

52:07.780 --> 52:09.440
No, no, no, you cannot.

52:09.440 --> 52:16.160
The only point of it is that Judge Joe Brown thinks that Biden's a racist, and, all right,

52:16.160 --> 52:17.160
Joe Brown.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.160
Yeah.

52:18.160 --> 52:19.160
I used to watch Joe Brown a lot.

52:19.160 --> 52:20.160
Did you?

52:20.160 --> 52:21.160
Judge Joe Brown?

52:21.160 --> 52:22.160
Yeah.

52:22.160 --> 52:27.320
And me and my friends would sit around, get high, watch judge shows, and I love Joe Brown

52:27.320 --> 52:31.040
because he always looked like he just got up from a nap, because he was so annoyed by

52:31.040 --> 52:32.040
everybody in the courtroom.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.800
He was very annoyed by everyone.

52:33.800 --> 52:37.040
It's like, you mean to tell me?

52:37.040 --> 52:39.080
I liked his demeanor quite a bit.

52:39.080 --> 52:43.560
Okay, so, but here's my, okay, so Judge Joe Brown says that Biden's a racist.

52:43.560 --> 52:44.560
Right.

52:44.560 --> 52:48.660
If Judge Judy comes out and says Biden's not a racist, what show do they go on?

52:48.660 --> 52:52.840
We got to go to Judge Mills Lane, obviously.

52:52.840 --> 52:53.840
My bad, my bad.

52:53.840 --> 52:54.840
That was too obvious.

52:54.840 --> 52:57.880
And settle this in a celebrity death match.

52:57.880 --> 53:04.760
Yeah, I mean, look, no disrespect to Judge Joe Brown.

53:04.760 --> 53:09.680
He is a judge and all, but I think when it comes to-

53:09.680 --> 53:11.480
Is he a real judge or is he-

53:11.480 --> 53:14.600
I don't think you can be on those shows and not be a real judge.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.240
I think you have to be a judge.

53:16.240 --> 53:17.840
I don't know if that's true.

53:17.840 --> 53:18.840
That might not be true.

53:18.840 --> 53:20.720
I feel like that is definitely not true.

53:20.720 --> 53:21.860
Judge Judy is a judge.

53:21.860 --> 53:23.280
She is a judge.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.280
Right.

53:24.280 --> 53:25.280
Ooh.

53:25.280 --> 53:26.280
Judge Mathis is a judge.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.200
Judge Mathis is a judge.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.400
Maybe Judge Joe Brown is a real judge.

53:29.400 --> 53:30.400
I think he is.

53:30.400 --> 53:33.080
How do you get to be a judge and then get on TV?

53:33.080 --> 53:34.680
We should explore this more, but we don't-

53:34.680 --> 53:36.960
That sounds really fucked up to me now that I think about it.

53:36.960 --> 53:41.880
So they've been practicing judges on the bench for a long time and then they get a TV show?

53:41.880 --> 53:43.400
That seems wrong.

53:43.400 --> 53:45.920
It seems strange, but it also is a good career path.

53:45.920 --> 53:46.920
Well, you're not wrong.

53:46.920 --> 53:47.920
Okay.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
Judge Joe Brown.

53:48.920 --> 53:49.920
Is he-

53:49.920 --> 53:52.000
Judge Joe Brown.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Real judge?

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Question mark.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.440
Judge Joe Brown is a former American lawyer and television personality.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.440
Aha.

53:58.440 --> 54:02.860
Oh, he is a former Shelby County, Tennessee criminal court judge and a former arbiter

54:02.860 --> 54:06.320
of the arbitration based reality show Judge Joe Brown.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.320
Okay.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.880
So yeah, he was formerly a judge in Tennessee.

54:09.880 --> 54:10.880
All right.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.880
Okay.

54:11.880 --> 54:12.880
Yeah.

54:12.880 --> 54:16.120
I would imagine that if you're ever on one of those shows, you're not an active judge.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.640
I think that's where I got confused.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.480
You're not moonlighting.

54:21.480 --> 54:25.520
I think there's a part of me that like when I filled out my Chicago ballot and I was voting

54:25.520 --> 54:30.960
for judges, then that connected to my mind, well, obviously I was voting for Judge Mathis

54:30.960 --> 54:32.880
or Joe Brown at some point.

54:32.880 --> 54:38.280
No, I think it's a good sort of late career move if you're someone who has some charisma

54:38.280 --> 54:41.840
and can make court hearings fun.

54:41.840 --> 54:42.840
Absolutely.

54:42.840 --> 54:46.960
Yeah, we will need a judge to settle this next issue.

54:46.960 --> 54:47.960
Okay.

54:47.960 --> 54:50.080
Alex is escalating this whole thing about Fauci getting hung.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.080
Okay.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.080
And now it's going to happen in public.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.080
That's not good.

54:53.080 --> 54:55.760
Fauci and Bill Gates are being destroyed as we speak.

54:55.760 --> 54:59.680
I told you months ago, they will be politically annihilated bare minimum.

54:59.680 --> 55:06.120
And I, I just go with my gut and the analysis, I think they're going to go to prison.

55:06.120 --> 55:09.920
I think if we work hard, we expose them and we're diligent, we pray, I believe they'll

55:09.920 --> 55:14.080
be convicted and that someday I believe we'll watch them both hung in public.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.080
I really do.

55:15.080 --> 55:16.880
They launched this attack with communist China.

55:16.880 --> 55:19.800
You know, you think that's strong rhetoric and it's not.

55:19.800 --> 55:23.080
Communist China just threatened to nuke us if we keep investigating the Wuhan lab.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.040
They did this on purpose with the UN.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.040
See?

55:26.040 --> 55:27.040
Wow.

55:27.040 --> 55:29.440
See how that information ends up being used?

55:29.440 --> 55:30.440
Yeah.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.840
Yeah, it's silly.

55:32.840 --> 55:39.900
Does everybody know that, that like now in the, in the modern world when, when they see

55:39.900 --> 55:49.120
like public hangings in a TV show or in a movie or in real life, those are the bad guys.

55:49.120 --> 55:51.320
The good guys are never doing public hangings.

55:51.320 --> 55:52.320
Hmm.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.320
Yeah.

55:53.320 --> 55:54.320
It seems rare.

55:54.320 --> 55:55.320
Yeah.

55:55.320 --> 55:56.320
That's fucked up.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.320
Yeah.

55:57.320 --> 56:06.140
I mean, look, I, I, I, I, I struggle with this because on the one hand, if anything

56:06.140 --> 56:10.040
that Alex was saying were true, these people are enemies of humanity.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.040
That is true.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.040
No, you're not wrong.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.040
You're not wrong.

56:13.040 --> 56:14.040
That's true.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.520
I mean, if they are wiping out millions of people, that is true.

56:16.520 --> 56:20.520
I do think that you should probably, you know, that's a hangable offense.

56:20.520 --> 56:21.800
I think so.

56:21.800 --> 56:22.800
Sure.

56:22.800 --> 56:29.000
I think that there's a narrow area where death penalties might be, maybe we go ahead and...

56:29.000 --> 56:30.920
Genociders can get the death penalty.

56:30.920 --> 56:31.920
I'm fine with that.

56:31.920 --> 56:36.600
I feel like that's inarguable as a, as a relatively fair solution.

56:36.600 --> 56:37.600
Sure.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.640
I don't know about the public spectacle part.

56:39.640 --> 56:41.960
I, oh, I, I certainly don't think that would be healthy.

56:41.960 --> 56:42.960
Yeah.

56:42.960 --> 56:46.080
But I also, but if you, but if you didn't do that, everyone would come up with conspiracies

56:46.080 --> 56:47.400
about how it didn't really happen.

56:47.400 --> 56:52.080
They're going to come up with, JFK is going to, JFK is still alive, according to some

56:52.080 --> 56:53.080
people.

56:53.080 --> 56:54.080
His head blew up on TV.

56:54.080 --> 56:57.640
Look, we're not going to be able to negotiate this and thankfully we don't have to.

56:57.640 --> 56:58.640
That's a good point.

56:58.640 --> 57:02.000
We don't have to because Alex has indicated that he's okay with a lesser punishment.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Okay, good.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
You have to say it.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.200
I don't want any harm against Bill Gates or Fauci.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.640
That could turn them into heroes.

57:08.640 --> 57:09.960
That could turn them into martyrs.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.360
No vigilante violence.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.980
I want them arrested.

57:14.980 --> 57:16.520
I want their records brought out.

57:16.520 --> 57:23.560
I want public trial and that I want a jury to find them guilty because the evidence is

57:23.560 --> 57:24.560
overwhelming.

57:24.560 --> 57:27.760
And I will take life in prison.

57:27.760 --> 57:30.800
They are incredible villains.

57:30.800 --> 57:36.240
And so I don't think execution would turn them into victims, but maybe let them spend

57:36.240 --> 57:43.480
the rest of their miserable lives on public display.

57:43.480 --> 57:48.960
Like you put animals in a cage, you want us to live in a cage.

57:48.960 --> 57:53.080
How about we throw Joe Biden in there with them?

57:53.080 --> 57:54.080
All right, man.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.080
Okay.

57:55.080 --> 57:56.080
Yeah.

57:56.080 --> 57:57.080
All right.

57:57.080 --> 57:58.080
What a gracious guy though.

57:58.080 --> 57:59.080
He's offering life in prison.

57:59.080 --> 58:03.840
It is nice to, to say, look, look, look, this requires a public hanging.

58:03.840 --> 58:08.640
God's justice demands a public hanging, but we will keep you in a dog cage for the rest

58:08.640 --> 58:11.360
of your life and have people walk by and spit on you.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.360
Yes.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.360
Yeah.

58:13.360 --> 58:15.520
That is what happens when you release plagues.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.240
We put you in a box.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.380
Yeah, that's about right.

58:19.380 --> 58:25.480
So Alex has the Hodge twins on who are a couple of twins as their name suggests.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.480
Yeah.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.480
Yeah.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.480
They are conservatives.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.880
Is Judge John Hodge been a judge?

58:30.880 --> 58:31.880
Nevermind.

58:31.880 --> 58:32.880
That was a joke.

58:32.880 --> 58:35.880
It used to be.

58:35.880 --> 58:41.160
So Hodge twins, they have some bad opinions and here's one of them.

58:41.160 --> 58:43.120
Black people are so upset about Christopher Columbus.

58:43.120 --> 58:47.920
You don't want to celebrate that, but why y'all want to celebrate something that happened

58:47.920 --> 58:48.920
over a hundred years ago.

58:48.920 --> 58:51.640
They're talking about the, uh, the Tulsa massacre.

58:51.640 --> 58:52.640
Yeah.

58:52.640 --> 58:55.600
The only reason why they want to celebrate these things is because they're asking for

58:55.600 --> 59:00.160
something and they think Joe Biden and the Democrats and people on the left is actually

59:00.160 --> 59:01.960
going to give them reparations or restitution.

59:01.960 --> 59:04.000
They're not going to see any, any of that.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.040
They have not till this day, black folks, black liberals have woken up and realize what

59:09.040 --> 59:10.480
these people are doing to them.

59:10.480 --> 59:13.560
They're using them mentally enslaving them or vote.

59:13.560 --> 59:15.320
That's the only reason why Joe Biden's there.

59:15.320 --> 59:16.320
Yeah.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.560
They're actually asking for reparations for what happened in Tulsa.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.960
There's only like two survivors left from that.

59:20.960 --> 59:21.960
Yeah.

59:21.960 --> 59:22.960
And I say fine.

59:22.960 --> 59:23.960
Give them, I mean, sure.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.360
The state or somebody should try to help them out.

59:25.360 --> 59:30.160
But the point is, is he's there to open old wounds and distract from what he's doing to

59:30.160 --> 59:32.360
all Americans shutting down the pipelines.

59:32.360 --> 59:35.080
Now Trump, Trump wasn't opening up old wounds last year.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.080
No, no, no, no.

59:36.080 --> 59:37.080
He wasn't doing that.

59:37.080 --> 59:38.080
I don't know.

59:38.080 --> 59:39.080
That'd be weird this time.

59:39.080 --> 59:40.520
Joe Biden always opens up old wounds.

59:40.520 --> 59:43.840
I think that it's horseshit that Alex is saying like, yeah, of course.

59:43.840 --> 59:44.840
Give them repar...

59:44.840 --> 59:45.840
Why?

59:45.840 --> 59:46.840
Why?

59:46.840 --> 59:47.840
Why Alex?

59:47.840 --> 59:48.840
Why?

59:48.840 --> 59:49.840
Yeah.

59:49.840 --> 59:50.840
You don't believe that for a second.

59:50.840 --> 59:51.840
No.

59:51.840 --> 59:55.520
You're saying that because you know that like saying don't, it would sound like shit.

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
Yeah.

59:56.520 --> 59:57.520
Absolutely.

59:57.520 --> 59:58.520
Now.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.400
A baseball should go whizzing right by his head just as a like warning shot.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.400
Do it again, man.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.400
Do it again.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.400
Yeah.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.040
Claim that you're fine with giving some people reparations again.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.960
Feel that break through the air.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:15.360
Now one of the reasons that the Tulsa massacre in particular is something that is brought

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.000
up in the conversation about reparations is because it was not just an attack on people.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
It was an attack on black wealth.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Exactly.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.760
And you know, one of the reasons that some of these issues have rippled through our country's

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:36.840
history so resonantly is because of the exclusion of nonwhite people from participation in the

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840
market.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
Yeah.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
Exactly.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840
Yeah.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.640
And this is a, that was a giant attack on exactly that.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.640
Yeah.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.120
And I think pretending that you don't understand that is a little bit silly and I think if

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:55.240
you're a commentator then you're going to come around and say that people only remember

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.240
that event because they want something.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240
Yeah.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.040
They want to guilt Biden into giving them something.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.560
I think you're a piece of shit.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.200
I think that's a shitty opinion.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.720
And that, that like idea of Alex even being like, well, you know, there's two survivors,

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.000
so yeah, the government should help them out or something like that.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.320
That's absolutely missing the point of wiping out generational wealth.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.600
You did, there are not two survivors of that massacre.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.480
There are countless survivors of that massacre.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480
Yeah.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.200
And that's, that's the point.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.200
That is a point.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200
Yeah.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200
Well not, yeah, not the point.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.200
Apologies.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.200
That's the point that he's avoiding.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.200
Yes.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.440
That's what he's basically and kind of like detracting from is what I was trying to say.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.240
While at the same time confusingly saying that it's okay to give something to those

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240
two people.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240
Right.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.880
Which again, I would just ask if I were, anyway, if I were in a position that these hodge twins

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.760
are in, I would just be like, why?

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760
Yeah.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.760
Please say why.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.760
Tell me why these two are fine.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.760
That's okay and it's not okay in other circumstances.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.760
Absolutely.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.320
So, so these people, these people had something taken from them.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.320
Right, right.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.040
And so they deserve recompense in some form.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040
Correct.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040
Okay.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.280
Let's take this a step further.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280
I don't understand.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
There are more steps?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280
Let's not.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280
Hmm.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.000
So there's been a lot of talk about how there's a coming indictment for Trump.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Sure.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Trump's going down.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Sure.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.640
Roger Stone's been playing into this quite a bit.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.960
Alex has been warning people that he's going down on the 4th of July.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.760
No, I thought he was going to be reinstated.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760
No, no, no.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.740
That's the, maybe who knows.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:32.020
Maybe they'll indict him and magically like a, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes who

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.200
will become president.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.200
That could be.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.200
Maybe.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.240
Maybe the Democrats just want a third go at impeachment, you know, like they fucked up

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.480
the first two real bad.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.480
Third tries a charm.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.480
Third tries a charm.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.560
However, the Hodge twins, they do not think that this is real and they think it's a distraction.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.400
I don't, I don't think they're going to get an indictment on him.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.560
I mean, he's the most vetted president we've ever had.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560
Everybody's investigated this man.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.560
They have found nothing.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.560
I'd be shocked if they found anything.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560
Yeah.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.160
I think more than anything, Alex, it's just a distraction because they're doing the audits

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.220
in Arizona, in Nevada.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.220
That's what they're really doing.

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:05.220
It's just a distraction.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.640
What Biden's doing in Tulsa.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.120
I mean, everybody on mainstream media on the left is just lost their minds talking about

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.060
when they started actually auditing the results.

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:20.920
I'm like, I don't understand why they will be so upset unless they trying to hide something.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:27.840
If you're so sure if Biden won that election, honestly, why don't you let everybody go in

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.360
audit the results and just show and tell everybody that's on the right, how stupid and naive

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360
they are.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.680
I mean, you have a goal and opportunity to show everybody in America how lost Trump supporters

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.680
are.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.680
Yeah.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680
I don't be willing to show that, Alex.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680
Look at the results.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680
He won here.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680
He won here.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.680
He won here, but they don't want to do that.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.040
They don't even want to investigate the results or audit because they're scared what's going

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040
to be uncovered.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.560
I mean, that's just a dumb argument and you can, you can take the exact idea and just

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.040
place it wherever you want with the story that you've written for yourself.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.800
You know, a good example of this, whether or not there's any truth to it is, Oh, why,

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.440
why won't Trump release all of his financial information if he's, Oh, he has to be afraid

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.700
of what's in there.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.280
And that's a story that you can write for yourself.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:17.840
It may be more likely than this whole election was a fraud or whatever, but it's, you know,

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.720
pretending that, you know, what would be found if someone looked at something and that's

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.240
why they're not looking at it.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240
Sure.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.240
Sure.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.240
Sure.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240
Is just a dishonest, uh, kind of game.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240
Yeah.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.360
I mean, the thing about that though, is it's eminently reasonable from what we do know

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.240
is that if you really went through just about any billionaires, no, any billionaires finances

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.640
sooner or later, you would find some crime.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.640
I understand that.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.780
Not like, not like maybe not a big crime, maybe not nothing, but you'd be like, there's

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:51.000
no way that you can get to be a billionaire without something along the way being fucked

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
up.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.500
Yeah, I understand that and I think that you could make an argument for what you might

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.440
expect to find, but I don't think that you could argue definitively in the way that they're

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.440
arguing definitively.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440
Sure.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.440
This is what you would find.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.440
You would find that Trump won the election.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.520
And what we know from history about elections though is, especially this one, it is really

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.080
hard to cheat the entire country.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080
Yeah.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080
Really tough.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Maybe impossible.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080
Yeah.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:21.120
Also this same pattern of why won't you let everyone investigate this?

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.680
You must be afraid of what's underneath.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.680
Sure.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.920
If you were just to apply that to Trump, they'd be like, no, no, no, he can't have it because

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
XYZ.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.920
Exactly.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.040
There'd be a hundred reasons why this is not the same thing.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040
Yeah.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040
Who cares?

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.840
And your, your bullshit argument of like, they have a real opportunity to make conservatives

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840
look stupid here.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.000
And you're like, no, get the fuck out of here.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That's trolling.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Yeah.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Shut the fuck up.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
You dick.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Speaking of trolling.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I agree.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And I don't go off color.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.240
I go off people, but wouldn't Allen West make a great governor of Texas?

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.840
Oh, hell yeah.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.840
Yeesh.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840
Oh my God.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.280
Just after this episode was broadcast, Allen West resigned as the chair of the Texas GOP.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:03.120
It was probably at least partially due to fallout from him attending and speaking at

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.360
that QAnon conference last week, where Mike Flynn said that there's no reason that what

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.040
happened in Myanmar shouldn't happen here.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.200
He didn't serve for chair as long, uh, for a long time.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:19.000
Uh, and in his time in that position, he changed the GOP of Texas's slogan to we are the storm,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.560
which is about as overt a reference to QAnon as you can imagine.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Wow.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.400
Allen West is a terrible, terrible choice for a leader, but given Alex's embrace of

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.400
Marjorie Taylor Greene lately, it seems like he's kind of seeing the political utility

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.000
of seeing these folks as like a new tea party.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.400
I think that you might, uh, you might expect to see more of that.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.960
50, 50 shot Cornel West could become governor of Texas by accident.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.840
Like that is honestly, they don't know.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.240
They don't know.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:51.080
So Alex wants, uh, Trump to get back on social media and that's something that they spend

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.360
a good bit of time talking about.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.480
Everything was better for us when people were constantly talking about Trump.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:02.080
And that's the same argument that they make about the media, uh, saying like Trump is

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.080
going to get indicted.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.000
They're like, Trump is driving ratings.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
He's good for ratings.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So they talk about Trump.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.360
It's like, you know, you're doing the same thing, right?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.360
You know?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.360
Yeah.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.120
So anyway, they want him to get back on social media and the Hodge twins have a interesting

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.560
theory as to why that hasn't happened yet.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.200
He doesn't even have social media.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.280
He has 2 million followers on gab.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.160
If he joined gab tomorrow and get 10 million, the site works good.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.760
They've gotten the bugs out.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.400
We need to get a message to Trump.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.680
I don't have any stock in gab.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.640
I have a site on gab, hundreds of thousands of followers, but, but, but he's deplatformed.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.800
He needs to get on these other platforms.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.560
Now he needs to be on rumble.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.840
He needs to be on gab.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.560
He needs to be out there instead of, I know for a fact there are people around him that

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.280
are quietly sabotaging him.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280
Right.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.280
Yeah.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.280
And big techs behind it.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.960
That's why they banned him from every social media platform that's out there because they

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.320
don't want him to be able to communicate with other consumers and other like-minded Americans.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.320
Yeah.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.320
Maybe he's, uh, I thought he had some kind of social media platform in the works.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.260
Maybe that's what he's waiting to let everybody see and not somebody else's platform because

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.640
you know, Trump, he wants his own thing.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.000
So Trump had claimed he was going to roll out his own social media site, which ultimately

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.400
turned out to be a blog on his website that was so roundly mocked that it was taken down

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.860
permanently less than a month after launching.

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:23.200
It was so poorly done that Trump's staff have had to claim that there's a different social

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.800
media thing he's working on.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.720
And this actually wasn't an embarrassment after all.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.480
And it's a mess.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.480
Wow.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.480
Yep.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.880
It was the blog version of the four seasons, my friend.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880
That's what it was.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.080
So, I mean, this is it for the episode and like, honestly, he just interviews the hodge

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.080
twins for the rest of his time and then Gerald Cilenti takes over.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:49.920
It's like, there's, this wasn't about Fauci's emails.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.360
I would say, but his emails, Alex, come on.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360
I mean, wow.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:03.480
That is about as stirring an admission of the emails being a giant nothing as you could

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.000
possibly get.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.600
Like, yeah, because they don't, it doesn't even need to be true.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.560
It's never needed to be true.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.840
That's the, you can lie about any of it.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.880
And they're still just like, I don't think this one has legs.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.140
That's I feel like that's what people are coming to the conclusion right now.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:26.000
It does feel like a big whiff.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.680
And you know what, here's the thing too.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.960
Like the way that it feels like a big whiff from everything that I've been able to tell

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.880
the things that I've read, Alex's response here.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:43.680
That's a real problem because there should be something in there that's really damning

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.680
if any of the stuff that Alex was saying is true.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.700
Like there should be something that is fucked up.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:54.160
There should be like a message between him and his Chinese handlers.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160
Totally.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160
Totally.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.540
Because then what you're saying, like the, okay, okay, so you got all of his private

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.540
emails now.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.640
They were leaked, man.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.440
You've got all of this information.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.680
This is the proof that you are looking for.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.140
And none of it backs up what you're saying.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.800
So you then have to say like, no, no, no, no.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.800
So where is it?

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.520
He's got a secret email address that he can, and it's like, then, then what's the point

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.600
of ever leaking anything if it doesn't prove what you like.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.720
And then you're just going to say it's secret that it goes back to the goddamn hodge twins

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.740
being like, you've got a real opportunity to prove that conservatives are idiots right

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:27.740
here.

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:30.560
You guys have been doing it for us for so many goddamn years.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.640
Yeah, if you have this giant tranche is a word that Alex loves to use.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.440
It's a great word in his defense.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.680
Of emails that have come out that, you know, you'd think would be something that you could

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.520
use to build the narratives that you've been building forever.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.520
Totally.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.720
You'd think that this would give you some kind of an insight into what was going on.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.940
And instead, so much of the emails that I've read are very indicative of learning along

01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:03.040
the way and like the changing awareness is and like at the beginning, people did not

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:11.480
know a whole lot and it, I don't know, it kind of weirdly reinforces reality.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:22.640
I mean, from, from what I understand, it is really like reinforced my, I suppose, confidence

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:28.200
in the people who are doing this, because at every point in time, you know, obviously

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.080
looking back, you would say obvious.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:35.600
If we knew everything, we wouldn't have done it differently or be able to handle that better.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.600
Duh.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.800
But the way that you see the progression there is exactly how you would want people to do

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800
it.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.120
As we get more data, we're finding out whether or not this data is useful or non useful.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.040
We're taking the data that we can use and we're using it to refine our process.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.040
We're taking that refined process, putting it back into the system, getting useful and

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.740
non useful data, and then refining it still further.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:00.480
And it's like, that's exactly how I want people to work.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.640
That's how I want like science to work.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.640
Exactly.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.760
It's how it works.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.320
At no point in time, did you hear anybody just making these giant guesses?

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.320
I did.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.320
I did.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320
I heard one guy.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.320
Oh yeah.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320
Alex.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320
Yes, exactly.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.640
No, at no point in time in the emails was it like, Hey, we don't know anything about

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.280
hydrochloroquine or how it works just yet, but let's just go ahead and say it's great.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.240
You know, like it didn't happen like that.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.960
And the fact that it happened for other people like that should give you giant realizations

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.440
that they're dumb, but that won't happen.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440
Probably not.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440
Because it would be hard.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.440
You'd have to think.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.440
Yep.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.960
Anyway, it was kind of a bummer because I was hoping for a little bit more stuff to

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.600
dig into as opposed to just new salmon.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.600
Yeah.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.000
Just so that you read all those emails.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.800
You got a lot of ammo in your gun for a werewolf that ain't coming.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800
To be clear.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.060
First of all, I love that metaphor.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.060
That was a good metaphor.

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.060
I'm surprised.

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.060
That was off the dome.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.280
Yeah, it was nice.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.760
But I also like, I didn't read all of them, but I read enough to get a very general sense

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:09.840
of what a lot of these are and what the people are talking about in the conspiracy sites.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.640
And Alex is just doing nothing here on the second.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640
Bummer.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640
Yeah.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.560
Maybe later he'll get to it.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.960
Maybe Leo Zagami will come up with something for him to work with.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.960
Let's hope.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960
Let's hope.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.680
I need a big swing out of these emails because this isn't even a check swing.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.680
This is a whiff.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.680
Yeah.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.520
And this is also still a little bit on the shorter side of an episode.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.360
And we're still getting back adjusted after vacation.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360
Sure.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.960
I had not been on vacation for a very long time and I did not realize some of the sleep

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.360
disturbance, some of those challenges.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.960
And so I appreciate folks giving us a little bit of a, you know, I understand this is only

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.760
like hour and 15.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.760
We'll get you on Friday.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.760
We're getting in.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760
We're going to get there.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.760
Come on now.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.880
And we'll be back for that.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.240
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.240
We do have a website.

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.240
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.240
Yep.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.240
We're at Twitter.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240
We are on Twitter.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.400
It's at knowledge underscore fight and I go to betjordan.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.400
We're also on Facebook.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.400
We are on Facebook.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400
It's knowledgefight.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.920
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.920
doing God's work.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.920
Yep.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.920
We'll be back.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.920
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920
I'm Leo.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920
I'm DZX Clark.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.920
I am part asparagus.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920
Andy in Kansas.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.920
You're on the air.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920
Thanks for holding.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920
Hello, Alex.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920
I'm a first time caller.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.920
I'm a huge fan.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.920
I love your work.
