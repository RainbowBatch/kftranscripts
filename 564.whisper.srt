N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,120
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:46,280
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight, need money, Andy in Kansas, stop it, Andy in Kansas, it's

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
time to pray.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:58,480
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work, knowledgefight.com,

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
I love you.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,360
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,360
like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,680
little bit about Alex Jones, oh indeed we are Dan, shit, ah come on, I wasn't going

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,520
to talk about it, you added it, you barely added a little thing, we were going to just

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,480
ride it on through, old habits, old habits, die hard, what are you going to do Dan, I

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,040
don't know, I have a question for you, okay, I'll do that, I'll answer that question,

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,200
what's your bright spot today, my bright spot today Jordan, I mentioned this to you, I decided

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,280
that I was going to give Assassin's Creed Valhalla another chance, I mentioned on the

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,600
show that I started playing it and I was enjoying it enough and then I just sort of lost interest,

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,720
and I did not make it very far into it, and you were telling me that there's this new

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,680
Ireland DLC, and so I decided I'll give this a shot, and you buried the lead, holy shit,

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,880
I went to Ireland, and almost immediately, instead of a horse, you now can ride a giant

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,880
cat around, I know, so my bright spot is now I'm riding around on a giant cat, I was hoping

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,200
you would discover it on your own, because I knew you were going to blow your mind, it's

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,760
the best, I have a giant cat that I'm riding around like a horse, and I couldn't be happier,

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,720
that's all you need, that's all you need, that's all you've ever dreamed of, that's

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,800
all you, yeah, no, absolutely, now the game is back in my good graces, and I will probably

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,620
finish it, because I have a giant cat friend, that is why I have tried to throw as many

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,480
pets at you in the other show we do, so that is nice, I like that, yeah, what about you?

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,480
My bright spot, Dan, as you may know, or probably don't, the French Open is going on right now,

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,980
oh no, and while you are listening to this, there's a good chance that Rafa and Djokovic

32
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,960
are meeting for their roughly 600th time, Djokovic I think is ahead by one win, they're

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,040
so close, they're the Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn of tennis, they've been going back and

34
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,620
forth for a decade, they're destined to fight forever, forever and ever, they're the two

35
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,240
best that ever lived, along with Federer, and it's just going to be great tomorrow,

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,840
or today, or whatever you're listening to, I imagine Rafa's going to wind up winning,

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,140
because Djokovic just looked a little bit shaky, but you never know, although you do,

38
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,720
because Rafa has won the French Open 13 times, I feel like the French Open was happening

39
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,920
like a week or two ago, I feel like this just keeps happening, it never stops, it's every

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,240
year or so, no I just feel like there's some tennis thing that I just always assume is

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,780
the French Open that's happening, yeah, well I mean, it's hard for me to tell the difference

42
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,200
between any of this, if you talk about Rafa, you eventually mention that he won 13 French

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,840
Opens, true, so Jordan, today we have an episode from the past, no, that's where things are

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,520
better, I got sick of Jordan's shit, well that's fair, I got sick of Alex's shit in

45
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,000
the present day, and you know, one of the things that was like, alright I'm definitely

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,860
doing an episode about the past, was that I kept seeing people posting that picture

47
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,040
of Alex at a strip club, and I just lost my patience with the present day, I don't understand

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,960
how that ends up being like, a viral tweet on Twitter, like I don't, who cares, yeah

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,200
that's my instant reaction, a lot of people were telling me about it and I was like, that's

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,960
okay, he's a monster, good for him, he can go to, we can all go to a strip club whenever

51
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,720
we want, whenever we want, that guy's a monster though, I don't care if he's at a strip club,

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,080
it doesn't really, it doesn't really make anything, it doesn't make any larger point

53
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,440
other than like, I think there's something weird about going to a strip club, I mean

54
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,240
I suppose you could probably try and make the argument that it's hypocritical for him

55
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,960
to be God-blasting all day, every day, and then be at a strip club, but yeah, it's so

56
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,880
easy, it's stupid, you could say like, look I'm a man, or you could say, I went there

57
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,480
because I had a business meeting and the people I was with wanted to go, you don't understand

58
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,760
what it's like to be in the higher echelons of business, you're running your own business

59
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,320
sometimes, you know there's a hundred ways you could get around the quote on quote hypocrisy

60
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,760
of it, and I don't know, I didn't look into it too much, but it looked like he was in

61
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,540
a bathroom, and look, I hate Alex Jones, I don't even know if that's a strip club, well

62
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,000
I hate Alex Jones, and I will say that if someone was taking a picture of him in the

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,040
bathroom, I think that is a violation of someone's rights of privacy, sure, and like, I don't

64
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,600
think it's cool to take pictures of people in a bathroom, yeah, I think you're right,

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,240
anyway, that's a good point, I was like, I don't know, I imagine maybe he has a rebuttal

66
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,240
to that, but I don't want to talk about it, I just don't care, yeah, so today we're gonna

67
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,080
be in the past and we're gonna be talking about May 15th to 20th, whoa, that's a lot,

68
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,280
2003, oh, blackjack, dammit, that's the wrong one again, roulette, this is a period that

69
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,400
I've been looking forward to covering because as we know, the de-bathification begins, yes,

70
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,560
around this time, he's been screaming about how they're gonna let the bath party run,

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,600
everything, the baths are taking over, that's Bush's and the globalist's plan from the beginning,

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,560
yes, they're going to be in charge of Iraq because they're basically CIA, exactly, and

73
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,080
so I was interested to see how that would be affected by, you know, how Alex's rhetoric

74
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,320
would be affected, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then the second thing is that this is

75
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,800
over the weekend, and this is when Alex goes to Kansas City to do that local radio station

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,240
gig, that's right, we have a couple of dangling threads that are gonna come together in this

77
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,720
episode and I'm excited to get to it, but first, let's say hello to some new wonks,

81
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,720
would go to a CPA named W Neon Skousen, I would go to that if it was a Cold War themed

82

86
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,800
us to give as a policy, honorary policy wonk I guess, that's Bunny Brigade Pennsylvania,

87
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,240
Bunny Brigade PA, it's a bunny charity, like a rescue animal charity, oh okay, yeah, yeah,

88
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,840
I'm way ahead, they're apparently trying to expand and you can go to their website and

89
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,800
donate if you want to help save some bunnies, hell yeah, I was very close to trying to adopt

90
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,400
one of them because I looked at the website and there's a couple that were very cute,

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,880
of course there are, of course there are, you can't not adopt a bunny, no, anyway, Bunny

92
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,320
Brigade PA, you're now a policy wonk, I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, and then

99
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,720
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson alright, let's just get down to business,

100
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,040
we ain't making that money off that heroin, why you pimps so good, my neck is freakishly

101

large, I declare info war on you, thank you all, yes, thank you very much, especially

102
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,380
to me for donating to our show, just to make sure everybody knows that I might have a stand

103
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,840
up video on YouTube still, and I'm not sure if I do, but okay, so Jordan, we're gonna

104
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,600
get into this here, but first, here is an out of context drop, man that was a good show,

105
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,320
didn't cover all the news, covered a lot of it, okay, okay, okay, man that was a good

106
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:06,920
C+, got a 75%, I'm feeling solid about this math test, holy shit, I nailed it, I did some

107
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:15,840
of the things, that to me felt like really Alex Jones, that's very good, I do appreciate

108
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,520
that, hey this is a good show, also I set the bar low, anyways, onto tomorrow, you gotta

109
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:29,520
love yourself, you know, so we start here on the 15th, this is a Thursday, and Alex

110
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,360
is still covering the bombing in Riyadh that had happened recently, if you recall it was

111
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,260
a residential complex compound kind of area where a lot of Westerners were known to live,

112
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,500
in the intervening time since then, some more information has come out about the particular

113
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,560
Westerners that were living in these compounds that appeared to be the target of that, and

114
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,480
so this is the direction the story is going to go.

115
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,560
Local companies' employees die in Saudi bombing, now I had this on Infowars.com yesterday,

116
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,700
I briefly mentioned it, I said two days ago, before it was even in the news, on my website

117
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,900
and it's posted, the headline, you saw it, where I said, hmm, I bet the Carlisle Group

118
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:19,520
is going to be involved, I bet they're involved in the rebuilding, well guess what, guess

119
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,820
who owned the company and it just gotten done selling it and it still had connections to

120
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:32,640
it as a subsidiary, the Carlisle Group, the Benlodons, the Bushes and the rest of them.

121
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,040
So the company in question that were apparently the targets of this 2003 bombing in Riyadh

122
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,180
was the Vinnell Corporation, it's a construction business that was founded in 1931 and has

123
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,120
a deep history of international contracts for U.S. interests.

124
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,280
For instance, during the Vietnam War, Vinnell was tasked with maintaining power plant systems

125
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,720
over there overseas, they're actually pretty well known for this because in 1967, approximately

126
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,280
2,000 Korean workers at a Vinnell plant in Cameron Bay were dissatisfied enough with

127
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,320
their conditions that they rioted.

128
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,200
From Shelby Stanton's book, The Rise and Fall of an American Army, U.S. Ground Forces in

129
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,960
Vietnam, 1965 to 1973, quote, the primary cause appears to have been dissatisfaction

130
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,260
with the food served them, particularly the shortage of rice.

131
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,520
The Koreans refused to eat their Saturday meal on November 18th and went to the Vinnell

132
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,800
Mess Hall where they turned over tables and attacked several Americans.

133
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
They forced the American project manager to eat some of their food to show them how bad

134
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
it was.

135
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,040
A Vinnell Corporation civilian took out his gun and shot three Koreans.

136
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,900
He was then mobbed and severely injured and a Korean shot another American.

137
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,760
The riot ended up lasting four days.

138
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,920
Yeah, I was gonna say, like you say a company that does stuff for American government since

139
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,840
1931 and I'm like, I'm probably bad.

140
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,400
Not since 1931.

141
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,780
They were founded in 1931.

142
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,480
But they have a long history of performing government contracts in what are probably

143
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,280
war zones or a lot of the time.

144
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
So they're bad.

145
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,040
Yeah, and their involvement in government contracts began during the Chinese Civil War

146
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,400
when they were hired to ship supplies, meaning weapons, to Chiang Kai-Shek's forces.

147
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,720
Oh shit, was Alex right about everything?

148
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
No.

149
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Oh, okay.

150
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Because they were sending weapons to Chiang Kai-Shek.

151
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Yes, I know.

152
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,360
It was fighting against Mao.

153
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,080
So I don't know, Alex has got a tough point there.

154
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,520
What's really most notable about this company, however, is that in 1975 they landed a very

155
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,420
lucrative contract to train the Saudi Arabian National Guard.

156
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,320
This is almost certainly- Can they do that?

157
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,080
Apparently they can.

158
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,940
This is almost certainly why their building was a target for that attack in Riyadh.

159
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,800
Not some obscure connection to people Alex is insisting on connecting everyone to back

160
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
in 2003.

161
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,120
In fact, their headquarters in Saudi Arabia had been bombed back in 1995, too.

162
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,720
This is something that I think people know to do.

163
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, I mean, you're bad, so this happens.

164
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,080
I think that the people who would be trying to attack the Saudi Arabian government, maybe

165
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,580
some rebel types or terrorists, would know enough to be like, well, let's not just attack

166
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
the government.

167
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,920
I mean, they're not using them with material stuff.

169
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
It kind of makes sense.

170
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,200
Here's the connection between Vinil and Carlyle Group.

172
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,420
In 1992, Vinil Corporation was bought by BDM International Incorporated, which in turn

173
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,240
was owned by the Carlyle Group.

174
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,040
However, in 1997, BDM was purchased by TRW Incorporated, which represented the end of

175
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,660
their association with the Carlyle Group.

176
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,720
According to an article in the Washington Post from 1997 about the deal, Carlyle had

177
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,120
agreed to sell its entire stake and shares in the company to TRW in the acquisition,

178
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,520
so there isn't even some minority ownership remaining the way Alex is pretending.

179
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,720
Right, right, right, right.

180
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,960
Then in 2002, TRW was bought by Northrop Grumman, so at the time Alex is recording this episode

181
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,920
and he wants to talk about this company in the context of the military industrial complex,

182
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
this would be the angle to take.

183
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,040
It seems really simple, too, which is why you can't do it.

184
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
It's too easy.

185
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,280
By pointing fingers at the Carlyle Group, Alex is making this piece of information fit

186
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,040
his pre-written narratives about Bush, but he's depriving the audience of access to any

187
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,080
real context for the subject that he's covering.

188
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,280
At the point Alex is on air here, the Carlyle Group was six years removed from selling Vinel's

189
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,100
parent company, and even if they were owners of Vinel's parent company, still it wouldn't

190
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
prove anything.

191
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Yeah.

192
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Oh, man.

193
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,700
I mean, to a certain extent, I think once you're talking about a company that's been

194
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,720
bought like three times in six years, I don't even know if any of these people have any

195
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,260
idea what it is they're buying or selling at that highest level.

196
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,920
You know what I'm saying?

197
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,020
What do you mean George W. Bush knows what's going on or anything like that?

198
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,820
He's got people who are just like, ah, we'll do all that stuff.

199
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,440
He's bumbling around like a fool.

200
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,500
I don't know.

201
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,280
They don't know what they're doing if they're buying those kinds of companies and then selling

202
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
them a year later.

203
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,900
Well, from what I understand from reading some of these articles, it was a period of

204
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:10,120
time where there was rampant consolidation and merger and going on in terms of these

205
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
international contractors.

206
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Right.

207
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Right, right, right.

208
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
And so that kind of explains a little bit of the moving around.

209
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Right.

210
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Right, right, right.

211
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Yeah.

212
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I don't know.

213
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
It's not compelling.

214
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Just because you see the name Carlyle Group in the past of this company.

215
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Right.

216
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Right, right, right.

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't know.

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's soft.

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Northrop Grumman is probably an easier name to just pull and be like, problem.

220
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Doesn't come up at all.

221
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
See?

222
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
No, but problem.

223
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
You know?

224
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Weird that it doesn't come up at all.

225
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
The name Northrop Grumman doesn't come up at all in Alex's conversation.

226
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,280
I thought Alex has a stake in Northrop Grumman.

227
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
No.

228
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
See?

229
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Anybody can do it, Dan.

230
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Anybody can do it.

231
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,440
Alex owns part of Northrop Grumman.

232
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,060
So it's all a conspiracy that he's trying to get people to hate the, it's, anybody.

233
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
As founded as anything else.

234
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Done.

235
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Yeah, anybody.

236
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Anybody.

237
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,720
Apparently this Vinnell Corporation is also apparently a front for the CIA.

238
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Oh, okay.

239
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Turns out the firm was a cover for the CIA too.

240
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:12,400
Oh, lo and behold, what got bombed was the CIA, hence the Times of London, and the Vinnells

241
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,120
one-time owners of the Carlyle Group, shadowy CIA operations.

242
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,040
Here are the mainstream articles, NBC and the Times of London, on the website Infowars.com

243
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,160
right now.

244
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,040
One of the things that I've learned to be very careful about when dealing with speculative

245
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,800
information is claims that people or groups are fronts.

246
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,640
This is an accusation that's really difficult to work with because generally speaking it's

247
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,080
a claim that's made constantly without proof, and people who make the claim often seem to

248
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,840
think that the burden of proof is on you to show that some group isn't a front, which

249
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,460
is a trap.

250
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,700
If you read any John Birch Society text or book from the anti-communist crusaders that

251
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,520
Alex loves, one of the first things you'll notice is that every single thing is asserted

252
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,280
to be a communist front, and none of it is ever substantiated.

253
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,520
Gary Allen's book, Communist Revolution in the Streets, accuses literally every civil

254
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,480
rights organization, every student activism group, and most bookstores of being communist

255
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
fronts.

256
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,240
And not in the sense that some communists might gravitate to these things.

257
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,800
He's claiming that these exist explicitly as props of the communist party.

258
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,920
It was Barnes and Nobleski, if you, alright.

259
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,080
So anyway, my point is that it's one of the rhetorical tricks that I have the least interest

260
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,400
in, is like an unsupported allegation that something or someone is a front.

261
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Nonsense.

262
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,040
The question I just wrote down is like, after all these years, what does Alex think the

263
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,600
CIA's portfolio actually looks like, like if there was a balance sheet of all of their

264
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
fronts?

265
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Jesus.

266
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,680
So in the case of Vinnell, there is an article in the London Times about how they were formerly

267
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,680
owned by the Carlyle Group, and that the Carlyle Group had a history of contracting with intelligence

268
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
organizations.

269
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Sure.

270
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Sure's the headline that Alex is talking about.

271
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,720
Now, here's the thing.

272
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,160
I would never come to you and say that Vinnell absolutely hasn't done some work with groups

273
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
like the CIA.

274
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Sure.

275
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,560
That's almost a certainty, considering their longstanding contract to train the Saudi National

276
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Guard.

277
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,960
And allegations have been made.

278
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,000
From a 2003 article in the LA Times, quote, in a memoir, former CIA operative Wilbur Crane

279
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,080
Evelyn described using his title as Vinnell vice president as a cover while working in

280
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,800
Africa and the Middle East in the early 1960s.

281
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,320
It's definitely conceivable to imagine that at times people who work for the CIA have

282
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,720
used fake employment at Vinnell as cover, but that alone doesn't demonstrate that the

283
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,400
entire company itself is a front operation.

284
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,280
I'm going out of my way to provide explanations for why Alex could be right, and I still don't

285
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,320
think his argument stands up to scrutiny.

286
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
No.

287
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,840
No, I mean, here's what I get from all of the evidence.

288
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,600
Something shady could be going on here.

289
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,080
Here's what I get from Alex.

290
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,440
It's the fucking globalists inside everybody.

291
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
And we've proved it.

292
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Yeah, exactly.

293
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,240
And it's like, man, I'm not saying nothing shady's going on, but I'm not saying nothing's

294
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,400
not going on.

295
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
Initially, after the bombing, it was suspected that the attacks were on a housing area known

296
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,560
to be used by Westerners living in Riyadh.

297
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,440
As more details came out, it became more clear that this was likely a targeted attack aimed

298
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,000
at Vinnell.

299
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,320
What makes a lot of sense is that, from the standpoint of people who might attack the

300
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,240
Saudi government, like we were talking about, they're assisting and training the National

301
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,760
Guard of Saudi Arabia, and you might see that as a high-profile target.

302
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,220
If you're a rebel, it's hard not to view that as a combatant target.

303
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,920
The CIA could outright run Vinnell, or they could just be a company that had close ties

304
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,440
to the government and allowed CIA agents to use their business's name as part of the cover.

305
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,160
Either way, I'm not sure it really matters, because the thing they're doing sucks.

306
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,100
There's a much larger problem here with this entire state of private armies and war contractors,

307
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,640
but instead of dealing with those things realistically, Alex just wants to jingle around keys like

308
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,380
the CIA and Carlyle group, because distracting is easier than wrestling with difficult information

309
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,160
and looking at the reality.

310
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,760
That's what he's doing, and it's wild.

311
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,640
I mean, then again, to a certain extent, it's hard not to look back in the context of, like,

312
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,180
when he has Trump, he's fine with so much of this shit, you know?

313
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,560
He likes Blackwater now.

314
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,040
Yeah, he loves all of this stuff, so, you know, maybe part of the reason-

315
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,400
He thinks Prince is a hero.

316
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,000
Part of the reason maybe that he's doing all of these jangling keys kinds of things is

317
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,960
because he wants the fundamental problems to stay the same, he just wants to be in control

318
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,120
of those fundamental problems and how we react to them, you know?

319
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,200
He wants to have a private army.

320
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,160
So why would he complain about people who have private armies unless it's within the

321
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,200
context of jangling keys over here, you know?

322
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,640
Well, I mean, certainly, you know, libertarianism is not averse to private armies.

323
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,840
No, no, no.

324
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,320
Most libertarian thinkers seem to-

325
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,160
As long as you get to join.

326
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Yeah.

327
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,080
So, anyway, Alex has some more conspiracies about this company in Saudi.

328
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:14,160
Turns out that 50 plus of the 70 employees were gone on a training mission and-

329
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,680
So he's saying that 50 of the 70 employees at Vinil were gone on a training mission,

330
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,840
but what he's doing is he's trying to create the false impression in the listener's head.

331
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,940
Whenever there's an attack, you'll always hear claims that some select group was warned

332
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,220
not to be there or had been removed from the area beforehand because claims like this seem

333
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,840
to be really strong indications of foreknowledge and probably it's a false lie.

334
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Of course.

335
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,520
Alex wants you to think that 50 of the seven employees there weren't at work that day,

336
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,360
which is suspicious, but that's not the situation.

337
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,960
The buildings that were bombed were a residential compound where 70 American employees lived.

338
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,440
I'm not sure where Alex is getting the 50 number from, but nine employees died and 15

339
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
were hospitalized, not counting many who were merely treated for minor injuries.

340
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Jesus.

341
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,200
Also, if people who worked at Vinil weren't at home, they almost by definition would be

342
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,520
on a training mission since the reason they're in Saudi Arabia is a training mission.

343
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,320
The words Alex is saying actually mean nothing, but they're meant to create a denser air of

344
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,840
suspicion around the bombing, which is unearned by the information that he's actually presenting.

345
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,560
It does seem like he's even presenting it the exact opposite way in as far as they were

346
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,160
just at work.

347
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,200
He's like, they're on a training mission, meaning they're not at work, but in this circumstance,

348
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,800
they're at work.

349
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
They're not at home.

350
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,480
Yeah, he's meaning it to be like they were sent to UAE.

351
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,120
Right, right, right.

352
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,640
He's trying to sell it like if the Pentagon got exploded tomorrow, but all the top generals

353
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,020
escaped miraculously the day before, you're like, well, that's suspicious as shit instead

354
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,020
of like-

355
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
That's exactly what he's doing.

356
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,020
They all just went to work that day.

357
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,020
It was a normal day.

358
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,160
He's saying all the higher ups were gone, and he literally does say a couple of times

359
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,680
like, the janitors were the ones who were-

360
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
Okay.

361
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't know about this.

362
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,480
So Alex jumps off this topic, and he reads a bit of an op-ed by Joseph Farah, the guy

363
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
who runs WorldNetDaily.

364
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Sure.

365
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I bet it's great.

366
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,280
Well, one of the things that I think is really fascinating about this is that Alex doesn't

367
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,320
seem to like WorldNetDaily in 2003.

368
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,360
I'm just so confused.

369
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,760
He doesn't consider them allies.

370
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I'm furious.

371
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,400
So anyway, this is going to start with him reading from the article and then expounding

372
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,720
a little bit on some of his feelings.

373
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,000
Most people need to rethink their notions about the political spectrum and the left

374
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
end.

375
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,960
Most people agree you have communism, total government control over the means of production

376
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
and property.

377
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,880
It's the other end of the spectrum that many get confused.

378
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Ask most left-wingers, and they'll suggest that fascism is on the extreme right, 180

379
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
degrees from communism.

380
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Uh-uh.

381
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Wow, Farah.

382
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
You've been listening to the show.

383
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,320
We know a lot of WorldNetDaily writers listen, and you've admitted that.

384
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,640
I've got news for you, friends.

385
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,080
Fascism and communism are ideological kissing cousins.

386
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,360
Boy, you said it.

387
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,680
I would place fascism and socialism just a few degrees to the right of communism.

388
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
No, Farah.

389
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
It's not left-right.

390
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
What?

391
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:10,000
Fascism, communism, socialism, all on the command and control, tyranny, serfdom, feudalism,

392
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,640
and republics, constitutional republics, are on the other end of that spectrum.

393
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Get a little more sophisticated.

394
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
I think you are.

395
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
I think you know.

396
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,600
They've got to keep you in that left-right.

397
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,680
You think you get a choice when really you're on the big government side.

398
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
That's weird.

399
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,720
Words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words.

400
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Yeah.

401
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,520
Alex loves WorldNetDaily now and has over large stretches of his career, but he seems

402
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,720
to think that they're neo-cons at this point, and he thinks that this op-ed that Joseph

403
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,520
Farah wrote is an indication that they're coming around or something, and so he's excited.

404
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,560
I'm less interested in that op-ed than I am in Alex's discussion about some of the more

405
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,960
the specifics about his belief that the right-left paradigm is an illusion.

406
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm a big fan of how he confuses economic systems, government systems, any number of

407
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
different things.

408
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,960
Listening to mostly more current episodes of Alex's show from the past five or six years,

409
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,040
you get the sense that that idea had something to do with political parties.

410
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,260
Even at the end of the clip, he's making reference to the left and the right having something

411
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,020
to do with giving you the illusion of having a choice, which feels like he's talking about

412
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,680
voting and political parties.

413
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,440
However, listening to these 2003 episodes, the concept has sort of taken a different

415
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
shape.

416
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,760
Since Alex talks a little bit more about what he actually means back then, and I have to

417
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,200
say that I think it's actually way stupider than I thought it was, it actually seems like

418
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,840
a political philosophy that's tailor-made to be defined by opposition, which goes a

419
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,480
long way toward helping make sense of how the show seemed nonsensical in the Trump era

420
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,320
and now.

421
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,440
When Alex is discussing the illusion of the left-right paradigm, I believe you have to

422
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,580
just completely get ideas of liberal or conservative politics out of your head.

423
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,040
I think Alex is operating on a completely different axis, which is essentially just

424
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,080
government is bad.

425
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,840
It's a pretty childish thing to express as your fundamental political belief, especially

426
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,300
if you don't have the courage to just come out and be a full-on anarchist.

427
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,300
If you're against big government, then I'd like to remind you that small government is

428
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,280
fucking huge compared to no government.

429
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,940
Leaving that aside, I want to discuss for a second why Alex's conception of this being

430
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,840
the only relevant excess in politics is woefully dumb and not the way to look at the world.

431
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,760
The sole factor Alex considers in terms of ideology is whether or not something is a

432
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,440
system that includes government control of the public, the command and control aspect.

433
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,300
On the one side of the spectrum, he puts communism, socialism, and fascism as systems with high

434
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,520
government control, and at the other end, he has this idealized version of a constitutional

435
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,200
republic, which I guess is supposed to have minimal government control, I guess.

436
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
I don't know.

437
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,680
If that's the only factor that matters, then there should be no difference to Alex between

438
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,400
anarcho-capitalism and libertarian socialism.

439
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,040
Both advocate for the elimination of the centralized state, which would result in a system with

440
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,040
even less governmental control over the public than exists in a republic.

441
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,080
Both are conceived around people existing in a stateless world, characterized by voluntarily

442
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,240
constructed groups.

443
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,060
But obviously, these two ideologies have stark differences.

444
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,760
One of the biggest is their stance on private property.

445
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,120
Anarcho-capitalists believe the right to private property is essentially the bedrock of society,

446
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,920
whereas libertarian socialists would view the accumulation of private property to be

447
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,480
an instance of the same oppression one might face from the state, just being carried out

448
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,440
by a private corporation.

449
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
It's very obvious if you look at these two systems that Alex isn't really being honest

450
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
about his political preferences.

451
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,280
If there's two schools of thought which both eschew centralized governmental control, there

452
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,880
are still political preferences that Alex has that are on the left-right spectrum.

453
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,160
Private property is a matter of the left-right spectrum.

454
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,840
While it's true that most center-left and center-right people tend to agree that private

455
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,380
property ownership is good, that's not true when you go to the further ends of the spectrum.

456
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,600
Further-left ideologies tend to favor communal ownership of private property or democratized

457
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
workplaces.

458
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,840
Conversely, further-right ideologies tend to believe that private property rights are

459
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,960
inalienable human rights, and they have no problem with exploitative workplaces because

460
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,080
employment is a voluntary relationship.

461
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,480
Alex presents himself as being above the left-right paradigm because he wants you to think that

462
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,120
he's talking about democrat-republican two-party system stuff that exists in the United States.

463
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,960
He wants you to think that because most people are disenfranchised with that two-party system,

464
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,420
and it's an easy thing to find agreement with.

465
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,320
Most people would be like, yeah, you know, these aren't fully, they don't fully encapsulate

466
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
my ideology.

467
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,840
And if you look at it as like a line between the two parties, yes, that is an illusion.

468
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,760
That's what he wants you to think, but that's not what he's talking about.

469
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,760
It's important to recognize that, and recognize that he's a liar.

470
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,600
When he says that he's above the left-right paradigm, what he's actually saying is that

471
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,000
he hates government, that he lacks the political depth to coherently advocate for the form

472
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,280
of anarchy that he would prefer, and so he just pretends that the answer is a constitutional

473
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
republic.

474
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:04,880
Yeah, I mean, I would also add into that, that level of, you know, the type of person

475
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,640
who wants capitalism, but you know, they're not going to be the people grounded underneath

476
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,120
the boot of capitalism.

477
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,960
You know, look, listen, I think, you know, people shouldn't have all of this money.

478
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,840
I mean, I should have all of this money, obviously, but people shouldn't have all this money,

479
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
you know?

480
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,640
Because again, you want to preserve so much of the system that gives you power over everybody

481
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,960
else, instead of being like, look, I don't want any government, whoa, whoa, whoa, then

482
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,960
people might steal my expensive things, you know, like that kind of feel.

483
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,640
If you created his kind of left-right paradigm world within there, there'd still be fucking

484
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,600
cops to protect his shit, so he doesn't have to.

485
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,320
Like that's the kind of anarcho bullshit he's peddling, so yeah, fuck off.

486
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,920
Yeah, I mean, what I would need from him is, okay, so if the question is command and control

487
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,640
nonsense and like what amount the government controls the population, right, that is the

488
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,880
relevant access upon which you can judge politics.

489
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
That's it.

490
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,120
If that's the case, then you need to explain to me why a constitutional republic is more

491
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,320
preferable than an anarchist state, because that would be the complete elimination of

492
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,640
this thing that you think is the bad.

493
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,600
And then you'd have to argue, I guess if you're Alex, that a certain amount is important.

494
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
And then, okay, why?

495
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,640
He's like, well, because I like to control things or something, you know?

496
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Yeah, exactly.

497
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Because I want stuff.

498
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Yeah.

499
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,000
And this doesn't even get into differentiation between personal and private property and

500
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,780
how many left ideologies still believe in personal property.

501
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,160
And the right does try to muddle those things a little bit.

502
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
It's easy.

503
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,300
But yeah, and I mean, this also isn't even getting into the differentiation between political

504
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,080
and more economic models and how Alex is just playing fast and loose between all of them.

505
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,840
You can have a fascist communist state.

506
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,400
There's a government and an economic model there that's not a fascist or communist state.

507
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,120
That's not how it works.

508
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,000
And, I don't know, I just think when you hear stuff like this, what it does is it helps

509
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,480
me understand a little bit more about these sort of elements of Alex's costume that he

510
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,120
wears to try and trick people into thinking he's sensible.

511
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:36,020
And that being above the left-right paradigm looks sensible, because you could say, Republicans

512
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,800
and Democrats are all the same.

513
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,280
They're beholden to corporate interests, special interest groups, and you can say that.

514
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,800
And I think you can get a lot of people to be like, yeah, you know what?

515
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,160
That makes some sense.

516
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,000
But that's not what Alex is talking about.

517
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
No, no.

518
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,800
It's just a little bit of a disguise.

519
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Yeah.

520
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,380
I mean, you can call yourself above the left-right paradigm fairly easily because a winning strategy

521
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,260
for both Republicans and Democrats is to say, listen, the Republicans and the Democrats

522
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,240
fucking suck.

523
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,400
Elect me to be one of those Republicans or Democrats, you know, like it's a winning strategy.

524
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
It kind of is.

525
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
It's not hard.

526
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Yeah.

527
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Yeah.

528
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
It does.

529
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
It helps.

530
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
It helps.

531
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
What a pathetic world.

532
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,240
But anyway, labels and words mean nothing.

533
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Yes.

534
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,720
Communism, fascism, it means nothing, nothing.

535
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,000
It's all strong man, thug, empire, get it straight.

536
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,240
If your goal is to enlighten an audience or help them better understand the world around

537
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,760
them and the political conversations that they're hearing, this is exactly the opposite

538
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
of what you should do.

539
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,260
Communism and fascism do definitely mean something.

540
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,640
They are just words that describe imperial strongmen wearing different colored hats and

541
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,960
convincing audiences that that's the case makes them entirely unprepared to deal with

542
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,720
challenging political issues.

543
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,320
Also, if you take Alex at his word, then the hallmarks of the sort of government that he

544
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,780
hates and he does not want to exist is one that's run by a strongman or thug, which is

545
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,960
an empire.

546
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,440
I know hypocrisy means nothing, but by these standards, Donald Trump is precisely the candidate

547
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,160
2003 Alex Jones would strongly oppose.

548
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,000
In 2015, Alex knew Trump was connected to the mob and presented an image of a strongman

549
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,240
as a facade.

550
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
He put on this image.

551
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
He was a fake strongman.

552
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Yeah.

553
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,820
During the campaign, Trump made signals to being open to empire and Alex even defended

554
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,720
Trump's desire to buy Greenland and claim space in the name of the United States.

555
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,880
Come on, you want Greenland, you want space.

556
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,180
Trump fails Alex's imaginary test that's allegedly above the left-right paradigm, but Alex still

557
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:39,120
supports him because he actually passes Alex's real litmus test, which is heavily dependent

558
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,480
on the left-right paradigm.

559
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,600
Oh yeah.

560
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,520
That's important to keep in mind, but it's important to remember that that's really what

561
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
motivates him.

562
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Yeah.

563
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,880
It's such a bummer that these concepts like communism and fascism and all of that stuff,

564
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,000
things that really do take a book or multiple books or many, many books to understand clearly,

565
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,280
let alone try and implement.

566
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,440
And then you've got people who are just like, communism is this in a short sentence.

567
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,400
That's going to muddy the waters.

568
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,440
Nobody wants to read many, many books.

569
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Yeah.

570
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,160
And I think you have that same problem on the reverse side.

571
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Oh yeah, totally.

572
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,600
People promoting certain ideologies or systems, doing it overly simplistically.

573
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,200
I think you run into similar issues of watering down meanings, confusing people.

574
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Yeah.

575
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,480
And there's a lot of complexity and I'm not even sitting here pretending I understand

576
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,920
fully every intricate aspect of theory.

577
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Right, right.

578
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
No, no, no.

579
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Absolutely.

580
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,160
It becomes, you know, why did Marx write Das Kapital?

581
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,240
It's so big.

582
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,440
He should have written a one page ad in the New York Times and we all still would have

583
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,860
gotten it, right?

584
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,200
That's how simple theory is.

585
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,320
Hey capitalism, I got two words for you.

586
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
Suck it.

587
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Yes, exactly.

588
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
Yeah, done.

589
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:04,000
So Alex jumps off this and goes on to another headline that I guess is the big news.

590
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But the big news when we get back, dead man left on gym floor while others exercise, just

591
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,040
how people don't care anymore.

592
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,280
This is a sad headline, but...

593
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
That's the big news.

594
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,640
Yeah, I'm not sure there's any place being part of the news roundup of a national radio

595
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
show.

596
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,120
I don't know.

597
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,400
Single person hurt in accident.

598
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,260
On shows like Alex's, you'll hear coverage like this a lot because it serves a couple

599
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,120
of important emotional purposes for the audience.

600
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,840
The first is that a straw man is created of the heartless people who could just exercise

601
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,040
while a person next to them was dead.

602
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,000
The listener gets to imagine how horrible these people are and feel morally superior

603
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,120
to these imaginary people.

604
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,760
The second is to demoralize the audience about the state of the world and erode their belief

605
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
in their fellow persons.

606
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,840
The goal is to present a situation where the audience hears this headline and they imagine

607
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,540
that these people in the gym continued to work out fully aware that this person was

608
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,320
dead because that's shitty of them.

609
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,040
If they didn't know the person was dead and thought possibly he was just resting, then

610
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,800
you can't really paint this as a story that highlights the moral degradation of the broader

611
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
culture.

612
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,400
It's really more just a situation where people are minding their own business at the gym

613
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,680
and there's a tragic coincidence.

614
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,480
People not bothering stranger.

615
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Yeah.

616
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,680
It's sad and it's unfortunate, but it's not like...

617
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,400
This is not a news story that illustrates how bad people are.

618
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah, no, it's like he's trying to do a sequel to Boondock Saints, but it's about people

619
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,880
at the gym who are just minding their own business.

620
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,520
I've been to the gym many times and people could have been dead.

621
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:40,320
There are people who I've seen laying, like, and your favorite word, supine.

622
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Supine.

623
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,280
You're never gonna let me live that down.

624
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Nope.

625
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,560
They're just laying there and obviously, you know, if you want to go poke them, you can,

626
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,160
but also every time I have been around, they eventually get up because they've just been

627
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,680
tired because they're working out.

628
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,340
Imagine how many years someone does that.

629
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,920
If you're listening to Alex Jones in 2003, right, and you're like taking this one story

630
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
to heart.

631
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,680
You've missed everything else he's ever said, but you got this one story.

632
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,160
How many years are you poking people at the gym before maybe you find a dead guy?

633
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
You know?

634
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Your whole life.

635
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Your whole life.

636
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
You're never finding a dead guy.

637
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
You're not finding people now.

638
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
I bet you're not.

639
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
You're an asshole.

640
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Yep.

641
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,480
So Alex has Craig Roberts back on.

642
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,400
And you'd have to try and explain it every time.

643
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Yeah.

644
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Oh, sorry.

645
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I thought you were dead.

646
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Sorry.

647
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I thought you were dead.

648
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,240
In 2003, Alex Jones had this story where people watched everybody die and I'm just not gonna

649
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
let it happen.

650
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,360
Alex Jones convinced me that the only way to be a good person was to poke everybody.

651
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Exactly.

652
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:47,320
So Alex has Craig Roberts back on, who is the conspiracy theorist type, and he was on

653
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,000
partially because he's gonna be in Kansas City with Alex in this speech.

654
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,880
And so, you know, there's a war going on in the world.

655
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,680
This is obviously just a distraction from the financial collapse that's happening tomorrow.

656
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,100
Gold.

657
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,240
And then we hit a common theme.

658
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,920
If they can keep us in a war, that'll divert us off the plunging economy and the shopping

659
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,320
malls being empty.

660
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,400
Because this, it's not just oil or weapons sales, it's about a global police state.

661
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,040
From Russia to the US, governments are using the terror as a massive crackdown mechanism.

662
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,640
We know Putin got caught blowing up buildings in Russia.

663
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,440
Well, it's order out of chaos, not decaled.

664
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,100
That's their motto.

665
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,680
Every day, Putin and the apartment buildings come up.

666
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,400
Every single day.

667
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
In this stretch?

668
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Yeah.

669
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Every day.

670
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,040
I have been keeping track.

671
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,600
Not a single episode has gone by that hasn't come up multiple times.

672
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,680
It makes me so mad.

673
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,960
It makes me so mad.

674
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,560
That's a cornerstone of his sort of reporting at this point.

675
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,400
You can just do whatever you want.

676
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
You certainly can.

677
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,760
That's the lesson of America.

678
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,980
If you're a psycho, you can do whatever the fuck you want.

679
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,000
So at this point, Alex, he has his interview with Craig Robertson.

680
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,600
It's kind of short and I don't really care.

681
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,360
I don't find that guy very interesting.

682
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,240
But what is interesting is that Alex then has an interview with his water filter sponsor.

683
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Oh no.

684
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,480
Bad news coming out, bad economy, and people putting their money back in.

685
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,640
Public indicators, there's no one at the stores.

686
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,000
I go to CompUSA to buy something computer-wise.

687
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I go to the mall.

688
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,360
There's no one there, Jim.

689
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,880
Well and that's what, that's basically the story all the way through the economy.

690
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,800
And they're saying is brace for massive terror attacks.

691
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
We're going to get hit.

692
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Blah, blah, blah.

693
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,760
People, you better get essentials.

694
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,600
You better pick up the phone and get these water filters.

695
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,080
You are nuts if you don't.

696
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,640
Jim, tell them about the new.

697
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
That's shameless.

698
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
That's what they knew.

699
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
That's an incredible new product.

700
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty shameless.

701
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,280
That is, that is without shame.

702
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,360
That is the definition of shameless.

703
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Yeah, yeah.

704
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,880
Let's get those water filters and the sponsor on to scare people.

705
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
They're going to be terrorist attacks.

706
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,600
They want to scare you with all these terrorist attacks.

707
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,100
Let me tell you something, people.

708
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,560
The economy's collapsing so you need water filters.

709
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,480
I'm not trying to scare you with terror attacks.

710
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,480
I think that, you know, I think we've talked about this a little bit in the past, but I

711
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,760
think it's been a really long time.

712
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,400
Like, I think that there is a way to do what Alex is doing in a responsible way.

713
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,200
You know, like be like, hey, you know, there, there are dangers in the world and you know,

714
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,800
let's say if you have a family, it would be good to have a little bit of food stored in

715
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,200
case of a natural disaster or something like when I was growing up, there was a worry about

716
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,480
tornadoes in Missouri.

717
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Yeah.

718
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,200
And so my parents had some canned food and water in the basement just as a, like, we

719
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,360
never ended up needing it, but just in case it's there.

720
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Exactly.

721
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,560
I always have an extra big bag of cat food on hand because I have a cat.

722
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Of course.

723
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,640
And I don't want to run into a situation where something could happen and I'm not able to

724
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,040
take care of this thing.

725
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,040
Totally.

726
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,680
I think that there is like a way to, it's not this though.

727
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
No.

728
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,800
This is exploitative and playing on people's fears.

729
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah.

730
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,620
There, there's a, there's a version of this that is like looking at life responsibly and

731
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,680
trying to be like, well, you may need this.

732
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Right.

733
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,640
It's, it's not a terrible idea just in case.

734
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,360
And the other side of it is this, like you're, you're stupid if you don't get these, these

735
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,840
water filters because there's going to be terrorist attacks and the economy is going

736
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
to collapse.

737
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
Yeah.

738
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Yeah.

739
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:23,660
It is unfortunate that that's like that combination of when commerce and capital met psychology

740
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,520
and turned it into advertising and they're like, we can get more stuff if we emotionally

741
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,480
manipulate people than if we provide them a rational argument.

742
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,440
So we're going to emotionally manipulate them.

743
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,540
The end.

744
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:40,660
So the filter sponsor, he apparently just got some big news from a major scientist about

745
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,240
how great his filters are.

746
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,640
And Alex tries to set this up.

747
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,520
Please tell me it's Dr. Fauci of all people.

748
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
I wish.

749
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Why not?

750
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Let's throw that in there.

751
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
No, I'm not that big of a witch.

752
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,320
Um, no, but the, the, the filter sponsor doesn't have time to talk about this and listen to

753
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Alex's disappointment here.

754
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,720
Okay, let's hear this.

755
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,640
So it's really, you had a famous scientist do the test.

756
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Uh, that's correct.

757
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,280
And um, well, Alex, I tell you what, I'm, I'm on a business trip and I've got to be

758
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,600
somewhere in about 15 minutes, but if I can, uh, I'd like to give a little special out

759
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
here.

760
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Sure.

761
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Go ahead, Jim.

762
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Okay.

763
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Very disappointed.

764
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Who is the famous scientist?

765
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,160
One thing to say, you said a famous scientist, say the name, then give the ad.

766
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Yes.

767
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
The end.

768
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
This has been approved by Mary.

769
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,520
Something, something, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

770
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,060
Watson and Crick.

771
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,800
Jonas Salk approves of my water filters.

772
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,440
Now we have a special running.

773
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Naturally, naturally.

774
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,240
Anyway, Alex is another guest and this is something that he's been promoting all day.

775
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,880
He's so excited to have this guy on.

776
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,680
He is a Canadian journalist named Barry Zwicker.

777
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
Okay.

778
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,400
Uh, and uh, he does not like 9-11 and thinks 9-11 was an inside job and what have you.

779
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
All right.

780
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,120
And he's been playing him up as like the biggest deal, like a huge Canadian journalist, one

781
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,960
of the most important in the world.

782
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Okay.

783
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,640
And uh, so here's Barry's introduction to the proceedings.

784
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,360
Well, listen, it's a real pleasure, Alex, I, uh, I, I encountered your face for the

785
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:18,960
first time at the end of that new video, uh, called aftermath, you know, questions, unanswered

786
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
questions from 9-11.

787
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,720
I saw that video in San Francisco last month and I really liked what they had you as the

788
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:33,620
last guy punching out a real call for people to wake up and uh, I really admired that.

789
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,280
So Barry Zwicker is an interesting fellow.

790
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,360
From everything I can tell, he was a pretty standard and accomplished Canadian journalist.

791
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,880
He'd worked for mainstream outlets and then 9-11 happened and everything seems to have

792
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
fallen apart.

793
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Uh oh.

794
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
Zwicker decided that...

795
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,880
He's like Dennis Miller.

796
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
Yeah, yeah.

797
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,780
Except I don't think that Zwicker's gone full hard right.

798
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,680
Or that Dennis Miller was ever funny.

799
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,320
I don't know if Zwicker's funny either.

800
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Fair.

801
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,160
He decided that the mainstream media story about the attack wasn't real, but he did have

802
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,720
a bit of a different angle on it than Alex.

803
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,640
According to what he told reporter Terry Glavin in a 2006 interview, the end goal of the attack,

804
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,160
carried out by the White House, was to create a war against Islam.

805
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Okay.

806
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
That was the conspiracy.

807
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Well?

808
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,720
In 2004, he would go on to make his own 9-11 film titled The Great Conspiracy, the 9-11

809
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,960
news special you never saw.

810
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,980
It's just as good and just as bad as every other 9-11 documentary and has a title that

811
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,660
bears all the hallmarks of the early days of internet clickbait, before people really

812
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,660
got good at it.

813
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

814
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,320
Before it turned into an art form into itself, yeah.

815
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,680
Over the years, he's continued to be a 9-11 truther and generally the sort of person you

816
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,760
can count on to call just about anything a false flag.

817
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,420
I found a recent interview he did with the Global Research News Hour where he was discussing

818
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,920
how the storming of the Capitol on January 6th was a false flag.

819
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
Sure.

820
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,960
I know you expected to hear him doing some Alex shtick, but it's the exact opposite.

821
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,240
He was saying that the event was a false flag inspired or directed by Trump, which honestly

822
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,240
makes no sense.

823
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,240
No, I love it.

824
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,500
The term false flag comes from the idea of a ship attacking someone while flying a different

825
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,020
country's flag so that country gets blamed.

826
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,280
If Trump had a bunch of people storming the Capitol wearing Trump hats, that's not a false

827
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,280
flag.

828
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,960
It's just a straight up correct flag.

829
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,880
It does seem like that, unless you are implying that...

830
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:25,920
So he's saying that Trump was also in on the setup of his own supporters in order to discredit

831
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
his own ideology and support.

832
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,120
No, I don't think so, because he doesn't like Trump.

833
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Right.

834
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,560
But how could Trump be in on a false flag if that...

835
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,560
That's what I'm saying.

836
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,560
Semantically, it doesn't make sense.

837
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,640
No, of course not.

838
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,660
It's tough for me to say, but listening to that interview, it kind of feels like Zwicker

839
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,160
is like an Alex Jones, but with opposite politics.

840
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,680
He's making wildly unfounded assertions and claims that don't make sense, but he's also

841
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,400
staunchly opposed to Trump and recognizes that systemic racism exists.

842
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Sure.

843
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Sure.

844
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Hooray.

845
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Yeah.

846
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,280
His appearance here on Alex's show is a real moment that was possible in 2003, but probably

847
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
not much later than that.

848
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
Not these days, yeah.

849
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,840
They felt like they were in agreement as far as 9-11 conspiracies were concerned, but they

850
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,480
actually didn't agree on anything, because they're dreadfully far apart on the left-right

851
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,480
paradigm.

852
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,160
The left-right paradigm is fairly important in reality.

853
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,440
It seems to be.

854
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:22,840
If you judge everything based on something's position in terms of the right and left spectrum,

855
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,600
then maybe that's a little bit reductive itself.

856
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Yeah.

857
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,980
There are multiple axes upon which things can be judged, but pretending that that one

858
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,640
doesn't exist is a real limitation.

859
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,640
Fool's game.

860
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,640
Fool's game, yeah.

861
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,600
So Barry, oh boy, bam.

862
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,880
Barry says something in this interview that if it were present day, Alex would lose his

863
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,880
goddamn mind.

864
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,880
Okay, I want to hear it.

865
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:50,120
I happen, my hero happens to be a guy named Bertrand Russell, a dead British white philosopher,

866
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:56,140
and he had his own Ten Commandments, and his first commandment is never lie to yourself.

867
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,640
And I think that is the first and foremost commandment.

868
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,640
Don't lie to yourself.

869
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,120
Bertrand Russell, you got this left-wing globalism arm, and that's how they catch us all.

870
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,600
They got the phony right wing, they got the phony left wing, but that's it for another

871
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
discussion.

872
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,600
But that is another discussion.

873
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,040
So that's a huge tell for me that Alex doesn't believe his own bullshit.

874
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,400
Yeah, what a cheater.

875
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,880
According to Infowars lore, Bertrand Russell's writing outright admits that the globalists

876
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,880
plan to drug, sterilize, and kill off most of the population.

877
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,960
Russell is one of the old school globalists, according to Alex, who is instrumental in

878
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,000
coming up with and publicizing their evil plans.

879
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,160
I can understand wanting to have a polite interview, and I do think that there are times

880
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,700
just to agree to disagree about things.

881
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,700
For instance, if Barry thought that the 9-11 planes were remote controlled and Alex felt

882
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,520
they were piloted by the hijackers, they could go ahead and agree to disagree without having

883
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,560
a gigantic problem sitting on the table.

884
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,180
They may have a disagreement, but not a fundamental contradiction.

885
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,960
Not a deal breaker, if you will.

886
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Right.

887
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,240
Barry isn't just saying that he kinda likes Bertrand Russell.

888
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,920
He says Russell is his hero.

889
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,640
Barry is a guy who's worked for major papers, and he's taught college courses, so it stands

890
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,880
to reason that if he says that Bertrand Russell is his hero, he's probably read as much or

891
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,180
more of his writing than Alex has.

892
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,380
This is why, to me, this cannot be an agree-to-disagree moment.

893
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,840
In order for Alex to maintain all the narratives he has in play, he has to be agreeing to disagree

894
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,280
about his guest hero-worshipping a guy who he has read, discussing the plans to kill

895
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,720
off most of the human population.

896
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,640
There's no other reasonable conclusion to come to with the information provided, other

897
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,680
than that Barry is an enthusiastic fan of globalist conspiracies.

898
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,680
He loves him.

899
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,280
Alex should want to fight him.

900
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,000
It does seem like Alex is like, okay, okay, I get it.

901
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,320
We agree that 9-11 was an inside job.

902
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:44,800
So I'm going to gloss over the fact that your hero is the architect of killing everybody

903
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,400
so we can really get to the bottom of this 9-11 thing.

904
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,920
You might be missing the forest for the fallen trees, if you will.

905
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,920
Yeah.

906
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,680
Alex knows that there's nothing he can do, and he can't really fight him on this, because

907
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,440
he knows that Barry's read Bertrand Russell.

908
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
Yeah, he doesn't know anything about Bertrand Russell.

909
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,320
He's probably way more conversant on the subject than Alex is.

910
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,320
It'd be very embarrassing.

911
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,480
But Alex also knows that if he presses the issue, he risks revealing that his shit about

912
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,840
Russell is made up.

913
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,200
But he also knows that he can't just let a statement like that stand.

914
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,200
And thus, you end up with his middle ground, his spineless agreeing to disagree about one

915
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,480
of the top thinkers of the gigantic demonic conspiracy that Alex has made his entire career

916
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,560
about fighting happening.

917
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,560
It's ridiculous.

918
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,840
Yeah, yeah, because if you're saying that you're above the left-right paradigm, you

919
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:34,480
should be more unhappy with the plan instead of being like, well, there's globalists on

920
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,480
the left.

921
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,480
There's globalists on the right.

922
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
What are you going to do?

923
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,480
Hey, you win some, you lose some.

924
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,880
Stuck in the middle with Barry.

925
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
Yeah, exactly.

926
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,880
Yeah.

927
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,680
I think that, I mean, obviously this is me just sort of spitballing and coming up with

928
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,240
what I think is the most likely explanation for this.

929
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:53,920
And that is that I think that Alex's branding at this point is so dependent on him being

930
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,600
able to pretend this left-right paradigm thing is an illusion.

931
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,560
So for him to have someone who's ostensibly a 9-11 conspiracy theorist who's on the left,

932
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,840
or who has left tendencies and left politics, I don't think he wants to fight with that

933
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,840
guy.

934
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,320
I think it's really important for them to have some kind of an appearance of an alliance,

935
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,400
especially with the way that Alex has been building him up as this big, giant reporter

936
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,560
and super important person in Canada.

937
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:30,920
And so I think that that takes precedence over this guy's hero is one of your main villains.

938
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,680
He can't think that Barry isn't aware of Bertrand Russell.

939
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,120
He can't think that he hasn't read the same things that Alex has read.

940
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,120
Right.

941
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,700
Well, I mean, because Alex is taking advantage of that.

942
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,280
So the enemy of my enemy is not my friend.

943
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,240
And you can prove that because Alex is taking advantage of people thinking that the enemy

944
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,960
of my enemy is my friend.

945
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Yep.

946
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
It's fairly simple.

947
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,960
Open and shut case.

948
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Yeah.

949
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,960
Yeah.

950
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Yeah.

951
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,480
So they take some calls with Barry and this guy really, really creeped me out.

952
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,440
This guy is so creepy.

953
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,920
Let's talk to Bill in Alaska.

954
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,960
You're on the air with our guests.

955
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,960
Go ahead.

956
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Yes, sir.

957
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,960
Alex.

958
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,240
I just had to call in.

959
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:17,480
I got an enemy that hasn't been mentioned yet on today's show.

960
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,120
And the American people want to know why this is like this.

961
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,760
All they got to do is look in the mirror.

962
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:30,840
Jim Jones in the case in point, I don't believe he was as guilty as the people that followed

963
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
him.

964
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
Oh.

965
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:37,800
He couldn't have been a bad leader if he hadn't had followers.

966
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Okay.

967
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
Creep.

968
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,800
Wow.

969
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,800
Wow.

970
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,000
You're going to need to sell me a lot more on that one.

971
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
He does not.

972
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,840
You're going to need a lot more salesmanship on that take.

973
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,000
I will tell you delivery and content both creepy as hell.

974
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah.

975
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,400
That's no good.

976
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,120
I don't like a fucking bit player from Bonanza from Alaska telling me that Jim Jones was

977
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,120
a good leader.

978
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,880
Hey, in terms of death cults, man, in terms of like mass suicide cults, don't hate the

979
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,880
player, hate the game.

980
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,880
What is happening?

981
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,680
I don't know.

982
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,920
Here's the problem.

983
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,920
People follow Jim Jones.

984
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,640
If he wasn't such a good leader, then they wouldn't have followed him, so it's their

985
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,640
fault.

986
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
What?

987
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,640
Okay.

988
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,640
All right.

989
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,640
All right.

990
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,720
I'm the Alaskan cowboy here to tell you about death cults.

991
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:37,120
So the rest of the calls are kind of boring, but then the interview takes a turn hard south

992
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,040
when Barry starts talking about his new DVD that he's been selling.

993
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
Okay.

994
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,280
We're having an incredible...

995
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,280
It looks like we're moving toward 500 sales.

996
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,000
We have an equation here in Canada, it's called the 10% thing, because the population of Canada

997
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,280
is about one-tenth of the population of USA, so whatever happens to the states, we usually

998
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,040
divide it by 10 and figure that's normal.

999
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,040
Okay.

1000
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,400
For those that don't know, you're a national television host.

1001
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,040
You do this on your own and you write for newspapers and you just put together this

1002
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,200
video and believe me, it'll be a lot more than 500 if you get the word out, but...

1003
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,960
That is awful.

1004
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,440
Like Alex straight up laughs at him.

1005
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,080
He's a little 500.

1006
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,080
Yeah.

1007
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,240
Yeah, that was not a, I'm laughing with you.

1008
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,240
No.

1009
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,760
That was an, I'm laughing at you.

1010
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,720
That was an almost uncontrollable response to like...

1011
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,080
You fucking shit.

1012
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,080
Oh no.

1013
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,080
500.

1014
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,320
Get out of here.

1015
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,760
And there's also the problem of like, alright, even the rule of tens, he's a little 5,000?

1016
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,520
That's still not great for what Alex is presenting.

1017
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,520
No.

1018
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,560
And so what that does is it pierces the illusion that Alex has created about this guy throughout

1019
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,560
the...

1020
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,120
He's a national writer, he's been on TV, he's the biggest, most important journalist in

1021
00:53:53,120 --> 00:54:00,480
Canada and he can get upwards of 500, well upwards of 499 people to really get these.

1022
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Yeah.

1023
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,480
Yeah.

1024
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,560
And it really hurts the facade, and you can tell that there is a tonal change in Alex

1025
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,880
after this specific number has been given, because it's like, I can't, I can't...

1026
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,000
Now you're nothing to me.

1027
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,800
He can't pretend that he is Rush Limbaugh of Canada if he's only moving those many units.

1028
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,600
My audience just, I can't deny that math.

1029
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,340
And so it's, you know, it is what it is, and it doesn't go much longer.

1030
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:38,000
But Alex does finish out this episode with some fairly standard complaining.

1031
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,520
A number of people detained is on the rise in Russia to Stalinist levels, it says here

1032
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,080
in the Moscow Times.

1033
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:52,040
Just total slavery over there, but they don't call it communism, they call it crony capitalism.

1034
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,920
Same thing, command and control.

1035
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:00,120
Alex brings up the Putin bombings at least four times in this episode, like it's really

1036
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,160
excessive.

1037
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,080
And then he says this about the Russian state, I find this fascinating because in the present

1038
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,360
day when he's trying to defend Putin, Alex will say that Russia isn't a globalist country,

1039
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,440
it's a system of crony capitalism, it's a positive thing now.

1040
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,200
Or at least it's not as bad as globalism.

1041
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,320
Crony capitalism isn't a negative command and control system in the present day to Alex.

1042
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,040
I could speculate about what the reason for this change is, but honestly I would just

1043
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,040
be guessing.

1044
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,040
It's a glaring difference though.

1045
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,040
Yeah.

1046
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,040
It's pretty weird.

1047
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
Pretty weird.

1048
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,040
I don't know.

1049
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Yeah.

1050
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,880
So the 16th is Friday, and Alex is en route to Kansas City.

1051
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,880
Sure.

1052
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,200
He's going to speak at the local radio station, and he's not in studio.

1053
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,920
What's that, a six hour drive?

1054
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
From Austin?

1055
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,920
Yeah.

1056
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
I have no idea.

1057
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,480
And I think it's more.

1058
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,480
I think it's probably more.

1059
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,480
It's probably more.

1060
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
It's probably a nine hour drive.

1061
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,200
I don't know if he's actually driving, because I think he said he flew back.

1062
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,200
I don't know.

1063
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,200
I don't care.

1064
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Anyway.

1065
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,200
The point is he takes Friday off.

1066
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
I'm just here to distract you with weird questions.

1067
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Yeah.

1068
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,200
He takes Friday off, and then he comes back on Monday, because I don't think he has a

1069
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
Sunday show at this point.

1070
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:09,960
So he comes back on Monday, and here we go.

1071
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,600
Completely different subject.

1072
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:18,320
There are now mainstream news articles reporting on what we've been saying for years.

1073
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,280
The evidence of mind control triggers in the Matrix films.

1074
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,960
And here it is.

1075
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,720
We've been saying this for about three years.

1076
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,160
And here it is in the mainstream news.

1077
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:38,440
Did you know that Malvo, the supposed sniper who looks like a mind control victim, is out

1078
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,880
there now saying that that is certainly involved.

1079
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,640
Wonder how we knew about this three years ago.

1080
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:52,040
Well, there's just a lot of key indicators, and of course Harris and the others involved

1081
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,920
there in the Columbine situation were obsessed with the Matrix.

1082
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,920
And we'll be discussing it a little bit later.

1083
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,320
It could be a coincidence, but somehow I doubt it.

1084
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
Okay.

1085
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,920
Could be a coincidence, but I doubt it.

1086
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,680
This is nonsense.

1087
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,280
I gotta tell you.

1088
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,560
The first hour of this show is basically just Alex saying over and over again that the new

1089
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,920
Treasury Secretary has been bad-mouthing the dollar.

1090
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,200
And this is leading to it collapsing in relation to the Euro.

1091
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Fine.

1092
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:31,160
And this is the only thing that seemed actually even interesting in about the first hour.

1093
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,760
It is a desert.

1094
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
Wow.

1095
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Wow.

1096
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,480
19th was a tough walk.

1097
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,480
It's so great whenever people are like, oh, the Matrix is mind control.

1098
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,000
And then you're like, okay, well, 20 years ago the Manchurian Candidate was telling us

1099
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,240
that the mind control is happening, and then 20 years before that, and you're like, I just

1100
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,440
don't care what you think about movies.

1101
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,520
I just don't care.

1102
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,540
And look, I would say that probably the Matrix has some ideas that are explored, maybe not

1103
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,800
as eloquently as they could have been, and maybe that confuses some people.

1104
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:12,880
Further, it has an aesthetic that a lot of people adopt, and maybe you could trace those

1105
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,560
things to some of these shooters.

1106
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,560
I don't know.

1107
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:22,320
I also think that, generally speaking, when you have somebody, like, there are a couple

1108
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,240
stories that Alex brings up, and it's people who shot somebody and then said they were

1109
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,360
trying to flee the Matrix in order to get an insanity plea.

1110
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,360
I'm not positive necessarily how these cases shook out, and how much of that was just a

1111
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,960
defense argument.

1112
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,960
Right.

1113
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Do you know what I'm saying?

1114
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,960
Yeah.

1115
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,240
Seems like something that could have been a popular defense.

1116
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,400
I'll toss that out.

1117
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,800
What if I either plead guilty, because everybody saw me do it, or I'm going to shoot my shot.

1118
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,720
You know, your shot, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, though, Dan.

1119
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
It's true.

1120
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,720
It's true.

1121
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,720
Gretzky.

1122
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,720
That's what everybody else, that's what they're saying.

1123
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,720
Anyway.

1124
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,720
Gretzky's dad.

1125
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,720
Dad Gretzky?

1126
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,720
So, yeah.

1127
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:11,480
I was excited, at least, to hear about Alex's thoughts about the Matrix.

1128
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Sure.

1129
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,480
He doesn't get into them.

1130
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,840
Of course not.

1131
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
It's a real desert.

1132
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
I was walking around-

1133
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,400
Wait, this is 2003, so Reloaded hadn't even come out yet, right?

1134
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
It's about to.

1135
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
It's about to.

1136
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
I think it just came out.

1137
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
It just came out.

1138
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
That's why he's-

1139
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,440
Alex does say, like, I'm going to try and go see the Matrix tonight.

1140
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,440
Sure, sure.

1141
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,680
So it is out in theaters, but, yeah, Reloaded didn't just come out.

1142
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,320
And actually, I was going back through it, because I was looking over the plots of those

1143
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,680
movies and I was like, I'm not sure I saw the third one.

1144
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,000
This plot seems foreign to me.

1145
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,560
Oh, look, you could watch it again and you'd be like, I don't think this is- and then you

1146
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,720
would forget it tomorrow.

1147
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,040
I definitely saw the second one, because I remember The Architect.

1148
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,040
Yeah.

1149
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
Like, I remember that stuff.

1150
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
But I-

1152
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,680
Vocabulary instead of writing?

1153
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,680
Hmm.

1154
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,760
I- sure I saw the third one, because I know if I saw the first two, I would want to finish

1155
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,760
it.

1156
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,320
Oh, the third one, you know, it's Jesus and then you move on.

1157
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,960
But I don't- I was reading the plot, I'm like, I don't remember that.

1158
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,120
Yeah, no, I think- okay, let me see if I can-

1159
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:15,680
I think I've seen the final fight scene, like, just in a YouTube video or something like

1160
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,560
that, but I don't think I've- I saw the plot, I'm like, I don't remember that.

1161
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,520
How much do you remember from the plot that you read?

1162
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,120
I'm going to see if I can't off the dome the third Matrix, alright?

1163
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,360
I remember broad strokes of it.

1164
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,360
Okay.

1165
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,360
So you can give it a try.

1166
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,360
Alright, here we go.

1167
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:36,040
It opens up, Neo had just passed out, because in the second one he turns out he can use

1168
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,080
electric powers in the real world.

1169
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,080
Right, right, right.

1170
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,600
They wake up and he's actually in the Matrix, even though he's not plugged into the Matrix.

1171
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,240
Because he's in the sickbay or whatever.

1172
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Exactly.

1173
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1174
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,380
So then, eventually he wakes up and blah blah blah, they meet in the Matrix, they come out,

1175
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,760
he and what's-her-face, they both go on Trinity, they both go on a suicide mission into the

1176
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,480
evil place, right?

1177
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,940
They fly up over into the sky and they're like, ah!

1178
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:06,120
In the meantime, at Zion, the final attack is going on and all the fucking, oh no, and

1179
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,600
there's all these blah blah blah blah blah, and that goes on for a while.

1180
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,640
From what I understand, so far, so good.

1181
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,480
Yeah, there's a guy and he's like po cho cho cho cho, and they got these weird mech suits

1182
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,020
and then there's some heroic action because it's a war and it's a movie and you gotta

1183
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,020
do that.

1184
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:26,800
And then Neo and Trinity, they make it through, Neo and the AI are both like, hey man, this

1185
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,080
Agent Smith dude is fucking out of control, right?

1186
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:36,720
So the AI plugs the Neo into the AI and they're like, you better solve this fucking problem,

1187
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,720
right?

1188
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:47,520
So he winds up being absorbed by Agent Orange Smith after a massive, useless, pointless

1189
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,560
fight, and then the AI is like blowing them all up and they start over and everybody finally

1190
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,200
breaks the cycle and everything's cool for a while at least.

1191
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,080
I think that's basically it.

1192
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,080
Yeah.

1193
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,080
I'm out of breath.

1194
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,440
The part that when I was reading over the plot, I was like, I don't remember this at

1195
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,440
all.

1196
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,440
What's that?

1197
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,120
Was Neo negotiating with the robots.

1198
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,200
Oh, you don't remember?

1199
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
That's what I'm talking about.

1200
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Yeah.

1201
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,360
And the robot's face comes out and it's all like, and the robot's mad.

1202
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,360
No, I don't remember that.

1203
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,360
It was terrible.

1204
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,360
I don't remember that at all.

1205
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,360
Yeah.

1206
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,360
It was weird.

1207
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:24,080
The robot AI did a lot of roaring, which seems like a weird thing for the AI to be

1208
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
into.

1209
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,320
No, because the AI would know what would intimidate a human.

1210
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,960
Yeah, but it seems like, I don't know.

1211
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,360
He doesn't even have eyes anymore.

1212
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,920
So why would you?

1213
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:39,720
He can see.

1214
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,120
I'm excited for the fourth one.

1215
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,120
That's all I'm saying.

1216
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,120
There's a fourth one?

1217
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
It's coming.

1218
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,120
That's right.

1219
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,120
I remember hearing that.

1220
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,120
Yeah.

1221
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,760
I'm going to watch the third one and see if I've seen it because that seemed like, I can't

1222
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,080
believe that was the plot.

1223
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,080
Oh, it's bad.

1224
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,080
I don't know.

1225
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,080
It's real bad.

1226
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,880
I don't know if it sounded bad on paper.

1227
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:58,880
Like it sounds bad.

1228
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,880
In execution?

1229
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,880
It does.

1230
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,880
In execution?

1231
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,880
It's bad.

1232
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,840
I do wonder if the, like, I don't, I don't think, I mean, I'll defend slightly reloaded.

1233
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,400
Like I think that's not as bad as maybe some people have said.

1234
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,600
I mean, there are some fun things.

1235
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,720
The twins were cool.

1236
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,720
Sure.

1237
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,880
They, they turned invisible for a while and then they showed up.

1238
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,880
That was fun.

1239
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,880
Yeah.

1240
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,120
I got to watch that third one.

1241
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,160
We should do that as like a live stream.

1242
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,160
As a live stream?

1243
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,160
Yeah, I'll do that.

1244
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,220
I'll watch the Matrix Revelations video.

1245
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,200
See if I actually saw it when I was younger.

1246
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
I'm in.

1247
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,800
Anyway, Alex doesn't get into talking about this much, but he does have some other news

1248
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:42,760
that's fresh from the Bureau desk that's in his imagination.

1249
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,760
Okay.

1250
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,240
Another saying, forget about ever capturing Saddam.

1251
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,960
These are all staged events.

1252
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,400
Saddam worked for the CIA starting in 1958.

1253
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,720
Looks like they gave him the amnesty deal and, uh, during the campaign, he had requested

1254
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,200
it and been refused it and told that if he tried to flee, he would be arrested or assassinated

1255
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:08,660
and looks like in the midst of the war over there, uh, they cut a deal and all resistance

1256
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,000
melted away.

1257
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,240
So Alex is reporting, uh, basically that, uh, you know, Saddam got an amnesty deal.

1258
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,240
Yeah.

1259
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,240
Yeah.

1260
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,240
Uh huh.

1261
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,800
Oh, I don't know who negotiated that one.

1262
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,800
I think they left a few people out of the negotiations if he got an amnesty deal.

1263
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,920
I think Alex negotiated this with himself.

1264
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,560
I think that might've been the case.

1265
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,560
So here on the 19th, we've got another familiar theme.

1266
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:38,780
Vladimir Putin was caught in 99 attacking his own soft targets.

1267
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,220
That is apartment buildings.

1268
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,480
Rebuildings were blown up.

1269
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,280
They said the Chechny and the Chechny and screamed, why would we do that and bring on

1270
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
an attack?

1271
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,880
No, the Russian government's doing it.

1272
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,320
And then Moscow police, not knowing what the other hand was doing, the left hand, not knowing

1273
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,600
what the right hand was doing, caught members of the FSB, the modern KGB that Putin was

1274
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:07,520
heading up for Boris Yeltsin, caught them in the building, planting hexagon explosives.

1275
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,840
They got the explosives, arrested them, and then they were raided by, the police station

1276
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:20,760
was raided in Moscow by paramilitary forces from the KGB slash FSB GRU.

1277
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,760
So here's the thing.

1278
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,040
When Alex talks about these ideas that he has about Putin, he is not talking about just

1279
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,120
like, I have a vague sense that that guy's bad.

1280
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,120
No, no, no, no.

1281
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:35,240
He's talking about things that are concrete events that he knows to be true.

1282
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:40,440
Now, for him to change his position on this, he needs to show his work.

1283
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,880
He needs to explain why is that no longer true?

1284
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
Right, right.

1285
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,280
Were you wrong here or did these events, do you have a new explanation for all of this?

1286
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,280
Sure, yeah.

1287
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,280
And he doesn't ever do that.

1288
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,280
He just sort of switches.

1289
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:59,140
And it's nuts to me to go back and listen to this and see just how consistently it is

1290
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,800
just like, fucking Putin, he's false flagging around.

1291
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:10,640
Yeah, it would be ironic if what seems to be one of the main pillars of his everything

1292
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:17,120
is a false flag thing, because these are documented events where you're like, yeah, Putin did

1293
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,820
that shit.

1294
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:27,360
So his main evidence that you can follow up on is now not at all mentioned and wiped away,

1295
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,700
despite the fact that he still claims that everything is a false flag.

1296
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,700
Just not that.

1297
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,700
That's strange.

1298
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:38,440
It would be ironic if you weren't aware that he's just a psycho, that none of this matters,

1299
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,880
and he's going to use whatever he feels like using however he feels like using it.

1300
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,480
So it's completely within his character.

1301
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:50,200
And this also seems a bit more like what you would expect from somebody who's like this

1302
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:55,960
anti-communist crusader type, you know, like Russia and China are evil, as opposed to like,

1303
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,880
ah, China's evil, but Russia's actually really cool.

1304
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,280
Yeah, Russia's pretty sweet.

1305
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,280
Yeah, I don't know, it's, I want to learn more about this.

1306
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,680
I like how they keep those women from talking in churches, it makes me feel good.

1307
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:13,080
I want to learn more about this, but I don't really know much more than Alex will not stop

1308
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:17,320
talking about Putin blowing up the apartment buildings in 2003.

1309
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:22,880
There's not really a lot more, like sort of detail to it, but I'm keeping my eyes open

1310
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,400
and I'll let you know if anything comes up.

1311
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,440
In a very short, has he already been on RT a bunch, or is this, is like in a very short

1312
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,680
period of time he will go on RT a bunch?

1313
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,480
I'm not sure when he started appearing on that, I know he does after this.

1314
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1315
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,480
So I would imagine after.

1316
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,480
I doubt he hasn't been on yet.

1317
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,680
I doubt they're like, eh, let's see what Alex has to say today.

1318
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,120
I would guess not.

1319
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,360
So Alex is another guest at this point, it's Dennis Cuddy, he's another conspiracy New

1320
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,520
World Order guy.

1321
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,080
I love his kids' music.

1322
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,960
Basically, Kid Cuddy?

1323
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,960
I like his wife, Dr. Cuddy, from House of Beads.

1324
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,960
There we go.

1325
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,960
There we go.

1326
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,960
Now you're playing the game.

1327
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:09,040
So he's on for like the rest of the show and it's just rambling about basic ass New World

1328
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,260
Order conspiracy talking points.

1329
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,560
It's a lot of the same stuff we covered in the Endgame documentary and it bored the hell

1330
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,560
out of me.

1331
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,840
That said, it's a far cry from the content that Alex produces these days.

1332
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:24,600
This is at very least a show that's striving to be about an alleged conspiracy.

1333
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,000
It goes off track pretty regularly, it provides horrible information, and it ignores stories

1334
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,280
in favor of headlines, but huge chunks of time are devoted to talking about a vague

1335
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:38,140
unsourced accusation about like the Bilderberg Group and Bohemian Grove.

1336
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:42,200
So we're not going to talk too much about this interview, but there is one very important

1337
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,200
moment.

1338
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,200
Mic down for this.

1339
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:50,920
They used facilitators through various Delphi techniques to do this, and Edward Bernays,

1340
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:56,120
who was hired by William Paley in 1928 as his chief advisor with CBS, wrote a book called

1341
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Propaganda.

1342
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,720
And in that book he said, we're like an invisible government, we know how to manipulate you,

1343
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:08,120
and at the end he says, sort of like Ross Perot, he says, we need a businessman politician

1344
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,680
type to say, I must lead the people, am I not their servant?

1345
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:19,040
Here's what you say you want, and it's really facilitated.

1346
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,040
Please continue.

1347
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,040
Alex is eating.

1348
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,200
Alex is eating!

1349
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,400
I'd not heard that in 2003.

1350
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,400
Please continue.

1351
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,400
Yeah.

1352
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,040
So Alex is clearly eating there, but also that also is funny.

1353
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,920
Love your stuff, keep growing, keep growing.

1354
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,240
Also the content of that is pretty funny.

1355
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:41,120
Yeah, that he's, it's kind of funny that I already brought up advertising and psychology

1356
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,960
and then 20 minutes later he's like, Edward Bernays!

1357
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,040
And also the businessman leader.

1358
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,680
Yeah, that one is hard to look away from.

1359
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,680
Yeah.

1360
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,400
Alex should listen to some of his old episodes, I think he would be horrified.

1361
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:01,280
So a caller calls in, he and Cuddy take calls, and one of the things that I noticed actually

1362
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:07,080
when I was listening to this is like, Cuddy is old school, like with his New World Order

1363
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,080
stuff.

1364
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:13,120
He has the, all the talking points that you'd expect to hear on old time New World Order

1365
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,560
conspiracy shows, and I was like, this guy, I bet he knows Bill Cooper.

1366
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,360
And so I was looking through the Hour of the Time archives, and he's been on, like back

1367
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:26,040
in 96 he was on Hour of the Time, like yep, that checks out.

1368
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Wow.

1369
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,040
Yeah.

1370
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,040
I wonder what he does for a day job.

1371
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,120
I think he writes books, probably goes on speaking things, I don't know.

1372
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,680
How do you get that scam?

1373
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:40,400
Anyway, there's a caller who calls in, and Alex has reported that Saddam Hussein has

1374
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,400
got a plea deal.

1375
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,400
Sure.

1376
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:48,960
And this caller says that one of our old friends, Joel Skousen, is reporting on something a

1377
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,880
little bit different.

1378
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:57,600
Skoulnik is reported by Joel Skousen as saying that Saddam Hussein has been moved and is

1379
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,080
located now in the side of the United States.

1380
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:09,280
Well, the evidence from the evidence, John, the evidence shows that he was probably taken

1381
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
down to Russia.

1382
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,800
They probably gave him the amnesty deal in the middle of the fight, they can still try

1383
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,960
a double though, so look out.

1384
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,400
So this is the first reference I've had to someone bringing up Skousen, which is interesting,

1385
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:26,620
that it's taken, you know, we're 19 days into the month of, you know, where we begin in

1386
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:31,680
2003, and you know, such a familiar face in other periods of time, and this is the first

1387
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,760
reference to him.

1388
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:39,080
And he thinks that Saddam's in the United States, Alex says nah nah nah nah nah, Russia.

1389
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,480
So they're both wrong.

1390
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:46,560
Oh man, these guys, these guys, and also that ending of just leaving it open for, now there

1391
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,520
could also be a double cross, you never know, anything could be true.

1392
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,900
Right now the evidence of which I have none is all pointing towards this place that I

1393
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,520
just made up, so there we go.

1394
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:03,680
So you have, you have Cuddy, who's been on in the month of May 2003 already, and you

1395
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,920
also had Colonel Craig Roberts, who was on, who's been on before, so you have some familiar

1396
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:15,580
faces starting to, like, appear to be there, but none of the familiar faces that we know.

1397
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:20,200
You know, I haven't seen any mention of Steve Pechenik, I haven't heard anything about Joel

1398
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:25,760
Skousen, well I guess we just got some Skousen, but Paul Craig Roberts, you know, couple of

1399
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,940
other folks who were like, Webster Tarpley, these kinds, Jerome Corsi, these folks are

1400
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:38,600
not figures in Alex's world at this point, or at least have not made themselves known.

1401
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:44,040
There's another person who also has not made himself known yet, and I found it very confusing

1402
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,720
that this is the first mention I've seen of him.

1403
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,800
Yes, very good show today, my question's a little bit off topic, but I was wondering

1404
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,120
if either one of you happen to know what might have happened to Bob Chapman, the gold expert?

1405
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,440
No, I don't.

1406
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,960
No, I don't know.

1407
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,960
What?

1408
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,560
We've had Bob on as a guest, but he's still writing his newsletters, basically he's been

1409
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,640
criticizing the bankers and they're a little bit angry with him, but go ahead.

1410
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,400
Okay, that was basically my question.

1411
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,540
So I find it very curious that Alex takes this tone when this caller brings up Bob

1412
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,540
Chapman.

1413
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:17,120
For those who haven't heard the episodes covering other periods of time, Bob Chapman is one

1414
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:22,160
of Alex's most regular guests for a stretch of years leading up to his death in 2012.

1415
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:26,320
He's an alleged precious metals expert who Alex used as a scene partner when doing extended

1416
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:31,040
commercials for Midas Resources, the gold sales company that syndicated Alex's show.

1417
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,160
Also, Bob claims to have been invited to a screening of a film of Ronald Reagan getting

1418
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,160
pegged.

1419
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,160
True.

1420
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,520
For years, Bob was on Alex's show every Friday.

1421
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,640
Outside of people who host the fourth hour, it's tough for me to think of anyone else

1422
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,920
who had what amounts to basically a standing engagement on Alex's schedule.

1423
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,120
To hear Alex saying he doesn't know what's up with him and sounding like he doesn't want

1424
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,820
to talk about it in 2003 is really weird.

1425
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:58,640
Things get even weirder when you consult issues of his newsletter, The International Forecaster,

1426
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,480
from back in 2003.

1427
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:06,400
They're not all available online, but there are two that I could find from 2003, January

1428
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,000
2003, and even back then, Bob clearly had a working relationship with Midas Resources.

1429
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,680
Quote, special offer, you may also order it, and it's in reference to the book The Beast

1430
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:21,080
from Jekyll Island, by calling Midas Resources Incorporated.

1431
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:25,640
Midas Resources will give you a silver dollar from the early 1900s, a $12 value, just for

1432
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:29,920
purchasing the book at its normal price of $19.95.

1433
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:35,680
It seems clear to me that this business relationship with Midas is intact at this point, even prior

1434
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,000
to this episode that we're listening to now, so whatever weird energy Alex is giving off,

1435
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,360
it seems like it's probably personal.

1436
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,080
I read over Bob's newsletters to see if I could find any reasons that Alex might not

1437
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,220
want to associate with him at this point.

1438
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,100
I'm not sure if I see anything.

1439
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,600
In one of his January issues, he predicts an imminent return of the gold standard in

1440
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,400
the United States because of the war in the Middle East.

1441
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,600
What a surprise that he would want or predict that.

1442
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,600
Yeah.

1443
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,840
The war is going to put pressure on economies, you know, that's fairly standard kind of stuff,

1444
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,560
you know, you could see Alex not disagreeing with that.

1445
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,040
He does say, quote, the Muslims believe they can destroy capitalism by forcing gold to

1446
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,520
the forefront, and we agree that this could and probably will be successful.

1447
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,520
Which is a little weird, but it does not seem like it's outside of Alex's wheelhouse.

1448
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,560
It doesn't seem like you'd burn a bridge over that.

1449
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,760
What a wild thing to think slash even wilder to say.

1450
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,760
Uh-huh.

1451
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,600
Some of the next issues that I could find were from July 2003, and honestly, it just

1452
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,200
kind of sounds like a transcript of something Alex might say at some point in his life.

1453
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,160
Quote, all we can say is buy gold and silver coins and shares as fast as possible.

1454
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,080
The ship is sinking and there's no sense in drowning with the rest of the idiots.

1455
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,140
Incidentally, exercise your constitutional rights and legally arm yourself and your families

1456
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,140
to the teeth.

1457
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,140
Whoa.

1458
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:51,140
This isn't going to be nice.

1459
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,740
Jesus Christ, I just want to buy some gold, man.

1460
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:57,980
The only thing I can find in there that I could see Alex being pissed off about is that

1461
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:03,120
Bob advises his readers to buy gold and silver, but if they have to invest in currency that

1462
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,760
they are going to hide, they should favor the euro or Swiss franc to the US dollar.

1463
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,040
I could see Alex thinking this was bad-mouthing the dollar like the treasury secretary was.

1464
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,660
Yeah, that would make sense.

1465
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:18,340
I don't know, but that's the only thing that stuck out to me as like, eh, Alex would not

1466
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,340
like that.

1467
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,920
You should always favor the dollar if you're going to favor currencies, especially not

1468
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,920
the fucking euro.

1469
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,320
It does seem that when they say, like, what happened to Bob, what they're suggesting is

1470
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:34,300
like Bob went off the rails somewhere and saying that the dollar isn't the single greatest

1471
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,340
thing in the world is probably, that's probably enough.

1472
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,700
All fiat currencies are evil, but if there must be one, you have to protect the world

1473
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,620
reserve currency status of the dollar.

1474
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,620
Right, right, right, right.

1475
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,620
I don't know.

1476
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:50,180
I could see that being, and I did also get that sense that like something had happened.

1477
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:52,260
There was some problem.

1478
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:56,580
I can't get any sense of like what that's in reference to, but it could be that.

1479
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:01,820
Yeah, because Bob can't get out of pocket, you know, like Bob is expendable.

1480
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,820
Maybe.

1481
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,820
Yeah.

1482
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,820
Maybe not.

1483
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,820
He saw a video of Reagan.

1484
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:07,820
That's fair.

1485
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:11,940
Incidentally, Bob Chapman's newsletter is definitely, without a doubt, written by Bob

1486
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:12,940
Chapman.

1487
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,660
You know, there's a lot of these folks who have these newsletters that are like, I don't

1488
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:19,660
know, someone just writes it, my name's on it, like Ron Paul.

1489
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,220
Bob cannot claim that.

1490
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,940
He calls people who don't take his financial advice idiots, and he's basically just fucking

1491
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:30,700
with his readers, quote, don't forget, as interest rates go back up to say 7 or 8 percent,

1492
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:35,480
you will lose money on the value of bonds unless you buy at par and hold to maturity.

1493
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,880
Most of you may be dead by then.

1494
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,100
We don't have all the answers, but this is the way we see it.

1495
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,760
We've been making these kinds of decisions for 43 years, so we guess this qualifies us

1496
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,540
to voice our opinion.

1497
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,020
It's outrageous stuff.

1498
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,480
Considering this is like, it's supposed to be a financial advice newsletter, not a, you're

1499
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,480
all gonna die.

1500
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,340
Put a hundred dollars in gold and die, idiot.

1501
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,340
Yeah.

1502
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,860
Whatever, it's life or death.

1503
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,900
Bury some Swiss francs and get a gun.

1504
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,140
Yeah, what are you doing?

1505
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,180
Why is this good financial advice?

1506
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,300
Yeah, I have no idea what happened to the two of them, but it's an open question that

1507
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,100
I'm excited to learn more about as we proceed.

1508
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,380
But we see him later on.

1509
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,380
Yeah, I know.

1510
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,580
We see him in 2009 at least, you know?

1511
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,580
No, definitely.

1512
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:16,580
Yeah.

1513
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:20,300
So I know that there is some sort of a coming back together, and I'm gonna guarantee that

1514
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,660
at no point do they discuss what their differences were on there and hash it out.

1515
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,660
No, absolutely not.

1516
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,660
No, no, no, no.

1517
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,420
But I wonder if I'll be able to learn more, like if another caller calls in and brings

1518
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:32,540
up specifics or something, I'm gonna keep my eye open on this one.

1519
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:36,700
So one of the other things that I'm tracking very closely, trying to understand, is whether

1520
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,380
or not Alex Jones believes he's fighting the literal devil in 2003.

1521
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:41,380
True.

1522
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,860
We know in the present day he believes that the devil is the head of the globalist conspiracy.

1523
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:50,420
That he's speaking to him extra-dimensionally or being possessed by demons.

1524
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:51,420
True.

1525
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,020
I'm not entirely sure if that is the case in 2003.

1526
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:59,260
So every time there's some kind of an indication of something, I like to bring it to the forefront.

1527
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:04,880
And I don't know if this says anything about Alex, but Cuddy definitely believes in literal

1528
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,880
biblical prophecy.

1529
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:06,880
Hey, alright!

1530
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,320
New York is defined in the federal regulations as the United Nations.

1531
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,700
And when Rudolph Giuliani stated on C-PAN that we're the capital of the world, yeah,

1532
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,700
New York City was the capital of the world, end quote, he was correct.

1533
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:25,140
And that is found at CFR chapter 111.

1534
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,900
Dr. Cuddy, any comments to what he's saying?

1535
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:34,420
Well, even taking that one step further, in terms of just biblical end times, you know

1536
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:38,940
Revelation 18 and what happens there, and it has to be a port city, and everybody says

1537
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,420
New York, and everybody says, well, that was the World Trade Center.

1538
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:48,820
I don't think so, because when you get around verse 22, remember it says, and a candle would

1539
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:53,460
be seen no more, and that would be symbolic of the Statue of Liberty.

1540
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,460
Okay.

1541
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:57,180
So something may be coming up.

1542
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:59,860
Thank you very much.

1543
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,580
Amazing information.

1544
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:09,020
So Alex doesn't necessarily jump in with him in the, let's decode, end times.

1545
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,420
Revelation, yeah.

1546
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:15,540
But he's also like, oh, that's amazing information, that, you know, like, he's encouraging of

1547
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:19,340
it in the guest, but he's not engaging in it himself.

1548
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,900
I find that interesting.

1549
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,900
Yeah.

1550
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:26,800
It does seem like he's, I mean, from what we've seen, he's allowed other people.

1551
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
He's platforming a hell of a lot of it.

1552
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,900
He's platformed a lot of biblical talk, but he's always been reticent to jump in on his

1553
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:39,120
own and really give people a full throated, hell yeah, Revelations 18 is how we're going

1554
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,820
to get through this, you know.

1555
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,840
He does seem to be walking that line a little bit.

1556
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:51,300
So Cuddy takes off after a very long interview, and Alex gets down to business.

1557
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,540
I'm going to go see the film Matrix.

1558
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:01,540
It's got its new age message, the paper here in Austin, and the entertainment pages said

1559
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,180
it's a new religion in America.

1560
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:07,500
Well, it's not new, it's Hindu or slash Buddhism or whatever, but.

1561
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:13,460
So you haven't seen the movie yet, oh my god, but it's Hindu slash Buddhism or whatever.

1562
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,900
But also, maybe, it's designed to make people kill.

1563
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:22,820
I've got a London Guardian story about it, Times of London article, US killers blame

1564
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:28,740
Matrix after random shootings, Matrix firms, films blamed for series of murders by obsessed

1565
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:32,720
fans.

1566
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:37,780
There are films that use triggers to go out there, but the government doesn't even have

1567
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,780
to brainwash you now in person.

1568
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:45,540
Certain susceptible minds who are programming through the culture with your big TV heads

1569
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:46,740
can be activated.

1570
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,740
I'm not saying the Matrix does that.

1571
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,200
We know they have these technologies.

1572
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,340
We know there's key indicators in it.

1573
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,780
We know that some of the things that Chief Moose said, you know, the duck is in the noose

1574
01:21:56,780 --> 01:22:03,140
or whatever is a known trigger, and then Malvo and the other guys show up, the Hamid show

1575
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,140
up.

1576
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:08,780
It goes on and on, but I don't like to speculate, but I'll tell you what I've seen if I get

1577
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,500
a chance to see it tonight.

1578
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,500
I don't like to speculate.

1579
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,500
Slap!

1580
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,500
Slap!

1581
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,500
All I'm doing is-

1582
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,500
Slap, sir!

1583
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,940
I speculate wildly, but man, I don't like it.

1584
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:21,460
I pull out my white glove.

1585
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:27,140
Don't be like me saying, I don't like to check into things Alex says, but I seem to do it

1586
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,140
a lot.

1587
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,620
Frankly, I'm honestly a very quiet person.

1588
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:33,060
I think people have recognized that for a long time.

1589
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:34,060
I don't like to be loud.

1590
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,060
It's your natural tendencies.

1591
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:36,060
I don't like to be loud.

1592
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:41,500
So, on this 19th, this May 19th episode, we have one last clip, and this is literally

1593
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:48,120
the only mention of the Ba'ath Party that I heard at all, and I should say that we are

1594
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:54,780
now past the point where the policy of de-Ba'athification has been openly announced, and there are people

1595
01:22:54,780 --> 01:23:00,940
who are coming out and speaking about getting rid of all party members within government

1596
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:05,020
and such, and here's Alex's take on that.

1597
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,500
When there's more tyranny than ever, they're putting the Ba'ath Party back into control

1598
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,500
while giving speeches that they aren't.

1599
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,500
Ooh, nice.

1600
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,500
It's an incredible line.

1601
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:13,500
Well done.

1602
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,500
So there we go.

1603
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,500
Way to sidestep that one.

1604
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,260
Just walk outside.

1605
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,420
Oh, that train is coming to hit me.

1606
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,420
Excuse me.

1607
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,420
Step aside.

1608
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,420
Don't care.

1609
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:24,420
Whee!

1610
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,420
Yeah.

1611
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:26,420
Jesus.

1612
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,780
This isn't going to work for long.

1613
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:33,180
I guess it's fine now on the 19th.

1614
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,100
Yeah, for like a day.

1615
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:41,860
It buys you some time, but this is not going to be the way that...

1616
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,260
This isn't going to pass the smell test for very long.

1617
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,260
No.

1618
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,260
No.

1619
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,260
I think we'll probably get...

1620
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:53,300
As thousands of people are removed from their posts, it's going to be tougher to be like,

1621
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,220
ah, they're still in there.

1622
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:56,220
Yeah.

1623
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:04,180
I think we're going to get more in-depth into this stuff in the coming days of 2003, because

1624
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:08,700
I think that Alex is going to have to try and wiggle a bit, and I'm interested to see

1625
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,100
how that plays out.

1626
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:15,820
There's actually a couple of really compelling threads that I'm starting to see in 2003 that

1627
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:17,880
I really want to learn more about.

1628
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,840
One is the anti-Putin stuff.

1629
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,240
Two is the de-bathification.

1630
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:25,100
Three is Alex and Bob Chapman.

1631
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,100
Right.

1632
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,420
Well, I mean, and you can just expand that out too, like side characters.

1633
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:31,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1634
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:33,180
What's our legion of doom here?

1635
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:37,980
Well, it's like, I don't know, you're playing a sequel to a video game or a prequel, and

1636
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:42,540
the main character's the same, but maybe they're in a different place, and so you have a different

1637
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,540
NPC character.

1638
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,540
Sure, sure.

1639
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:45,540
And different side characters.

1640
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,540
It's like the cube.

1641
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,540
Yeah.

1642
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:52,620
Yeah, and I'm wondering where the old friends are and who these new people are, and so,

1643
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:59,700
you know, I enjoy, I'm enjoying this a bit more, and I want to continue it, and I want

1644
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:00,700
to learn more.

1645
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:04,540
Do you mean you're enjoying learning and discovering new things like you always have, and now that

1646
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:10,980
you're in the present where we are rarely learning anything and often discovering the

1647
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:14,900
same things daily, this is new and exciting for you?

1648
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,900
Yeah, kind of.

1649
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,900
Oh, that sounds right.

1650
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,820
There's at least interesting context and things to discuss, whereas I think in the present

1651
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:25,940
day most episodes that I do end up could just be like, he didn't read this, he doesn't know.

1652
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,860
Dumb, dumb.

1653
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:32,040
So we get to the 20th, and Alex, I was hoping, had seen The Matrix, because you know I love

1654
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,040
a movie review.

1655
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,060
He said he was going to see it on the 19th.

1656
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,620
He did not go see The Matrix.

1657
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,620
What?

1658
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,620
What, did he get busy?

1659
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:39,620
Yeah, probably.

1660
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,420
So, but he's going to talk about it a little more.

1661
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:42,420
Okay.

1662
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,140
Also, Matrix Maker rejects crime links.

1663
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,700
We're not saying crime links, and I'm not saying crime links.

1664
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:51,860
Some have said mind control trigger links.

1665
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:52,860
Duh!

1666
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:55,240
Bunch of idiots.

1667
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,220
This is Alex correcting the record.

1668
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:01,060
Call him David Brock, because he is correcting the fucking record.

1669
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:04,660
I'm not going to let people slander me in public.

1670
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,660
Right, crime links, pshaw.

1671
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:11,140
How silly, how silly for someone to think that The Matrix has crime links.

1672
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,140
I would never.

1673
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,140
They control minds.

1674
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,140
Duh.

1675
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,580
There's a mind control trigger link.

1676
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:16,580
Duh.

1677
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,580
Right.

1678
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:18,580
Jesus.

1679
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:19,580
Now the trigger makes you commit crime.

1680
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,940
These plebes, I'm telling you, stay out of my business.

1681
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,820
Anyway, Alex has a guest on.

1682
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:25,820
Sure.

1683
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:29,460
And this is a wild guest for Alex to have on for a number of reasons.

1684
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,340
This could never have happened in any other period of time.

1685
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,340
Okay.

1686
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:38,620
And it doesn't go super well, but this guy named Noah Schackman, who has an article in

1687
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:44,340
Wired that had just come out about a DARPA program, we'll talk about it a little bit

1688
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:50,460
more, but Alex distorts some of the ideas around surveillance and such in order to introduce

1689
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,460
Noah.

1690
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:54,660
It's a new level of corruption, we're all prisoners, the kids are thumb scanning to

1691
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:58,500
get school lunches in thousands of school districts, the thumb scanners are going in

1692
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:03,660
the banks, going in the grocery stores, going in everywhere.

1693
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,180
It's total.

1694
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:10,380
It's 180 degrees from what America's supposed to be, and they say it's to stop terror while

1695
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:14,700
the borders are wide open and while the feds are starting to accept in 800 plus cities

1696
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:18,780
the fake IDs of illegals from Poland to Mexico.

1697
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:23,460
And Noah Schackman is on the air with us.

1698
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,740
Noah, thanks for coming on the show today, sir.

1699
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:27,260
Thanks for having me.

1700
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:30,280
This is, there's no way to really understate this.

1701
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:35,340
This is, or overstate this, I should say, this is, this is scary.

1702
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:39,700
I'm going to guess that if you were to find Noah Schackman today and ask what he thinks

1703
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:44,660
about having been a guest on Alex's show, you might not get an answer, because at this

1704
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:51,060
point in 2003, Schackman worked at Wired, but now in 2021, he's currently the editor

1705
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:55,540
in chief of the Daily Beast, an outlet that Alex screams about quite often for their very

1706
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:58,300
cruel coverage of the stupid things he says and does.

1707
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,300
Wow!

1708
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,300
Yeah.

1709
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,500
That is a career path.

1710
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,780
That is a career path.

1711
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:04,780
Yeah.

1712
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:08,300
He's on the show because he wrote an article in Wired about early possible plans from DARPA

1713
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,720
to create a project called LifeLog, which would seek to compile all available data on

1714
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,300
individuals to be able to tell the story of their lives.

1715
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:20,220
It was outrageously fucked up as an idea, and it did not end up coming to pass for a

1716
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,940
number of reasons.

1717
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:26,360
One was probably public backlash, but another was probably the unfeasibility of creating

1718
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,740
a system that would be able to do this in any meaningful, usable way.

1719
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:30,740
Yeah.

1720
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,900
Now the NSA just grabs our metadata.

1721
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:33,900
Duh.

1722
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:38,900
This is beyond that, though, with the conception of what this LifeLog thing would be.

1723
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:42,960
The primary sourcing on the program was a solicitation from DARPA for people to make

1724
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,660
proposals on how to create this program that they had the name for and an idea of what

1725
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:50,380
they wanted it to do, but not much else.

1726
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:53,900
This is to say that there wasn't a program they were testing, they were requesting people

1727
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:58,500
to put in bids to create a program to do some pretty overly ambitious and overly fucked

1728
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,500
up things.

1729
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,820
America, the Pentagon deserves your money.

1730
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:07,460
As I understand it from the way Noah describes it, the way they were hoping to start some

1731
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:15,140
of this research was to have researchers themselves do mock trips, places, and see if this program

1732
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:21,100
that they had created could log their physical movements, their transactions, and stuff like

1733
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,100
that.

1734
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,100
Sure.

1735
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,260
And it did not work out.

1736
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:27,260
Yeah, no, and also that's astonishingly fucked up.

1737
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,260
Yeah, no kidding.

1738
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:29,260
Wow.

1739
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:35,540
I can understand how someone might look at, like, boy, that would be really helpful in

1740
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:38,620
criminal investigations, and I don't disagree, probably would be.

1741
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,620
Sure, sure.

1742
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,740
No, it would make it very easy.

1743
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:45,900
The fact of it existing has a lot of other ramifications that I don't think.

1744
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:46,900
There would be some problems.

1745
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:49,420
I think that they would outweigh it on the seesaw.

1746
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:54,240
I would say that if you're looking at that program as a positive, you are wearing rose-tinted

1747
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,180
glasses at the very least.

1748
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:57,180
Yeah.

1749
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,140
The point is, government surveillance is a real issue that is taken seriously by serious

1750
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:03,580
people, and it appears that Noah is one of them.

1751
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:08,460
I suspect that he accepted this booking because in 2003, no one really knew how not serious

1752
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:13,380
Alex is, and how Alex will take any opportunity to use Noah's credibility to advance nonsense

1753
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,940
exaggerations of his underlying reporting.

1754
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,820
And that's all that's going on here.

1755
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,940
And I think Noah's polite.

1756
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,940
I will say that.

1757
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:22,940
Okay.

1758
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:24,260
And I think Alex is trying to red pill him.

1759
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,260
That sounds right.

1760
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:28,780
The National Association of Banks up in Minnesota, they're doing it.

1761
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:31,780
Now even if you have an account, they're going to want you to thumb scan.

1762
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:35,700
Yeah, you know, like I said, I don't know about that particular program, but I know

1763
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,980
that there's definitely an overall effort to make that happen.

1764
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:43,980
Well, that makes the cash digital, and basically a part of a digital system.

1765
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,420
You know, there's already RFID tags in the money.

1766
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:49,220
I know, I wasn't worried about that.

1767
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:52,560
Yeah, radio frequency identifiers have been in for six years, and the Federal Reserve

1768
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,420
says if you don't keep your money in the bank, they're going to devalue it off those tags.

1769
01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:00,020
So what I'm telling you is this is maybe a lot further along than you knew, sir.

1770
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:02,540
Yeah, you know, it could be.

1771
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,320
So there's just like...

1772
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,260
That's more polite than I would have been when he's like, you know, there's already

1773
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:08,260
RFID in the money.

1774
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,900
I'd have been like, fuck you.

1775
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,700
And they're going to devalue it?

1776
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,700
Fuck you.

1777
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:13,700
How does that work?

1778
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,140
If you don't put it in the bank.

1779
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:16,140
How?

1780
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,140
Wait, but how would that work?

1781
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,700
So this hundred dollar bill that I have...

1782
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:19,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1783
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,820
The RFID chip is going to take a zero off of it.

1784
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:26,540
Wait, wait, so I try and use it, and it's only worth like $97 because I've had it for

1785
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,540
too long?

1786
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,540
You've had it for too long.

1787
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,060
There's also a little ticking timer on it.

1788
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,580
How does this work?

1789
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:32,960
How does this work?

1790
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:40,440
You're just renting money by the hour.

1791
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:45,220
Is it possible that what the system would be is that if too many people have too many

1792
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:49,100
hundred dollar bills out, then all hundred dollar bills will be devalued?

1793
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,560
Oh, almost some sort of inflation.

1794
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:57,380
Like if there's too much of something, it's like it goes and then it dilutes the overall

1795
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,380
value.

1796
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,340
I don't know how the RFID chips would be necessary for that.

1797
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:01,660
It seems like they would be extraneous.

1798
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:08,220
Anyway, he's very polite, and Alex starts talking about the finger scanning at the grocery

1799
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:12,380
store that you're going to need to do, and it's like, you know, it's the extension of

1800
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:16,700
self-checkout lanes, and of course, as Alex always does when he talks about this, he's

1801
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,420
like, then I'm going to have to bag my own groceries.

1802
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:23,500
Now that's not really a problem, but it seems like he's not happy about it.

1803
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,500
Oh man.

1804
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,500
This leads to a little bit of a disagreement.

1805
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,500
Okay.

1806
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:31,640
I mean, the Biometric Consortium and the grocery stores say they want to pull all the check

1807
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:36,780
out lanes out and make you self-serve and thumb scan, and I mean, I don't want to bag

1808
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:37,860
my own groceries.

1809
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:42,700
That's a more low level threat here, and they're going to put in thumb scan and check out lanes

1810
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:45,760
and then pull out the other ones and make you do it.

1811
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,760
That's the plan.

1812
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,860
We're only a few years away from this.

1813
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:55,860
Well, I think on this point, I'll agree to disagree with you here.

1814
01:32:55,860 --> 01:33:03,180
I don't see this as necessarily a job killer, but I do see it as a really invasive intrusion

1815
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,180
into our lives.

1816
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:08,900
Well, what I'm saying is, sir, they pull out three checkout lanes of 10, put in biometric

1817
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:13,920
ones, self-checkout, then they pull out all the rest of the lanes and make you check your

1818
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,020
own stuff out.

1819
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:16,740
They're saying they're going to do this.

1820
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,740
Right.

1821
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:25,580
Well, I haven't seen that, but even assuming that's true, the biometric part is a little

1822
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:32,700
is nerve wracking to me, but bagging my own groceries doesn't bug me that much.

1823
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:33,700
Jesus.

1824
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:34,700
Yeah.

1825
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:35,700
That's so funny.

1826
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:36,700
That's so funny.

1827
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:42,840
He's coming here to talk about the plan that DARPA has to try and log every aspect of a

1828
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:47,440
human life and then expand that to every human on the planet.

1829
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:51,100
And Alex comes back with, I'm going to have to bag my own groceries, man.

1830
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:57,740
I'm not positive, actually, even from reading that-

1831
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:58,740
Wired article.

1832
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:02,980
No, the solicitation for bids.

1833
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:03,980
Oh, sure.

1834
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:07,460
I'm not even positive necessarily that the plan was ever to make it for everyone.

1835
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:08,460
Sure, sure.

1836
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:11,620
Because I think that that even, I don't even think that they would think that was possible.

1837
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:14,020
No, of course not.

1838
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,060
I think it was something that could be abused.

1839
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,640
Yeah, wow.

1840
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,860
Were it to exist?

1841
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,860
Absolutely.

1842
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,860
Yeah.

1843
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:28,860
The article that Noah wrote, Noah Shachman wrote in Wired, is a discussion of this, a

1844
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:36,900
discussion of the moral implications, people even within the sort of technological community

1845
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,980
being worried about this.

1846
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1847
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:40,980
Problem.

1848
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:43,260
And it's an actual article.

1849
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:46,220
And then he goes on Alex's show ostensibly to talk about it.

1850
01:34:46,220 --> 01:34:47,220
Right.

1851
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,220
And this is what ends up happening.

1852
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:49,940
Hey, I'm going to have to bag my own groceries.

1853
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,100
I'm a serious person.

1854
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,900
I have to put my thumb on the groceries.

1855
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:55,900
I gotta go.

1856
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:59,220
And then it's going to unlock them, and that's how you have to get groceries now, and I have

1857
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:00,940
to put them in my own bags.

1858
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:05,340
Another thing that is a concern of both serious people and Alex is drones.

1859
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:12,380
And there is also relevant conversations around that that don't involve Infowars stuff.

1860
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,020
And Noah brings up drones.

1861
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:17,100
Are the drones going to bring my groceries to me?

1862
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,300
That's not the context of this.

1863
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:20,300
Okay.

1864
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,300
But this is how the interview ends.

1865
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,300
Okay.

1866
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:25,300
There's some really creepy uses for drones domestically.

1867
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,780
Well, it's like They Live where the little drone flies up.

1868
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:28,780
It even looks the same.

1869
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:29,780
I'm sorry.

1870
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:30,780
What'd you say?

1871
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:31,780
You ever seen They Live?

1872
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,780
Uh, They Live.

1873
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:37,780
That's what the, uh, the, uh, rowdy, uh, Roddy Piper movie.

1874
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:38,780
Yeah.

1875
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:39,780
That's the John Carpenter film.

1876
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1877
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:41,780
That's great.

1878
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:42,780
The drones even look the same.

1879
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:43,780
Is that right?

1880
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:44,780
I haven't seen that movie in a long time.

1881
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,780
We got one that can see.

1882
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,700
Maybe you can see, uh, Noah.

1883
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,700
Thanks for joining us.

1884
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,700
Okay.

1885
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:50,700
Thanks much.

1886
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:56,540
I just, I just want more.

1887
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:59,460
I want more of that on my regular news.

1888
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:05,740
I want more of like at the end of a very serious interview with a fucking general or some bullshit

1889
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:10,060
that I'm just being like, Hey, you know, real quick, have you seen They Live recently?

1890
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:11,820
That's kind of a pretty good movie.

1891
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:12,820
Yeah.

1892
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:16,960
I think it's a lot of fun and I wish Alex would have swung harder and been like, did

1893
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,220
you know that the Matrix is a mind control trigger?

1894
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:20,220
Totally.

1895
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:21,220
Uh, what?

1896
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,220
Go for it.

1897
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:25,300
Once you open the can of worms, I want you to get to Matrix mind control.

1898
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:26,300
Yeah.

1899
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:31,420
So Alex has another guest on after this and it's a guy named Rick Adams, uh, who's a talk

1900
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:33,500
show host out of Rhode Island.

1901
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:36,180
I believe Alex has been welcomed on his show.

1902
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:39,060
And so now, uh, the, the, the favor is repaid.

1903
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:40,060
Sure.

1904
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,060
Sure.

1905
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:45,380
Uh, Alex keeps referring to this station W A L E as a, uh, I think it's like a 50 megawatt

1906
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,380
blow torch.

1907
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,380
Oh no.

1908
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:49,820
He says that like five times.

1909
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,820
Yeah.

1910
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:53,180
Somebody, somebody gave him that and he went crazy.

1911
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,180
Yeah.

1912
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:55,180
Anyway.

1913
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:56,180
Um, their credibility is up.

1914
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,180
Rick.

1915
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:02,620
I remember 10 years ago, you remember back further than that, but a Patriots talking

1916
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:08,340
about everything that's now happening today and that now what's happened is our credibility

1917
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:13,680
has exploded because over the years, people heard us warn them about all this.

1918
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,020
Now they've seen it happening.

1919
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,660
So our credibility has skyrocketed.

1920
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:18,660
Absolutely.

1921
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:23,060
You know, when I was in college, you know, a lot of people thought I was the nut and

1922
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:29,100
now generations later or decades later, I meet one or two of my friends from college

1923
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:33,660
and they say exactly what you've just said, Rick, I apologize.

1924
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,700
I thought you were the nut.

1925
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,740
I was the nut.

1926
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:41,340
I didn't believe because I didn't want to believe, but everything you said was going

1927
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:44,080
to happen did in fact happen.

1928
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,080
So you're right, Alex.

1929
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:49,260
So yeah, this dude's a conservative talk show host in Rhode Island.

1930
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:52,380
I'm not sure how wide his syndication was, but I don't know.

1931
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:55,260
He just seems like a kind of like a John Birch society dude.

1932
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,260
Sounds like it.

1933
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,260
I don't know.

1934
01:37:57,260 --> 01:37:59,180
I don't, I don't find him all that interesting.

1935
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:03,340
However, what is interesting is that mentality that they're expressing and it's kind of

1936
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:06,780
like a mantra for propagandists and conspiracy theorists.

1937
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:11,020
I've heard Alex say exactly this same sort of thing in the present day.

1938
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:12,780
I've heard him say it five years ago.

1939
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,780
He says this all the time.

1940
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:19,260
This like our credibility is through the roof because everything we've said has come true.

1941
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:23,500
The reason this rhetoric is used is because it's not about credibility or track records

1942
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:24,500
or predictions.

1943
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:28,280
None of these concepts are even real in the game that's being played on these shows.

1944
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:32,820
The goal is to tap into the audience's feelings and provide them with psychological comfort.

1945
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:36,780
They all have memory of someone thinking that they were crazy for their conspiracy beliefs

1946
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:42,100
and it makes people feel better to have their supposed expert hero give voice to those feelings.

1947
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,740
But importantly to put them in the past.

1948
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:48,620
You were right to believe me all along, we're on the other side of it now.

1949
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:52,600
This supposed story about Rick's friends from college apologizing for doubting him,

1950
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,020
that didn't happen.

1951
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:58,460
That story is constructed to give the audience hope that if they hold strong to their fringe-ass

1952
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:02,700
nonsense, eventually they too will have everyone in their lives apologizing to them for being

1953
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,740
too afraid to accept the truth.

1954
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:08,100
You see this really consistently in these sorts of communities, like it's rampant

1955
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:14,540
and QAnon conversations that you see of like, you know, fantasizing about the day that everyone

1956
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:18,180
will admit that they were right all along.

1957
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:20,820
It's weird.

1958
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:26,140
And it can't possibly be like, everyone thought we were wrong but we keep being right and

1959
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,920
so our credibility is through the roof.

1960
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,900
It can't be right in 2003 and 2020.

1961
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,900
No.

1962
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:33,900
Like it can't be right at both times.

1963
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,860
And then it also can't be right in all those intervening years when I've heard him say

1964
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:38,400
it.

1965
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,100
Do people just constantly forget about how credible you are?

1966
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:46,100
I mean it seems like he's creating a like sign wave of credibility that just goes up

1967
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:52,320
and down depending on the year or the day or whatever, you know, like today our credibility

1968
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:56,140
is through the roof and then tomorrow our credibility is way way down, you know, like

1969
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,140
what are you talking about?

1970
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:00,820
Yeah, same with like the globalists are winning, oh no they're losing, oh no they're back

1971
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:01,820
to winning!

1972
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:04,980
Oh god, oh that's terrifying.

1973
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:11,780
So Rick, I was wondering about him, and you know, he's very much in line with Alex's beliefs,

1974
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:17,740
two of them are simpatico, and I was wondering, hey does this dude think he's fighting demons?

1975
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:21,820
What type of world from your studies, Rick, do the globalists want to build?

1976
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:26,940
Well I have to go back to a biblical perspective, and I know this turns off some people, but

1977
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:31,820
I have to say it because I'm not a phony and I'm like yourself, I tell it like it is.

1978
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:37,460
We're dealing with, as the scripture says, forces of evil in this world today.

1979
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:41,980
We're not wrestling, as the apostles said, under, you know, delusion that we're fighting

1980
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,620
flesh and bones.

1981
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:48,900
We wrestle against powers and principalities of evil, Alex.

1982
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:54,260
Now I want to say Alex does not respond to that comment at all.

1983
01:40:54,260 --> 01:41:00,460
So again, he's platforming somebody who has like a sort of fundamentalist belief, a Christian

1984
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:07,380
belief in the war that they're fighting that is presumably political in nature is actually

1985
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:09,780
against principalities of evil.

1986
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:10,780
Demons.

1987
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:11,780
Yeah.

1988
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:13,820
I furrow my brow at you, Dan.

1989
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:14,820
Why?

1990
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:18,700
Because I want Alex to fucking weigh in and I'm sick of this teasing bullshit.

1991
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,740
Yeah I know, I'm a little bit frustrated with it too.

1992
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:25,860
But again, it's another interesting thread that exists in this period of time that we

1993
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:30,700
now have the ability to learn more about and unravel.

1994
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,860
And I find that really compelling.

1995
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:33,860
So weird.

1996
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:34,860
It's so weird.

1997
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:35,860
When?

1998
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:36,860
Why?

1999
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:38,020
Why was it not acceptable then?

2000
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:41,500
I mean, I guess it must have been a strategy for him then.

2001
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,420
And maybe that strategy- That's a conclusion you could jump to and

2002
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:47,860
I'm not entirely sure if it's correct, but it feels like what's going on.

2003
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,860
Totally.

2004
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:53,620
It seems like it has to be, something is going on, but it frustrates me because that sounds

2005
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:57,980
like I'm making a conspiracy theory about something going on, but something has to be

2006
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:58,980
going on.

2007
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:01,660
But that's why we need to learn more and gather more information and evidence.

2008
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:02,660
Of course.

2009
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:08,820
The stuff that some of these other folks are saying isn't too far from what Alex says in

2010
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:09,820
the current day.

2011
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:14,860
Of course Alex yells more and talks more grossly and graphically about stuff.

2012
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:19,100
But it's not too far off in terms of the, we're fighting demons.

2013
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:23,380
But Alex stays away from it himself for the most part.

2014
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:28,060
Which that's why it seems like a strategic decision because he's still booking these

2015
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:31,300
people that he knows who Rick Adams is.

2016
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,860
He probably knows this element of his belief and he's comfortable with him expressing it.

2017
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:40,920
He's just not talking the way he would in the present day.

2018
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:43,140
He would pray on air in the present day.

2019
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,140
No.

2020
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:49,860
And I mean, with those types of people, you've always got a time to Bible reference.

2021
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:55,260
So it's not like he's been talking to this dude off air for, you know, weeks and they

2022
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,820
just have never had the Bible come up.

2023
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:03,660
Like these people have, okay, if you are talking to me within a 30 minute stretch, you're gonna

2024
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:04,900
hear about the Bible.

2025
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:05,900
There's a real good chance.

2026
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,300
There's a real good chance.

2027
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:09,940
And it doesn't matter what we're talking about.

2028
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:11,860
Sports, it's going to be the Bible.

2029
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,860
It doesn't matter.

2030
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:13,860
You know?

2031
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:18,180
So we have a couple clips left from the 20th and they take some calls.

2032
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:20,460
Him and Rick.

2033
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:24,380
And again, this is the other thing too that was really wild.

2034
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:29,580
Like Cuddy is on for almost two hours as a guest.

2035
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,420
Rick is on for a really long time.

2036
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:39,580
And I thought like, like this is long for an Alex interview and it's because they're

2037
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:45,820
like just like right on the same page in terms of those new world order basics and the conspiracies.

2038
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:51,260
He can just have them co-host with you while you take phone calls and stuff and it, again,

2039
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:55,100
it's another thing that feels more like, well, this is what this radio show is trying to

2040
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,100
be.

2041
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:57,100
Right.

2042
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,100
Right.

2043
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,100
Right.

2044
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,100
Right.

2045
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:01,100
Right.

2046
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,580
And, oh, also did not get into whether or not demons are what we're fighting with Shachman.

2047
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:03,580
No Shachman.

2048
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:05,300
I'm going to guess he doesn't think that.

2049
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,580
I don't know.

2050
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:08,340
That would be a, that would be a twist.

2051
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:10,740
That would be a nice little twist for us.

2052
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,940
So like in the Matrix.

2053
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:15,540
Oh, and the third one when they negotiate with the robots.

2054
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,540
We still don't remember that.

2055
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:17,540
Yeah.

2056
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:23,940
So Alex takes this call and this is awesome.

2057
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:25,900
I don't even know how to set it up other than that.

2058
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:26,900
Okay.

2059
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:27,900
This is awesome.

2060
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,900
Okay.

2061
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:32,380
Alex, what happened with your deal when you went down to do your license and they asked

2062
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:34,860
you to thumb scan and wasn't there some kind of an uproar?

2063
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,460
What ended, what became of all this?

2064
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:39,060
See the video in a Mariner get destroyed by design.

2065
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:40,060
You ever seen that footage?

2066
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:44,100
No, I've, I've, uh, seen Masters of Terror just last week.

2067
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,920
We picked that up really enjoy it.

2068
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,500
My mom wants to use it at her church in Wisconsin.

2069
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:53,900
Well, I suggest as a primer road to tyranny is the best we've got the production wise,

2070
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,100
but I would suggest you get that one.

2071
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,100
They're all great.

2072
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:59,700
Were you able to get around the thumb scan?

2073
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:02,620
No, they have a waiver.

2074
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:03,860
Some people have gotten it.

2075
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:05,660
They will not give it to you and will refuse it.

2076
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:09,580
I could sue them, but then I wouldn't have time to be on the radio six, seven hours a

2077
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:10,580
day.

2078
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,580
Right.

2079
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:12,580
Like tonight I'm going to be on Jeff.

2080
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:15,820
I'll be filling in for somebody for two hours today or locally.

2081
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,300
I mean, I'm just working all the time.

2082
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,880
So fucking funny.

2083
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:23,100
This is one of Alex's biggest early publicity stunts, and you could argue that it's the

2084
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:29,580
closing segment, the like the big piece in his documentary, America Destroyed by Design.

2085
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:34,060
Alex brings in a bunch of cameras when he goes to the Austin DMV to go get a new driver's

2086
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:37,380
license knowing that the process requires a fingerprint.

2087
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:41,060
He brings along eight forms of identification and insists he shouldn't have to provide a

2088
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,540
fingerprint to which the people at the DMV say you do.

2089
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:48,360
Alex starts yelling about how Bill Clinton wants his blood and urine next and asking

2090
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,340
if the DMV workers are going to stick a needle in him.

2091
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:54,680
It's a petulant display and it's a real sign of the sort of publicity stunts that would

2092
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,020
come to characterize his career moving forward.

2093
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:02,540
It's so hilarious that at the end of this story, he just went back without the cameras

2094
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:07,120
and gave the fingerprint to get his driver's license because I know he has a driver's license.

2095
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:08,780
He got a DUI a few months back.

2096
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,780
Of course he does.

2097
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,860
He didn't get a driving without a license charge.

2098
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:14,380
That is so infuriating.

2099
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:16,840
It's exactly like Alex.

2100
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:17,920
It's Alex to a T.

2101
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:21,380
Well, I mean, I need a new ID, so I guess I'll go get it.

2102
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:22,380
I'll give you my thumb.

2103
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,380
Right.

2104
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:28,140
I will go and I will take this stand and yell while there's cameras running and get attention

2105
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:32,940
and incite people into a frenzy about these supposed political beliefs and these like,

2106
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:39,060
I am standing up for all the people, you know, and then, you know, I need to drive.

2107
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:42,580
I will die on this hill two days later.

2108
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:44,260
Listen, I'm real sorry about that.

2109
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:45,260
Yeah.

2110
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,260
That's my bad.

2111
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:49,100
And then when a caller calls in and asks, he's like, yeah, you can get around it, but

2112
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:50,100
like, I don't know.

2113
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,100
It's really hard.

2114
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:52,100
I gotta be on the radio.

2115
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:53,100
I can't sue people.

2116
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:54,100
I work.

2117
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,100
I have a job.

2118
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:56,100
What am I going to do?

2119
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:58,980
Hire a lawyer to do it for me while I work?

2120
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,240
No, I have to do all of my own lawsuits.

2121
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,080
What am I supposed to do?

2122
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:05,100
The hard work of having a principled stand?

2123
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:06,100
Exactly, yes.

2124
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:07,100
No.

2125
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:08,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2126
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,100
Hire a principled stand.

2127
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:11,140
Do you have time to have principles?

2128
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:12,500
Because then do it.

2129
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,500
I don't care.

2130
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,500
What?

2131
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,500
What, you don't have a job?

2132
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,500
Fine.

2133
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,500
Go have principles outside.

2134
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,500
Yeah.

2135
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,500
Crazy.

2136
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,100
What a coward.

2137
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:27,820
So Alex gets a call from an HEB manager, and this has to do with more of his ideas

2138
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:29,620
about waivers and what have you.

2139
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:30,620
Sure.

2140
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:36,060
So this manager is bringing up that at her place of work, they are now talking about

2141
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:40,820
bringing in a scanner, like a fingerprint scanner, for the time clock.

2142
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:45,580
This is different than the idea of a checkout lane that's connected to your credit card

2143
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:46,580
and what have you.

2144
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:47,580
Oh, man.

2145
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:48,940
But Alex says that this is the beginning of bringing in the...

2146
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:49,940
Sure, sure.

2147
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:50,940
Whatever.

2148
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:56,260
Anyway, the manager wants to ask Alex about ways that she can fight back and not use this

2149
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,460
system.

2150
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:02,100
And Alex's advice is so Alex that it's almost laughable.

2151
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,940
Here's my thing.

2152
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:07,620
I need to know what is my defense, not to give them my fingerprint.

2153
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:11,700
Well, tell them it's a religious reason.

2154
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:15,580
Tell them that you've been a good employee, always clocked in, not had a problem.

2155
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:20,300
Tell them that you're not gonna be part of this, and if they give you problems, I think

2156
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:24,280
you're gonna have a civil rights lawsuit on religious reasons.

2157
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,780
We need to do things like that.

2158
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,780
Okay.

2159
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:27,780
What about you?

2160
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:33,540
And is there any place you can recommend, like on the web or a certain spot in the library

2161
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:38,620
that I should look to research this stuff and what my rights are and that I can use

2162
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:40,620
as a defense to our...

2163
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:41,620
InfoWars.com.

2164
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:44,620
I can't even think of what I can...

2165
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:51,060
Well, that's a whole section of study, but it's a whole section of study, but the religious

2166
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:57,060
exemption for religious reasons, you're against that, you should be able to do something there.

2167
01:48:57,060 --> 01:49:00,540
Find out more, tell me as it progresses, and I appreciate the call.

2168
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:01,540
I really do, Billy.

2169
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:05,580
I've got a ton of calls and I wish you guys ought to call me back tomorrow or tonight

2170
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,660
or next week so I can talk to you more.

2171
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,220
We're just up against the gun here.

2172
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:10,380
He's not up against the gun.

2173
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:11,580
He has plenty of...

2174
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:12,860
He takes more calls.

2175
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:15,200
But yeah, there's no advice.

2176
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,200
There's nothing.

2177
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:21,100
There's no specific reference that he can give her to help her better navigate this

2178
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:28,460
struggle that he wants her to engage in, and his advice is essentially make up a religious

2179
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:29,460
exemption.

2180
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,460
Yep.

2181
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:31,460
Use religion as a prop.

2182
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:32,460
Yep.

2183
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,460
Yep.

2184
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:39,380
There's no part of like, here is what is violated in this religious belief.

2185
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:41,140
Here is the reason.

2186
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:48,220
Like dietary restrictions, you know, make sense as a religious exemption in various

2187
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,220
settings.

2188
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:50,220
I keep kosher.

2189
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:51,220
Sure.

2190
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,220
Yeah.

2191
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:53,220
Whatever you want.

2192
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:54,220
That makes sense.

2193
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:59,100
And there are other things, sort of opposition to war, being a conscientious objector makes

2194
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,100
total sense.

2195
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:05,100
This, I don't know, I mean I guess what he would do is say Mark of the Beast or something

2196
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,100
like that.

2197
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,100
Sure, sure.

2198
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:08,100
You're going to scream Mark of the Beast.

2199
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:13,540
I guess that would be the direction that it would go, but I don't know if that really

2200
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,220
would stand up to scrutiny.

2201
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:21,820
And it's, to me, indicative of how Alex engages with a lot of religious beliefs.

2202
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:22,820
It's a prop.

2203
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:23,820
Yeah.

2204
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:27,980
It's use it to your advantage to do the things that you don't want to do and not have to

2205
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:28,980
do the things you don't want to do.

2206
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:29,980
Or justify the things.

2207
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:30,980
Yeah.

2208
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:31,980
Absolutely.

2209
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:35,420
And no, I will not tell you where to look into this.

2210
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:42,140
I mean, how could you possibly expect somebody to win a religious exemption lawsuit if there's

2211
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:46,140
a clip of you saying, make up a religious exemption for this?

2212
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:51,340
To be fair, I just want to be totally clear, that's my language that I use to make it up.

2213
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:54,500
He's not saying make it up, but that's how it is.

2214
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,200
He is saying make it up, you know?

2215
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:01,180
He's saying find something in your religion that you 99% of the time either don't think

2216
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:03,740
about or don't actually believe.

2217
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:04,740
Right.

2218
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:09,780
Convince somebody that it's the most important thing to you now, suddenly, despite, again,

2219
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:12,700
never having thought about it in your entire life.

2220
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:16,780
Have these arguments very loudly on camera and then go back and stay on your fingers.

2221
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:18,380
I'll clock in.

2222
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:19,380
Sorry about that.

2223
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:20,380
My bad.

2224
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:21,380
Yeah.

2225
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:22,380
Yeah.

2226
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:27,540
Man, it takes so much, it must be so exhausting to convince yourself that Alex isn't a giant,

2227
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:29,140
useless piece of shit.

2228
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:34,900
Like you just heard that clip, wouldn't you be like, oh, well then you're useless.

2229
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:39,260
Your entire life is meant to be fighting at the tip of the spear.

2230
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,860
And you are giving me advice that is nothing.

2231
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:48,700
You are the person who has more knowledge and more resources than we do as individual

2232
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,420
info warriors out there in the field.

2233
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:54,740
And you had a perfect situation where you had a lot of people supporting you.

2234
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:55,920
They had your back.

2235
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,400
You could have been the one to do this lawsuit in order to make sure that all of us could

2236
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:05,340
get our waivers and not have to give fingerprints to get a DMV, get our licenses.

2237
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:06,340
Yeah.

2238
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:08,000
Oh, but then you couldn't be on the radio all the time.

2239
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:14,580
So guess, uh, guess it's going to have to be the HEB manager with very little money.

2240
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:15,580
No time.

2241
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:16,580
Yeah.

2242
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:17,580
Yeah.

2243
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:18,580
No support.

2244
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:20,220
No cult of personality around them.

2245
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,540
Their responsibility.

2246
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:22,540
Yeah.

2247
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:28,220
It's a little bit, uh, you know, I mean, it's not new, but it is just a gross, uh, denial

2248
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:31,860
of the self appointed role.

2249
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:36,540
This is a grassroots movement where I exploit the grassroots.

2250
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:37,620
Okay.

2251
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:44,020
You can water the grass or you can suck all of the life out of it for every single scent

2252
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,460
that you can steal.

2253
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,460
Yep.

2254
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,460
Man, that was a good show.

2255
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:57,940
Anyway, uh, we come to the end of this and, and, and like, I really feel like there are

2256
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:01,380
threads that I'm fascinated by in 2003.

2257
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:07,220
I think a lot of stuff is, is, is, is coming up that I really, really want to know where

2258
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:08,980
these things go.

2259
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:12,580
And so I hope to, uh, you know, obviously I'm not going to lose track of the present

2260
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:17,740
day or ignore it entirely, but this is, this is, this is getting me, getting my juices.

2261
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:23,940
I think what it is to me, it's just so uncanny, you know, like I recognize this guy and yet

2262
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:26,900
every time I hear him talk, I'm like, who the fuck is this guy?

2263
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:30,820
You know, like it's so close to Alex, but it's just even weirder.

2264
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:31,820
Yeah.

2265
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:39,620
And we're even taking for granted like almost, uh, how like nutty it is, the, the, the position

2266
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:45,420
on Putin is so like night and day, like it's, that's outrageous.

2267
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:52,060
I can't believe how jaded we are that that completely is like almost passé to a certain,

2268
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:55,500
you know, like, oh yeah, yeah, of course he believes this then and doesn't believe that

2269
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,500
now.

2270
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:58,780
Like that's just boring at this point, but that's nuts.

2271
01:53:58,780 --> 01:53:59,780
That's major.

2272
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:00,780
That's foundational.

2273
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:01,780
Yeah.

2274
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,900
There's a lot of major stuff that is, uh, is going to have to give.

2275
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:04,900
Totally.

2276
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,540
And then I want to know where, like, where these people are.

2277
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:09,860
Where are the, the, the experts?

2278
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:12,500
Where are the G Edward Griffin?

2279
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:13,500
Where's that dude?

2280
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:18,020
I know some of them are editor in chief of the daily beast now.

2281
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:24,140
Why isn't Alex like he's, obviously he's talking about gold a little bit, but like Midas Resources

2282
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:25,940
is selling gold at this point.

2283
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:29,700
He's not pushing gold as hard as he does in like years after this.

2284
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:30,700
Yeah.

2285
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:31,700
I don't know.

2286
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:32,700
It's interesting.

2287
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:33,700
It's confusing.

2288
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:36,420
I'm excited to learn more and we shall in the future, but until then, Jordan, we have

2289
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:37,420
a website.

2290
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:38,420
We do have a website.

2291
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,420
It's knowledgefight.com.

2292
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:40,420
Yep.

2293
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:41,420
We're also on Twitter.

2294
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:42,420
We are on Twitter.

2295
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:43,420
We're also on Facebook.

2296
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:44,420
