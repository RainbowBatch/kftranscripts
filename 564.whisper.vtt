N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.120
I have great respect for knowledgefight, knowledgefight.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, knowledgefight.

00:29.960 --> 00:46.280
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight, need money, Andy in Kansas, stop it, Andy in Kansas, it's

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
time to pray.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.280
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us.

00:49.280 --> 00:58.480
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work, knowledgefight.com,

00:58.480 --> 00:59.480
I love you.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.360
Hey everybody, welcome back to knowledgefight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes

01:02.360 --> 01:06.360
like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a

01:06.360 --> 01:10.680
little bit about Alex Jones, oh indeed we are Dan, shit, ah come on, I wasn't going

01:10.680 --> 01:13.520
to talk about it, you added it, you barely added a little thing, we were going to just

01:13.520 --> 01:17.480
ride it on through, old habits, old habits, die hard, what are you going to do Dan, I

01:17.480 --> 01:22.040
don't know, I have a question for you, okay, I'll do that, I'll answer that question,

01:22.040 --> 01:26.200
what's your bright spot today, my bright spot today Jordan, I mentioned this to you, I decided

01:26.200 --> 01:32.280
that I was going to give Assassin's Creed Valhalla another chance, I mentioned on the

01:32.280 --> 01:36.600
show that I started playing it and I was enjoying it enough and then I just sort of lost interest,

01:36.600 --> 01:40.720
and I did not make it very far into it, and you were telling me that there's this new

01:40.720 --> 01:49.680
Ireland DLC, and so I decided I'll give this a shot, and you buried the lead, holy shit,

01:49.680 --> 01:54.880
I went to Ireland, and almost immediately, instead of a horse, you now can ride a giant

01:54.880 --> 02:01.880
cat around, I know, so my bright spot is now I'm riding around on a giant cat, I was hoping

02:01.880 --> 02:07.200
you would discover it on your own, because I knew you were going to blow your mind, it's

02:07.200 --> 02:11.760
the best, I have a giant cat that I'm riding around like a horse, and I couldn't be happier,

02:11.760 --> 02:14.720
that's all you need, that's all you need, that's all you've ever dreamed of, that's

02:14.720 --> 02:20.800
all you, yeah, no, absolutely, now the game is back in my good graces, and I will probably

02:20.800 --> 02:26.620
finish it, because I have a giant cat friend, that is why I have tried to throw as many

02:26.620 --> 02:33.480
pets at you in the other show we do, so that is nice, I like that, yeah, what about you?

02:33.480 --> 02:40.480
My bright spot, Dan, as you may know, or probably don't, the French Open is going on right now,

02:40.480 --> 02:44.980
oh no, and while you are listening to this, there's a good chance that Rafa and Djokovic

02:44.980 --> 02:51.960
are meeting for their roughly 600th time, Djokovic I think is ahead by one win, they're

02:51.960 --> 02:57.040
so close, they're the Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn of tennis, they've been going back and

02:57.040 --> 03:01.620
forth for a decade, they're destined to fight forever, forever and ever, they're the two

03:01.620 --> 03:08.240
best that ever lived, along with Federer, and it's just going to be great tomorrow,

03:08.240 --> 03:13.840
or today, or whatever you're listening to, I imagine Rafa's going to wind up winning,

03:13.840 --> 03:18.140
because Djokovic just looked a little bit shaky, but you never know, although you do,

03:18.140 --> 03:23.720
because Rafa has won the French Open 13 times, I feel like the French Open was happening

03:23.720 --> 03:29.920
like a week or two ago, I feel like this just keeps happening, it never stops, it's every

03:29.920 --> 03:34.240
year or so, no I just feel like there's some tennis thing that I just always assume is

03:34.240 --> 03:37.780
the French Open that's happening, yeah, well I mean, it's hard for me to tell the difference

03:37.780 --> 03:42.200
between any of this, if you talk about Rafa, you eventually mention that he won 13 French

03:42.200 --> 03:48.840
Opens, true, so Jordan, today we have an episode from the past, no, that's where things are

03:48.840 --> 03:54.520
better, I got sick of Jordan's shit, well that's fair, I got sick of Alex's shit in

03:54.520 --> 03:59.000
the present day, and you know, one of the things that was like, alright I'm definitely

03:59.000 --> 04:02.860
doing an episode about the past, was that I kept seeing people posting that picture

04:02.860 --> 04:09.040
of Alex at a strip club, and I just lost my patience with the present day, I don't understand

04:09.040 --> 04:15.960
how that ends up being like, a viral tweet on Twitter, like I don't, who cares, yeah

04:15.960 --> 04:20.200
that's my instant reaction, a lot of people were telling me about it and I was like, that's

04:20.200 --> 04:26.960
okay, he's a monster, good for him, he can go to, we can all go to a strip club whenever

04:26.960 --> 04:31.720
we want, whenever we want, that guy's a monster though, I don't care if he's at a strip club,

04:31.720 --> 04:36.080
it doesn't really, it doesn't really make anything, it doesn't make any larger point

04:36.080 --> 04:40.440
other than like, I think there's something weird about going to a strip club, I mean

04:40.440 --> 04:45.240
I suppose you could probably try and make the argument that it's hypocritical for him

04:45.240 --> 04:50.960
to be God-blasting all day, every day, and then be at a strip club, but yeah, it's so

04:50.960 --> 04:57.880
easy, it's stupid, you could say like, look I'm a man, or you could say, I went there

04:57.880 --> 05:01.480
because I had a business meeting and the people I was with wanted to go, you don't understand

05:01.480 --> 05:04.760
what it's like to be in the higher echelons of business, you're running your own business

05:04.760 --> 05:09.320
sometimes, you know there's a hundred ways you could get around the quote on quote hypocrisy

05:09.320 --> 05:12.760
of it, and I don't know, I didn't look into it too much, but it looked like he was in

05:12.760 --> 05:17.540
a bathroom, and look, I hate Alex Jones, I don't even know if that's a strip club, well

05:17.540 --> 05:21.000
I hate Alex Jones, and I will say that if someone was taking a picture of him in the

05:21.000 --> 05:28.040
bathroom, I think that is a violation of someone's rights of privacy, sure, and like, I don't

05:28.040 --> 05:32.600
think it's cool to take pictures of people in a bathroom, yeah, I think you're right,

05:32.600 --> 05:37.240
anyway, that's a good point, I was like, I don't know, I imagine maybe he has a rebuttal

05:37.240 --> 05:41.240
to that, but I don't want to talk about it, I just don't care, yeah, so today we're gonna

05:41.240 --> 05:46.080
be in the past and we're gonna be talking about May 15th to 20th, whoa, that's a lot,

05:46.080 --> 05:53.280
2003, oh, blackjack, dammit, that's the wrong one again, roulette, this is a period that

05:53.280 --> 05:58.400
I've been looking forward to covering because as we know, the de-bathification begins, yes,

05:58.400 --> 06:02.560
around this time, he's been screaming about how they're gonna let the bath party run,

06:02.560 --> 06:07.600
everything, the baths are taking over, that's Bush's and the globalist's plan from the beginning,

06:07.600 --> 06:12.560
yes, they're going to be in charge of Iraq because they're basically CIA, exactly, and

06:12.560 --> 06:20.080
so I was interested to see how that would be affected by, you know, how Alex's rhetoric

06:20.080 --> 06:24.320
would be affected, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then the second thing is that this is

06:24.320 --> 06:28.800
over the weekend, and this is when Alex goes to Kansas City to do that local radio station

06:28.800 --> 06:34.240
gig, that's right, we have a couple of dangling threads that are gonna come together in this

06:34.240 --> 06:39.720
episode and I'm excited to get to it, but first, let's say hello to some new wonks,

06:39.720 --> 06:43.840
so first, possibly Pluto, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk, I'm a policy wonk,

06:54.280 --> 07:00.720

07:00.720 --> 07:06.480
laser tag place, that would be awesome, that would be dope, next, Liam, we know your favorite

07:06.480 --> 07:10.520

07:15.520 --> 07:21.040
policy wonk, thank you very much Omar, thank you, and this is a shout out that a wonk asked

07:21.040 --> 07:27.800
us to give as a policy, honorary policy wonk I guess, that's Bunny Brigade Pennsylvania,

07:27.800 --> 07:32.240
Bunny Brigade PA, it's a bunny charity, like a rescue animal charity, oh okay, yeah, yeah,

07:32.240 --> 07:36.840
I'm way ahead, they're apparently trying to expand and you can go to their website and

07:36.840 --> 07:42.800
donate if you want to help save some bunnies, hell yeah, I was very close to trying to adopt

07:42.800 --> 07:45.400
one of them because I looked at the website and there's a couple that were very cute,

07:45.400 --> 07:48.880
of course there are, of course there are, you can't not adopt a bunny, no, anyway, Bunny

07:48.880 --> 07:53.320
Brigade PA, you're now a policy wonk, I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, and then

07:53.320 --> 07:57.920
a couple technocrats here Jordan, we got Just Listen to Jordan stand up on YouTube and really

07:57.920 --> 08:03.800

08:03.800 --> 08:08.840
Derek hey, congratulations on your engagement recently, I hope you and Mallory have a great

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320

08:20.320 --> 08:23.720
Alright, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this Watson alright, let's just get down to business,

08:23.720 --> 08:29.040
we ain't making that money off that heroin, why you pimps so good, my neck is freakishly

08:29.040 --> 08:35.160
large, I declare info war on you, thank you all, yes, thank you very much, especially

08:35.160 --> 08:40.380
to me for donating to our show, just to make sure everybody knows that I might have a stand

08:40.380 --> 08:46.840
up video on YouTube still, and I'm not sure if I do, but okay, so Jordan, we're gonna

08:46.840 --> 08:52.600
get into this here, but first, here is an out of context drop, man that was a good show,

08:52.600 --> 08:58.320
didn't cover all the news, covered a lot of it, okay, okay, okay, man that was a good

08:58.320 --> 09:06.920
C+, got a 75%, I'm feeling solid about this math test, holy shit, I nailed it, I did some

09:06.920 --> 09:15.840
of the things, that to me felt like really Alex Jones, that's very good, I do appreciate

09:15.840 --> 09:21.520
that, hey this is a good show, also I set the bar low, anyways, onto tomorrow, you gotta

09:21.520 --> 09:29.520
love yourself, you know, so we start here on the 15th, this is a Thursday, and Alex

09:29.520 --> 09:35.360
is still covering the bombing in Riyadh that had happened recently, if you recall it was

09:35.360 --> 09:41.260
a residential complex compound kind of area where a lot of Westerners were known to live,

09:41.260 --> 09:45.500
in the intervening time since then, some more information has come out about the particular

09:45.500 --> 09:50.560
Westerners that were living in these compounds that appeared to be the target of that, and

09:50.560 --> 09:53.480
so this is the direction the story is going to go.

09:53.480 --> 09:59.560
Local companies' employees die in Saudi bombing, now I had this on Infowars.com yesterday,

09:59.560 --> 10:06.700
I briefly mentioned it, I said two days ago, before it was even in the news, on my website

10:06.700 --> 10:12.900
and it's posted, the headline, you saw it, where I said, hmm, I bet the Carlisle Group

10:12.900 --> 10:19.520
is going to be involved, I bet they're involved in the rebuilding, well guess what, guess

10:19.520 --> 10:24.820
who owned the company and it just gotten done selling it and it still had connections to

10:24.820 --> 10:32.640
it as a subsidiary, the Carlisle Group, the Benlodons, the Bushes and the rest of them.

10:32.640 --> 10:37.040
So the company in question that were apparently the targets of this 2003 bombing in Riyadh

10:37.040 --> 10:42.180
was the Vinnell Corporation, it's a construction business that was founded in 1931 and has

10:42.180 --> 10:46.120
a deep history of international contracts for U.S. interests.

10:46.120 --> 10:51.280
For instance, during the Vietnam War, Vinnell was tasked with maintaining power plant systems

10:51.280 --> 10:56.720
over there overseas, they're actually pretty well known for this because in 1967, approximately

10:56.720 --> 11:02.280
2,000 Korean workers at a Vinnell plant in Cameron Bay were dissatisfied enough with

11:02.280 --> 11:04.320
their conditions that they rioted.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.200
From Shelby Stanton's book, The Rise and Fall of an American Army, U.S. Ground Forces in

11:08.200 --> 11:13.960
Vietnam, 1965 to 1973, quote, the primary cause appears to have been dissatisfaction

11:13.960 --> 11:17.260
with the food served them, particularly the shortage of rice.

11:17.260 --> 11:21.520
The Koreans refused to eat their Saturday meal on November 18th and went to the Vinnell

11:21.520 --> 11:25.800
Mess Hall where they turned over tables and attacked several Americans.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.800
They forced the American project manager to eat some of their food to show them how bad

11:29.800 --> 11:30.800
it was.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.040
A Vinnell Corporation civilian took out his gun and shot three Koreans.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.900
He was then mobbed and severely injured and a Korean shot another American.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.760
The riot ended up lasting four days.

11:40.760 --> 11:46.920
Yeah, I was gonna say, like you say a company that does stuff for American government since

11:46.920 --> 11:49.840
1931 and I'm like, I'm probably bad.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.400
Not since 1931.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.780
They were founded in 1931.

11:53.780 --> 11:58.480
But they have a long history of performing government contracts in what are probably

11:58.480 --> 12:01.280
war zones or a lot of the time.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.280
So they're bad.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.040
Yeah, and their involvement in government contracts began during the Chinese Civil War

12:06.040 --> 12:10.400
when they were hired to ship supplies, meaning weapons, to Chiang Kai-Shek's forces.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.720
Oh shit, was Alex right about everything?

12:12.720 --> 12:13.720
No.

12:13.720 --> 12:14.720
Oh, okay.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.720
Because they were sending weapons to Chiang Kai-Shek.

12:15.720 --> 12:16.720
Yes, I know.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.360
It was fighting against Mao.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.080
So I don't know, Alex has got a tough point there.

12:23.080 --> 12:27.520
What's really most notable about this company, however, is that in 1975 they landed a very

12:27.520 --> 12:31.420
lucrative contract to train the Saudi Arabian National Guard.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.320
This is almost certainly- Can they do that?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.080
Apparently they can.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.940
This is almost certainly why their building was a target for that attack in Riyadh.

12:38.940 --> 12:42.800
Not some obscure connection to people Alex is insisting on connecting everyone to back

12:42.800 --> 12:43.800
in 2003.

12:43.800 --> 12:48.120
In fact, their headquarters in Saudi Arabia had been bombed back in 1995, too.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.720
This is something that I think people know to do.

12:51.720 --> 12:56.320
Yeah, I mean, you're bad, so this happens.

12:56.320 --> 13:03.080
I think that the people who would be trying to attack the Saudi Arabian government, maybe

13:03.080 --> 13:09.580
some rebel types or terrorists, would know enough to be like, well, let's not just attack

13:09.580 --> 13:10.580
the government.

13:10.580 --> 13:11.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.920
I mean, they're not using them with material stuff.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.920
It kind of makes sense.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.920
Yeah, yeah.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.200
Here's the connection between Vinil and Carlyle Group.

13:20.200 --> 13:25.420
In 1992, Vinil Corporation was bought by BDM International Incorporated, which in turn

13:25.420 --> 13:27.240
was owned by the Carlyle Group.

13:27.240 --> 13:34.040
However, in 1997, BDM was purchased by TRW Incorporated, which represented the end of

13:34.040 --> 13:36.660
their association with the Carlyle Group.

13:36.660 --> 13:40.720
According to an article in the Washington Post from 1997 about the deal, Carlyle had

13:40.720 --> 13:45.120
agreed to sell its entire stake and shares in the company to TRW in the acquisition,

13:45.120 --> 13:48.520
so there isn't even some minority ownership remaining the way Alex is pretending.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.720
Right, right, right, right.

13:49.720 --> 13:55.960
Then in 2002, TRW was bought by Northrop Grumman, so at the time Alex is recording this episode

13:55.960 --> 13:59.920
and he wants to talk about this company in the context of the military industrial complex,

13:59.920 --> 14:02.160
this would be the angle to take.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.040
It seems really simple, too, which is why you can't do it.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.040
It's too easy.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.280
By pointing fingers at the Carlyle Group, Alex is making this piece of information fit

14:09.280 --> 14:13.040
his pre-written narratives about Bush, but he's depriving the audience of access to any

14:13.040 --> 14:16.080
real context for the subject that he's covering.

14:16.080 --> 14:20.280
At the point Alex is on air here, the Carlyle Group was six years removed from selling Vinel's

14:20.280 --> 14:25.100
parent company, and even if they were owners of Vinel's parent company, still it wouldn't

14:25.100 --> 14:26.100
prove anything.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.100
Yeah.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.100
Oh, man.

14:28.100 --> 14:34.700
I mean, to a certain extent, I think once you're talking about a company that's been

14:34.700 --> 14:40.720
bought like three times in six years, I don't even know if any of these people have any

14:40.720 --> 14:44.260
idea what it is they're buying or selling at that highest level.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.920
You know what I'm saying?

14:45.920 --> 14:50.020
What do you mean George W. Bush knows what's going on or anything like that?

14:50.020 --> 14:53.820
He's got people who are just like, ah, we'll do all that stuff.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.440
He's bumbling around like a fool.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.500
I don't know.

14:56.500 --> 15:00.280
They don't know what they're doing if they're buying those kinds of companies and then selling

15:00.280 --> 15:01.280
them a year later.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.900
Well, from what I understand from reading some of these articles, it was a period of

15:04.900 --> 15:10.120
time where there was rampant consolidation and merger and going on in terms of these

15:10.120 --> 15:11.120
international contractors.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.120
Right.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.120
Right, right, right.

15:13.120 --> 15:16.800
And so that kind of explains a little bit of the moving around.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.800
Right.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.800
Right, right, right.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.800
Yeah.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.800
I don't know.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.800
It's not compelling.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.000
Just because you see the name Carlyle Group in the past of this company.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Right.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Right, right, right.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I don't know.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
It's soft.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.600
Northrop Grumman is probably an easier name to just pull and be like, problem.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
Doesn't come up at all.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.600
See?

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
No, but problem.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
You know?

15:37.600 --> 15:38.600
Weird that it doesn't come up at all.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.800
The name Northrop Grumman doesn't come up at all in Alex's conversation.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.280
I thought Alex has a stake in Northrop Grumman.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.280
No.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.280
See?

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
Anybody can do it, Dan.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
Anybody can do it.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.440
Alex owns part of Northrop Grumman.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.060
So it's all a conspiracy that he's trying to get people to hate the, it's, anybody.

15:52.060 --> 15:53.060
As founded as anything else.

15:53.060 --> 15:54.060
Done.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.060
Yeah, anybody.

15:55.060 --> 15:56.060
Anybody.

15:56.060 --> 15:59.720
Apparently this Vinnell Corporation is also apparently a front for the CIA.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
Oh, okay.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.720
Turns out the firm was a cover for the CIA too.

16:03.720 --> 16:12.400
Oh, lo and behold, what got bombed was the CIA, hence the Times of London, and the Vinnells

16:12.400 --> 16:18.120
one-time owners of the Carlyle Group, shadowy CIA operations.

16:18.120 --> 16:26.040
Here are the mainstream articles, NBC and the Times of London, on the website Infowars.com

16:26.040 --> 16:27.160
right now.

16:27.160 --> 16:31.040
One of the things that I've learned to be very careful about when dealing with speculative

16:31.040 --> 16:33.800
information is claims that people or groups are fronts.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.640
This is an accusation that's really difficult to work with because generally speaking it's

16:37.640 --> 16:42.080
a claim that's made constantly without proof, and people who make the claim often seem to

16:42.080 --> 16:45.840
think that the burden of proof is on you to show that some group isn't a front, which

16:45.840 --> 16:47.460
is a trap.

16:47.460 --> 16:51.700
If you read any John Birch Society text or book from the anti-communist crusaders that

16:51.700 --> 16:55.520
Alex loves, one of the first things you'll notice is that every single thing is asserted

16:55.520 --> 16:59.280
to be a communist front, and none of it is ever substantiated.

16:59.280 --> 17:03.520
Gary Allen's book, Communist Revolution in the Streets, accuses literally every civil

17:03.520 --> 17:08.480
rights organization, every student activism group, and most bookstores of being communist

17:08.480 --> 17:09.480
fronts.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.240
And not in the sense that some communists might gravitate to these things.

17:13.240 --> 17:18.800
He's claiming that these exist explicitly as props of the communist party.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.920
It was Barnes and Nobleski, if you, alright.

17:22.920 --> 17:27.080
So anyway, my point is that it's one of the rhetorical tricks that I have the least interest

17:27.080 --> 17:31.400
in, is like an unsupported allegation that something or someone is a front.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.400
Nonsense.

17:32.400 --> 17:37.040
The question I just wrote down is like, after all these years, what does Alex think the

17:37.040 --> 17:42.600
CIA's portfolio actually looks like, like if there was a balance sheet of all of their

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
fronts?

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
Jesus.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.680
So in the case of Vinnell, there is an article in the London Times about how they were formerly

17:48.680 --> 17:52.680
owned by the Carlyle Group, and that the Carlyle Group had a history of contracting with intelligence

17:52.680 --> 17:53.680
organizations.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.680
Sure.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.680
Sure's the headline that Alex is talking about.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.720
Now, here's the thing.

17:57.720 --> 18:03.160
I would never come to you and say that Vinnell absolutely hasn't done some work with groups

18:03.160 --> 18:04.160
like the CIA.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.160
Sure.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.560
That's almost a certainty, considering their longstanding contract to train the Saudi National

18:09.560 --> 18:10.560
Guard.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.960
And allegations have been made.

18:12.960 --> 18:18.000
From a 2003 article in the LA Times, quote, in a memoir, former CIA operative Wilbur Crane

18:18.000 --> 18:23.080
Evelyn described using his title as Vinnell vice president as a cover while working in

18:23.080 --> 18:26.800
Africa and the Middle East in the early 1960s.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.320
It's definitely conceivable to imagine that at times people who work for the CIA have

18:30.320 --> 18:34.720
used fake employment at Vinnell as cover, but that alone doesn't demonstrate that the

18:34.720 --> 18:37.400
entire company itself is a front operation.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.280
I'm going out of my way to provide explanations for why Alex could be right, and I still don't

18:41.280 --> 18:43.320
think his argument stands up to scrutiny.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.320
No.

18:44.320 --> 18:50.840
No, I mean, here's what I get from all of the evidence.

18:50.840 --> 18:53.600
Something shady could be going on here.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.080
Here's what I get from Alex.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.440
It's the fucking globalists inside everybody.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.440
And we've proved it.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
Yeah, exactly.

18:59.440 --> 19:03.240
And it's like, man, I'm not saying nothing shady's going on, but I'm not saying nothing's

19:03.240 --> 19:04.400
not going on.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.240
Initially, after the bombing, it was suspected that the attacks were on a housing area known

19:08.240 --> 19:10.560
to be used by Westerners living in Riyadh.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.440
As more details came out, it became more clear that this was likely a targeted attack aimed

19:14.440 --> 19:16.000
at Vinnell.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.320
What makes a lot of sense is that, from the standpoint of people who might attack the

19:20.320 --> 19:24.240
Saudi government, like we were talking about, they're assisting and training the National

19:24.240 --> 19:29.760
Guard of Saudi Arabia, and you might see that as a high-profile target.

19:29.760 --> 19:35.220
If you're a rebel, it's hard not to view that as a combatant target.

19:35.220 --> 19:39.920
The CIA could outright run Vinnell, or they could just be a company that had close ties

19:39.920 --> 19:44.440
to the government and allowed CIA agents to use their business's name as part of the cover.

19:44.440 --> 19:50.160
Either way, I'm not sure it really matters, because the thing they're doing sucks.

19:50.160 --> 19:55.100
There's a much larger problem here with this entire state of private armies and war contractors,

19:55.100 --> 19:59.640
but instead of dealing with those things realistically, Alex just wants to jingle around keys like

19:59.640 --> 20:04.380
the CIA and Carlyle group, because distracting is easier than wrestling with difficult information

20:04.380 --> 20:07.160
and looking at the reality.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.760
That's what he's doing, and it's wild.

20:09.760 --> 20:15.640
I mean, then again, to a certain extent, it's hard not to look back in the context of, like,

20:15.640 --> 20:20.180
when he has Trump, he's fine with so much of this shit, you know?

20:20.180 --> 20:21.560
He likes Blackwater now.

20:21.560 --> 20:26.040
Yeah, he loves all of this stuff, so, you know, maybe part of the reason-

20:26.040 --> 20:27.400
He thinks Prince is a hero.

20:27.400 --> 20:32.000
Part of the reason maybe that he's doing all of these jangling keys kinds of things is

20:32.000 --> 20:36.960
because he wants the fundamental problems to stay the same, he just wants to be in control

20:36.960 --> 20:41.120
of those fundamental problems and how we react to them, you know?

20:41.120 --> 20:43.200
He wants to have a private army.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.160
So why would he complain about people who have private armies unless it's within the

20:47.160 --> 20:49.200
context of jangling keys over here, you know?

20:49.200 --> 20:55.640
Well, I mean, certainly, you know, libertarianism is not averse to private armies.

20:55.640 --> 20:56.840
No, no, no.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.320
Most libertarian thinkers seem to-

20:58.320 --> 21:00.160
As long as you get to join.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.160
Yeah.

21:01.160 --> 21:06.080
So, anyway, Alex has some more conspiracies about this company in Saudi.

21:06.080 --> 21:14.160
Turns out that 50 plus of the 70 employees were gone on a training mission and-

21:14.160 --> 21:18.680
So he's saying that 50 of the 70 employees at Vinil were gone on a training mission,

21:18.680 --> 21:23.840
but what he's doing is he's trying to create the false impression in the listener's head.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.940
Whenever there's an attack, you'll always hear claims that some select group was warned

21:26.940 --> 21:31.220
not to be there or had been removed from the area beforehand because claims like this seem

21:31.220 --> 21:35.840
to be really strong indications of foreknowledge and probably it's a false lie.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
Of course.

21:36.840 --> 21:40.520
Alex wants you to think that 50 of the seven employees there weren't at work that day,

21:40.520 --> 21:43.360
which is suspicious, but that's not the situation.

21:43.360 --> 21:48.960
The buildings that were bombed were a residential compound where 70 American employees lived.

21:48.960 --> 21:53.440
I'm not sure where Alex is getting the 50 number from, but nine employees died and 15

21:53.440 --> 21:57.120
were hospitalized, not counting many who were merely treated for minor injuries.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.120
Jesus.

21:58.120 --> 22:02.200
Also, if people who worked at Vinil weren't at home, they almost by definition would be

22:02.200 --> 22:06.520
on a training mission since the reason they're in Saudi Arabia is a training mission.

22:06.520 --> 22:10.320
The words Alex is saying actually mean nothing, but they're meant to create a denser air of

22:10.320 --> 22:14.840
suspicion around the bombing, which is unearned by the information that he's actually presenting.

22:14.840 --> 22:20.560
It does seem like he's even presenting it the exact opposite way in as far as they were

22:20.560 --> 22:23.160
just at work.

22:23.160 --> 22:27.200
He's like, they're on a training mission, meaning they're not at work, but in this circumstance,

22:27.200 --> 22:28.800
they're at work.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
They're not at home.

22:29.800 --> 22:35.480
Yeah, he's meaning it to be like they were sent to UAE.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.120
Right, right, right.

22:38.120 --> 22:42.640
He's trying to sell it like if the Pentagon got exploded tomorrow, but all the top generals

22:42.640 --> 22:47.020
escaped miraculously the day before, you're like, well, that's suspicious as shit instead

22:47.020 --> 22:48.020
of like-

22:48.020 --> 22:49.020
That's exactly what he's doing.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.020
They all just went to work that day.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.020
It was a normal day.

22:51.020 --> 22:54.160
He's saying all the higher ups were gone, and he literally does say a couple of times

22:54.160 --> 22:56.680
like, the janitors were the ones who were-

22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
Okay.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.640
I don't know about this.

22:59.640 --> 23:05.480
So Alex jumps off this topic, and he reads a bit of an op-ed by Joseph Farah, the guy

23:05.480 --> 23:06.480
who runs WorldNetDaily.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.480
Sure.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.480
I bet it's great.

23:08.480 --> 23:13.280
Well, one of the things that I think is really fascinating about this is that Alex doesn't

23:13.280 --> 23:16.320
seem to like WorldNetDaily in 2003.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.360
I'm just so confused.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.760
He doesn't consider them allies.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.760
I'm furious.

23:20.760 --> 23:25.400
So anyway, this is going to start with him reading from the article and then expounding

23:25.400 --> 23:27.720
a little bit on some of his feelings.

23:27.720 --> 23:31.000
Most people need to rethink their notions about the political spectrum and the left

23:31.000 --> 23:32.800
end.

23:32.800 --> 23:36.960
Most people agree you have communism, total government control over the means of production

23:36.960 --> 23:37.960
and property.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.880
It's the other end of the spectrum that many get confused.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.880
Ask most left-wingers, and they'll suggest that fascism is on the extreme right, 180

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
degrees from communism.

23:45.880 --> 23:46.880
Uh-uh.

23:46.880 --> 23:47.880
Wow, Farah.

23:47.880 --> 23:48.880
You've been listening to the show.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.320
We know a lot of WorldNetDaily writers listen, and you've admitted that.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.640
I've got news for you, friends.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.080
Fascism and communism are ideological kissing cousins.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.360
Boy, you said it.

23:57.360 --> 24:01.680
I would place fascism and socialism just a few degrees to the right of communism.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.680
No, Farah.

24:02.680 --> 24:03.680
It's not left-right.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.680
What?

24:04.680 --> 24:10.000
Fascism, communism, socialism, all on the command and control, tyranny, serfdom, feudalism,

24:10.000 --> 24:15.640
and republics, constitutional republics, are on the other end of that spectrum.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.640
Get a little more sophisticated.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.640
I think you are.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.640
I think you know.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.600
They've got to keep you in that left-right.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.680
You think you get a choice when really you're on the big government side.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
That's weird.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.720
Words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words.

24:28.720 --> 24:29.720
Yeah.

24:29.720 --> 24:34.520
Alex loves WorldNetDaily now and has over large stretches of his career, but he seems

24:34.520 --> 24:40.720
to think that they're neo-cons at this point, and he thinks that this op-ed that Joseph

24:40.720 --> 24:46.520
Farah wrote is an indication that they're coming around or something, and so he's excited.

24:46.520 --> 24:50.560
I'm less interested in that op-ed than I am in Alex's discussion about some of the more

24:50.560 --> 24:54.960
the specifics about his belief that the right-left paradigm is an illusion.

24:54.960 --> 25:01.280
I'm a big fan of how he confuses economic systems, government systems, any number of

25:01.280 --> 25:02.280
different things.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.960
Listening to mostly more current episodes of Alex's show from the past five or six years,

25:06.960 --> 25:11.040
you get the sense that that idea had something to do with political parties.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.260
Even at the end of the clip, he's making reference to the left and the right having something

25:14.260 --> 25:18.020
to do with giving you the illusion of having a choice, which feels like he's talking about

25:18.020 --> 25:19.680
voting and political parties.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:20.680 --> 25:24.440
However, listening to these 2003 episodes, the concept has sort of taken a different

25:24.440 --> 25:25.440
shape.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.760
Since Alex talks a little bit more about what he actually means back then, and I have to

25:28.760 --> 25:33.200
say that I think it's actually way stupider than I thought it was, it actually seems like

25:33.200 --> 25:37.840
a political philosophy that's tailor-made to be defined by opposition, which goes a

25:37.840 --> 25:41.480
long way toward helping make sense of how the show seemed nonsensical in the Trump era

25:41.480 --> 25:43.320
and now.

25:43.320 --> 25:46.440
When Alex is discussing the illusion of the left-right paradigm, I believe you have to

25:46.440 --> 25:50.580
just completely get ideas of liberal or conservative politics out of your head.

25:50.580 --> 25:54.040
I think Alex is operating on a completely different axis, which is essentially just

25:54.040 --> 25:56.080
government is bad.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.840
It's a pretty childish thing to express as your fundamental political belief, especially

25:59.840 --> 26:03.300
if you don't have the courage to just come out and be a full-on anarchist.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.300
If you're against big government, then I'd like to remind you that small government is

26:06.300 --> 26:10.280
fucking huge compared to no government.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.940
Leaving that aside, I want to discuss for a second why Alex's conception of this being

26:13.940 --> 26:18.840
the only relevant excess in politics is woefully dumb and not the way to look at the world.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.760
The sole factor Alex considers in terms of ideology is whether or not something is a

26:22.760 --> 26:28.440
system that includes government control of the public, the command and control aspect.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.300
On the one side of the spectrum, he puts communism, socialism, and fascism as systems with high

26:32.300 --> 26:36.520
government control, and at the other end, he has this idealized version of a constitutional

26:36.520 --> 26:40.200
republic, which I guess is supposed to have minimal government control, I guess.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.200
I don't know.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.680
If that's the only factor that matters, then there should be no difference to Alex between

26:45.680 --> 26:49.400
anarcho-capitalism and libertarian socialism.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.040
Both advocate for the elimination of the centralized state, which would result in a system with

26:53.040 --> 26:57.040
even less governmental control over the public than exists in a republic.

26:57.040 --> 27:01.080
Both are conceived around people existing in a stateless world, characterized by voluntarily

27:01.080 --> 27:03.240
constructed groups.

27:03.240 --> 27:08.060
But obviously, these two ideologies have stark differences.

27:08.060 --> 27:11.760
One of the biggest is their stance on private property.

27:11.760 --> 27:15.120
Anarcho-capitalists believe the right to private property is essentially the bedrock of society,

27:15.120 --> 27:19.920
whereas libertarian socialists would view the accumulation of private property to be

27:19.920 --> 27:23.480
an instance of the same oppression one might face from the state, just being carried out

27:23.480 --> 27:25.440
by a private corporation.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.720
It's very obvious if you look at these two systems that Alex isn't really being honest

27:28.720 --> 27:30.240
about his political preferences.

27:30.240 --> 27:35.280
If there's two schools of thought which both eschew centralized governmental control, there

27:35.280 --> 27:40.880
are still political preferences that Alex has that are on the left-right spectrum.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.160
Private property is a matter of the left-right spectrum.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.840
While it's true that most center-left and center-right people tend to agree that private

27:46.840 --> 27:51.380
property ownership is good, that's not true when you go to the further ends of the spectrum.

27:51.380 --> 27:55.600
Further-left ideologies tend to favor communal ownership of private property or democratized

27:55.600 --> 27:56.600
workplaces.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.840
Conversely, further-right ideologies tend to believe that private property rights are

28:00.840 --> 28:04.960
inalienable human rights, and they have no problem with exploitative workplaces because

28:04.960 --> 28:08.080
employment is a voluntary relationship.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.480
Alex presents himself as being above the left-right paradigm because he wants you to think that

28:11.480 --> 28:17.120
he's talking about democrat-republican two-party system stuff that exists in the United States.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.960
He wants you to think that because most people are disenfranchised with that two-party system,

28:20.960 --> 28:23.420
and it's an easy thing to find agreement with.

28:23.420 --> 28:28.320
Most people would be like, yeah, you know, these aren't fully, they don't fully encapsulate

28:28.320 --> 28:29.320
my ideology.

28:29.320 --> 28:36.840
And if you look at it as like a line between the two parties, yes, that is an illusion.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.760
That's what he wants you to think, but that's not what he's talking about.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.760
It's important to recognize that, and recognize that he's a liar.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.600
When he says that he's above the left-right paradigm, what he's actually saying is that

28:47.600 --> 28:52.000
he hates government, that he lacks the political depth to coherently advocate for the form

28:52.000 --> 28:56.280
of anarchy that he would prefer, and so he just pretends that the answer is a constitutional

28:56.280 --> 28:57.280
republic.

28:57.280 --> 29:04.880
Yeah, I mean, I would also add into that, that level of, you know, the type of person

29:04.880 --> 29:10.640
who wants capitalism, but you know, they're not going to be the people grounded underneath

29:10.640 --> 29:12.120
the boot of capitalism.

29:12.120 --> 29:18.960
You know, look, listen, I think, you know, people shouldn't have all of this money.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.840
I mean, I should have all of this money, obviously, but people shouldn't have all this money,

29:23.840 --> 29:24.840
you know?

29:24.840 --> 29:29.640
Because again, you want to preserve so much of the system that gives you power over everybody

29:29.640 --> 29:35.960
else, instead of being like, look, I don't want any government, whoa, whoa, whoa, then

29:35.960 --> 29:40.960
people might steal my expensive things, you know, like that kind of feel.

29:40.960 --> 29:45.640
If you created his kind of left-right paradigm world within there, there'd still be fucking

29:45.640 --> 29:49.600
cops to protect his shit, so he doesn't have to.

29:49.600 --> 29:56.320
Like that's the kind of anarcho bullshit he's peddling, so yeah, fuck off.

29:56.320 --> 30:01.920
Yeah, I mean, what I would need from him is, okay, so if the question is command and control

30:01.920 --> 30:07.640
nonsense and like what amount the government controls the population, right, that is the

30:07.640 --> 30:10.880
relevant access upon which you can judge politics.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.880
That's it.

30:11.880 --> 30:16.120
If that's the case, then you need to explain to me why a constitutional republic is more

30:16.120 --> 30:21.320
preferable than an anarchist state, because that would be the complete elimination of

30:21.320 --> 30:24.640
this thing that you think is the bad.

30:24.640 --> 30:29.600
And then you'd have to argue, I guess if you're Alex, that a certain amount is important.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
And then, okay, why?

30:30.600 --> 30:35.640
He's like, well, because I like to control things or something, you know?

30:35.640 --> 30:36.640
Yeah, exactly.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.640
Because I want stuff.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.640
Yeah.

30:38.640 --> 30:44.000
And this doesn't even get into differentiation between personal and private property and

30:44.000 --> 30:47.780
how many left ideologies still believe in personal property.

30:47.780 --> 30:51.160
And the right does try to muddle those things a little bit.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.160
It's easy.

30:52.160 --> 30:57.300
But yeah, and I mean, this also isn't even getting into the differentiation between political

30:57.300 --> 31:03.080
and more economic models and how Alex is just playing fast and loose between all of them.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.840
You can have a fascist communist state.

31:05.840 --> 31:11.400
There's a government and an economic model there that's not a fascist or communist state.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.120
That's not how it works.

31:13.120 --> 31:19.000
And, I don't know, I just think when you hear stuff like this, what it does is it helps

31:19.000 --> 31:25.480
me understand a little bit more about these sort of elements of Alex's costume that he

31:25.480 --> 31:29.120
wears to try and trick people into thinking he's sensible.

31:29.120 --> 31:36.020
And that being above the left-right paradigm looks sensible, because you could say, Republicans

31:36.020 --> 31:37.800
and Democrats are all the same.

31:37.800 --> 31:42.280
They're beholden to corporate interests, special interest groups, and you can say that.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.800
And I think you can get a lot of people to be like, yeah, you know what?

31:45.800 --> 31:47.160
That makes some sense.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.000
But that's not what Alex is talking about.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
No, no.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.800
It's just a little bit of a disguise.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.800
Yeah.

31:52.800 --> 31:58.380
I mean, you can call yourself above the left-right paradigm fairly easily because a winning strategy

31:58.380 --> 32:04.260
for both Republicans and Democrats is to say, listen, the Republicans and the Democrats

32:04.260 --> 32:06.240
fucking suck.

32:06.240 --> 32:10.400
Elect me to be one of those Republicans or Democrats, you know, like it's a winning strategy.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.400
It kind of is.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.400
It's not hard.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.400
Yeah.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.400
Yeah.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.400
It does.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.400
It helps.

32:16.400 --> 32:17.400
It helps.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.400
What a pathetic world.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.240
But anyway, labels and words mean nothing.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.240
Yes.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.720
Communism, fascism, it means nothing, nothing.

32:24.720 --> 32:29.000
It's all strong man, thug, empire, get it straight.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.240
If your goal is to enlighten an audience or help them better understand the world around

32:32.240 --> 32:35.760
them and the political conversations that they're hearing, this is exactly the opposite

32:35.760 --> 32:37.600
of what you should do.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.260
Communism and fascism do definitely mean something.

32:40.260 --> 32:44.640
They are just words that describe imperial strongmen wearing different colored hats and

32:44.640 --> 32:48.960
convincing audiences that that's the case makes them entirely unprepared to deal with

32:48.960 --> 32:50.720
challenging political issues.

32:50.720 --> 32:54.320
Also, if you take Alex at his word, then the hallmarks of the sort of government that he

32:54.320 --> 32:58.780
hates and he does not want to exist is one that's run by a strongman or thug, which is

32:58.780 --> 32:59.960
an empire.

32:59.960 --> 33:04.440
I know hypocrisy means nothing, but by these standards, Donald Trump is precisely the candidate

33:04.440 --> 33:07.160
2003 Alex Jones would strongly oppose.

33:07.160 --> 33:12.000
In 2015, Alex knew Trump was connected to the mob and presented an image of a strongman

33:12.000 --> 33:13.240
as a facade.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.240
He put on this image.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.240
He was a fake strongman.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.240
Yeah.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.820
During the campaign, Trump made signals to being open to empire and Alex even defended

33:20.820 --> 33:24.720
Trump's desire to buy Greenland and claim space in the name of the United States.

33:24.720 --> 33:27.880
Come on, you want Greenland, you want space.

33:27.880 --> 33:33.180
Trump fails Alex's imaginary test that's allegedly above the left-right paradigm, but Alex still

33:33.180 --> 33:39.120
supports him because he actually passes Alex's real litmus test, which is heavily dependent

33:39.120 --> 33:40.480
on the left-right paradigm.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.600
Oh yeah.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.520
That's important to keep in mind, but it's important to remember that that's really what

33:45.520 --> 33:46.520
motivates him.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
Yeah.

33:47.520 --> 33:54.880
It's such a bummer that these concepts like communism and fascism and all of that stuff,

33:54.880 --> 34:02.000
things that really do take a book or multiple books or many, many books to understand clearly,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.280
let alone try and implement.

34:04.280 --> 34:10.440
And then you've got people who are just like, communism is this in a short sentence.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.400
That's going to muddy the waters.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.440
Nobody wants to read many, many books.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.440
Yeah.

34:15.440 --> 34:19.160
And I think you have that same problem on the reverse side.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.160
Oh yeah, totally.

34:20.160 --> 34:24.600
People promoting certain ideologies or systems, doing it overly simplistically.

34:24.600 --> 34:30.200
I think you run into similar issues of watering down meanings, confusing people.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.200
Yeah.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.480
And there's a lot of complexity and I'm not even sitting here pretending I understand

34:34.480 --> 34:37.920
fully every intricate aspect of theory.

34:37.920 --> 34:38.920
Right, right.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.920
No, no, no.

34:39.920 --> 34:40.920
Absolutely.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.160
It becomes, you know, why did Marx write Das Kapital?

34:44.160 --> 34:45.240
It's so big.

34:45.240 --> 34:49.440
He should have written a one page ad in the New York Times and we all still would have

34:49.440 --> 34:50.860
gotten it, right?

34:50.860 --> 34:52.200
That's how simple theory is.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.320
Hey capitalism, I got two words for you.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.320
Suck it.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.320
Yes, exactly.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.320
Yeah, done.

34:57.320 --> 35:04.000
So Alex jumps off this and goes on to another headline that I guess is the big news.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
But the big news when we get back, dead man left on gym floor while others exercise, just

35:09.000 --> 35:11.040
how people don't care anymore.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.280
This is a sad headline, but...

35:12.280 --> 35:13.280
That's the big news.

35:13.280 --> 35:17.640
Yeah, I'm not sure there's any place being part of the news roundup of a national radio

35:17.640 --> 35:18.640
show.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.120
I don't know.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.400
Single person hurt in accident.

35:22.400 --> 35:26.260
On shows like Alex's, you'll hear coverage like this a lot because it serves a couple

35:26.260 --> 35:29.120
of important emotional purposes for the audience.

35:29.120 --> 35:32.840
The first is that a straw man is created of the heartless people who could just exercise

35:32.840 --> 35:35.040
while a person next to them was dead.

35:35.040 --> 35:39.000
The listener gets to imagine how horrible these people are and feel morally superior

35:39.000 --> 35:41.120
to these imaginary people.

35:41.120 --> 35:44.760
The second is to demoralize the audience about the state of the world and erode their belief

35:44.760 --> 35:46.320
in their fellow persons.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.840
The goal is to present a situation where the audience hears this headline and they imagine

35:49.840 --> 35:53.540
that these people in the gym continued to work out fully aware that this person was

35:53.540 --> 35:56.320
dead because that's shitty of them.

35:56.320 --> 36:00.040
If they didn't know the person was dead and thought possibly he was just resting, then

36:00.040 --> 36:03.800
you can't really paint this as a story that highlights the moral degradation of the broader

36:03.800 --> 36:04.800
culture.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.400
It's really more just a situation where people are minding their own business at the gym

36:07.400 --> 36:09.680
and there's a tragic coincidence.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.480
People not bothering stranger.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.480
Yeah.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.680
It's sad and it's unfortunate, but it's not like...

36:15.680 --> 36:20.400
This is not a news story that illustrates how bad people are.

36:20.400 --> 36:26.200
Yeah, no, it's like he's trying to do a sequel to Boondock Saints, but it's about people

36:26.200 --> 36:28.880
at the gym who are just minding their own business.

36:28.880 --> 36:33.520
I've been to the gym many times and people could have been dead.

36:33.520 --> 36:40.320
There are people who I've seen laying, like, and your favorite word, supine.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.320
Supine.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.280
You're never gonna let me live that down.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.280
Nope.

36:44.280 --> 36:49.560
They're just laying there and obviously, you know, if you want to go poke them, you can,

36:49.560 --> 36:54.160
but also every time I have been around, they eventually get up because they've just been

36:54.160 --> 36:58.680
tired because they're working out.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.340
Imagine how many years someone does that.

37:01.340 --> 37:06.920
If you're listening to Alex Jones in 2003, right, and you're like taking this one story

37:06.920 --> 37:07.920
to heart.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.680
You've missed everything else he's ever said, but you got this one story.

37:10.680 --> 37:15.160
How many years are you poking people at the gym before maybe you find a dead guy?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.160
You know?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.160
Your whole life.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.160
Your whole life.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.160
You're never finding a dead guy.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.160
You're not finding people now.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.160
I bet you're not.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
You're an asshole.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.160
Yep.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.480
So Alex has Craig Roberts back on.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.400
And you'd have to try and explain it every time.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.400
Yeah.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
Oh, sorry.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
I thought you were dead.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.400
Sorry.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
I thought you were dead.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.240
In 2003, Alex Jones had this story where people watched everybody die and I'm just not gonna

37:33.240 --> 37:34.240
let it happen.

37:34.240 --> 37:38.360
Alex Jones convinced me that the only way to be a good person was to poke everybody.

37:38.360 --> 37:39.360
Exactly.

37:39.360 --> 37:47.320
So Alex has Craig Roberts back on, who is the conspiracy theorist type, and he was on

37:47.320 --> 37:53.000
partially because he's gonna be in Kansas City with Alex in this speech.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.880
And so, you know, there's a war going on in the world.

37:55.880 --> 38:01.680
This is obviously just a distraction from the financial collapse that's happening tomorrow.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.100
Gold.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.240
And then we hit a common theme.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.920
If they can keep us in a war, that'll divert us off the plunging economy and the shopping

38:09.920 --> 38:11.320
malls being empty.

38:11.320 --> 38:15.400
Because this, it's not just oil or weapons sales, it's about a global police state.

38:15.400 --> 38:20.040
From Russia to the US, governments are using the terror as a massive crackdown mechanism.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.640
We know Putin got caught blowing up buildings in Russia.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.440
Well, it's order out of chaos, not decaled.

38:25.440 --> 38:27.100
That's their motto.

38:27.100 --> 38:30.680
Every day, Putin and the apartment buildings come up.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.400
Every single day.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.400
In this stretch?

38:33.400 --> 38:34.400
Yeah.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
Every day.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.040
I have been keeping track.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.600
Not a single episode has gone by that hasn't come up multiple times.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.680
It makes me so mad.

38:41.680 --> 38:42.960
It makes me so mad.

38:42.960 --> 38:47.560
That's a cornerstone of his sort of reporting at this point.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.400
You can just do whatever you want.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.400
You certainly can.

38:50.400 --> 38:51.760
That's the lesson of America.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.980
If you're a psycho, you can do whatever the fuck you want.

38:54.980 --> 38:58.000
So at this point, Alex, he has his interview with Craig Robertson.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.600
It's kind of short and I don't really care.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.360
I don't find that guy very interesting.

39:02.360 --> 39:07.240
But what is interesting is that Alex then has an interview with his water filter sponsor.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.240
Oh no.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.480
Bad news coming out, bad economy, and people putting their money back in.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.640
Public indicators, there's no one at the stores.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.000
I go to CompUSA to buy something computer-wise.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
I go to the mall.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.360
There's no one there, Jim.

39:19.360 --> 39:25.880
Well and that's what, that's basically the story all the way through the economy.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.800
And they're saying is brace for massive terror attacks.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.800
We're going to get hit.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.800
Blah, blah, blah.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.760
People, you better get essentials.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.600
You better pick up the phone and get these water filters.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.080
You are nuts if you don't.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.640
Jim, tell them about the new.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.640
That's shameless.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
That's what they knew.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.640
That's an incredible new product.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.640
Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty shameless.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.280
That is, that is without shame.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.360
That is the definition of shameless.

39:48.360 --> 39:49.360
Yeah, yeah.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.880
Let's get those water filters and the sponsor on to scare people.

39:51.880 --> 39:52.880
They're going to be terrorist attacks.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.600
They want to scare you with all these terrorist attacks.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.100
Let me tell you something, people.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.560
The economy's collapsing so you need water filters.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.480
I'm not trying to scare you with terror attacks.

40:02.480 --> 40:06.480
I think that, you know, I think we've talked about this a little bit in the past, but I

40:06.480 --> 40:07.760
think it's been a really long time.

40:07.760 --> 40:12.400
Like, I think that there is a way to do what Alex is doing in a responsible way.

40:12.400 --> 40:17.200
You know, like be like, hey, you know, there, there are dangers in the world and you know,

40:17.200 --> 40:22.800
let's say if you have a family, it would be good to have a little bit of food stored in

40:22.800 --> 40:27.200
case of a natural disaster or something like when I was growing up, there was a worry about

40:27.200 --> 40:28.480
tornadoes in Missouri.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.480
Yeah.

40:29.480 --> 40:33.200
And so my parents had some canned food and water in the basement just as a, like, we

40:33.200 --> 40:36.360
never ended up needing it, but just in case it's there.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.360
Exactly.

40:37.360 --> 40:41.560
I always have an extra big bag of cat food on hand because I have a cat.

40:41.560 --> 40:42.560
Of course.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.640
And I don't want to run into a situation where something could happen and I'm not able to

40:45.640 --> 40:47.040
take care of this thing.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.040
Totally.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.680
I think that there is like a way to, it's not this though.

40:50.680 --> 40:51.680
No.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.800
This is exploitative and playing on people's fears.

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
Yeah.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.620
There, there's a, there's a version of this that is like looking at life responsibly and

40:58.620 --> 41:01.680
trying to be like, well, you may need this.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
Right.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.640
It's, it's not a terrible idea just in case.

41:05.640 --> 41:11.360
And the other side of it is this, like you're, you're stupid if you don't get these, these

41:11.360 --> 41:13.840
water filters because there's going to be terrorist attacks and the economy is going

41:13.840 --> 41:14.840
to collapse.

41:14.840 --> 41:15.840
Yeah.

41:15.840 --> 41:16.840
Yeah.

41:16.840 --> 41:23.660
It is unfortunate that that's like that combination of when commerce and capital met psychology

41:23.660 --> 41:27.520
and turned it into advertising and they're like, we can get more stuff if we emotionally

41:27.520 --> 41:30.480
manipulate people than if we provide them a rational argument.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.440
So we're going to emotionally manipulate them.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.540
The end.

41:34.540 --> 41:40.660
So the filter sponsor, he apparently just got some big news from a major scientist about

41:40.660 --> 41:42.240
how great his filters are.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.640
And Alex tries to set this up.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.520
Please tell me it's Dr. Fauci of all people.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.520
I wish.

41:46.520 --> 41:47.520
Why not?

41:47.520 --> 41:48.520
Let's throw that in there.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.520
No, I'm not that big of a witch.

41:49.520 --> 41:54.320
Um, no, but the, the, the filter sponsor doesn't have time to talk about this and listen to

41:54.320 --> 41:55.320
Alex's disappointment here.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.720
Okay, let's hear this.

41:56.720 --> 42:00.640
So it's really, you had a famous scientist do the test.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.640
Uh, that's correct.

42:02.640 --> 42:09.280
And um, well, Alex, I tell you what, I'm, I'm on a business trip and I've got to be

42:09.280 --> 42:14.600
somewhere in about 15 minutes, but if I can, uh, I'd like to give a little special out

42:14.600 --> 42:15.600
here.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.600
Sure.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.600
Go ahead, Jim.

42:17.600 --> 42:18.600
Okay.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.600
Very disappointed.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.600
Who is the famous scientist?

42:21.600 --> 42:27.160
One thing to say, you said a famous scientist, say the name, then give the ad.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.160
Yes.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.160
The end.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.160
This has been approved by Mary.

42:30.160 --> 42:34.520
Something, something, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.060
Watson and Crick.

42:36.060 --> 42:38.800
Jonas Salk approves of my water filters.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.440
Now we have a special running.

42:40.440 --> 42:41.440
Naturally, naturally.

42:41.440 --> 42:45.240
Anyway, Alex is another guest and this is something that he's been promoting all day.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.880
He's so excited to have this guy on.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.680
He is a Canadian journalist named Barry Zwicker.

42:49.680 --> 42:50.680
Okay.

42:50.680 --> 42:55.400
Uh, and uh, he does not like 9-11 and thinks 9-11 was an inside job and what have you.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.400
All right.

42:56.400 --> 43:01.120
And he's been playing him up as like the biggest deal, like a huge Canadian journalist, one

43:01.120 --> 43:02.960
of the most important in the world.

43:02.960 --> 43:03.960
Okay.

43:03.960 --> 43:06.640
And uh, so here's Barry's introduction to the proceedings.

43:06.640 --> 43:12.360
Well, listen, it's a real pleasure, Alex, I, uh, I, I encountered your face for the

43:12.360 --> 43:18.960
first time at the end of that new video, uh, called aftermath, you know, questions, unanswered

43:18.960 --> 43:19.960
questions from 9-11.

43:19.960 --> 43:25.720
I saw that video in San Francisco last month and I really liked what they had you as the

43:25.720 --> 43:33.620
last guy punching out a real call for people to wake up and uh, I really admired that.

43:33.620 --> 43:36.280
So Barry Zwicker is an interesting fellow.

43:36.280 --> 43:40.360
From everything I can tell, he was a pretty standard and accomplished Canadian journalist.

43:40.360 --> 43:44.880
He'd worked for mainstream outlets and then 9-11 happened and everything seems to have

43:44.880 --> 43:45.880
fallen apart.

43:45.880 --> 43:46.880
Uh oh.

43:46.880 --> 43:47.880
Zwicker decided that...

43:47.880 --> 43:48.880
He's like Dennis Miller.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.880
Yeah, yeah.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.780
Except I don't think that Zwicker's gone full hard right.

43:52.780 --> 43:54.680
Or that Dennis Miller was ever funny.

43:54.680 --> 43:56.320
I don't know if Zwicker's funny either.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.320
Fair.

43:57.320 --> 44:01.160
He decided that the mainstream media story about the attack wasn't real, but he did have

44:01.160 --> 44:03.720
a bit of a different angle on it than Alex.

44:03.720 --> 44:08.640
According to what he told reporter Terry Glavin in a 2006 interview, the end goal of the attack,

44:08.640 --> 44:12.160
carried out by the White House, was to create a war against Islam.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.160
Okay.

44:13.160 --> 44:14.160
That was the conspiracy.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.160
Well?

44:15.160 --> 44:19.720
In 2004, he would go on to make his own 9-11 film titled The Great Conspiracy, the 9-11

44:19.720 --> 44:21.960
news special you never saw.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.980
It's just as good and just as bad as every other 9-11 documentary and has a title that

44:25.980 --> 44:29.660
bears all the hallmarks of the early days of internet clickbait, before people really

44:29.660 --> 44:30.660
got good at it.

44:30.660 --> 44:31.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:31.660 --> 44:34.320
Before it turned into an art form into itself, yeah.

44:34.320 --> 44:37.680
Over the years, he's continued to be a 9-11 truther and generally the sort of person you

44:37.680 --> 44:40.760
can count on to call just about anything a false flag.

44:40.760 --> 44:45.420
I found a recent interview he did with the Global Research News Hour where he was discussing

44:45.420 --> 44:48.920
how the storming of the Capitol on January 6th was a false flag.

44:48.920 --> 44:49.920
Sure.

44:49.920 --> 44:53.960
I know you expected to hear him doing some Alex shtick, but it's the exact opposite.

44:53.960 --> 44:58.240
He was saying that the event was a false flag inspired or directed by Trump, which honestly

44:58.240 --> 44:59.240
makes no sense.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.240
No, I love it.

45:00.240 --> 45:03.500
The term false flag comes from the idea of a ship attacking someone while flying a different

45:03.500 --> 45:06.020
country's flag so that country gets blamed.

45:06.020 --> 45:09.280
If Trump had a bunch of people storming the Capitol wearing Trump hats, that's not a false

45:09.280 --> 45:10.280
flag.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.960
It's just a straight up correct flag.

45:11.960 --> 45:16.880
It does seem like that, unless you are implying that...

45:16.880 --> 45:25.920
So he's saying that Trump was also in on the setup of his own supporters in order to discredit

45:25.920 --> 45:27.920
his own ideology and support.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.120
No, I don't think so, because he doesn't like Trump.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.120
Right.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.560
But how could Trump be in on a false flag if that...

45:33.560 --> 45:34.560
That's what I'm saying.

45:34.560 --> 45:35.560
Semantically, it doesn't make sense.

45:35.560 --> 45:36.640
No, of course not.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.660
It's tough for me to say, but listening to that interview, it kind of feels like Zwicker

45:39.660 --> 45:43.160
is like an Alex Jones, but with opposite politics.

45:43.160 --> 45:46.680
He's making wildly unfounded assertions and claims that don't make sense, but he's also

45:46.680 --> 45:51.400
staunchly opposed to Trump and recognizes that systemic racism exists.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.400
Sure.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.400
Sure.

45:53.400 --> 45:54.400
Hooray.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.400
Yeah.

45:55.400 --> 45:59.280
His appearance here on Alex's show is a real moment that was possible in 2003, but probably

45:59.280 --> 46:00.280
not much later than that.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.280
Not these days, yeah.

46:01.280 --> 46:04.840
They felt like they were in agreement as far as 9-11 conspiracies were concerned, but they

46:04.840 --> 46:09.480
actually didn't agree on anything, because they're dreadfully far apart on the left-right

46:09.480 --> 46:12.480
paradigm.

46:12.480 --> 46:15.160
The left-right paradigm is fairly important in reality.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.440
It seems to be.

46:16.440 --> 46:22.840
If you judge everything based on something's position in terms of the right and left spectrum,

46:22.840 --> 46:24.600
then maybe that's a little bit reductive itself.

46:24.600 --> 46:25.600
Yeah.

46:25.600 --> 46:28.980
There are multiple axes upon which things can be judged, but pretending that that one

46:28.980 --> 46:31.640
doesn't exist is a real limitation.

46:31.640 --> 46:32.640
Fool's game.

46:32.640 --> 46:33.640
Fool's game, yeah.

46:33.640 --> 46:37.600
So Barry, oh boy, bam.

46:37.600 --> 46:41.880
Barry says something in this interview that if it were present day, Alex would lose his

46:41.880 --> 46:42.880
goddamn mind.

46:42.880 --> 46:43.880
Okay, I want to hear it.

46:43.880 --> 46:50.120
I happen, my hero happens to be a guy named Bertrand Russell, a dead British white philosopher,

46:50.120 --> 46:56.140
and he had his own Ten Commandments, and his first commandment is never lie to yourself.

46:56.140 --> 46:58.640
And I think that is the first and foremost commandment.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.640
Don't lie to yourself.

46:59.640 --> 47:04.120
Bertrand Russell, you got this left-wing globalism arm, and that's how they catch us all.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.600
They got the phony right wing, they got the phony left wing, but that's it for another

47:06.600 --> 47:07.600
discussion.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.600
But that is another discussion.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.040
So that's a huge tell for me that Alex doesn't believe his own bullshit.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.400
Yeah, what a cheater.

47:12.400 --> 47:16.880
According to Infowars lore, Bertrand Russell's writing outright admits that the globalists

47:16.880 --> 47:20.880
plan to drug, sterilize, and kill off most of the population.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.960
Russell is one of the old school globalists, according to Alex, who is instrumental in

47:23.960 --> 47:27.000
coming up with and publicizing their evil plans.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.160
I can understand wanting to have a polite interview, and I do think that there are times

47:30.160 --> 47:32.700
just to agree to disagree about things.

47:32.700 --> 47:36.700
For instance, if Barry thought that the 9-11 planes were remote controlled and Alex felt

47:36.700 --> 47:40.520
they were piloted by the hijackers, they could go ahead and agree to disagree without having

47:40.520 --> 47:42.560
a gigantic problem sitting on the table.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.180
They may have a disagreement, but not a fundamental contradiction.

47:46.180 --> 47:47.960
Not a deal breaker, if you will.

47:47.960 --> 47:48.960
Right.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.240
Barry isn't just saying that he kinda likes Bertrand Russell.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.920
He says Russell is his hero.

47:53.920 --> 47:57.640
Barry is a guy who's worked for major papers, and he's taught college courses, so it stands

47:57.640 --> 48:01.880
to reason that if he says that Bertrand Russell is his hero, he's probably read as much or

48:01.880 --> 48:04.180
more of his writing than Alex has.

48:04.180 --> 48:07.380
This is why, to me, this cannot be an agree-to-disagree moment.

48:07.380 --> 48:11.840
In order for Alex to maintain all the narratives he has in play, he has to be agreeing to disagree

48:11.840 --> 48:17.280
about his guest hero-worshipping a guy who he has read, discussing the plans to kill

48:17.280 --> 48:19.720
off most of the human population.

48:19.720 --> 48:23.640
There's no other reasonable conclusion to come to with the information provided, other

48:23.640 --> 48:27.680
than that Barry is an enthusiastic fan of globalist conspiracies.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.680
He loves him.

48:28.680 --> 48:30.280
Alex should want to fight him.

48:30.280 --> 48:34.000
It does seem like Alex is like, okay, okay, I get it.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.320
We agree that 9-11 was an inside job.

48:37.320 --> 48:44.800
So I'm going to gloss over the fact that your hero is the architect of killing everybody

48:44.800 --> 48:48.400
so we can really get to the bottom of this 9-11 thing.

48:48.400 --> 48:52.920
You might be missing the forest for the fallen trees, if you will.

48:52.920 --> 48:53.920
Yeah.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.680
Alex knows that there's nothing he can do, and he can't really fight him on this, because

48:56.680 --> 48:58.440
he knows that Barry's read Bertrand Russell.

48:58.440 --> 48:59.440
Yeah, he doesn't know anything about Bertrand Russell.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.320
He's probably way more conversant on the subject than Alex is.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.320
It'd be very embarrassing.

49:03.320 --> 49:07.480
But Alex also knows that if he presses the issue, he risks revealing that his shit about

49:07.480 --> 49:08.840
Russell is made up.

49:08.840 --> 49:12.200
But he also knows that he can't just let a statement like that stand.

49:12.200 --> 49:16.200
And thus, you end up with his middle ground, his spineless agreeing to disagree about one

49:16.200 --> 49:20.480
of the top thinkers of the gigantic demonic conspiracy that Alex has made his entire career

49:20.480 --> 49:22.560
about fighting happening.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.560
It's ridiculous.

49:23.560 --> 49:27.840
Yeah, yeah, because if you're saying that you're above the left-right paradigm, you

49:27.840 --> 49:34.480
should be more unhappy with the plan instead of being like, well, there's globalists on

49:34.480 --> 49:35.480
the left.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.480
There's globalists on the right.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.480
What are you going to do?

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
Hey, you win some, you lose some.

49:38.480 --> 49:39.880
Stuck in the middle with Barry.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.880
Yeah, exactly.

49:40.880 --> 49:41.880
Yeah.

49:41.880 --> 49:46.680
I think that, I mean, obviously this is me just sort of spitballing and coming up with

49:46.680 --> 49:49.240
what I think is the most likely explanation for this.

49:49.240 --> 49:53.920
And that is that I think that Alex's branding at this point is so dependent on him being

49:53.920 --> 49:57.600
able to pretend this left-right paradigm thing is an illusion.

49:57.600 --> 50:02.560
So for him to have someone who's ostensibly a 9-11 conspiracy theorist who's on the left,

50:02.560 --> 50:07.840
or who has left tendencies and left politics, I don't think he wants to fight with that

50:07.840 --> 50:08.840
guy.

50:08.840 --> 50:13.320
I think it's really important for them to have some kind of an appearance of an alliance,

50:13.320 --> 50:17.400
especially with the way that Alex has been building him up as this big, giant reporter

50:17.400 --> 50:21.560
and super important person in Canada.

50:21.560 --> 50:30.920
And so I think that that takes precedence over this guy's hero is one of your main villains.

50:30.920 --> 50:34.680
He can't think that Barry isn't aware of Bertrand Russell.

50:34.680 --> 50:38.120
He can't think that he hasn't read the same things that Alex has read.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.120
Right.

50:39.120 --> 50:42.700
Well, I mean, because Alex is taking advantage of that.

50:42.700 --> 50:46.280
So the enemy of my enemy is not my friend.

50:46.280 --> 50:50.240
And you can prove that because Alex is taking advantage of people thinking that the enemy

50:50.240 --> 50:51.960
of my enemy is my friend.

50:51.960 --> 50:52.960
Yep.

50:52.960 --> 50:53.960
It's fairly simple.

50:53.960 --> 50:54.960
Open and shut case.

50:54.960 --> 50:55.960
Yeah.

50:55.960 --> 50:56.960
Yeah.

50:56.960 --> 50:57.960
Yeah.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.480
So they take some calls with Barry and this guy really, really creeped me out.

51:00.480 --> 51:02.440
This guy is so creepy.

51:02.440 --> 51:04.920
Let's talk to Bill in Alaska.

51:04.920 --> 51:05.960
You're on the air with our guests.

51:05.960 --> 51:06.960
Go ahead.

51:06.960 --> 51:07.960
Yes, sir.

51:07.960 --> 51:08.960
Alex.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.240
I just had to call in.

51:10.240 --> 51:17.480
I got an enemy that hasn't been mentioned yet on today's show.

51:17.480 --> 51:21.120
And the American people want to know why this is like this.

51:21.120 --> 51:24.760
All they got to do is look in the mirror.

51:24.760 --> 51:30.840
Jim Jones in the case in point, I don't believe he was as guilty as the people that followed

51:30.840 --> 51:31.840
him.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
Oh.

51:32.840 --> 51:37.800
He couldn't have been a bad leader if he hadn't had followers.

51:37.800 --> 51:38.800
Okay.

51:38.800 --> 51:39.800
Creep.

51:39.800 --> 51:40.800
Wow.

51:40.800 --> 51:41.800
Wow.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.000
You're going to need to sell me a lot more on that one.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
He does not.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.840
You're going to need a lot more salesmanship on that take.

51:47.840 --> 51:52.000
I will tell you delivery and content both creepy as hell.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.400
That's no good.

51:54.400 --> 52:00.120
I don't like a fucking bit player from Bonanza from Alaska telling me that Jim Jones was

52:00.120 --> 52:01.120
a good leader.

52:01.120 --> 52:05.880
Hey, in terms of death cults, man, in terms of like mass suicide cults, don't hate the

52:05.880 --> 52:06.880
player, hate the game.

52:06.880 --> 52:07.880
What is happening?

52:07.880 --> 52:09.680
I don't know.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.920
Here's the problem.

52:10.920 --> 52:11.920
People follow Jim Jones.

52:11.920 --> 52:16.640
If he wasn't such a good leader, then they wouldn't have followed him, so it's their

52:16.640 --> 52:17.640
fault.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.640
What?

52:18.640 --> 52:19.640
Okay.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.640
All right.

52:20.640 --> 52:21.640
All right.

52:21.640 --> 52:25.720
I'm the Alaskan cowboy here to tell you about death cults.

52:25.720 --> 52:37.120
So the rest of the calls are kind of boring, but then the interview takes a turn hard south

52:37.120 --> 52:41.040
when Barry starts talking about his new DVD that he's been selling.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.040
Okay.

52:42.040 --> 52:45.280
We're having an incredible...

52:45.280 --> 52:50.280
It looks like we're moving toward 500 sales.

52:50.280 --> 52:55.000
We have an equation here in Canada, it's called the 10% thing, because the population of Canada

52:55.000 --> 52:59.280
is about one-tenth of the population of USA, so whatever happens to the states, we usually

52:59.280 --> 53:01.040
divide it by 10 and figure that's normal.

53:01.040 --> 53:02.040
Okay.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.400
For those that don't know, you're a national television host.

53:03.400 --> 53:07.040
You do this on your own and you write for newspapers and you just put together this

53:07.040 --> 53:12.200
video and believe me, it'll be a lot more than 500 if you get the word out, but...

53:12.200 --> 53:14.960
That is awful.

53:14.960 --> 53:17.440
Like Alex straight up laughs at him.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.080
He's a little 500.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.080
Yeah.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.240
Yeah, that was not a, I'm laughing with you.

53:22.240 --> 53:23.240
No.

53:23.240 --> 53:25.760
That was an, I'm laughing at you.

53:25.760 --> 53:29.720
That was an almost uncontrollable response to like...

53:29.720 --> 53:31.080
You fucking shit.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.080
Oh no.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.080
500.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.320
Get out of here.

53:35.320 --> 53:39.760
And there's also the problem of like, alright, even the rule of tens, he's a little 5,000?

53:39.760 --> 53:42.520
That's still not great for what Alex is presenting.

53:42.520 --> 53:43.520
No.

53:43.520 --> 53:47.560
And so what that does is it pierces the illusion that Alex has created about this guy throughout

53:47.560 --> 53:48.560
the...

53:48.560 --> 53:53.120
He's a national writer, he's been on TV, he's the biggest, most important journalist in

53:53.120 --> 54:00.480
Canada and he can get upwards of 500, well upwards of 499 people to really get these.

54:00.480 --> 54:01.480
Yeah.

54:01.480 --> 54:02.480
Yeah.

54:02.480 --> 54:08.560
And it really hurts the facade, and you can tell that there is a tonal change in Alex

54:08.560 --> 54:13.880
after this specific number has been given, because it's like, I can't, I can't...

54:13.880 --> 54:15.000
Now you're nothing to me.

54:15.000 --> 54:22.800
He can't pretend that he is Rush Limbaugh of Canada if he's only moving those many units.

54:22.800 --> 54:27.600
My audience just, I can't deny that math.

54:27.600 --> 54:33.340
And so it's, you know, it is what it is, and it doesn't go much longer.

54:33.340 --> 54:38.000
But Alex does finish out this episode with some fairly standard complaining.

54:38.000 --> 54:43.520
A number of people detained is on the rise in Russia to Stalinist levels, it says here

54:43.520 --> 54:45.080
in the Moscow Times.

54:45.080 --> 54:52.040
Just total slavery over there, but they don't call it communism, they call it crony capitalism.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.920
Same thing, command and control.

54:53.920 --> 55:00.120
Alex brings up the Putin bombings at least four times in this episode, like it's really

55:00.120 --> 55:01.160
excessive.

55:01.160 --> 55:05.080
And then he says this about the Russian state, I find this fascinating because in the present

55:05.080 --> 55:09.360
day when he's trying to defend Putin, Alex will say that Russia isn't a globalist country,

55:09.360 --> 55:12.440
it's a system of crony capitalism, it's a positive thing now.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.200
Or at least it's not as bad as globalism.

55:15.200 --> 55:20.320
Crony capitalism isn't a negative command and control system in the present day to Alex.

55:20.320 --> 55:24.040
I could speculate about what the reason for this change is, but honestly I would just

55:24.040 --> 55:25.040
be guessing.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.040
It's a glaring difference though.

55:26.040 --> 55:27.040
Yeah.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.040
It's pretty weird.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.040
Pretty weird.

55:29.040 --> 55:30.040
I don't know.

55:30.040 --> 55:31.040
Yeah.

55:31.040 --> 55:34.880
So the 16th is Friday, and Alex is en route to Kansas City.

55:34.880 --> 55:35.880
Sure.

55:35.880 --> 55:40.200
He's going to speak at the local radio station, and he's not in studio.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.920
What's that, a six hour drive?

55:41.920 --> 55:42.920
From Austin?

55:42.920 --> 55:43.920
Yeah.

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
I have no idea.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.480
And I think it's more.

55:46.480 --> 55:47.480
I think it's probably more.

55:47.480 --> 55:48.480
It's probably more.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.480
It's probably a nine hour drive.

55:49.480 --> 55:54.200
I don't know if he's actually driving, because I think he said he flew back.

55:54.200 --> 55:55.200
I don't know.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.200
I don't care.

55:56.200 --> 55:57.200
Anyway.

55:57.200 --> 55:58.200
The point is he takes Friday off.

55:58.200 --> 55:59.200
I'm just here to distract you with weird questions.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.200
Yeah.

56:00.200 --> 56:03.200
He takes Friday off, and then he comes back on Monday, because I don't think he has a

56:03.200 --> 56:04.200
Sunday show at this point.

56:04.200 --> 56:09.960
So he comes back on Monday, and here we go.

56:09.960 --> 56:11.600
Completely different subject.

56:11.600 --> 56:18.320
There are now mainstream news articles reporting on what we've been saying for years.

56:18.320 --> 56:23.280
The evidence of mind control triggers in the Matrix films.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.960
And here it is.

56:24.960 --> 56:27.720
We've been saying this for about three years.

56:27.720 --> 56:30.160
And here it is in the mainstream news.

56:30.160 --> 56:38.440
Did you know that Malvo, the supposed sniper who looks like a mind control victim, is out

56:38.440 --> 56:43.880
there now saying that that is certainly involved.

56:43.880 --> 56:45.640
Wonder how we knew about this three years ago.

56:45.640 --> 56:52.040
Well, there's just a lot of key indicators, and of course Harris and the others involved

56:52.040 --> 56:56.920
there in the Columbine situation were obsessed with the Matrix.

56:56.920 --> 57:00.920
And we'll be discussing it a little bit later.

57:00.920 --> 57:04.320
It could be a coincidence, but somehow I doubt it.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.320
Okay.

57:05.320 --> 57:07.920
Could be a coincidence, but I doubt it.

57:07.920 --> 57:10.680
This is nonsense.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.280
I gotta tell you.

57:12.280 --> 57:16.560
The first hour of this show is basically just Alex saying over and over again that the new

57:16.560 --> 57:19.920
Treasury Secretary has been bad-mouthing the dollar.

57:19.920 --> 57:24.200
And this is leading to it collapsing in relation to the Euro.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.200
Fine.

57:25.200 --> 57:31.160
And this is the only thing that seemed actually even interesting in about the first hour.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.760
It is a desert.

57:32.760 --> 57:33.760
Wow.

57:33.760 --> 57:34.760
Wow.

57:34.760 --> 57:37.480
19th was a tough walk.

57:37.480 --> 57:42.480
It's so great whenever people are like, oh, the Matrix is mind control.

57:42.480 --> 57:47.000
And then you're like, okay, well, 20 years ago the Manchurian Candidate was telling us

57:47.000 --> 57:52.240
that the mind control is happening, and then 20 years before that, and you're like, I just

57:52.240 --> 57:54.440
don't care what you think about movies.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.520
I just don't care.

57:56.520 --> 58:01.540
And look, I would say that probably the Matrix has some ideas that are explored, maybe not

58:01.540 --> 58:05.800
as eloquently as they could have been, and maybe that confuses some people.

58:05.800 --> 58:12.880
Further, it has an aesthetic that a lot of people adopt, and maybe you could trace those

58:12.880 --> 58:15.560
things to some of these shooters.

58:15.560 --> 58:16.560
I don't know.

58:16.560 --> 58:22.320
I also think that, generally speaking, when you have somebody, like, there are a couple

58:22.320 --> 58:27.240
stories that Alex brings up, and it's people who shot somebody and then said they were

58:27.240 --> 58:31.360
trying to flee the Matrix in order to get an insanity plea.

58:31.360 --> 58:37.360
I'm not positive necessarily how these cases shook out, and how much of that was just a

58:37.360 --> 58:38.960
defense argument.

58:38.960 --> 58:39.960
Right.

58:39.960 --> 58:40.960
Do you know what I'm saying?

58:40.960 --> 58:41.960
Yeah.

58:41.960 --> 58:44.240
Seems like something that could have been a popular defense.

58:44.240 --> 58:46.400
I'll toss that out.

58:46.400 --> 58:51.800
What if I either plead guilty, because everybody saw me do it, or I'm going to shoot my shot.

58:51.800 --> 58:56.720
You know, your shot, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, though, Dan.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.720
It's true.

58:57.720 --> 58:58.720
It's true.

58:58.720 --> 58:59.720
Gretzky.

58:59.720 --> 59:00.720
That's what everybody else, that's what they're saying.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.720
Anyway.

59:01.720 --> 59:02.720
Gretzky's dad.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.720
Dad Gretzky?

59:03.720 --> 59:04.720
So, yeah.

59:04.720 --> 59:11.480
I was excited, at least, to hear about Alex's thoughts about the Matrix.

59:11.480 --> 59:12.480
Sure.

59:12.480 --> 59:13.480
He doesn't get into them.

59:13.480 --> 59:14.840
Of course not.

59:14.840 --> 59:15.840
It's a real desert.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.840
I was walking around-

59:16.840 --> 59:20.400
Wait, this is 2003, so Reloaded hadn't even come out yet, right?

59:20.400 --> 59:21.400
It's about to.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.400
It's about to.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
I think it just came out.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
It just came out.

59:24.400 --> 59:25.400
That's why he's-

59:25.400 --> 59:27.440
Alex does say, like, I'm going to try and go see the Matrix tonight.

59:27.440 --> 59:28.440
Sure, sure.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.680
So it is out in theaters, but, yeah, Reloaded didn't just come out.

59:31.680 --> 59:35.320
And actually, I was going back through it, because I was looking over the plots of those

59:35.320 --> 59:39.680
movies and I was like, I'm not sure I saw the third one.

59:39.680 --> 59:42.000
This plot seems foreign to me.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.560
Oh, look, you could watch it again and you'd be like, I don't think this is- and then you

59:46.560 --> 59:47.720
would forget it tomorrow.

59:47.720 --> 59:50.040
I definitely saw the second one, because I remember The Architect.

59:50.040 --> 59:51.040
Yeah.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
Like, I remember that stuff.

59:52.040 --> 59:53.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
But I-

59:54.040 --> 59:55.680
Vocabulary instead of writing?

59:55.680 --> 59:56.680
Hmm.

59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.760
I- sure I saw the third one, because I know if I saw the first two, I would want to finish

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760
it.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.320
Oh, the third one, you know, it's Jesus and then you move on.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.960
But I don't- I was reading the plot, I'm like, I don't remember that.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.120
Yeah, no, I think- okay, let me see if I can-

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.680
I think I've seen the final fight scene, like, just in a YouTube video or something like

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.560
that, but I don't think I've- I saw the plot, I'm like, I don't remember that.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.520
How much do you remember from the plot that you read?

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.120
I'm going to see if I can't off the dome the third Matrix, alright?

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.360
I remember broad strokes of it.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.360
Okay.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.360
So you can give it a try.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.360
Alright, here we go.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.040
It opens up, Neo had just passed out, because in the second one he turns out he can use

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.080
electric powers in the real world.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.080
Right, right, right.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.600
They wake up and he's actually in the Matrix, even though he's not plugged into the Matrix.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.240
Because he's in the sickbay or whatever.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240
Exactly.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.380
So then, eventually he wakes up and blah blah blah, they meet in the Matrix, they come out,

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:55.760
he and what's-her-face, they both go on Trinity, they both go on a suicide mission into the

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.480
evil place, right?

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.940
They fly up over into the sky and they're like, ah!

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:06.120
In the meantime, at Zion, the final attack is going on and all the fucking, oh no, and

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.600
there's all these blah blah blah blah blah, and that goes on for a while.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.640
From what I understand, so far, so good.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.480
Yeah, there's a guy and he's like po cho cho cho cho, and they got these weird mech suits

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.020
and then there's some heroic action because it's a war and it's a movie and you gotta

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020
do that.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:26.800
And then Neo and Trinity, they make it through, Neo and the AI are both like, hey man, this

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.080
Agent Smith dude is fucking out of control, right?

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:36.720
So the AI plugs the Neo into the AI and they're like, you better solve this fucking problem,

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.720
right?

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:47.520
So he winds up being absorbed by Agent Orange Smith after a massive, useless, pointless

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.560
fight, and then the AI is like blowing them all up and they start over and everybody finally

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.200
breaks the cycle and everything's cool for a while at least.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.080
I think that's basically it.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080
Yeah.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080
I'm out of breath.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.440
The part that when I was reading over the plot, I was like, I don't remember this at

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440
all.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.440
What's that?

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.120
Was Neo negotiating with the robots.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.200
Oh, you don't remember?

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200
That's what I'm talking about.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200
Yeah.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.360
And the robot's face comes out and it's all like, and the robot's mad.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.360
No, I don't remember that.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360
It was terrible.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360
I don't remember that at all.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.360
Yeah.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.360
It was weird.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.080
The robot AI did a lot of roaring, which seems like a weird thing for the AI to be

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080
into.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.320
No, because the AI would know what would intimidate a human.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.960
Yeah, but it seems like, I don't know.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.360
He doesn't even have eyes anymore.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.920
So why would you?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:39.720
He can see.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.120
I'm excited for the fourth one.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120
That's all I'm saying.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120
There's a fourth one?

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120
It's coming.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120
That's right.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120
I remember hearing that.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120
Yeah.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.760
I'm going to watch the third one and see if I've seen it because that seemed like, I can't

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.080
believe that was the plot.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.080
Oh, it's bad.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.080
I don't know.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080
It's real bad.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.880
I don't know if it sounded bad on paper.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880
Like it sounds bad.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.880
In execution?

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.880
It does.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880
In execution?

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880
It's bad.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.840
I do wonder if the, like, I don't, I don't think, I mean, I'll defend slightly reloaded.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.400
Like I think that's not as bad as maybe some people have said.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.600
I mean, there are some fun things.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.720
The twins were cool.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720
Sure.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.880
They, they turned invisible for a while and then they showed up.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.880
That was fun.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.880
Yeah.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.120
I got to watch that third one.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.160
We should do that as like a live stream.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.160
As a live stream?

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160
Yeah, I'll do that.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.220
I'll watch the Matrix Revelations video.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.200
See if I actually saw it when I was younger.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200
I'm in.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.800
Anyway, Alex doesn't get into talking about this much, but he does have some other news

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.760
that's fresh from the Bureau desk that's in his imagination.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.760
Okay.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.240
Another saying, forget about ever capturing Saddam.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.960
These are all staged events.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.400
Saddam worked for the CIA starting in 1958.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.720
Looks like they gave him the amnesty deal and, uh, during the campaign, he had requested

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.200
it and been refused it and told that if he tried to flee, he would be arrested or assassinated

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.660
and looks like in the midst of the war over there, uh, they cut a deal and all resistance

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.000
melted away.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.240
So Alex is reporting, uh, basically that, uh, you know, Saddam got an amnesty deal.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.240
Yeah.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240
Yeah.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240
Uh huh.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.800
Oh, I don't know who negotiated that one.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.800
I think they left a few people out of the negotiations if he got an amnesty deal.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.920
I think Alex negotiated this with himself.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.560
I think that might've been the case.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.560
So here on the 19th, we've got another familiar theme.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.780
Vladimir Putin was caught in 99 attacking his own soft targets.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.220
That is apartment buildings.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.480
Rebuildings were blown up.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.280
They said the Chechny and the Chechny and screamed, why would we do that and bring on

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.280
an attack?

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.880
No, the Russian government's doing it.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.320
And then Moscow police, not knowing what the other hand was doing, the left hand, not knowing

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.600
what the right hand was doing, caught members of the FSB, the modern KGB that Putin was

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:07.520
heading up for Boris Yeltsin, caught them in the building, planting hexagon explosives.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.840
They got the explosives, arrested them, and then they were raided by, the police station

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:20.760
was raided in Moscow by paramilitary forces from the KGB slash FSB GRU.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.760
So here's the thing.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.040
When Alex talks about these ideas that he has about Putin, he is not talking about just

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.120
like, I have a vague sense that that guy's bad.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.120
No, no, no, no.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:35.240
He's talking about things that are concrete events that he knows to be true.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:40.440
Now, for him to change his position on this, he needs to show his work.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.880
He needs to explain why is that no longer true?

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880
Right, right.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.280
Were you wrong here or did these events, do you have a new explanation for all of this?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280
Sure, yeah.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.280
And he doesn't ever do that.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.280
He just sort of switches.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:59.140
And it's nuts to me to go back and listen to this and see just how consistently it is

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:02.800
just like, fucking Putin, he's false flagging around.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:10.640
Yeah, it would be ironic if what seems to be one of the main pillars of his everything

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.120
is a false flag thing, because these are documented events where you're like, yeah, Putin did

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.820
that shit.

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:27.360
So his main evidence that you can follow up on is now not at all mentioned and wiped away,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.700
despite the fact that he still claims that everything is a false flag.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.700
Just not that.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.700
That's strange.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:38.440
It would be ironic if you weren't aware that he's just a psycho, that none of this matters,

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.880
and he's going to use whatever he feels like using however he feels like using it.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.480
So it's completely within his character.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:50.200
And this also seems a bit more like what you would expect from somebody who's like this

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:55.960
anti-communist crusader type, you know, like Russia and China are evil, as opposed to like,

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.880
ah, China's evil, but Russia's actually really cool.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.280
Yeah, Russia's pretty sweet.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.280
Yeah, I don't know, it's, I want to learn more about this.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.680
I like how they keep those women from talking in churches, it makes me feel good.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:13.080
I want to learn more about this, but I don't really know much more than Alex will not stop

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.320
talking about Putin blowing up the apartment buildings in 2003.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:22.880
There's not really a lot more, like sort of detail to it, but I'm keeping my eyes open

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.400
and I'll let you know if anything comes up.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.440
In a very short, has he already been on RT a bunch, or is this, is like in a very short

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.680
period of time he will go on RT a bunch?

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.480
I'm not sure when he started appearing on that, I know he does after this.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480
So I would imagine after.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.480
I doubt he hasn't been on yet.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.680
I doubt they're like, eh, let's see what Alex has to say today.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.120
I would guess not.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:51.360
So Alex is another guest at this point, it's Dennis Cuddy, he's another conspiracy New

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.520
World Order guy.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.080
I love his kids' music.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.960
Basically, Kid Cuddy?

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.960
I like his wife, Dr. Cuddy, from House of Beads.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.960
There we go.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960
There we go.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.960
Now you're playing the game.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:09.040
So he's on for like the rest of the show and it's just rambling about basic ass New World

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.260
Order conspiracy talking points.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.560
It's a lot of the same stuff we covered in the Endgame documentary and it bored the hell

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.560
out of me.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.840
That said, it's a far cry from the content that Alex produces these days.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.600
This is at very least a show that's striving to be about an alleged conspiracy.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:29.000
It goes off track pretty regularly, it provides horrible information, and it ignores stories

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.280
in favor of headlines, but huge chunks of time are devoted to talking about a vague

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.140
unsourced accusation about like the Bilderberg Group and Bohemian Grove.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:42.200
So we're not going to talk too much about this interview, but there is one very important

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.200
moment.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.200
Mic down for this.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:50.920
They used facilitators through various Delphi techniques to do this, and Edward Bernays,

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:56.120
who was hired by William Paley in 1928 as his chief advisor with CBS, wrote a book called

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120
Propaganda.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.720
And in that book he said, we're like an invisible government, we know how to manipulate you,

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:08.120
and at the end he says, sort of like Ross Perot, he says, we need a businessman politician

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.680
type to say, I must lead the people, am I not their servant?

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:19.040
Here's what you say you want, and it's really facilitated.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040
Please continue.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040
Alex is eating.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.200
Alex is eating!

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.400
I'd not heard that in 2003.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400
Please continue.

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.400
Yeah.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.040
So Alex is clearly eating there, but also that also is funny.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.920
Love your stuff, keep growing, keep growing.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.240
Also the content of that is pretty funny.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.120
Yeah, that he's, it's kind of funny that I already brought up advertising and psychology

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.960
and then 20 minutes later he's like, Edward Bernays!

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.040
And also the businessman leader.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.680
Yeah, that one is hard to look away from.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.680
Yeah.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.400
Alex should listen to some of his old episodes, I think he would be horrified.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:01.280
So a caller calls in, he and Cuddy take calls, and one of the things that I noticed actually

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.080
when I was listening to this is like, Cuddy is old school, like with his New World Order

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080
stuff.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.120
He has the, all the talking points that you'd expect to hear on old time New World Order

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.560
conspiracy shows, and I was like, this guy, I bet he knows Bill Cooper.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.360
And so I was looking through the Hour of the Time archives, and he's been on, like back

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.040
in 96 he was on Hour of the Time, like yep, that checks out.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.040
Wow.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040
Yeah.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.040
I wonder what he does for a day job.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.120
I think he writes books, probably goes on speaking things, I don't know.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.680
How do you get that scam?

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:40.400
Anyway, there's a caller who calls in, and Alex has reported that Saddam Hussein has

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.400
got a plea deal.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.400
Sure.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:48.960
And this caller says that one of our old friends, Joel Skousen, is reporting on something a

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.880
little bit different.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:57.600
Skoulnik is reported by Joel Skousen as saying that Saddam Hussein has been moved and is

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.080
located now in the side of the United States.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:09.280
Well, the evidence from the evidence, John, the evidence shows that he was probably taken

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280
down to Russia.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.800
They probably gave him the amnesty deal in the middle of the fight, they can still try

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.960
a double though, so look out.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:21.400
So this is the first reference I've had to someone bringing up Skousen, which is interesting,

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:26.620
that it's taken, you know, we're 19 days into the month of, you know, where we begin in

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:31.680
2003, and you know, such a familiar face in other periods of time, and this is the first

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.760
reference to him.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.080
And he thinks that Saddam's in the United States, Alex says nah nah nah nah nah, Russia.

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.480
So they're both wrong.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.560
Oh man, these guys, these guys, and also that ending of just leaving it open for, now there

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.520
could also be a double cross, you never know, anything could be true.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.900
Right now the evidence of which I have none is all pointing towards this place that I

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.520
just made up, so there we go.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.680
So you have, you have Cuddy, who's been on in the month of May 2003 already, and you

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.920
also had Colonel Craig Roberts, who was on, who's been on before, so you have some familiar

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:15.580
faces starting to, like, appear to be there, but none of the familiar faces that we know.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:20.200
You know, I haven't seen any mention of Steve Pechenik, I haven't heard anything about Joel

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.760
Skousen, well I guess we just got some Skousen, but Paul Craig Roberts, you know, couple of

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.940
other folks who were like, Webster Tarpley, these kinds, Jerome Corsi, these folks are

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:38.600
not figures in Alex's world at this point, or at least have not made themselves known.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.040
There's another person who also has not made himself known yet, and I found it very confusing

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.720
that this is the first mention I've seen of him.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.800
Yes, very good show today, my question's a little bit off topic, but I was wondering

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.120
if either one of you happen to know what might have happened to Bob Chapman, the gold expert?

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.440
No, I don't.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.960
No, I don't know.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.960
What?

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.560
We've had Bob on as a guest, but he's still writing his newsletters, basically he's been

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.640
criticizing the bankers and they're a little bit angry with him, but go ahead.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.400
Okay, that was basically my question.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.540
So I find it very curious that Alex takes this tone when this caller brings up Bob

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.540
Chapman.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:17.120
For those who haven't heard the episodes covering other periods of time, Bob Chapman is one

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.160
of Alex's most regular guests for a stretch of years leading up to his death in 2012.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.320
He's an alleged precious metals expert who Alex used as a scene partner when doing extended

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.040
commercials for Midas Resources, the gold sales company that syndicated Alex's show.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.160
Also, Bob claims to have been invited to a screening of a film of Ronald Reagan getting

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.160
pegged.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.160
True.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.520
For years, Bob was on Alex's show every Friday.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.640
Outside of people who host the fourth hour, it's tough for me to think of anyone else

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.920
who had what amounts to basically a standing engagement on Alex's schedule.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.120
To hear Alex saying he doesn't know what's up with him and sounding like he doesn't want

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.820
to talk about it in 2003 is really weird.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:58.640
Things get even weirder when you consult issues of his newsletter, The International Forecaster,

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.480
from back in 2003.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:06.400
They're not all available online, but there are two that I could find from 2003, January

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:12.000
2003, and even back then, Bob clearly had a working relationship with Midas Resources.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.680
Quote, special offer, you may also order it, and it's in reference to the book The Beast

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:21.080
from Jekyll Island, by calling Midas Resources Incorporated.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.640
Midas Resources will give you a silver dollar from the early 1900s, a $12 value, just for

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.920
purchasing the book at its normal price of $19.95.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:35.680
It seems clear to me that this business relationship with Midas is intact at this point, even prior

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.000
to this episode that we're listening to now, so whatever weird energy Alex is giving off,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.360
it seems like it's probably personal.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.080
I read over Bob's newsletters to see if I could find any reasons that Alex might not

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.220
want to associate with him at this point.

01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.100
I'm not sure if I see anything.

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.600
In one of his January issues, he predicts an imminent return of the gold standard in

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:56.400
the United States because of the war in the Middle East.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.600
What a surprise that he would want or predict that.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.600
Yeah.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.840
The war is going to put pressure on economies, you know, that's fairly standard kind of stuff,

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.560
you know, you could see Alex not disagreeing with that.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.040
He does say, quote, the Muslims believe they can destroy capitalism by forcing gold to

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.520
the forefront, and we agree that this could and probably will be successful.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.520
Which is a little weird, but it does not seem like it's outside of Alex's wheelhouse.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.560
It doesn't seem like you'd burn a bridge over that.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.760
What a wild thing to think slash even wilder to say.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.760
Uh-huh.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.600
Some of the next issues that I could find were from July 2003, and honestly, it just

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.200
kind of sounds like a transcript of something Alex might say at some point in his life.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.160
Quote, all we can say is buy gold and silver coins and shares as fast as possible.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:44.080
The ship is sinking and there's no sense in drowning with the rest of the idiots.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.140
Incidentally, exercise your constitutional rights and legally arm yourself and your families

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.140
to the teeth.

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.140
Whoa.

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.140
This isn't going to be nice.

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:54.740
Jesus Christ, I just want to buy some gold, man.

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:57.980
The only thing I can find in there that I could see Alex being pissed off about is that

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:03.120
Bob advises his readers to buy gold and silver, but if they have to invest in currency that

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.760
they are going to hide, they should favor the euro or Swiss franc to the US dollar.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.040
I could see Alex thinking this was bad-mouthing the dollar like the treasury secretary was.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.660
Yeah, that would make sense.

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:18.340
I don't know, but that's the only thing that stuck out to me as like, eh, Alex would not

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.340
like that.

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:22.920
You should always favor the dollar if you're going to favor currencies, especially not

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920
the fucking euro.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.320
It does seem that when they say, like, what happened to Bob, what they're suggesting is

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:34.300
like Bob went off the rails somewhere and saying that the dollar isn't the single greatest

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.340
thing in the world is probably, that's probably enough.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:42.700
All fiat currencies are evil, but if there must be one, you have to protect the world

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.620
reserve currency status of the dollar.

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.620
Right, right, right, right.

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:46.620
I don't know.

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:50.180
I could see that being, and I did also get that sense that like something had happened.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.260
There was some problem.

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:56.580
I can't get any sense of like what that's in reference to, but it could be that.

01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:01.820
Yeah, because Bob can't get out of pocket, you know, like Bob is expendable.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:02.820
Maybe.

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:03.820
Yeah.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:04.820
Maybe not.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.820
He saw a video of Reagan.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.820
That's fair.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.940
Incidentally, Bob Chapman's newsletter is definitely, without a doubt, written by Bob

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:12.940
Chapman.

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:15.660
You know, there's a lot of these folks who have these newsletters that are like, I don't

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:19.660
know, someone just writes it, my name's on it, like Ron Paul.

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.220
Bob cannot claim that.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.940
He calls people who don't take his financial advice idiots, and he's basically just fucking

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:30.700
with his readers, quote, don't forget, as interest rates go back up to say 7 or 8 percent,

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:35.480
you will lose money on the value of bonds unless you buy at par and hold to maturity.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.880
Most of you may be dead by then.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.100
We don't have all the answers, but this is the way we see it.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.760
We've been making these kinds of decisions for 43 years, so we guess this qualifies us

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.540
to voice our opinion.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.020
It's outrageous stuff.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:50.480
Considering this is like, it's supposed to be a financial advice newsletter, not a, you're

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.480
all gonna die.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.340
Put a hundred dollars in gold and die, idiot.

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.340
Yeah.

01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.860
Whatever, it's life or death.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.900
Bury some Swiss francs and get a gun.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.140
Yeah, what are you doing?

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.180
Why is this good financial advice?

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.300
Yeah, I have no idea what happened to the two of them, but it's an open question that

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:10.100
I'm excited to learn more about as we proceed.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.380
But we see him later on.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.380
Yeah, I know.

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.580
We see him in 2009 at least, you know?

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.580
No, definitely.

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:16.580
Yeah.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.300
So I know that there is some sort of a coming back together, and I'm gonna guarantee that

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.660
at no point do they discuss what their differences were on there and hash it out.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.660
No, absolutely not.

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.660
No, no, no, no.

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.420
But I wonder if I'll be able to learn more, like if another caller calls in and brings

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.540
up specifics or something, I'm gonna keep my eye open on this one.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:36.700
So one of the other things that I'm tracking very closely, trying to understand, is whether

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:40.380
or not Alex Jones believes he's fighting the literal devil in 2003.

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.380
True.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.860
We know in the present day he believes that the devil is the head of the globalist conspiracy.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:50.420
That he's speaking to him extra-dimensionally or being possessed by demons.

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:51.420
True.

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.020
I'm not entirely sure if that is the case in 2003.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:59.260
So every time there's some kind of an indication of something, I like to bring it to the forefront.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:04.880
And I don't know if this says anything about Alex, but Cuddy definitely believes in literal

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.880
biblical prophecy.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880
Hey, alright!

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.320
New York is defined in the federal regulations as the United Nations.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.700
And when Rudolph Giuliani stated on C-PAN that we're the capital of the world, yeah,

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.700
New York City was the capital of the world, end quote, he was correct.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:25.140
And that is found at CFR chapter 111.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.900
Dr. Cuddy, any comments to what he's saying?

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:34.420
Well, even taking that one step further, in terms of just biblical end times, you know

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:38.940
Revelation 18 and what happens there, and it has to be a port city, and everybody says

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.420
New York, and everybody says, well, that was the World Trade Center.

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:48.820
I don't think so, because when you get around verse 22, remember it says, and a candle would

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:53.460
be seen no more, and that would be symbolic of the Statue of Liberty.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.460
Okay.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.180
So something may be coming up.

01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.860
Thank you very much.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.580
Amazing information.

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:09.020
So Alex doesn't necessarily jump in with him in the, let's decode, end times.

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.420
Revelation, yeah.

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:15.540
But he's also like, oh, that's amazing information, that, you know, like, he's encouraging of

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.340
it in the guest, but he's not engaging in it himself.

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.900
I find that interesting.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.900
Yeah.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:26.800
It does seem like he's, I mean, from what we've seen, he's allowed other people.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800
He's platforming a hell of a lot of it.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:32.900
He's platformed a lot of biblical talk, but he's always been reticent to jump in on his

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:39.120
own and really give people a full throated, hell yeah, Revelations 18 is how we're going

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.820
to get through this, you know.

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:43.840
He does seem to be walking that line a little bit.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:51.300
So Cuddy takes off after a very long interview, and Alex gets down to business.

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:55.540
I'm going to go see the film Matrix.

01:20:55.540 --> 01:21:01.540
It's got its new age message, the paper here in Austin, and the entertainment pages said

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.180
it's a new religion in America.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:07.500
Well, it's not new, it's Hindu or slash Buddhism or whatever, but.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:13.460
So you haven't seen the movie yet, oh my god, but it's Hindu slash Buddhism or whatever.

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.900
But also, maybe, it's designed to make people kill.

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.820
I've got a London Guardian story about it, Times of London article, US killers blame

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:28.740
Matrix after random shootings, Matrix firms, films blamed for series of murders by obsessed

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:32.720
fans.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.780
There are films that use triggers to go out there, but the government doesn't even have

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.780
to brainwash you now in person.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:45.540
Certain susceptible minds who are programming through the culture with your big TV heads

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:46.740
can be activated.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.740
I'm not saying the Matrix does that.

01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.200
We know they have these technologies.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.340
We know there's key indicators in it.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:56.780
We know that some of the things that Chief Moose said, you know, the duck is in the noose

01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:03.140
or whatever is a known trigger, and then Malvo and the other guys show up, the Hamid show

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.140
up.

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:08.780
It goes on and on, but I don't like to speculate, but I'll tell you what I've seen if I get

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.500
a chance to see it tonight.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.500
I don't like to speculate.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.500
Slap!

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.500
Slap!

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.500
All I'm doing is-

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:15.500
Slap, sir!

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.940
I speculate wildly, but man, I don't like it.

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:21.460
I pull out my white glove.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:27.140
Don't be like me saying, I don't like to check into things Alex says, but I seem to do it

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.140
a lot.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.620
Frankly, I'm honestly a very quiet person.

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.060
I think people have recognized that for a long time.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.060
I don't like to be loud.

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.060
It's your natural tendencies.

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.060
I don't like to be loud.

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:41.500
So, on this 19th, this May 19th episode, we have one last clip, and this is literally

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:48.120
the only mention of the Ba'ath Party that I heard at all, and I should say that we are

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:54.780
now past the point where the policy of de-Ba'athification has been openly announced, and there are people

01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:00.940
who are coming out and speaking about getting rid of all party members within government

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:05.020
and such, and here's Alex's take on that.

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:08.500
When there's more tyranny than ever, they're putting the Ba'ath Party back into control

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.500
while giving speeches that they aren't.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.500
Ooh, nice.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.500
It's an incredible line.

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:13.500
Well done.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.500
So there we go.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.500
Way to sidestep that one.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.260
Just walk outside.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.420
Oh, that train is coming to hit me.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.420
Excuse me.

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.420
Step aside.

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.420
Don't care.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.420
Whee!

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.420
Yeah.

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.420
Jesus.

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.780
This isn't going to work for long.

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:33.180
I guess it's fine now on the 19th.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.100
Yeah, for like a day.

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:41.860
It buys you some time, but this is not going to be the way that...

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:45.260
This isn't going to pass the smell test for very long.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.260
No.

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.260
No.

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.260
I think we'll probably get...

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:53.300
As thousands of people are removed from their posts, it's going to be tougher to be like,

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.220
ah, they're still in there.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.220
Yeah.

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:04.180
I think we're going to get more in-depth into this stuff in the coming days of 2003, because

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:08.700
I think that Alex is going to have to try and wiggle a bit, and I'm interested to see

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.100
how that plays out.

01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:15.820
There's actually a couple of really compelling threads that I'm starting to see in 2003 that

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.880
I really want to learn more about.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.840
One is the anti-Putin stuff.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.240
Two is the de-bathification.

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.100
Three is Alex and Bob Chapman.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.100
Right.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:29.420
Well, I mean, and you can just expand that out too, like side characters.

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.180
What's our legion of doom here?

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:37.980
Well, it's like, I don't know, you're playing a sequel to a video game or a prequel, and

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.540
the main character's the same, but maybe they're in a different place, and so you have a different

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.540
NPC character.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.540
Sure, sure.

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.540
And different side characters.

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.540
It's like the cube.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.540
Yeah.

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:52.620
Yeah, and I'm wondering where the old friends are and who these new people are, and so,

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:59.700
you know, I enjoy, I'm enjoying this a bit more, and I want to continue it, and I want

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:00.700
to learn more.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:04.540
Do you mean you're enjoying learning and discovering new things like you always have, and now that

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:10.980
you're in the present where we are rarely learning anything and often discovering the

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.900
same things daily, this is new and exciting for you?

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:15.900
Yeah, kind of.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:16.900
Oh, that sounds right.

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:19.820
There's at least interesting context and things to discuss, whereas I think in the present

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:25.940
day most episodes that I do end up could just be like, he didn't read this, he doesn't know.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:27.860
Dumb, dumb.

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:32.040
So we get to the 20th, and Alex, I was hoping, had seen The Matrix, because you know I love

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.040
a movie review.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.060
He said he was going to see it on the 19th.

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:36.620
He did not go see The Matrix.

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:37.620
What?

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:38.620
What, did he get busy?

01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.620
Yeah, probably.

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.420
So, but he's going to talk about it a little more.

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.420
Okay.

01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.140
Also, Matrix Maker rejects crime links.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:48.700
We're not saying crime links, and I'm not saying crime links.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:51.860
Some have said mind control trigger links.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:52.860
Duh!

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:55.240
Bunch of idiots.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.220
This is Alex correcting the record.

01:25:57.220 --> 01:26:01.060
Call him David Brock, because he is correcting the fucking record.

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.660
I'm not going to let people slander me in public.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.660
Right, crime links, pshaw.

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:11.140
How silly, how silly for someone to think that The Matrix has crime links.

01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.140
I would never.

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.140
They control minds.

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.140
Duh.

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.580
There's a mind control trigger link.

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:16.580
Duh.

01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:17.580
Right.

01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:18.580
Jesus.

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:19.580
Now the trigger makes you commit crime.

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.940
These plebes, I'm telling you, stay out of my business.

01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.820
Anyway, Alex has a guest on.

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.820
Sure.

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.460
And this is a wild guest for Alex to have on for a number of reasons.

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:32.340
This could never have happened in any other period of time.

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.340
Okay.

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:38.620
And it doesn't go super well, but this guy named Noah Schackman, who has an article in

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:44.340
Wired that had just come out about a DARPA program, we'll talk about it a little bit

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:50.460
more, but Alex distorts some of the ideas around surveillance and such in order to introduce

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:51.460
Noah.

01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:54.660
It's a new level of corruption, we're all prisoners, the kids are thumb scanning to

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.500
get school lunches in thousands of school districts, the thumb scanners are going in

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:03.660
the banks, going in the grocery stores, going in everywhere.

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:05.180
It's total.

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:10.380
It's 180 degrees from what America's supposed to be, and they say it's to stop terror while

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.700
the borders are wide open and while the feds are starting to accept in 800 plus cities

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:18.780
the fake IDs of illegals from Poland to Mexico.

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:23.460
And Noah Schackman is on the air with us.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.740
Noah, thanks for coming on the show today, sir.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.260
Thanks for having me.

01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:30.280
This is, there's no way to really understate this.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:35.340
This is, or overstate this, I should say, this is, this is scary.

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:39.700
I'm going to guess that if you were to find Noah Schackman today and ask what he thinks

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:44.660
about having been a guest on Alex's show, you might not get an answer, because at this

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:51.060
point in 2003, Schackman worked at Wired, but now in 2021, he's currently the editor

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:55.540
in chief of the Daily Beast, an outlet that Alex screams about quite often for their very

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:58.300
cruel coverage of the stupid things he says and does.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.300
Wow!

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.300
Yeah.

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.500
That is a career path.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.780
That is a career path.

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:04.780
Yeah.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:08.300
He's on the show because he wrote an article in Wired about early possible plans from DARPA

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.720
to create a project called LifeLog, which would seek to compile all available data on

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.300
individuals to be able to tell the story of their lives.

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:20.220
It was outrageously fucked up as an idea, and it did not end up coming to pass for a

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.940
number of reasons.

01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:26.360
One was probably public backlash, but another was probably the unfeasibility of creating

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.740
a system that would be able to do this in any meaningful, usable way.

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:30.740
Yeah.

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.900
Now the NSA just grabs our metadata.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:33.900
Duh.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:38.900
This is beyond that, though, with the conception of what this LifeLog thing would be.

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:42.960
The primary sourcing on the program was a solicitation from DARPA for people to make

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:47.660
proposals on how to create this program that they had the name for and an idea of what

01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:50.380
they wanted it to do, but not much else.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.900
This is to say that there wasn't a program they were testing, they were requesting people

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.500
to put in bids to create a program to do some pretty overly ambitious and overly fucked

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.500
up things.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.820
America, the Pentagon deserves your money.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:07.460
As I understand it from the way Noah describes it, the way they were hoping to start some

01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:15.140
of this research was to have researchers themselves do mock trips, places, and see if this program

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:21.100
that they had created could log their physical movements, their transactions, and stuff like

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.100
that.

01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:23.100
Sure.

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:24.260
And it did not work out.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.260
Yeah, no, and also that's astonishingly fucked up.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.260
Yeah, no kidding.

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.260
Wow.

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:35.540
I can understand how someone might look at, like, boy, that would be really helpful in

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:38.620
criminal investigations, and I don't disagree, probably would be.

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.620
Sure, sure.

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.740
No, it would make it very easy.

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:45.900
The fact of it existing has a lot of other ramifications that I don't think.

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:46.900
There would be some problems.

01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:49.420
I think that they would outweigh it on the seesaw.

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:54.240
I would say that if you're looking at that program as a positive, you are wearing rose-tinted

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.180
glasses at the very least.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:57.180
Yeah.

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.140
The point is, government surveillance is a real issue that is taken seriously by serious

01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.580
people, and it appears that Noah is one of them.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:08.460
I suspect that he accepted this booking because in 2003, no one really knew how not serious

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:13.380
Alex is, and how Alex will take any opportunity to use Noah's credibility to advance nonsense

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:16.940
exaggerations of his underlying reporting.

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.820
And that's all that's going on here.

01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:20.940
And I think Noah's polite.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:21.940
I will say that.

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:22.940
Okay.

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:24.260
And I think Alex is trying to red pill him.

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:25.260
That sounds right.

01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:28.780
The National Association of Banks up in Minnesota, they're doing it.

01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.780
Now even if you have an account, they're going to want you to thumb scan.

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:35.700
Yeah, you know, like I said, I don't know about that particular program, but I know

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:37.980
that there's definitely an overall effort to make that happen.

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:43.980
Well, that makes the cash digital, and basically a part of a digital system.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.420
You know, there's already RFID tags in the money.

01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:49.220
I know, I wasn't worried about that.

01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:52.560
Yeah, radio frequency identifiers have been in for six years, and the Federal Reserve

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.420
says if you don't keep your money in the bank, they're going to devalue it off those tags.

01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:00.020
So what I'm telling you is this is maybe a lot further along than you knew, sir.

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.540
Yeah, you know, it could be.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.320
So there's just like...

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.260
That's more polite than I would have been when he's like, you know, there's already

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:08.260
RFID in the money.

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:09.900
I'd have been like, fuck you.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.700
And they're going to devalue it?

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.700
Fuck you.

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:13.700
How does that work?

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.140
If you don't put it in the bank.

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:16.140
How?

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.140
Wait, but how would that work?

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.700
So this hundred dollar bill that I have...

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:19.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.820
The RFID chip is going to take a zero off of it.

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:26.540
Wait, wait, so I try and use it, and it's only worth like $97 because I've had it for

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:27.540
too long?

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.540
You've had it for too long.

01:31:28.540 --> 01:31:30.060
There's also a little ticking timer on it.

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.580
How does this work?

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:32.960
How does this work?

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:40.440
You're just renting money by the hour.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:45.220
Is it possible that what the system would be is that if too many people have too many

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.100
hundred dollar bills out, then all hundred dollar bills will be devalued?

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:51.560
Oh, almost some sort of inflation.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:57.380
Like if there's too much of something, it's like it goes and then it dilutes the overall

01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.380
value.

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.340
I don't know how the RFID chips would be necessary for that.

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:01.660
It seems like they would be extraneous.

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:08.220
Anyway, he's very polite, and Alex starts talking about the finger scanning at the grocery

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:12.380
store that you're going to need to do, and it's like, you know, it's the extension of

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.700
self-checkout lanes, and of course, as Alex always does when he talks about this, he's

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.420
like, then I'm going to have to bag my own groceries.

01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:23.500
Now that's not really a problem, but it seems like he's not happy about it.

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.500
Oh man.

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:25.500
This leads to a little bit of a disagreement.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:26.500
Okay.

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:31.640
I mean, the Biometric Consortium and the grocery stores say they want to pull all the check

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.780
out lanes out and make you self-serve and thumb scan, and I mean, I don't want to bag

01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:37.860
my own groceries.

01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:42.700
That's a more low level threat here, and they're going to put in thumb scan and check out lanes

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:45.760
and then pull out the other ones and make you do it.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.760
That's the plan.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.860
We're only a few years away from this.

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:55.860
Well, I think on this point, I'll agree to disagree with you here.

01:32:55.860 --> 01:33:03.180
I don't see this as necessarily a job killer, but I do see it as a really invasive intrusion

01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:04.180
into our lives.

01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:08.900
Well, what I'm saying is, sir, they pull out three checkout lanes of 10, put in biometric

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:13.920
ones, self-checkout, then they pull out all the rest of the lanes and make you check your

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.020
own stuff out.

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:16.740
They're saying they're going to do this.

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.740
Right.

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:25.580
Well, I haven't seen that, but even assuming that's true, the biometric part is a little

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:32.700
is nerve wracking to me, but bagging my own groceries doesn't bug me that much.

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.700
Jesus.

01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:34.700
Yeah.

01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:35.700
That's so funny.

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:36.700
That's so funny.

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:42.840
He's coming here to talk about the plan that DARPA has to try and log every aspect of a

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:47.440
human life and then expand that to every human on the planet.

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.100
And Alex comes back with, I'm going to have to bag my own groceries, man.

01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:57.740
I'm not positive, actually, even from reading that-

01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:58.740
Wired article.

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:02.980
No, the solicitation for bids.

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:03.980
Oh, sure.

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:07.460
I'm not even positive necessarily that the plan was ever to make it for everyone.

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:08.460
Sure, sure.

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.620
Because I think that that even, I don't even think that they would think that was possible.

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:14.020
No, of course not.

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:17.060
I think it was something that could be abused.

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:18.640
Yeah, wow.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.860
Were it to exist?

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:20.860
Absolutely.

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:21.860
Yeah.

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:28.860
The article that Noah wrote, Noah Shachman wrote in Wired, is a discussion of this, a

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:36.900
discussion of the moral implications, people even within the sort of technological community

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:38.980
being worried about this.

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:39.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:40.980
Problem.

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.260
And it's an actual article.

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.220
And then he goes on Alex's show ostensibly to talk about it.

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.220
Right.

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:48.220
And this is what ends up happening.

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.940
Hey, I'm going to have to bag my own groceries.

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.100
I'm a serious person.

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:54.900
I have to put my thumb on the groceries.

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:55.900
I gotta go.

01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:59.220
And then it's going to unlock them, and that's how you have to get groceries now, and I have

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:00.940
to put them in my own bags.

01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:05.340
Another thing that is a concern of both serious people and Alex is drones.

01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:12.380
And there is also relevant conversations around that that don't involve Infowars stuff.

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:14.020
And Noah brings up drones.

01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:17.100
Are the drones going to bring my groceries to me?

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.300
That's not the context of this.

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.300
Okay.

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.300
But this is how the interview ends.

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:22.300
Okay.

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:25.300
There's some really creepy uses for drones domestically.

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.780
Well, it's like They Live where the little drone flies up.

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:28.780
It even looks the same.

01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:29.780
I'm sorry.

01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:30.780
What'd you say?

01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:31.780
You ever seen They Live?

01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:32.780
Uh, They Live.

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:37.780
That's what the, uh, the, uh, rowdy, uh, Roddy Piper movie.

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:38.780
Yeah.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.780
That's the John Carpenter film.

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:41.780
That's great.

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.780
The drones even look the same.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:43.780
Is that right?

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:44.780
I haven't seen that movie in a long time.

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:45.780
We got one that can see.

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.700
Maybe you can see, uh, Noah.

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.700
Thanks for joining us.

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.700
Okay.

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:50.700
Thanks much.

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:56.540
I just, I just want more.

01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:59.460
I want more of that on my regular news.

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:05.740
I want more of like at the end of a very serious interview with a fucking general or some bullshit

01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:10.060
that I'm just being like, Hey, you know, real quick, have you seen They Live recently?

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:11.820
That's kind of a pretty good movie.

01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:12.820
Yeah.

01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:16.960
I think it's a lot of fun and I wish Alex would have swung harder and been like, did

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.220
you know that the Matrix is a mind control trigger?

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:20.220
Totally.

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:21.220
Uh, what?

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:22.220
Go for it.

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:25.300
Once you open the can of worms, I want you to get to Matrix mind control.

01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.300
Yeah.

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:31.420
So Alex has another guest on after this and it's a guy named Rick Adams, uh, who's a talk

01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.500
show host out of Rhode Island.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:36.180
I believe Alex has been welcomed on his show.

01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:39.060
And so now, uh, the, the, the favor is repaid.

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.060
Sure.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.060
Sure.

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:45.380
Uh, Alex keeps referring to this station W A L E as a, uh, I think it's like a 50 megawatt

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:46.380
blow torch.

01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.380
Oh no.

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:49.820
He says that like five times.

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:50.820
Yeah.

01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:53.180
Somebody, somebody gave him that and he went crazy.

01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.180
Yeah.

01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:55.180
Anyway.

01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:56.180
Um, their credibility is up.

01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:57.180
Rick.

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:02.620
I remember 10 years ago, you remember back further than that, but a Patriots talking

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:08.340
about everything that's now happening today and that now what's happened is our credibility

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:13.680
has exploded because over the years, people heard us warn them about all this.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.020
Now they've seen it happening.

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.660
So our credibility has skyrocketed.

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:18.660
Absolutely.

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:23.060
You know, when I was in college, you know, a lot of people thought I was the nut and

01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:29.100
now generations later or decades later, I meet one or two of my friends from college

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:33.660
and they say exactly what you've just said, Rick, I apologize.

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.700
I thought you were the nut.

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:36.740
I was the nut.

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:41.340
I didn't believe because I didn't want to believe, but everything you said was going

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:44.080
to happen did in fact happen.

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.080
So you're right, Alex.

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:49.260
So yeah, this dude's a conservative talk show host in Rhode Island.

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:52.380
I'm not sure how wide his syndication was, but I don't know.

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:55.260
He just seems like a kind of like a John Birch society dude.

01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:56.260
Sounds like it.

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.260
I don't know.

01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:59.180
I don't, I don't find him all that interesting.

01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:03.340
However, what is interesting is that mentality that they're expressing and it's kind of

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:06.780
like a mantra for propagandists and conspiracy theorists.

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:11.020
I've heard Alex say exactly this same sort of thing in the present day.

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.780
I've heard him say it five years ago.

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:14.780
He says this all the time.

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:19.260
This like our credibility is through the roof because everything we've said has come true.

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.500
The reason this rhetoric is used is because it's not about credibility or track records

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:24.500
or predictions.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:28.280
None of these concepts are even real in the game that's being played on these shows.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.820
The goal is to tap into the audience's feelings and provide them with psychological comfort.

01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:36.780
They all have memory of someone thinking that they were crazy for their conspiracy beliefs

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:42.100
and it makes people feel better to have their supposed expert hero give voice to those feelings.

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:44.740
But importantly to put them in the past.

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:48.620
You were right to believe me all along, we're on the other side of it now.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:52.600
This supposed story about Rick's friends from college apologizing for doubting him,

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.020
that didn't happen.

01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:58.460
That story is constructed to give the audience hope that if they hold strong to their fringe-ass

01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:02.700
nonsense, eventually they too will have everyone in their lives apologizing to them for being

01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:04.740
too afraid to accept the truth.

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:08.100
You see this really consistently in these sorts of communities, like it's rampant

01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:14.540
and QAnon conversations that you see of like, you know, fantasizing about the day that everyone

01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:18.180
will admit that they were right all along.

01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.820
It's weird.

01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:26.140
And it can't possibly be like, everyone thought we were wrong but we keep being right and

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.920
so our credibility is through the roof.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.900
It can't be right in 2003 and 2020.

01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.900
No.

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:33.900
Like it can't be right at both times.

01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.860
And then it also can't be right in all those intervening years when I've heard him say

01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.400
it.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.100
Do people just constantly forget about how credible you are?

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:46.100
I mean it seems like he's creating a like sign wave of credibility that just goes up

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:52.320
and down depending on the year or the day or whatever, you know, like today our credibility

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:56.140
is through the roof and then tomorrow our credibility is way way down, you know, like

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:57.140
what are you talking about?

01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:00.820
Yeah, same with like the globalists are winning, oh no they're losing, oh no they're back

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:01.820
to winning!

01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:04.980
Oh god, oh that's terrifying.

01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:11.780
So Rick, I was wondering about him, and you know, he's very much in line with Alex's beliefs,

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:17.740
two of them are simpatico, and I was wondering, hey does this dude think he's fighting demons?

01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:21.820
What type of world from your studies, Rick, do the globalists want to build?

01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:26.940
Well I have to go back to a biblical perspective, and I know this turns off some people, but

01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:31.820
I have to say it because I'm not a phony and I'm like yourself, I tell it like it is.

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:37.460
We're dealing with, as the scripture says, forces of evil in this world today.

01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:41.980
We're not wrestling, as the apostles said, under, you know, delusion that we're fighting

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.620
flesh and bones.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:48.900
We wrestle against powers and principalities of evil, Alex.

01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:54.260
Now I want to say Alex does not respond to that comment at all.

01:40:54.260 --> 01:41:00.460
So again, he's platforming somebody who has like a sort of fundamentalist belief, a Christian

01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:07.380
belief in the war that they're fighting that is presumably political in nature is actually

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:09.780
against principalities of evil.

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.780
Demons.

01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.780
Yeah.

01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:13.820
I furrow my brow at you, Dan.

01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:14.820
Why?

01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:18.700
Because I want Alex to fucking weigh in and I'm sick of this teasing bullshit.

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:21.740
Yeah I know, I'm a little bit frustrated with it too.

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:25.860
But again, it's another interesting thread that exists in this period of time that we

01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:30.700
now have the ability to learn more about and unravel.

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:32.860
And I find that really compelling.

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:33.860
So weird.

01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:34.860
It's so weird.

01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:35.860
When?

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:36.860
Why?

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:38.020
Why was it not acceptable then?

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:41.500
I mean, I guess it must have been a strategy for him then.

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:44.420
And maybe that strategy- That's a conclusion you could jump to and

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.860
I'm not entirely sure if it's correct, but it feels like what's going on.

01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:48.860
Totally.

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:53.620
It seems like it has to be, something is going on, but it frustrates me because that sounds

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:57.980
like I'm making a conspiracy theory about something going on, but something has to be

01:41:57.980 --> 01:41:58.980
going on.

01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:01.660
But that's why we need to learn more and gather more information and evidence.

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:02.660
Of course.

01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:08.820
The stuff that some of these other folks are saying isn't too far from what Alex says in

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:09.820
the current day.

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:14.860
Of course Alex yells more and talks more grossly and graphically about stuff.

01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:19.100
But it's not too far off in terms of the, we're fighting demons.

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:23.380
But Alex stays away from it himself for the most part.

01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:28.060
Which that's why it seems like a strategic decision because he's still booking these

01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:31.300
people that he knows who Rick Adams is.

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:36.860
He probably knows this element of his belief and he's comfortable with him expressing it.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:40.920
He's just not talking the way he would in the present day.

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.140
He would pray on air in the present day.

01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:44.140
No.

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:49.860
And I mean, with those types of people, you've always got a time to Bible reference.

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:55.260
So it's not like he's been talking to this dude off air for, you know, weeks and they

01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:57.820
just have never had the Bible come up.

01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:03.660
Like these people have, okay, if you are talking to me within a 30 minute stretch, you're gonna

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:04.900
hear about the Bible.

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:05.900
There's a real good chance.

01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:07.300
There's a real good chance.

01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:09.940
And it doesn't matter what we're talking about.

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.860
Sports, it's going to be the Bible.

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:12.860
It doesn't matter.

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:13.860
You know?

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:18.180
So we have a couple clips left from the 20th and they take some calls.

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.460
Him and Rick.

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:24.380
And again, this is the other thing too that was really wild.

01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:29.580
Like Cuddy is on for almost two hours as a guest.

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.420
Rick is on for a really long time.

01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:39.580
And I thought like, like this is long for an Alex interview and it's because they're

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:45.820
like just like right on the same page in terms of those new world order basics and the conspiracies.

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:51.260
He can just have them co-host with you while you take phone calls and stuff and it, again,

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:55.100
it's another thing that feels more like, well, this is what this radio show is trying to

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:56.100
be.

01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.100
Right.

01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.100
Right.

01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.100
Right.

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.100
Right.

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.100
Right.

01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:02.580
And, oh, also did not get into whether or not demons are what we're fighting with Shachman.

01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:03.580
No Shachman.

01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.300
I'm going to guess he doesn't think that.

01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.580
I don't know.

01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:08.340
That would be a, that would be a twist.

01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.740
That would be a nice little twist for us.

01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:11.940
So like in the Matrix.

01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:15.540
Oh, and the third one when they negotiate with the robots.

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.540
We still don't remember that.

01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:17.540
Yeah.

01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:23.940
So Alex takes this call and this is awesome.

01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:25.900
I don't even know how to set it up other than that.

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:26.900
Okay.

01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:27.900
This is awesome.

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:28.900
Okay.

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:32.380
Alex, what happened with your deal when you went down to do your license and they asked

01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:34.860
you to thumb scan and wasn't there some kind of an uproar?

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.460
What ended, what became of all this?

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:39.060
See the video in a Mariner get destroyed by design.

01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:40.060
You ever seen that footage?

01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:44.100
No, I've, I've, uh, seen Masters of Terror just last week.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.920
We picked that up really enjoy it.

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.500
My mom wants to use it at her church in Wisconsin.

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:53.900
Well, I suggest as a primer road to tyranny is the best we've got the production wise,

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:56.100
but I would suggest you get that one.

01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.100
They're all great.

01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:59.700
Were you able to get around the thumb scan?

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:02.620
No, they have a waiver.

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:03.860
Some people have gotten it.

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:05.660
They will not give it to you and will refuse it.

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:09.580
I could sue them, but then I wouldn't have time to be on the radio six, seven hours a

01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:10.580
day.

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.580
Right.

01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:12.580
Like tonight I'm going to be on Jeff.

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:15.820
I'll be filling in for somebody for two hours today or locally.

01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:17.300
I mean, I'm just working all the time.

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.880
So fucking funny.

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.100
This is one of Alex's biggest early publicity stunts, and you could argue that it's the

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:29.580
closing segment, the like the big piece in his documentary, America Destroyed by Design.

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:34.060
Alex brings in a bunch of cameras when he goes to the Austin DMV to go get a new driver's

01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:37.380
license knowing that the process requires a fingerprint.

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:41.060
He brings along eight forms of identification and insists he shouldn't have to provide a

01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:44.540
fingerprint to which the people at the DMV say you do.

01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:48.360
Alex starts yelling about how Bill Clinton wants his blood and urine next and asking

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:51.340
if the DMV workers are going to stick a needle in him.

01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:54.680
It's a petulant display and it's a real sign of the sort of publicity stunts that would

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.020
come to characterize his career moving forward.

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.540
It's so hilarious that at the end of this story, he just went back without the cameras

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:07.120
and gave the fingerprint to get his driver's license because I know he has a driver's license.

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.780
He got a DUI a few months back.

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:09.780
Of course he does.

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.860
He didn't get a driving without a license charge.

01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:14.380
That is so infuriating.

01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:16.840
It's exactly like Alex.

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.920
It's Alex to a T.

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.380
Well, I mean, I need a new ID, so I guess I'll go get it.

01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:22.380
I'll give you my thumb.

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.380
Right.

01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:28.140
I will go and I will take this stand and yell while there's cameras running and get attention

01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:32.940
and incite people into a frenzy about these supposed political beliefs and these like,

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:39.060
I am standing up for all the people, you know, and then, you know, I need to drive.

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:42.580
I will die on this hill two days later.

01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:44.260
Listen, I'm real sorry about that.

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:45.260
Yeah.

01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.260
That's my bad.

01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:49.100
And then when a caller calls in and asks, he's like, yeah, you can get around it, but

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:50.100
like, I don't know.

01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.100
It's really hard.

01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:52.100
I gotta be on the radio.

01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.100
I can't sue people.

01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:54.100
I work.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.100
I have a job.

01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:56.100
What am I going to do?

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:58.980
Hire a lawyer to do it for me while I work?

01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:01.240
No, I have to do all of my own lawsuits.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:03.080
What am I supposed to do?

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.100
The hard work of having a principled stand?

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.100
Exactly, yes.

01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.100
No.

01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:08.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.100
Hire a principled stand.

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:11.140
Do you have time to have principles?

01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:12.500
Because then do it.

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:13.500
I don't care.

01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.500
What?

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:15.500
What, you don't have a job?

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:16.500
Fine.

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:17.500
Go have principles outside.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:18.500
Yeah.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.500
Crazy.

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.100
What a coward.

01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:27.820
So Alex gets a call from an HEB manager, and this has to do with more of his ideas

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.620
about waivers and what have you.

01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:30.620
Sure.

01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:36.060
So this manager is bringing up that at her place of work, they are now talking about

01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:40.820
bringing in a scanner, like a fingerprint scanner, for the time clock.

01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:45.580
This is different than the idea of a checkout lane that's connected to your credit card

01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:46.580
and what have you.

01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:47.580
Oh, man.

01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:48.940
But Alex says that this is the beginning of bringing in the...

01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:49.940
Sure, sure.

01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:50.940
Whatever.

01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:56.260
Anyway, the manager wants to ask Alex about ways that she can fight back and not use this

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.460
system.

01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:02.100
And Alex's advice is so Alex that it's almost laughable.

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:03.940
Here's my thing.

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:07.620
I need to know what is my defense, not to give them my fingerprint.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:11.700
Well, tell them it's a religious reason.

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:15.580
Tell them that you've been a good employee, always clocked in, not had a problem.

01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:20.300
Tell them that you're not gonna be part of this, and if they give you problems, I think

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:24.280
you're gonna have a civil rights lawsuit on religious reasons.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.780
We need to do things like that.

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:26.780
Okay.

01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:27.780
What about you?

01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:33.540
And is there any place you can recommend, like on the web or a certain spot in the library

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:38.620
that I should look to research this stuff and what my rights are and that I can use

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:40.620
as a defense to our...

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:41.620
InfoWars.com.

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.620
I can't even think of what I can...

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:51.060
Well, that's a whole section of study, but it's a whole section of study, but the religious

01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:57.060
exemption for religious reasons, you're against that, you should be able to do something there.

01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:00.540
Find out more, tell me as it progresses, and I appreciate the call.

01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:01.540
I really do, Billy.

01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:05.580
I've got a ton of calls and I wish you guys ought to call me back tomorrow or tonight

01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.660
or next week so I can talk to you more.

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.220
We're just up against the gun here.

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:10.380
He's not up against the gun.

01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:11.580
He has plenty of...

01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:12.860
He takes more calls.

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:15.200
But yeah, there's no advice.

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.200
There's nothing.

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:21.100
There's no specific reference that he can give her to help her better navigate this

01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:28.460
struggle that he wants her to engage in, and his advice is essentially make up a religious

01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:29.460
exemption.

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.460
Yep.

01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:31.460
Use religion as a prop.

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:32.460
Yep.

01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:33.460
Yep.

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:39.380
There's no part of like, here is what is violated in this religious belief.

01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:41.140
Here is the reason.

01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:48.220
Like dietary restrictions, you know, make sense as a religious exemption in various

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.220
settings.

01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:50.220
I keep kosher.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.220
Sure.

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:52.220
Yeah.

01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:53.220
Whatever you want.

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:54.220
That makes sense.

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:59.100
And there are other things, sort of opposition to war, being a conscientious objector makes

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.100
total sense.

01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:05.100
This, I don't know, I mean I guess what he would do is say Mark of the Beast or something

01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:06.100
like that.

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.100
Sure, sure.

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:08.100
You're going to scream Mark of the Beast.

01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:13.540
I guess that would be the direction that it would go, but I don't know if that really

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.220
would stand up to scrutiny.

01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:21.820
And it's, to me, indicative of how Alex engages with a lot of religious beliefs.

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:22.820
It's a prop.

01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:23.820
Yeah.

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:27.980
It's use it to your advantage to do the things that you don't want to do and not have to

01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:28.980
do the things you don't want to do.

01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:29.980
Or justify the things.

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:30.980
Yeah.

01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:31.980
Absolutely.

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:35.420
And no, I will not tell you where to look into this.

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:42.140
I mean, how could you possibly expect somebody to win a religious exemption lawsuit if there's

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:46.140
a clip of you saying, make up a religious exemption for this?

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:51.340
To be fair, I just want to be totally clear, that's my language that I use to make it up.

01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:54.500
He's not saying make it up, but that's how it is.

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.200
He is saying make it up, you know?

01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:01.180
He's saying find something in your religion that you 99% of the time either don't think

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:03.740
about or don't actually believe.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:04.740
Right.

01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:09.780
Convince somebody that it's the most important thing to you now, suddenly, despite, again,

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:12.700
never having thought about it in your entire life.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:16.780
Have these arguments very loudly on camera and then go back and stay on your fingers.

01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:18.380
I'll clock in.

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:19.380
Sorry about that.

01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:20.380
My bad.

01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:21.380
Yeah.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:22.380
Yeah.

01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:27.540
Man, it takes so much, it must be so exhausting to convince yourself that Alex isn't a giant,

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:29.140
useless piece of shit.

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:34.900
Like you just heard that clip, wouldn't you be like, oh, well then you're useless.

01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:39.260
Your entire life is meant to be fighting at the tip of the spear.

01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.860
And you are giving me advice that is nothing.

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:48.700
You are the person who has more knowledge and more resources than we do as individual

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:51.420
info warriors out there in the field.

01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:54.740
And you had a perfect situation where you had a lot of people supporting you.

01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:55.920
They had your back.

01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:00.400
You could have been the one to do this lawsuit in order to make sure that all of us could

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:05.340
get our waivers and not have to give fingerprints to get a DMV, get our licenses.

01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:06.340
Yeah.

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:08.000
Oh, but then you couldn't be on the radio all the time.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.580
So guess, uh, guess it's going to have to be the HEB manager with very little money.

01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:15.580
No time.

01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:16.580
Yeah.

01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:17.580
Yeah.

01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:18.580
No support.

01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.220
No cult of personality around them.

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.540
Their responsibility.

01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:22.540
Yeah.

01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:28.220
It's a little bit, uh, you know, I mean, it's not new, but it is just a gross, uh, denial

01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:31.860
of the self appointed role.

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:36.540
This is a grassroots movement where I exploit the grassroots.

01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:37.620
Okay.

01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:44.020
You can water the grass or you can suck all of the life out of it for every single scent

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.460
that you can steal.

01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:46.460
Yep.

01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.460
Man, that was a good show.

01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:57.940
Anyway, uh, we come to the end of this and, and, and like, I really feel like there are

01:52:57.940 --> 01:53:01.380
threads that I'm fascinated by in 2003.

01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:07.220
I think a lot of stuff is, is, is, is coming up that I really, really want to know where

01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:08.980
these things go.

01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:12.580
And so I hope to, uh, you know, obviously I'm not going to lose track of the present

01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:17.740
day or ignore it entirely, but this is, this is, this is getting me, getting my juices.

01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:23.940
I think what it is to me, it's just so uncanny, you know, like I recognize this guy and yet

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:26.900
every time I hear him talk, I'm like, who the fuck is this guy?

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:30.820
You know, like it's so close to Alex, but it's just even weirder.

01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:31.820
Yeah.

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:39.620
And we're even taking for granted like almost, uh, how like nutty it is, the, the, the position

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:45.420
on Putin is so like night and day, like it's, that's outrageous.

01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:52.060
I can't believe how jaded we are that that completely is like almost passé to a certain,

01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:55.500
you know, like, oh yeah, yeah, of course he believes this then and doesn't believe that

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.500
now.

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.780
Like that's just boring at this point, but that's nuts.

01:53:58.780 --> 01:53:59.780
That's major.

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:00.780
That's foundational.

01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:01.780
Yeah.

01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:03.900
There's a lot of major stuff that is, uh, is going to have to give.

01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:04.900
Totally.

01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:07.540
And then I want to know where, like, where these people are.

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.860
Where are the, the, the experts?

01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:12.500
Where are the G Edward Griffin?

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.500
Where's that dude?

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:18.020
I know some of them are editor in chief of the daily beast now.

01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:24.140
Why isn't Alex like he's, obviously he's talking about gold a little bit, but like Midas Resources

01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.940
is selling gold at this point.

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:29.700
He's not pushing gold as hard as he does in like years after this.

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:30.700
Yeah.

01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:31.700
I don't know.

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:32.700
It's interesting.

01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:33.700
It's confusing.

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:36.420
I'm excited to learn more and we shall in the future, but until then, Jordan, we have

01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:37.420
a website.

01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:38.420
We do have a website.

01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:39.420
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.420
Yep.

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:41.420
We're also on Twitter.

01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:42.420
We are on Twitter.

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:43.420
We're also on Facebook.

01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:44.420
We are on Facebook.

01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:48.780
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:49.780
doing God's work.

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:50.780
Yep.

01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:51.780
We'll be back.

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:52.780
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:53.780
I'm Leo.

01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:54.780
I'm DZX Clark.

01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:55.780
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:57.660
And now here comes the sex robots.

01:54:57.660 --> 01:54:58.660
Andy in Kansas.

01:54:58.660 --> 01:54:59.660
You're on the air.

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:00.660
Thanks for holding.

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:01.660
Hello Alex.

01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:02.660
I'm a first time caller.

01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:03.660
I'm a huge fan.

01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:04.660
I love your work.

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:13.340
I love you.
