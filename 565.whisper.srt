2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,680
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
Knowledgefight.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
Knowledgefight.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Dan and Jordan.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Need money.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
Andy and Kansas.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
Andy and Kansas.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Stop it.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Andy and Kansas.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Andy and Kansas.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
It's time to pray.

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Thanks for holding.

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Hello, Alex.

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
I'm a first-time caller.

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
I'm a huge fan.

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
I love your room.

I love you.

36
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,800
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

37
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
I'm Dan.

38
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm Jordan.

39
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
We're a couple dudes.

40
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
I'd like to sit around, worship at the Altar of Selene and talk a little bit about Alex

41
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Jones.

42
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

43
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Jordan.

44
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Dan!

45
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Jordan.

46
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Quick question for you.

47
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
What's up?

48
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
What's your bright spot today?

49
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Why don't you go first?

50
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Well, obviously, there's only one bright spot for me, Dan.

51
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Yeah, I think I actually know what this is going to be.

52
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
There's only one possible bright spot for me.

53
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,360
Is it a really long bright spot?

54
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,980
No, it will be fairly short. No. No, I mean the experience of watching it. Uh, it was it was fairly long

55
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,380
Yeah

56
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,980
There have been longer. There have been there have been significantly longer several hours. Perhaps there were

57
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,060
Matches that have gone over two days before each. Uh, yeah, but

58
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,320
no, uh Rafa and Djokovic played the

59
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,400
I did almost say it

60
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,080
I was thinking about him because I was going in my mind through the greatest matches in all of tennis history

61
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Mm-hmm and

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Djokovic and Rafa played the greatest clay court match in the history of tennis

63
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,900
Without question the third set lasted an hour and 40 minutes. Mm-hmm

64
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,580
that is the length of most Rafa on clay matches and that was just the third set and it was just

65
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,840
Spectacular shot may get back and forth. It was no no, I mean it wasn't even that it was impossible shots left and right

66
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,460
It was truly incredible and Djokovic won, unfortunately

67
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,840
But I mean, there's no there's no shame there

68
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,480
Three three points go a different way and Rafa wins six three six three six three

69
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,040
Yeah, and even incredible even if you end up losing a match like that

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,880
You were still a participant in it totally there's something to be said for like you were able to go that far, right?

71
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,680
Right you were able to go that hard

72
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,840
Yeah, totally and it's not like Rafa hasn't won enough French opens for people to think he's pretty good on clay. Mm-hmm

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,280
He's won a few that's what I've heard. Yeah. Yeah

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,880
He's been all right on clay for so for so long, but well, it was just it was incredible to watch

75
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,560
Oh, I'm happy for you that you got to watch that if you were a tennis fan. It was a borderline religious experience

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm not joking. I got that from your text

77
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Intense it's an intense emotional experience. Well, my bright spot is actually kind of a athletic thing as well. Okay

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,800
the recently the switch had the Nintendo switch has

79
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,100
Updated it the game so you can now play Mario parties with people in other places. That's awesome

80
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,860
Yeah, and so I've started playing some Mario parties with folks who live in other states

81
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,940
Okay, some friends of mine and I am essentially undefeated. I

82
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,520
Should grant I accept and I understand fully sure game is mostly random sure sure

83
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,540
It's for children. Well, I understand all these things

84
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,300
Um, but yeah, I've been I've been killing it in the the Mario party game

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,380
I don't think there's anything wrong with getting confirmation as an adult that you could defeat children at something. Yeah, you know

86
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:01,980
It's good. Yeah, it's nice. Sometimes you see kids do stuff and you're like, there's no chance I have at competing with that

87
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,140
Yeah, you know and that makes you feel bad because you're an adult

88
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,840
Mm-hmm, but really beating the shit out of kids can sometimes be well

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,580
Maybe that's too far but really beating them can feel good

90
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:16,820
One of the one of the fun things too about this this Mario party this this iteration of the game is that they have these spaces

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,120
Where you can get a friend you can get an ally and so you'll just have like I always play as Waluigi

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Yeah, you know like of course you do. Of course

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,960
I want to get Donkey Kong or Diddy Kong to be my friend and follow me around the board. Naturally. It's so fun

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,340
Anyway, Jordan today we have an episode to go over. We're gonna be back into the present today

95
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,980
Ooh, that's a bad place to be. It is. We're gonna be talking about June 10th, 2021, Blackjack. Ahh!

96
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,620
Again, that's my new response to that. Bummer. Missed. Missed again. Maybe maybe that's the new bit

97
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,580
so it's

98
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,260
It's a day. It's a day. It's a monumental day in a lot of ways

99
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Okay, it is also a day of

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,340
walking through

101
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Knee deep mud. Yeah

102
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,380
for Alex's content. I imagine it's a day of

103
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,420
Avoiding topics. Uh, yeah, not a lot of topics come up. Yeah, some very important things like whether or not we're all gonna die

104
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,260
That is dealt with quite at length. I mean that seems pretty important

105
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,260
Yes, unless the answer is no in which case it's not very important at all. Is it? You can put that on the back burner

106
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,620
Okay, that's fair

107
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,140
So today we're gonna get down to business on this but before we do let's say hello to some new wonks

108
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,940
Oh, that's a great idea. So first, Dr.

109
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,980
David strange hate or how I signed up for the patreon to get all of the podcast extras and the exclusive audio feed

110
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:42,740
But I only got two because everything is uploaded as a video. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

111
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,940
Thank you so much. To be clear to dr. Strange, David strange hate and everybody else. There's nothing that is behind a paywall

112
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,340
Yeah, we tried very hard to keep things as far away from a paywall as possible and maybe we could do a better job

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
putting some of those videos as audio, but

114
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,180
Yeah

115
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,340
Next from brother Ben Matt W. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

116
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,460
Thank you very much Matt W. That was from his brother Ben. Oh, okay

117
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:16,060
I freeze that. Yeah, next Emily Finch. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thanks Emily

118
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,820
Oh and Blandy and candy. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

119
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,740
Oh, thank you very much Blandy and candy

120
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:30,100
Thank you and a couple of technocrats out there. I'd like to give a little wave to first Stevie P's most dirty dossier

121
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,780
Thank you so much. You are now policy wonk and brew ha ha Chicago's drinking pot. Thank you so much

122
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:42,060
You are now a technocrat. I'm a policy wonk crikey mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew. How's your 401k doing, bro?

123
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,060
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson. All right, let's just get down to business

124
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,620
We ain't making that money off that heroin. Why you pimps so good. My neck is freakishly large

125
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,180
I declare info war on you. Thank you all so much

126
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,980
Yes, thank you very much. Not to not to correct you but to clarify I believe Stevie P's dirty dossier is also a technocrat

127
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,940
Correct. Yes, you accidentally said policy wonk. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. I didn't want anybody

128
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,080
You were gonna get so many Twitter messages that were used to been like, oh man. I appreciate you checking me

129
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,340
I told you before we started recording. I barely got any sleep

130
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,340
Totally that's what I'm here for. I'm not judging you. No, I appreciate the the subtle show

131
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,380
So Jordan we have to do a little segment before we get into today's episode

132
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,700
It's a segment that is taking the world by storm seems to be giving someone life is giving someone death

133
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
You could say that

134
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,380
Oh life is death you can that's true. Yep, so Renee

135
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,020
Who is the best cat uncle and snail dad who had a birthday on the 6th? Happy birthday. Happy birthday

136
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,640
Also, this is this is a this is a weird one

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,660
Mm-hmm. So Sarah sent me a message and said that her friend Joe has a birthday in June June here

138
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,380
Okay, so happy birthday Joe

139
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:09,080
All right, Joe Sarah also told me that Joe will not say when his birthday is interesting just that it's

140
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,720
I like this. Yeah, I like this a great deal. I am completely Phil Hartman in news radio

141
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,860
I'm conflicted on one level. I enjoy people retaining some mystery in their life, of course

142
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,620
But on the other hand, I'm like just tell your friend when the birthday is

143
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,600
If you're not on Facebook, they might not remember anyway these days most people need that Facebook reminder to get a birthday

144
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I mean, there's only one way to

145
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,460
If somebody doesn't want to tell you their birthday, then you have to surreptitiously discover it in any way pop

146
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,960
You know, like follow them to the DMV one, right? You know just and then be in the corner just with a little

147
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,660
Pair of magnifying glasses or your opera glasses if you will something along those lines, you know, you have to do something

148
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,340
You gotta reach out to a podcast and have the host

149
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:01,620
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea tell it tell Sarah what day your birth why haven't you texted his parents? They're there

150
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,900
They're ready and waiting to give you their birthday. Yeah. Also, this is not a birthday. This is a congratulations to Camry

151
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,920
This is graduating from the University of Ottawa. Oh

152
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,820
Okay, engineering degree. I realize this is now just spiraling completely out of control

153
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,500
We've lost it completely. This is this is our new show. Basically, I don't even know if we do Alex Jones related content anymore

154
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
And we have one more one more birthday message

155
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,700
This this fella Eric actually sent a message. He wanted me to read and be

156
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,180
Jordan just shook his head. No, no. Sorry Eric Eric. Love you. That's a big that's a big shake of the head for me

157
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Happy 22nd birthday, Alexandra

158
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,780
You're the happily ever after in my story, and I hope you have a wonderful day

159
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,700
Remember to work for progress not perfection and keep sight of what's on the other side. There you go. All right

160
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,860
Well, I'm not doing that again. That's a good wedding toast, but I don't think it's ever happened

161
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,420
I'm not doing that again because we are getting dangerously close to territory that I am deeply uncomfortable

162
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,860
No, we're we're borderline morning zoo crew at this. Yeah, but but Alexandra. Hope you have a great birthday. Yes, of course

163
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
boy

164
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,740
Being born is a condition that leads to death

165
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,380
You can say that life is a disease that ends in death. Happy life is death day to all of you. Absolutely

166
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,740
So Jordan we got to get this episode June 10th to go over

167
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,820
All right, and here's not a context drop from today's show. My testicles are like, I guess like superstars. Yeah. All right

168
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,080
Alex's testicles are superstars in what like in testicle related fields or or like

169
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,060
As celebrity is it an influencer situation here as testicles average 17

170
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:49,100
Rebound last season. Okay, so he starts out the show and I would describe it as

171
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,460
Bad weird mood if he were anybody but himself sure since he is himself. It's a regular morning

172
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
I would describe it as a pretty normal

173
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,980
Now I've been saying this a lot before the shows just because all I do is tell you how I feel

174
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,260
But I'm having a real trouble doing these products. It's a great way of putting it. That's a really great way because of

175
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,980
how this is really

176
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,600
Starting to set in on me that this is it

177
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:23,820
And they're really killing people all around us and maybe people all around us and I was already ready today to come on air

178
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,940
And look at the real numbers of the unprecedented amounts of young people

179
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,860
having heart attacks having strokes even dying from the so-called COVID vaccines and

180
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,580
then I

181
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Was sent a big Twitter feed

182
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,060
By a good friend of mine a national talk show host about a 30 minutes for the show

183
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,580
so I ended up reading this Twitter feed of medical documents and CDC numbers and

184
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
I

185
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,940
Actually got dizzy and almost passed out Alex almost passed out cuz he read a Twitter thread Wow

186
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,900
Yeah, it's it's a little much it's kind of amazing how

187
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,340
Accidentally self-aware that first bit. All I do is get on the radio and tell you how I feel

188
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,780
Yeah, it's such a great like yeah, man. Yeah, you got it. You have identified the problem

189
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:21,180
Yes, you nailed it. All you do people tune in to hear you feel things. Yeah, and it's

190
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:28,860
Terrible, it's somehow weirdly cathartic for people who are really angry. Yes. Yeah. Oh god. No, that's me, isn't it?

191
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,820
Fuck. Yeah, I um, I was interested in what was going on here. What was up with this Twitter thread?

192
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,420
I wasn't so interested in his like I'm so angry. I can't do the show. Sure. It's so we've heard it

193
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,540
Yeah happens all the time. Yeah, the present day is like it's it's it's so boring with something that's so

194
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,620
Interesting. Mm-hmm. Like anybody else doing this would be

195
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
good groundbreaking

196
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,660
Anybody who had a boss

197
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,540
Oh my god, they're gonna get fired. Yeah must mean it

198
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,740
This is how TV shows start and then they get worse from there, but the first episode you like

199
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,580
Yeah, it's Alex Alex talks a little bit more about this

200
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,900
You know, you have that effect where quote women would get overwhelmed by something and just pass out

201
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,540
And that's really the point. I've gotten to where I'm just like

202
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,580
Nothing's stopping any of this. It's just rolling forward. I was reading

203
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,660
about hundreds of thousands of people getting sick from the shots that are young how they're targeting our children and it just

204
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,060
Pisses me off. And so my brain says go out and you know, do you know what people are doing this?

205
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,080
I just it's just overwhelming. It's just overwhelming to watch him kill us like this

206
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
So

207
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
It is overwhelming that's pretty overwhelming

208
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,200
so I looked up the most recent information on the CDC's website and there have been reports of

209
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,560
5208 deaths of people who have gotten one of the kovat 19 vaccines. All right

210
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,760
This is out of 302 million doses administered which represents a point zero zero one seven death rate. Oh, that's too dangerous

211
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,200
So like but that's even if you assume the ridiculous absolute worst-case scenario that all of the deaths are even related or linked to the vaccines

212
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,560
At all, it would be a point zero zero one seven

213
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,760
It's just too dangerous for a vaccine Dan and the truth of the matter is that they are not all connected

214
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,960
No, of course not. So so it's too dangerous to even hear about the vaccine. I guess so

215
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,440
Yeah, it's also there is something that's been happening

216
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,280
Lately there have been some more more reports of younger people having some heart inflammation

217
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,680
Sure, that could be connected to vaccination and it's something that needs more study

218
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:50,200
Of course, there have been 623 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis in persons aged 30 or under post vaccination

219
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,120
These are primarily males and and through review of medical records. The CDC was able to confirm

220
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:04,120
268 of these reports none of these cases have resulted in deaths and only 15 ended up hospitalized with 41 of them experiencing ongoing

221
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,080
unspecified symptoms

222
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,360
This is not good obviously and it's something that the CDC is investigating and when they have more information

223
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,120
We'll know a bit more about it

224
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,640
but the way that Alex is dealing with this story is just sensational to the point of

225
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,520
Being dangerous like yeah, it makes me want to do you know what yeah, we do know what yeah

226
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,640
You're talking about killing people. It is it is amazing that he's he's exemplary. You know, he's he's doing part of the trolley

227
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,960
Ethical question where he's like, you know, we can't

228
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,440
Hurt one person with a vaccine to save five other people's lives

229
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
What we need to do is

230
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,400
Throw that person in front of the train and then have the train run over the five people after that

231
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,520
And then I live happily ever after and that person I'm gonna throw in front of a train is a doctor. Yes, exactly

232
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Yes, I'm going to get all of these people killed and then I'm going to jump on top of the train and fly

233
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, so the first hour I would say is meandering

234
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,200
It's it's a bit meandering and it's unfortunate because as we as we learn in this this next clip

235
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Alex has so much news that he's so big like his balls. He's getting chills

236
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,480
20 years ago out of a hundred or articles or so. There might be one really big one. I

237
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:31,080
Have more than 50 devastating reports that are confirmed that send chills up my spine lightning round

238
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
And

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,400
It's just it's the real realization of how screwed we are

240
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,860
It'd be like if I walked outside and looked up at the Sun and saw it like explode and I'd go oh my gosh

241
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,080
It feels something kind of like that it's it's like the whoo Wow

242
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,120
because they have set something in motion that is the planned organized total collapse of

243
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,640
Civilization and mass death. So Alex is in a bad mood

244
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
We're all dead

245
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,680
It's pretty definite there doesn't seem to be much wiggle room. No, no, this was this would seem serious if here if you're

246
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Think that's the end for all of us

247
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,280
Even if it was the planned explosion into a red giant earth is still gone, man. Yeah

248
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,720
Yeah, and that the way he's speaking about this is obviously meant to be like there's nothing that you can do. We're all fucking dead

249
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,960
Yeah, yeah, and it's um, I mean, it's certainly not inspiring

250
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,320
That's the that's not the up-over-the-hill man charge that you necessarily want, right?

251
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:52,740
I know that Patton when he was giving some of his sort of famous speeches generally be like we're fucking

252
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,700
We're screwed

253
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,860
We shall fight them on the beaches. It won't matter. You're all fucking dead. I saw the song blow up

254
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,880
So I think that if you see the Sun blow up metaphorically

255
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,540
One of the things that you might want to do is run away to a bunker

256
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,180
You know, I mean if it's the Sun you I would just lay down and be like, let's do this man

257
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,100
There's no hope at this point. That's why I said metaphorically. Okay metaphorically you might want to run away to the hills

258
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,940
Sure, and Alex is certainly feeling that pressure. Okay, it's the end of civilization

259
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,860
Fast and it's not even a selfishness, but my very cells

260
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,800
Say get out of Austin get your family out and go to the most remote area and dig in now go

261
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,780
But if we do that the globalist win boo, and they're gonna accelerate their collapse and finally dig us out of our holes later

262
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:54,060
Every show is now coming out with dystopic mass death planetary extermination robots killing us

263
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,220
under you in command because they're

264
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,740
Pre-conditioning everyone to accept that and that that is the future that's about to unfold and I mean the video games the movies

265
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,900
All of it. What about movies from like the 60s about robots? No, no

266
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
I don't know

267
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,380
Battlestar Galactica never happened every movie is now about the UN having killer robots

268
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,140
That's true I find it so funny that we're also in the past and he's like

269
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm pretty sure that Saddam is in the United States or he's in Russia in Australia

270
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,220
And then he's like they're gonna come and dig us up out of our holes and I'm like, ah, you don't even know man

271
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Oh you in the past don't even know

272
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,580
Some people get dug out of holes buddy

273
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,940
Yeah

274
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,940
so Alex is pretty pretty doom heavy here like even actually kind of more so than usual like I think a lot of the

275
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,980
Time he doesn't descend this deeply

276
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Into that abyss. It seems early too. It's it was immediate. Yeah, that's

277
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,620
You gotta you gotta ease me into that. It was immediate and it kept going over commercial breaks

278
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,960
Like you'd go to commercial and he'd come back and he was still doing this. All right. Okay fucking die

279
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,900
All right, so we're in we're in full-on the the guy and watchmen shouting for the end of the world territory

280
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:20,180
That's what was that's what's going on. Well, here's the situation Jordan when you have been like, let's say I

281
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,980
Don't know convicted of a horrible crime and you're put in front of the the firing squad. Sure. They'll put a little

282
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,100
A blindfold over you. Yeah, I was polite. Yeah, so you don't have to see the bullet coming

283
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,580
You don't want to do that Alex is doing the opposite and in this next clip

284
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,060
He wonders if maybe he shouldn't do the opposite. Maybe he should allow people to just have a blindfold. Okay

285
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,340
This is not a deer in the headlights moment, it's

286
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,300
It's almost obscene

287
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,020
To even tell everybody this it's kind of like they put a blindfold on somebody who's in a firing squad

288
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,980
so they'd have to watch themselves be killed and

289
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,260
They and they give you a cigarette maybe a little bottle of brandy an hour before

290
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,460
also polite

291
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
So, you know what

292
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,540
The public's not gonna wake up and stop this anyways, they don't want to they're that we're cursed

293
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,260
We kill our babies they kill our old people. And so I guess I

294
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,620
just guess prepare to have everything collapsed and

295
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:34,460
Destroyed and and to die. I mean, I guess that's just really it prepare to die seems to be Alex's message

296
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,260
Today, I mean that's a what what day was the 10th was that those Thursday that was Thursday

297
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,060
Yeah, right before the weekend. I get it. No, I get it. You know, it's like Arthur Dent

298
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:52,300
You know, it's like Arthur Dent. He just never got the hang of Thursdays man that happens. What are you gonna do? It's tough

299
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,980
You know, it's like everybody's working for the weekend. Mm-hmm. It's just rough. Yeah lover boy

300
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Pissed off his hell about Thursdays

301
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,540
So there might be an answer yeah, maybe and from listening to this clip

302
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,340
I don't know if this is exactly the message you're gonna take away from it

303
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,420
But it seems to me like maybe the answer is blindly accepting whatever Alex wants you to do

304
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,140
And not questioning anything and just doing it

305
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:27,100
Wow seems to be what he thinks will solve all the problems in the world vis-a-vis the globalist. So he's starting a religion

306
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,780
maybe

307
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Because this mad scientist evil

308
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,420
this post-humanist evil

309
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,860
Has figured out all the angles

310
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:44,860
and the only way you beat it is recognizing the angles and it's full spectrum assault and then do the exact opposite but

311
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:52,940
Instead the public likes to debate and argue and act silly and and and fight with each other at the low level

312
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,380
And if you do that

313
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,220
We have zero chance if we just woke up and accepted god

314
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:05,340
And and did what god said to do and stood against the new world order then this evil would just evaporate like

315
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,340
Phantom is it gone?

316
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,380
That everybody can feel it everybody can see it

317
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,820
And

318
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,180
That's just what it comes down to so here's what I'm gonna do

319
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:37,500
Here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna make sure we stay on here as long as we can and make sure that that's dealt with

320
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Make sure our own house is in order

321
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,220
And then i'm gonna come back and i'm gonna hit all this finish

322
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,340
As best I can i'm just gonna cover it and then that's gonna be it

323
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
What

324
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:56,060
Alex you're still doing a great job, but maybe next few segments you can't put stuff on screen because

325
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,900
I'm here talking and they just put a screen clip up

326
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:06,700
Of people in new york saying we want to wear masks forever. We don't want to take them off. We like them. There are blankets

327
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,620
Sure

328
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
And that's something I was going to cover later, but see

329
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
That's painful to look at

330
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,540
And so i'm right on the edge of just not being able to handle this anymore

331
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,800
Plus it it then just becomes a distraction

332
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,900
From what i'm already covering what i'm doing and i'm not bitching at the crew

333
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,020
I told them to put stuff up on screen. It's just this point. I may have to start doing a show in a radio booth

334
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,340
And the crew can go run other shows or something and i'm just going to go back to reading articles and covering those because

335
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:44,220
Because I can't look at joe biden. I can't look at the mask cult. I can't look at another animal human clone

336
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,620
Aren't we already dead? What's going on? Okay, so if I understand correctly, here's how the show is going so far

337
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,180
I think also that clip is very indicative of how the show is going. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, please

338
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:04,860
Yeah, so if I understand correctly, we're all dead. We're all already dead. Yes. We need to prepare to die. Yeah, uh,

339
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,060
My crew put up a picture of joe biden and uh people supporting him

340
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,860
So I am going to throw a hissy fit. I'm gonna go off the air. Uh

341
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,060
The end I don't even think it's i'm gonna go off the air

342
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:24,800
It's that i'm gonna i'm gonna threaten to just do radio now because i'm too distracted by images. That's bananas

343
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:33,340
That is unprofessional to a level of like I think pathology. I think I think it's honestly just solving the wrong problem

344
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,980
you know

345
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,100
I'm too distracted by pictures to do my job and therefore get rid of the pictures

346
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,580
I guess I guess it is a solution

347
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:50,300
But you know if somebody jangles plastic keys in the room, I can no longer function as a human being

348
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,060
So just get rid of all plastic keys everywhere dan. It makes perfect sense. That does make sense unless

349
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,300
Jangling plastic keys are a major component of your job. There is that yeah, that is a problem

350
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:09,260
Yeah, I do work at a jangling keys factory. So there is there are a lot of disorienting things. You might have to learn

351
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,980
how to

352
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:18,380
Focus your attention, uh better you could change you that was possible. I'm just tossing that out there. Yeah

353
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,020
yeah, and I and I think I think that that also the idea of like

354
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,900
If you just saw all the angles and all this we would just be able to defeat the new world order

355
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Yeah, like that's that's just your code for like if everybody just thought the exact same way I did. Oh, yeah

356
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,260
Oh, yeah, nonsense if we all just did what god told us to do who's telling me what god is telling me to do

357
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,380
Let me ask you that question because that's a really important question. Spoiler alert. It's alex. Yeah, that sounds right

358
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,660
so, uh the vaccine side effects are something that alex is

359
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:54,700
Greatly exaggerating and not dealing with seriously. Um, and uh, if you need any more evidence of that

360
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,300
You know, the worst thing is uh, reading all these federal documents

361
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,740
And how they know by design that they're giving the young people shots now that are going to mess up their hearts livers and brains

362
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,100
And lungs for life, which is not going to be very long

363
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,220
And then of course I I knew this a while ago while they're doing it

364
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,860
Not just about killing you

365
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,860
Yeah

366
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,540
It's a sacrifice to the youth and that pleases their god

367
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,900
And also it's going to weigh down and hurt their families and cause great anguish in their families

368
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,060
Because you're supposed to bury your parents not bury your children. Yeah, you see you see

369
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:44,460
These vaccines the the the side effects that people might experience are a sacrament to satan, right? Yep, right, right

370
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
right

371
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,540
I just can't disagree with any of that. Sure

372
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,860
It's just airtight. You're not supposed to bury your parents

373
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,380
Or I mean the other way around i've heard that said yeah parents not supposed to bury their child

374
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,900
Yeah, see there we go

375
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:08,380
And then if that makes sense, I assume that all the preceding arguments have to make sense as well it all it all tracks

376
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,260
Yeah, so the public is in a trance and that is a problem for alex because his whole thing is about like

377
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,780
Dealing with people who aren't in a trance. Yeah, but it seems like that is the better thing if we're all gonna die

378
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,660
No matter what as he was arguing earlier, maybe just let people stay in the trance put on a blindfold

379
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,140
Yeah, I think that alex is essentially admitting failure here because

380
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,860
His self-appointed role is that guy who yells and wakes people up out of their trance exactly

381
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,260
So if his primary complaint is that people are too much in a trance that means that you are ineffective at the job

382
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,620
You have given yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't know if I don't know if I would be proud of this next clip

383
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,160
If I were alex, okay, and then I just see the public mesmerized

384
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,100
Into a trance watching their sports and playing their video games

385
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,780
And I can't join the globalist because that

386
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:11,580
That's evil and I don't want to prey on people and then most of the public he says predator. I'm saying

387
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:19,020
I guess we're just here to tell the truth and let people make a decision for themselves and it'll all work out in god's plan

388
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,140
but uh

389
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,140
I mean, I feel like i'm being punched in the chest right now

390
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,180
And I I don't know what it is. I'm supposed to do to not feel like that

391
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:34,940
I don't really feel good about everything i'm doing quit your job and almost always when I feel like this. It means there's some answer

392
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,620
There's something we're supposed to do right now. I'm going to stop this

393
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,140
I guess that's really what it is. I feel extreme guilt

394
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,180
And I'm not someone in my life that feels a lot of guilt

395
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,140
You should I know that you should feel a lot of guilt

396
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,220
That's why I may have to go off here today because I don't want to just sit up here and talk about how I feel

397
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,180
Oh, this isn't some calculated thing before I came in today to say all this I I I

398
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,260
I have stacks of government documents stacks of reports that are all total nightmares all ten on a richter scale of tyranny

399
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,700
Just

400
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,380
Just some person nearby just needs to be like alex. Just do your job

401
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:22,060
Yeah, just shut up and do your job. Yeah, what are you doing? Don't talk about how well you could do your job. Yes

402
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:29,420
Don't talk about how it's everybody else's fault. You can't do your job a little annoying just do your job man

403
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:34,380
Just one time and I would I would argue that it actually is

404
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:41,500
A calculated thing that alex is doing and not necessarily because he decided to get on air and act like a weirdo

405
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,140
It's that he didn't prepare at all exactly

406
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:51,420
He chose not to get ready to do his show at all. And so he has to fill time rambling about nothing now

407
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
We're all gonna die

408
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,100
You can't just come out and say sorry. Yeah, I have to burn an hour because i've only got two I have

409
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,420
Too much news to get over. I have to talk about all of this

410
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,620
I'm gonna kill a third of the show saying

411
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,060
Complete horseshit, nothing gotta gotta do that. I gotta do that to really get into the news

412
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,900
But you know what else he has to do. What's that predict things? Okay

413
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,260
And we'll be sitting here in a year or two with you know, run 10k to raise money

414
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,460
Because you know all the neurological problems and they'll have movie stars up there. Well, let's get together and

415
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,100
Finally at a certain point 10 years down the road or even sooner they'll say well

416
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,720
Folks are signing on to volunteer to be euthanized

417
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,800
because they know they're too much of a weight on society and

418
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,960
They'll get some extra money and get to party for a few weeks before they are killed

419
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,080
And that's all the plan here. That's the plan

420
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Is this plan f now?

421
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,360
We got a lot of plans on the air a lot of plans up in the air all the time

422
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,720
I don't know. I don't know if I can handle this many plans. They don't seem like complementary plans. No, they sure don't

423
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,160
Yeah, so then two years celebrities will be doing

424
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,040
5k charity things. Yeah, I would assume that's true not necessarily for people who

425
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,880
like were hurt by a vaccine side effect from covid but sure, you know, there are certainly

426
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,520
You know experiences that people have had about long covid, you know, there's totally there are

427
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,920
Things that we will learn moving forward that we're not aware of now or we're starting to become aware of now

428
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,160
I could see celebrities doing fundraising for some sort of charity

429
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,760
Uh in that line. Yeah, 10 years from now

430
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,080
Alex believes there will be so many people who have been hurt by the covid vaccine right that there will be

431
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,000
euthanasia

432
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
Uh drives going on where you get to party

433
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,520
Aha a little bit if you agree to let them kill you get a little extra money. Yeah, and you then that's for your family

434
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,640
Yeah, okay

435
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,240
So it's a little bit like looper is that kind of what we're dealing with here?

436
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,120
We're dealing with you sign a contract for about 10 years and then you get killed like I I I guess

437
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,240
It's kind of like suicide bombers, but without the bomb it does seem a little bit like that. Yeah, I don't know

438
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,720
I don't I think this is uh, one of them, uh, predictions that alex is gonna forget he made

439
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,920
Who's gonna run the 5k's 10 years from now when we've got all these euthanasia drives going all the runners will be dead

440
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
I assume they're the first to go. Uh-huh

441
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,520
So when you were worried about like who's gonna be uh, interpreting the words of god. Yes

442
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,200
And I told you it was alex. Yeah, I tend to be worried about that, too

443
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:36,000
I believe that it's alex primarily because he seems to think that churches are all full of betrayers. Well, there's that so this is

444
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
in today's stuff

445
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
And your church isn't gonna say a word

446
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,360
They just want to party

447
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,600
They just want to have a good time a lot like churches. I know well, I'm not gonna say a word

448
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,240
Have a good time a lot like churches. I know

449
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Hell

450
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,520
You're not gonna find more satanic group of people than the folks that run the churches

451
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,480
Because they're the real betrayers that went there to make sure there wouldn't be a church to fight this when it was needed

452
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,320
So i'm sorry folks i'm real sorry

453
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,400
And i'm not trying to depress you, you know, it means god's plans real and we're being judged but this is gonna be rough

454
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,360
My church wants to party all the time

455
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,600
God there were so many fucking parties at my church when I was young. Oh god all the time

456
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,560
Non-stop partying even the parties that we did have at our church weren't fun. No, we didn't even have communion wine

457
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:38,320
We run out from so many fucking parties. Dan. We we in our youth group. We had like, uh, every every I think it was every

458
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,300
sunday, uh, we have evening sunday evening, uh, just youth group, uh,

459
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:50,660
Services or whatever and afterwards they'd get uh papa john's pizza. Yes, right. Yeah, but you had to pay for slice

460
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,100
That's not fun. That's not a party

461
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
In the church. Yeah. Oh, man

462
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:04,660
You realized jesus would have run in there and started throwing pizza all around the place like no commerce in this motherfucking place

463
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:11,860
Right flipping the pepperoncini box. Of course get the also olives olives. Yeah, it was uh, not fun

464
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,940
I'm jesus and I don't like olives this episode is just a mess

465
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,220
yeah, like the whole first hour is this it is outrageous like and it's

466
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,620
it's even worse once alex starts trying to explain why he's feeling the way he is because

467
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,180
It's just such bullshit

468
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,860
So here's what sent me for a tailspin because I already knew all this but it kind of all crystallized 10 minutes for the show

469
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
And then

470
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,220
There's some things I want to tell you and I can't tell you because the sources they told me not to sure

471
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,220
and i've never

472
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:02,180
michael own a source and i've never given information out sometimes there's information you can't get out because

473
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,340
If you get out any of it

474
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,780
It gives it away from the source before they finish the work they're doing but there's a major counter-strike to all this in the works

475
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,620
right now

476
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:18,340
But uh, it's been confirmed the documents have been seen that this is a kill plan. So there's a kill plan. Um

477
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,420
Okay

478
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,140
All right

479
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:27,460
So yeah, alex has a source that he can't give up sure and he can't speak in specifics because the source, you know

480
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,940
Blow their cover still working too hard. Yes still working under under cover

481
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,900
I guess is alex talking to steve again. Is this a double agent situation?

482
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Is this somebody in the government who's viewing the kill plan documents?

483
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,460
Anybody who actually has access to anything would never talk to a dick like this

484
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,180
No one would talk to alex

485
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,100
He gets on air and talks about how we're all gonna die for an hour at the beginning of his show

486
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,180
Yep, i'm gonna be like, oh, hey alex. I've got to get your brain in on this

487
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,020
See, this is why I just can't be allowed to be part of the government because I swear to god

488
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,060
I would crank call alex at least once a week and be like i've got some documents for you

489
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,980
I'd send him pictures of bullshit. It would never not be hilarious to me for them to show up the next day

490
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:18,420
Yeah, it would just never not be fun. I'm not certain that you have to work in the government to do that

491
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
Get yourself a proton mail, uh

492
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
sure

493
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:30,500
You could probably uh plant some stories lieutenant colonel bull s hit

494
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,260
At protonmail.com. Mr. Bull

495
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,740
My grandpa served

496
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:45,620
Under you and uh, which one did your great grandpa serve in was the north or the south which one was it?

497
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,380
Texas, okay, texas. Okay. Okay. I got you

498
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,340
Um, so yeah

499
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:57,620
I guess alex was sent into a tailspin at the beginning or right before the show because of some secret information that he got from

500
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,500
a source

501
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,860
Or a twitter thread that he read that almost made him pass out sure not entirely sure which

502
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,100
It is but maybe his secret source is this twitter thread. I don't know

503
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,580
I mean, I understand being thrown off by what would be relatively petty things

504
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,940
like one thing that threw me off during that clip was literally going like

505
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,140
Why don't I remember the theme song to tailspin?

506
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:26,900
And then I realized that because every time I think about the theme song to tailspin I go did it tailspin we and i'm like

507
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,060
That's ducktails. That's ducktails. I can't do that. Do you remember tailspin?

508
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,580
I think I did the exact same thing that you did in my head just then yeah

509
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,220
I think that it might not have had lyrics. I remember having loud drums

510
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,540
I think the tailspin theme song didn't have lyrics. I think it was just instrumental interesting

511
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,940
I'm, not sure but I did do the ducktail set

512
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:52,820
Totally totally so we got a kill plan on our hands not entirely sure exactly how this is going to play out. Uh,

513
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,340
Who do you think is way up at the top of this and I i'll tell you sure not a person organization

514
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,460
Okay, so if you're asking me it can't be the un that seems too obvious

515
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,660
Well, actually i'm asking you because we've been listening to this show

516
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,980
for all the time that covet has existed yes, and

517
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,780
You should know

518
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:20,420
By now who's running all this? Oh, if there's a kill plan sure who's running it. Well the devil, of course

519
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,020
No, no, no, no. Oh china. No biden. No

520
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
Stelter. No fauci. No

521
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,740
the cfr

522
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,540
No

523
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
the un no

524
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Brazil no, who cares?

525
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:40,580
I've been talking to folks that have seen the official government plans. Uh-huh cia put out by the

526
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,620
major foundations

527
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,300
oh the uh

528
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,500
carny endowment

529
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,520
That's why the carny endowment is not in full control get bill gates once again. The cia is run by the carny endowment

530
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,140
And it's just a total extermination plan. I mean final solution. We're all dead

531
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:03,700
It's like wow. Wow, you guys are really evil because I knew they were evil but man

532
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,980
It's bad enough wanting to wipe out third world people

533
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
I don't want to kill them, but I know that

534
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,620
They don't have jobs futures any of that. I'm not signed on to kill them. But this plan is to kill everybody

535
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,780
Whoa, that got weird at the end there

536
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,580
Um that is that's just bad writing

537
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,340
That's just bad writing to all of a sudden come up with a brand new villain at the very end to swoop in and cause

538
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,860
That's like if at the end of the scooby-doo episode. They took the mask off and they're like

539
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,220
Terry from three towns down the street. What are you doing here?

540
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:39,300
And he's like, oh just do this i'm certain that alex has never been like big on the carnegie endowment, but it's true

541
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,980
That was not some

542
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:48,740
Organization that's come up as one of our even in the mix. No players. No, not tertiary not tangential just gone

543
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:56,420
John's hopkins is constantly a villain the gates foundation. Of course nation naturally, uh, cfr, obviously

544
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,220
Yeah, the uh, the rockefeller foundation

545
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
Yeah, I don't know. I I uh

546
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:09,300
I mean the rothchilds are always in the mix. You could have just tossed the rothchilds in there. Nope carnegie endowment carnegie endowment, boo

547
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,660
You know, you know what you have to do to destroy the world dan practice practice practice also fuck alex

548
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:22,260
We're saying uh that stuff about people in the developing world. They have no future. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck yourself. Fuck yourself

549
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:28,820
Um, so alex has these sources that have told him about the kill plan and he doesn't just believe these sources now

550
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,300
I should tell you he does just believe these well naturally, but he doesn't just believe no

551
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,180
I mean, I see i've just got stuff like that going on

552
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,180
And I don't just believe people that have seen the documents

553
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,700
I can see the documents all in front of me how they're implementing it

554
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,480
Everything I was told by the individual that saw this plan

555
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:55,960
And held the plan is in event 201. The plan is in lockstep. The plan is in crimson contagion. The plan is all there

556
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,920
But but specifically they've reached the point now of recruiting

557
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,280
Levels deep into government corporations and are have gone operational now

558
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,040
So they're even telling people the plan to get them on board

559
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,480
Hey, like, uh, you know, you and your family are going to live

560
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,400
If you want to be part of that 500 million that live

561
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,800
It's on the georgia guide stones. You better get on board right now and you'll get up space for your family

562
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,360
during the collapse

563
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,640
But of course you read deeper and this is what these individuals were able to see

564
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,840
it's exactly what they've told us that they believe all humans must be gotten rid of and

565
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,720
And above that there's not much knowledge, but everybody including top pentagon four-star generals

566
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,760
They think it's aliens some deal has been made with aliens to kill everybody

567
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,560
and then the people that the small group that does it gets to like

568
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Like the board or whatever join these things. I

569
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,000
Man, all i'm telling you is is that everybody's dead

570
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
That's all I can tell you everybody's dead

571
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,120
I mean

572
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:03,000
If the if true, uh, I I guess there's nothing really we can do right? I mean if you make a deal with aliens

573
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,440
Um, that's out of my that's above my pay grade four-star generals

574
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,480
Think there's a deal with aliens

575
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,320
Then we gotta get new generals. Yeah, that would be good

576
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,600
Um, yeah, there's been a deal with it. Yeah, there's only gonna be 500 billion left. We made a deal with aliens

577
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,960
It's a real bummer. Yeah, I mean on the one hand what if the aliens other deal was like we kill everybody

578
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
That's a good deal

579
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:36,760
Um compared to that. Yeah compared to the human extinction if we live in a scenario where there is kill everyone

580
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:44,520
Or kill all but a hundred people. Yeah, obviously kill all but a hundred people is the preferable option to everybody dying. Exactly. Um,

581
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,320
Yeah, I mean it's all made up. So sure

582
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:53,080
Sure. Sure. It's we go back to the trolley problem again. Alex is just feeling bad

583
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:59,400
What if there are 7.7 billion people in front of a train and we've got a hundred we could save

584
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,920
I think it makes perfect sense

585
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,280
So you got to just get right with god because everybody's gonna die and alex is just he's giving very little hope

586
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,720
Uh at all in this first hour sure get right with god. Do the aliens know god?

587
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,880
It's it's debatable whether they're actually aliens they might be demons they might be demons that's fair

588
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,480
You're right. So you got to get right with god and then alex introduces a guest

589
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,760
He's gonna have and mike down for this because he honestly sounds a little bit pissed that he's gonna be interviewed

590
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,800
Oh no

591
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,720
And the dominoes are falling the the the the the the program has already started the countdown is here

592
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,960
And I I don't know what to do. I just get right with god. That's all I can say

593
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Instead we'll talk to my pillow guy

594
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:48,840
Which will be fun. I'm sure nice guy really cares. That's a good heart fight the tyranny. Wow

595
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,440
Wow

596
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,440
Get right with god

597
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,720
You can almost hear the silent we're gonna talk to the fucking my pillow. Yes, totally. No. No, I heard it

598
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,680
I heard the fucking that was not spoken so loud

599
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,200
so this is the episode of mike lindell from my pillow comes on for his first appearance on info wars, which is

600
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,760
Baffling that it's his first appearance. That is baffling. Yeah for it says a lot for a guy to go from

601
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,120
Um, limerick soap man to shit talking the my pillow guy

602
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,960
I'm, just saying maybe you're uh getting above your britches there, buddy

603
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,360
Well, I was thinking about like what the dynamics are here and why alex might be like

604
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,560
Not super happy about this and I think why mike wouldn't be super happy about this either

605
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,480
Is is because neither of this is neither of their first choice. No

606
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,640
um alex probably doesn't want to talk to him because he's nuts and he sounds and

607
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,800
He has the potential to drag alex into litigation with uh, you know slanderous claims. Totally. Yeah

608
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,200
Yeah, he's throwing him around like water. Yeah, and I think that he's somebody who

609
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,000
Um, you know, you could you could end up getting uh dragged into court

610
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,480
for having too close of an association with particularly in uh,

611
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,340
This sort of a setting interviewing them and allowing them to broadcast

612
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,640
slanderous claims

613
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,920
about uh

614
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,760
Various things it does people and organizations. It does seem like mike lindell comes along with the same

615
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:23,240
Producer as like a prank show where after you talk to mike lindell some lawyer just runs up to you real quick

616
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,120
And he's like, okay. I just need to give you a quick interview. You're gonna need to sign this statement

617
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,520
Exactly. Yeah

618
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,240
um, so and I also think that mike can't be super happy about this either because

619
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,360
He's been in the trump orbit in one of these people for a while now

620
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,240
If he wanted to be on info wars, he would have been on there long ago long ago

621
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,320
He would have been on there when roger was on and when the good days were going

622
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:55,320
Yep, and the reason that he didn't is because obviously no one wants to be on info wars. It's the last resort

623
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,160
Even for these shit head grifters for the my pillow guy

624
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:07,000
Yes, this is slumming it mike lindell is doing this because he's not allowed on those other channels anymore because he's being sued

625
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:12,200
by smartmatic and dominion and those claims are all he wants to talk about and those those

626
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,280
Networks just won't let him uh spread that shit. So where can he info wars?

627
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,960
Alex is the last person who will let him the tv networks are better lawyers than mike lindell's lawyers

628
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,640
Because they're the only people who are like no we can't have you talking about your case on air

629
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,880
We're going to learn that mike actually just lost his lawyer

630
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,320
That makes sense a little bit later in this interview. That sounds right

631
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,760
So alex before he gets into the actual interview with mike lindell

632
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,360
He's gonna he's gonna talk a little bit about how the last hour was pretty heavy

633
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,760
And it was yes

634
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,400
I got pretty wound up last hour got into some heavy issues

635
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,400
But i'm just telling you where the globalists want to take us if they succeed they're going to fail

636
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,560
But as we get mike lindell back on and ready

637
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,480
Please remember we're lister supported and I thank you all and you're amazing

638
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,720
Uh, just like they tried to bankrupt and shut down mike lindell. They tried to shut us down

639
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,800
But thanks for your support. We're still on air and still more effective than ever

640
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,000
So we're introducing the brand new mega immune support supplements fun. Jesus. Yep

641
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,760
Oh if you add mega you're you're you've already admitted you're done, you know the moment you're like

642
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,360
You know the moment you're like, this is our mega health supplement. You're making bullshit up very much. So yeah

643
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:29,000
It's it's interesting to me though the way that alex spends an hour saying we're all dead. Everybody's dead. Fuck it

644
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,000
We're gonna die. It doesn't matter

645
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,920
We're all dead and then he sort of tries to walk it back there with like

646
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,440
I'm, just talking about what the globalists want to do if they win they're gonna lose

647
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,080
Like as if to undo

648
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,560
All that he did in the last hour

649
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:49,160
Yep, that hour could have been anything else than anything anything else. Yep. It was meaningless

650
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,440
It's a completely meaningless hour of just a guy

651
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,760
Trying to get people scared. Yeah, and and hopeless

652
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,000
I mean

653
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,960
Okay

654
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,080
so

655
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,040
What he did was spend an hour telling us that we're all gonna die

656
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:11,720
And then his way of apology is like this is only if they win and they're going to lose

657
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,840
Now that first hour would be valuable if you were giving me steps on how to make them lose

658
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,080
Uh, right because you you're giving me the intense fear

659
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,400
Oh, well, maybe yep. You know what? Never mind. You're right

660
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,120
That hour was incredibly important to letting me know why I need to buy those mega supplements

661
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,200
That's the that's the end. That's the destination of the walk that we were on. Oh, I'm so tired

662
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,280
That was a long walk to get there. You think you're tired. I do. Mike Lindell's tired. He works a lot. I believe that

663
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,480
Uh, Mike, great to finally get you on air with us. Thank you so much. Sincere. Oh, thanks for having me on

664
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,680
You're a busy guy working 20 hours a day. Wow

665
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,640
Yeah, I just landed. I'm in Michigan today. I've been going all around this country trying to get

666
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,280
This election pulled down and we will get it pulled down. So we're gonna 20 hour days trying to overturn the election

667
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,040
What are you doing for 20 hours? That's a really good question

668
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:11,560
I don't know what I don't know what what amount of work there is to be done on this front. I guess writing letters?

669
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,320
It could be

670
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:19,880
Um, traveling to another place and then writing letters? I guess there's no like time limit on talking shit. That's true

671
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:26,200
That's probably what he's doing. I mean does does it qualify as work if no one's around to hear you talk shit?

672
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:32,680
Is that our new like if a tree falls in the forest if Mike Lindell is telling you about the stolen election and no one's around to hear it?

673
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,200
If you're your own boss, you can count that as on the clock Alex. I think so. Yeah

674
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,520
Tax-deductible at least. Mike Lindell's got this argument about overturning the election, right? Sure. And

675
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,480
some arguments

676
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:52,920
Maybe they're three of a kind. Maybe they're a full house. Uh-huh. Not Mike's argument. No. Royal flush. Okay. All right

677
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,120
It's been a pretty amazing because it's like you're sitting here with a royal flush in a poker game

678
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:03,480
And we're just waiting to play it. We're gonna probably, you know, we're gonna bring it to the Supreme Court in July

679
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:10,040
As a full warrant. Oh, that's fast. It's just a matter of getting the word out to every every person in this country

680
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,960
Getting it out there. So the Supreme Court has pressure to accept it. Not a fucking chance

681
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:23,320
The Supreme Court has pressure to accept this case. Not a fucking chance. No. Yep. No

682
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:30,680
This seems to be the theme of what he's trying to get to is like we need to get everybody on board with this

683
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,680
So the Supreme Court can't reject it

684
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,440
I think he probably isn't stupid enough to think that that's really how things would work

685
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,040
I think he knows that by the time people realize that the Supreme Court's not going to take this case up

686
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
We still will have fleeced them

687
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:53,320
Tends to be the case. It does seem like you are always moving the date where we're gonna get that royal flush up

688
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,840
Oh, yeah, you got I mean you got to play, you know, you're never you're never pushing it back

689
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,560
You're never like hey we're on the date

690
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:05,800
You're always like and now next month we'll get there and you know what the the honest-to-god thing is that if he can get this

691
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,240
In front of the Supreme Court

692
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,160
Things are gonna move real fast. That's probably true. Things are going great

693
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,600
I couldn't be happier the way things are going in our country right now really said before our president be back

694
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,400
I said August I could be off by a month or two

695
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,960
This you've been quarterbacking the resistance and I believe in you and I know you've been behind the scenes

696
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,680
I've talked a lot of folks you've been working with. I'll leave it at that but

697
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,760
President Trump our real president in now in his second term with with the Chinese agent

698
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,360
Biden there this weekend as you know

699
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,720
He came out in the video saying oh, we're gonna take back the Senate

700
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,920
We're gonna take back the house and the White House sooner than you think and I've talked

701
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,760
With Trump he is really excited and he believes when the evidence comes out. There's a strategy

702
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,320
So wow, tell us about that

703
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,600
boy

704
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,600
Trump's gonna be president again in August

705
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,920
That is a lot sooner than I was expecting. Yeah, I I that was sooner than I planned for specifically

706
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:11,480
This is such a goddamn roller coaster. It's like the first hour is we're all gonna die and then Mike Lindell comes in

707
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,320
It's like no Trump will be president again within a few months. Yeah

708
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:22,440
Yeah, what? Yeah, the globalist plan seems very easy to sidestep how just completely

709
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:29,080
How are you supposed to feel if you're a listener to this show? It's so it's so untethered. You're dead in a year. Boo

710
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,040
President Trump. Yay

711
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,040
This is just how you go through this broadcast just a constant

712
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,280
Stream of look I'm bipolar and this is fucking with my yeah

713
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,360
If I took any of this seriously as being like it all

714
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,720
Based in reality. I would have a very difficult time

715
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,080
Emotionally surfing these waves. Yeah. Yeah

716
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:57,240
Yeah, no, one of the big things that I try and do to cope is is like lower the amount of intense emotional stimuli that

717
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,320
I receive I believe if I listen to you

718
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,400
One of these broadcast I would be running through the street screaming. That's why the

719
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,960
Delegation of labor is the way it yes, it makes it only way this could work. Yeah, so once the Supreme Court

720
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,560
In July gets a hold of this case. They're gonna rule nine to zero

721
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,960
You understand me

722
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,680
Unanimous I really think the best you're going for is five to four there

723
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,200
I don't think Roberts is gonna side with you guys nine zero

724
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,120
When that when the Supreme Court looks at this it's not subjective evidence

725
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,200
So it's gonna be nine zero not eight to one seven to two

726
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,760
It has to be nine zero because this is not this isn't subjective evidence

727
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,600
So they're gonna pull this down and now and now but everybody needs to know there's a couple other things

728
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:57,240
One is there were many down tickets to that were flipped especially with you know senators like John James both senators in Georgia

729
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:06,840
Jason Lewis from Minnesota many congressmen many I mean this wasn't just at the presidential level and and and in our country

730
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,320
I want everybody to know this there's no there's no statute of limitations on this everyone says come on Mike

731
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:20,520
That's too hard to believe. Well, let me tell you something. Uh, but you believe we've been in this position a year and a half ago. No

732
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:26,360
So and but I will tell you this every election in the United States is history

733
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,440
if you find out there was a crime committed after the fact or

734
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,080
That the other person won in any way. Let's say it was just a mistake whatever it was

735
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,280
They put the person that won back in office

736
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:45,020
They put the person that won back in office. And if there was a crime committed by the by anyone else they get arrested

737
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:52,520
That's right. Let's use the sports analogy that's happened hundreds of times prominently thousands of times in smaller cases where you find out the other team

738
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,760
cheated cheated

739
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:59,720
So the other team cheated they then forfeited and then it's given to who they actually cheated against

740
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,680
Do you notice how alex used a sports metaphor instead of an example from the world of politics?

741
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,460
It does seem like a sports metaphor has more opportunities

742
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah, like if you're in a boxing match and it later comes out that your opponent was on the juice or something like that

743
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,720
You might you know that you might end up having the other person forfeit. Yes, that's true

744
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,400
I'm hard pressed to come up with examples from

745
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,120
The history of our courts, I mean there have been instances where there were really close races sure and somebody who had won

746
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,320
Uh after a recount, you know, you they had uh flipped the winner sure or something like that

747
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:43,800
Yeah, I don't know if I can think of any example of what they're talking about now off the top of my head

748
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,420
I I would I would say the thing that's most surprising to me about this whole conversation

749
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,960
Is the idea that mike lindell was talking to somebody about this and was like we've got an open and shut case

750
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,020
It's all done and that person responded with no it's out of the statute of limitations

751
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:06,220
Right, right. And then mike lindell says there's no statute of limitations and this person goes

752
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,220
What?

753
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:15,100
Yeah, I can't believe that in that case in that case. I'm gonna relitigate. I think this is the way to do it

754
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,660
So like that's six. Was it 68?

755
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:23,340
Yeah, yeah, let's go back to the beginning. Yeah, I don't think tj won that election

756
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,340
That's what i'm gonna go out there right now. I think he stole it and you know, it's fucking awesome about that

757
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,580
Too you undo one of those past elections and it throws you all gotta do them all

758
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:37,180
You gotta start all over it throws everything into chaos because what if it was a two-term president totally then the second term

759
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,220
Yeah, yeah, the whole country has to reset from the beginning

760
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,620
We dig up george washington and we get him back in there. Yeah

761
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,420
I honestly think that that might be a better solution to this fanciful nonsense

762
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,880
Like I mean, this isn't a better solution up george washington. No, not exactly but sort of yeah metaphorically

763
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:04,860
If mike lindell were to be let me be clear really clear. Sure. None of this is gonna happen

764
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,100
Yeah, of course not if he were to have

765
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:15,180
Incontrovertible evidence that this election was stolen by foreign powers or whatever sure and he gets it to the supreme court and they vote nine zero

766
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,020
in july

767
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,020
I think the answer isn't put trump back in office. It's right a new constitution

768
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:25,580
Yeah, if our country has failed no complaints figure something better out

769
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,460
Frankly, we should already be starting the new constitution process as we speak

770
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,180
You know, but let's just take this country like an etch a sketch totally

771
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:40,140
We'll hold on to some of the good stuff. Sure some of the protections and rights. Yeah. Yeah, but

772
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,540
Anyway, mike lindell is being sued by dominion

773
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:50,220
I would even go so far as to rewrite that 13th amendment to include prisoners and not uh, you know

774
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,980
Just be like slaves are bad unless they committed a crime one time me

775
00:58:54,620 --> 00:59:01,180
So mike lindell is being sued by dominion and smartmatic, uh over claims, uh about their

776
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,860
Their computers and their technology being used. Uh

777
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:12,140
Intentionally to rig an election. Yeah. Yeah, that's a bit that's a big one. I think he's being sued for uh, it's in the billions

778
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:18,780
Yep. Yep. Yep. I think punitive damages would suggest that's a good idea. Now. There's something you may not have heard

779
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:25,500
What's that? Mike lindell is also suing them. I have not heard that. Yes. What crimes have they committed?

780
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:29,980
Um, you gotta watch his documentary. Oh, I can't do that. I can't do that. I'm sorry

781
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:36,460
We'll talk about it here in a minute. I made it. But anyway, um, he's suing them and there's a minor setback and that his lawyer quit

782
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,440
and

783
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,440
apparently

784
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:47,600
Apparently jordan, this is cancel culture. Oh, okay now last thursday. This is really key. I sued dominion

785
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,000
And smartmatic I threw them in there too because they're all in cahoots together

786
00:59:52,480 --> 01:00:00,020
And for two billion dollars, you didn't hear about that probably in the news, but I even put their lawyers as co-conspirators

787
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:07,280
I put down their lawyers because their lawyers have served papers either lawsuits or threatening letters to over

788
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:14,400
200 people in this country and and news outlets including fox and whoever so everybody lives in fear

789
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Of being sued. Well when I did that last thursday, I had to get a local council in minnesota

790
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:27,360
I got so many lawyers. I don't even know their names, but I got a local council in minnesota to serve them in minneapolis federal court

791
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,040
This law firm said yes, that's great. We'll do it. So we did it they signed up

792
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:39,840
They were attacked on thursday night by bots and trolls and email and the left and the communism

793
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:45,280
Who knows who all attacked them? So then on friday they fired the one of their lawyers

794
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,240
And said they did that they blamed it on that lawyer for even taking mike lindale's case

795
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:58,080
So they could get out there out from under the attack. It's just more cancel culture. It's cancel culture man. Oh boy

796
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,160
it just

797
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,640
Just seems like maybe they the law firm was more like whoops. Uh

798
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:11,440
I don't think the billable hours is worth this. Yes. Yeah, this is going to really be a drag

799
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,280
Yeah, we should uh, we thought we could go under the radar and just bill mike lindale for money

800
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,120
Oh, we looked at mike lindale's books and granted he's

801
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,360
Bizarrely rich for someone who has a pillow company. Um, but not that rich

802
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,080
We can let him go. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, he's got this new documentary

803
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,800
He has like these these documentaries have been like absolute proof. Sure absolute collusion

804
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:42,560
Sure, and now this new one is called absolute nine zero. Oh boy in honor of the supreme court. Yes

805
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:49,840
Yeah, yeah, this is the cyber evidence. Everybody needs to watch this video. It's absolutely nine zero

806
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:56,880
This is the cyber proof against dominion against all this it shows it shows china attacking our country

807
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,560
What they did so I like to give everyone a fair chance to be heard sure I went ahead and I watched this film

808
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,640
And I want to tell you this right off the bat. I was not convinced. Oh, no

809
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,760
I I think your standards of evidence are a little bit higher than the supreme courts though, dan

810
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:18,400
There's nothing persuasive in the film and it's honestly mostly just uh, mike talking into his phone like he's recording on his phone

811
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
His ear pods are in

812
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,320
He's talking to an alleged cyber expert whose face and voice is on the screen

813
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:28,720
He's talking to an alleged cyber expert whose face and voice are distorted. It is an anonymous person

814
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,280
Who knows what the fuck he is got to be anonymous

815
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:38,160
So what it boils down to is that mike is claiming that he has what's called packet captures or the raw information from these computers

816
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,880
That proves that votes were being changed on election night

817
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,620
He shows these long scrolls of numbers over and over again in the documentary

818
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,720
As if to insist that even though you can't read this code. It's so definitive that trump is going to be president again in no time

819
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,320
Mike does say multiple times that these scrolls of numbers are actually the packet captures that they're working from

820
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,160
That's a problem the washington post among others

821
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:08,800
Pointed out that the scrolls of numbers are not packet captures and they're not even in the right format that that information would be found

822
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,960
In this sort of data that's transmitted over the internet is generally in binary. Whereas this is all hexadecimal code

823
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,960
So it just doesn't even make sense what the claims that are being made

824
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,800
That's going to be a tough hurdle for him to uh jump at the supreme court

825
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:29,040
But if he's got this kind of proof, I don't know the post took a look at some of the code and translated it into readable

826
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:36,340
Uh letters mike lindell is a piece of shit. It appears to be the pennsylvania voter roll, which is publicly available information

827
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,600
Yeah, okay

828
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,120
It might be a safe assumption to believe that this scroll of numbers is a dumb prop and this pixelated cyber expert is someone

829
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:52,160
Doing some fun role-playing and this is just a bunch of bullshit. That sounds likely. Yep. Oh, man. Mm-hmm

830
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:01,040
There's an inverse relationship between confidence in a set of numbers that a pillow person cannot read and uh truth

831
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,360
Behind those numbers. Yeah

832
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,000
So alex, I don't know what it was. Like I think mike lindell was a little delayed

833
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,720
And so when he was like, oh we're gonna talk to the my pillow guy

834
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,800
It might have been a situation where it's like he's late sure for the interview and so like maybe that was what was frustrating him

835
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,040
Because alex is saying a number of positive things

836
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:26,080
He's being he's being pretty polite and positive and putting up with some clearly nonsensical things that might just be a good scene partner

837
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,160
Yeah, and I think what he's doing is he's chasing a contract that's not going to come. Yeah

838
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,800
It's a little too late the cash cow for mike lindell getting some of his money

839
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:40,340
Is a little bit in the past like a lot of those like oan or right side broadcasting

840
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,000
They could get any money they wanted from him. I'm sure you know

841
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:49,920
We saw those uh those rallies that were just like the coverage for these networks were entirely sponsored

842
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,160
Yeah, and like I think that alex maybe would want some of that. I mean I would if I were him

843
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,000
It's easy money. Yeah, I think when I think it's too late

844
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,680
He's getting sued for millions or billions of dollars when it comes to principles versus gaining money

845
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,720
I think alex is going to go for gaining money every single time

846
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,440
But that money just won't be there for long. Yeah, I think it's too late. He's uh, he's fishing in a dry well

847
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,920
Um, but he does say some nice things about mike and uh then accidentally a my pillow commercial breaks out

848
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Oh, no, my listeners still love trump, but I love trump. I want to run for president again

849
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,960
He is our president. I want to run for the speaker house, whatever he wants

850
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,760
But from a listener's view on the street people started asking more often. Do you know mike lindell?

851
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,640
Instead of you know trump because it's an example

852
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,920
People want action

853
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,840
They want somebody to stand up and I know trump had to lick his wounds get ready totally cut off a few months to

854
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,360
Exercise lose weight trump's fucking great. He's giving speeches

855
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,880
The threat to arrest his whole family would set up bogus stuff. He doesn't back down

856
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:02,480
I'm, not criticizing trump when I hold up mike lindell. I'm saying he's the example of putting it all on the line

857
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,200
Uh and and being there so I know you don't want to bring this up i'm bringing up right now. How do people

858
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,640
Support with all the attacks you're under fighting the globalist

859
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,240
How do people support the work you're doing because I know you're separate from my pillow with your your political action

860
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,880
But how do people do that so they can buy the pillows and then finance what you're doing?

861
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,360
Finance what you're doing. Wait, I thought you I thought that my pillow was separate from the political stuff user

862
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,360
But it finances the political stuff

863
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,840
That's suspicious

864
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,400
Well, you know that the best way is because you know dominion attacked my employees soon

865
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,640
We've lost all our retailers. So people have really stepped up but you could you could use the promo code mike today

866
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:48,640
Just use mike and you can save up to 66 on all our products. That's a lot. This goes on a while, too

867
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:54,240
This this this ad is not short. Mike has created a new bed that he plugs. Sure. Sure

868
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:00,800
Oh boy. Yep. I want I need to sue for something for alex

869
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:07,840
I need to sue for like extreme gaslighting for alex insisting to me that trump licked his wounds by exercising

870
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:12,640
Yeah, he was doing set ups. I want I there needs to be punitive damages for that

871
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:18,960
Yeah, something because you can't do that. That's just wrong. Carpe donkdom is gonna put out a uh,

872
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,240
compilation of like uh, uh set to eye of the tiger of trump like boxing

873
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,240
Show me show me one heaven

874
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:31,920
Meat hanging in a in a in a locker show me an example of him working out one picture. I don't know

875
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,360
I don't know. I just think this is more masculine hero worship nonsense totally. That's so disgusting

876
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,920
So I think that this next clip is one of the weirder things that i've heard happen on the show

877
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,200
Ever. Um, you know, there's there's there's things that are bizarre ideas that are bizarre. Sure

878
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,160
And then there are things that just happen that i'm like how did that happen? That's weird

879
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:57,200
And this is one of those it's the latter thing. It's not a weird idea. All right. I just don't know how this happened

880
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,040
Okay, we're gonna do what i'm gonna do in I mean now see on your show right now as we speak

881
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:09,920
Um in july i'm gonna get a place, uh some big location. I don't care

882
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,040
Michael and l stay there. I gotta you know about tv already. I got hard breaks satellites stay there

883
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,600
We'll come right back in a few minutes. I want to hear this big announcement. Alex almost never does that

884
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,320
He runs into the brakes all the time

885
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,840
Whether it's like I will skip this break that used to do that

886
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,360
Yeah, but even multiple times on this episode he's just in the middle of a sentence and it goes to break. That's so great

887
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,920
Why would he interrupt mike lindell in the middle of the big announcement?

888
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:41,360
That's the best time to interrupt somebody i'm gonna announce people on to on this show

889
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,800
Right now i'm sorry. We gotta go to break shit

890
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:51,360
You're breaking the flow a little bit. I guess I do understand it, you know from a presentation standpoint

891
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,960
You would want it to be clean. Yeah, you want the full announcement all at once

892
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,640
You don't want to announce the first half and then we'll be back at break and then you announce the second

893
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,840
No, no, that makes sense. Yeah, but not for alex. No, not for alex. No, not for alex

894
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:10,400
No, and I would uh, I would assume that most professionals would know that a big announcement was about to happen on their show

895
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,160
if you

896
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,160
if you were going to

897
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:20,240
Also, I mean just from a professional standpoint as an interviewee if you're going to make a big announcement

898
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:24,560
You should know if it's going to be broken up. Yeah. Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah

899
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,040
So anyway, are you ready here to the announcement? Let's do it

900
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,200
You were you we were going to break you had a big announcement. What is the big announcement?

901
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,520
Yeah, well, this is just part of the plan, but the big announcement is um

902
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,680
If all the cyber evidence I have all this stuff from the day before the election the election the two days after all those packets

903
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,240
They're called packet captures everybody since I went public with that in on an absolutely nine zero

904
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,640
I got all kinds of companies from all over the united states

905
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:02,640
Cyber companies that are cyber white hat hackers cyber companies said hey, we'd like to look at that and validate that pay us in bitcoin

906
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:08,160
Sometime in july i'm gonna get either. I don't care if it's us big stadium

907
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:15,680
I don't care how big it has to be i'm gonna invite all of these white cyber, um experts in

908
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:21,120
And I want to televise all of them can be there the whole world can watch

909
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:26,160
The whole world can watch and I don't care if there's a hundred of these companies there here it is

910
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:33,280
And I want them all to say on on on tb and everywhere. Wow. There it is hundred percent. There it is. There it is

911
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,160
It's like showing a royal flush in a poker game and everyone going does everybody see it?

912
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,680
Hello

913
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:45,200
That election's coming down. Um, i'm not gonna hold my breath on uh this event happening. Yeah

914
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,760
I would argue it's less like

915
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,120
Showing people a royal flush while you're playing a game of poker and more like instead of having cards

916
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,760
You throw a dead horse on the table and you're like see

917
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,920
I won

918
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,680
Well, technically he would have something to show them. I guess it would be more like he's got a two. Yeah

919
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,040
Um the death card from a tarot deck naturally the instruction card, right?

920
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
um

921
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,600
That nolan ryan's, uh, rookie baseball card and a piece of non. Yes, exactly. Yeah

922
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,120
Royal flush, baby. What kind of looks like cards?

923
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,520
uh

924
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,800
Yeah

925
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:30,640
I don't know. I I would love for this to happen though. I do think it would be chaotic on a level

926
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,220
It would rival the uh, the the landscaping

927
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,760
four seasons

928
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,080
Yeah, yeah, that would be pretty delightful

929
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:46,080
I was just thinking like I wonder if even if a ransomware company if he would even notice if his

930
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:51,120
Computers were locked and he can't get into his business software unless he paid 10 million in bitcoin

931
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,200
He'd be like, oh no

932
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:59,360
And then just record on his phone like he wouldn't even fucking care. Yeah. Yeah, or it would be cancel culture

933
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,000
Yes, it would be cancel culture. So mike's got one last little thing, uh to say here and uh,

934
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:09,360
This is where I you know, it's kind of getting a little bit worried that maybe mike is a bit of a christian zealot

935
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,360
In the same vein as alex

936
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,240
Everybody needs to pray. That's the number one thing for mike

937
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,520
And and everything he's doing

938
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:24,400
Yeah, thank you. And I thank everybody for your prayers and I believe I do believe that we're in the greatest revival ever

939
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,840
People aren't looking for hope unless things are bad we get through this

940
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,120
It's going to be once again one one nation under god, but it's the biggest revival for jesus in history

941
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,840
Everybody right now is just they're praying and we are our prayers are answered

942
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:44,080
They have been answered over and over here. Remember god's got his hand in all of this. This is on god's timing

943
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,680
Can you imagine if this would have been flipped back in uh, december?

944
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,640
You might have had a you know, democrats not believing that they really that it really got stole

945
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,800
Well now when the supreme court pulls this down those nine supreme court justices are going to be heroes

946
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,960
They're protecting our country from china and whether you're a democrat or republican

947
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,640
It's going to be a united and as long as your message gets out we win

948
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,160
So, I don't know. I don't know if you quite grasped what he was saying there at the end

949
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,920
He's saying that like if if trump had been put back in like right after the election or whatever

950
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,800
Yeah, democrats would have been really mad. No, but now democrats all know the election was

951
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,640
Was a scam. Well, we all watched absolutely nine zero. Yes

952
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,040
so and so now the we will

953
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:33,920
We will carry the supreme court justices out of chambers on our shoulders chanting and cheering. Thank you

954
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:41,040
Thank you. Thank you three and a half more years of trump three and a half more years. I think he gets time served

955
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,760
I disagree, sir

956
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,920
I have to take that up with mike

957
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,960
I'll take it to the supreme court

958
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:55,840
So mike lindale takes off and alex has another guest on uh for another the last hour. Uh-huh

959
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,840
And uh, it's a it's a fellow we know uh, he's a rat fucker

960
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:05,280
Oh boy, he's uh, here we go. Mary prankster. All right. All right this bastard

961
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,880
Uh, roger stone is back and he wants to talk about the good old days

962
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,720
Those were the days that he would like to talk about I assume yeah

963
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:21,120
There was a time when both parties just had two different governing philosophies a more liberal philosophy a more conservative philosophy

964
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,960
On finances on fiscal matters on foreign policy matters. This is no longer the case you have now we want to overthrow

965
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,200
We want to overthrow democracy america first party under donald trump

966
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:40,400
And you have the other party that has been completely co-opted by the red chinese. I think this is abundantly clear

967
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:46,720
Their party will not denounce radical islam. What think about that the party of harry truman?

968
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,040
What?

969
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,960
Why is truman in here truman has nothing to do with radical islam?

970
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:59,920
I don't connect with you generally. I wasn't like hey, it wasn't like radical islam defeats. Truman is the

971
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,720
Headline he was holding up. You don't know about dewy

972
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,160
Um

973
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,160
yeah, I I think I

974
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,280
um

975
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,520
I don't know. I lose patience for people who make these two arguments together

976
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,880
They like there was a time when both parties loved the country

977
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:24,080
Sure, and now we have all coalesced around a charismatic leader with a america first slogan and then the other people

978
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:30,960
Everybody else are co-opted by the comments. Yes, exactly. Yes. It is us against them with no middle ground

979
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,720
Yes, but oh I miss the days when everyone used to be able to do middle ground

980
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,040
We used to be able to do middle ground all the time when I was working for nixon the main thing

981
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,120
That we did in our administration

982
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:47,840
Reaching out to the other aisle. Yeah, that's what we did. Definitely and when I was working with reagan

983
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:55,280
We reached out across the aisle to destroy those unions. That was our plan. Yeah, and what?

984
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:00,800
Jesus christ, so roger has a belief and that is that trump is the greatest president since lincoln

985
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,880
He is the greatest president since abraham lincoln I agree maybe since washington, so let me ask you this

986
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,800
What do we do then? Because we're just sitting here watching the country destroyed and I understand I don't want a civil war

987
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,200
They're trying to start one. Anyways, what do we do then?

988
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,280
But you can go to roger stone's plan to save america.com. That's a long url

989
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,400
That's a little that's not happening buddy. No, you gotta trim that up

990
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,160
Get a bitly or something

991
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:41,680
Don't have a website that requires an apostrophe. That's what I that's all i'm saying. It's too confusing for people you're trying to target

992
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,400
Especially for those people. Yeah

993
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,960
Please check out my website

994
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:53,060
Www.rogerstone's got some wonderful ideas that will have very much helped this country get back on track.com

995
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,560
Oh god, I went to this website and it's just one of these

996
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,760
Uh-huh. It's just one of these awesome things that just the people on the right do this all the time

997
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,320
They're so good at this and that is just it's a donation landing page. Yep

998
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:15,680
And I have a plan that will save america put in your email address and i'll send it to you

999
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,160
Got it. Just try to build up an email list roger's trying to get back on his hustle. Jesus

1000
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:24,560
Yeah, so this is his uh transition back into being able to direct market to people. Yeah

1001
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,440
Um, so good good good on him. Yeah, great

1002
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,600
Yeah, I bet he could take it. I bet he could get a job working for greenwald at this point

1003
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,440
Working on that sub stack. That might be that might be a good way for stone to go greenwald and stone. Yeah

1004
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,200
The new well manifold went down

1005
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:47,280
So greenwald's the next obvious choice right get uh get at water in there and you gotta you got a consulting firm

1006
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,080
Oh, man

1007
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,280
I wonder if greenwald would know how shitty he's become if I

1008
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,840
Really told him that he and roger stone are equal now. That'd be bad

1009
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,520
So you may have some ideas about greenwald, but roger's got some ideas about fauci

1010
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,640
Hitler, okay

1011
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,640
All right. Fauci will be remembered

1012
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:12,000
As hitler that sounds strange. I think tony fauci is going to go down with adolf hitler

1013
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:18,720
Joseph stalin and chairman mao is one of the great mass murderers of all time and those who say what are you talking about?

1014
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:24,080
Millions of people have taken this vaccination have had no reaction to which I say. Yeah

1015
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,080
Ah

1016
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:34,080
Well, I have been roundly outsmarted roger stone shit I didn't think of that

1017
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,480
That's certainly not an argument that

1018
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,920
Can't be made about everything. No, no, no, no that one. No, nope

1019
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:52,880
Very dumb, how about uh, how about we just apply that to literally any and all arguments with roger stone from now on just say

1020
01:18:52,880 --> 01:19:00,240
Yet. Yeah, not yet. Oh, no, they'll never kill trump. Not yet. Oh now you've been defeated, sir

1021
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:08,000
Oh, yeah, fuck off. So, uh, one of the big things about mike lindell's interview was that trump is going to be president again

1022
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:13,040
Imminently. Yes. He's going to be put right back in that august maybe a little bit later couple months

1023
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,080
Maybe couple months max august. Maybe i'm a little bit off couple months

1024
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:22,080
You never know how long the supreme court is going to take with arguments, you know, totally and there's literally no

1025
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:28,720
Uh protocol for reinstating a president. No, I don't think we've ever done that one before so I

1026
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,880
I would think that there might be conversations that would last quite a while about that

1027
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,840
Um, but yeah a couple months anyway, it would have been funny if after harding they were like listen

1028
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,800
I mean, this is too soon. We're just gonna redo it

1029
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,080
So that's mike's big thing

1030
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,560
Now roger is on right after

1031
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:55,440
No, he's not into it. Okay now I should also tell you just as a way to give a little bit of context for this

1032
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,360
this next uh

1033
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:03,440
Uh clip roger his wife apparently has just recently been diagnosed with cancer and that's awful

1034
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,600
Yeah, I hope the best for her, uh recovery that sucks. However

1035
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,040
Alex takes that information

1036
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,460
And tries to turn roger's wife's diagnosis

1037
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:20,340
Into a vaccine talking point. Wow, and if I were roger, I would be furious

1038
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:27,620
Well, first of all, look I have great respect for mike lindell who's doing an extraordinary job and spending his own money putting his

1039
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:33,540
His mouth his money where his mouth is try to undercover the election fraud in all these states parenthesis

1040
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:39,940
I would never do that. Listen, I make the subjective judgment that even then turning over the election will be very difficult

1041
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,540
I really hope to be wrong. I hope mike lindell is right

1042
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,860
I hope the president's instinct is correct at the moment. I've got to be honest with you

1043
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:55,380
I'm, so distracted with my wife's cancer treatments and the tsunami of contradictory medical advice that we're trying to sort through

1044
01:20:55,780 --> 01:21:03,460
And the millions and millions of phds and doctors and professionals as well as holistic and homeopathic healers

1045
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:08,500
Who've contacted us trying to help us? It's heartwarming. It really is but it's also

1046
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:14,580
Overwhelming it is. Hey roger. What do you make of so many people that get the inoculation and get cancer in a few months?

1047
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:21,140
Uh, that's what all these scientists are saying. It's doing i've got a new article out of florida out of palm beach close to where you live

1048
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,980
I don't get into your own private life. I don't know if you made this public or not. You didn't take the vaccine

1049
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,420
But did anybody else, you know take the vaccine recently? They just got cancer

1050
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:35,940
Well, uh, no, but I can tell you that uh that my uh, a member of my family did take it not my wife

1051
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,720
A member of my family did take it not my wife just disgusting

1052
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:42,580
Just absolutely disgusting

1053
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:47,460
No, uh, but I can tell you that you're a disgusting monster

1054
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:54,100
Uh that you have just decided to turn my wife's cancer diagnosis into a prop for your own bullshit

1055
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:59,700
And normally i'm fine with that but this is my fucking wife. We're talking about you asshole

1056
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:03,060
Yeah, I mean he's brought up, uh on this interview a couple times

1057
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:08,660
Like I wouldn't pull clips of it to to discuss because it's you know his private life and you know, sure

1058
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:13,860
That's very difficult. It's not what we do a loved one. Uh have uh have a medical condition like that

1059
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,540
And uh, he's brought it up a couple times and it seems like something that is

1060
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:24,020
You know kind of scary and something that is difficult to deal with for even for a slimy fuck like roger

1061
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:29,380
yeah, and I I would rather make fun of his terrible positions than

1062
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:33,220
A legitimate tragedy and pain that he's going through

1063
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:38,660
Yeah, so he's brought it up a number of times and for alex to now do that

1064
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:42,600
Is so insulting it is so exploitative

1065
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,420
It's because if alex is listening to him, he has to recognize that like this isn't

1066
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:54,180
Like roger's polonium poisoning right? Right. Right. This is actually real. This is real. Yeah. Yeah

1067
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,340
I mean

1068
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,940
Here's the thing. Here's the other hand I have for that which is just

1069
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:08,020
Roger and alex have both done this to so many people in the past where they've exploited their personal shit for their propaganda that it's like

1070
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:12,020
Hey, you live by the sword you die by the sword. Of course. This was going to happen

1071
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:16,260
I guess you know you can't roger can't feel insulted

1072
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,900
Without wrestling with his own behavior, I guess you know

1073
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:26,740
So I can feel insulted on his behalf because I haven't taken his wife's cancer and used it as a prop

1074
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:32,420
Nor have I taken anybody's cancer and used it as a prop. It's just low, you know, like it's low. It's low

1075
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:38,100
It's a real bummer. It's a it's a it's a it's a real real bummer to be sitting here

1076
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:44,500
I'm, like I hate both of these people but alex is really edging out in terms of who I hate more in this interaction

1077
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:50,100
Yep. Yep. I I can't I can't imagine what it would feel like to do that the way alex is doing that too like

1078
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:54,260
Uh, hey, this this article is from close to where you live

1079
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:00,580
There's all these people who are getting cancer after getting the shot. Did anybody you know who maybe just got cancer?

1080
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:04,580
Yep, like say it was your wife. It's such a leading question kind of thing

1081
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:08,820
It's like please use your use your wife's condition as a as a way

1082
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,700
To make my narratives work better for me to make money off of you're around cancer people now

1083
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,300
You go to the treatments all the time

1084
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:20,980
So you gotta know a bunch of people with cancer tell me which ones took the vaccine and then let's go turn that pain into

1085
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:27,140
Profit totally totally and my profit not yours, by the way. No, because nobody's gonna get to your dumb url you idiot

1086
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:31,220
Yeah, they're gonna put that apostrophe in and get lost exactly. It's never happening

1087
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:37,060
Yeah, so you have one last clip here and I I really do think that this is so indicative of like

1088
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:42,820
Present-day alex and why it's just this this shit's meaningless. It's just a bad person doing a bad job

1089
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,500
Uh, because you know at the beginning of the show, like I said, it's an hour of him

1090
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,660
Just talking about how everyone's dead. It just doesn't matter and here's what he says

1091
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,300
at the end of the show

1092
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,420
Sometimes I start the show the best of moods end up bad moods

1093
01:24:56,420 --> 01:25:00,740
Sometimes I start the bad mood in a good mood as rob doodler in the hall was telling me earlier man

1094
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,740
You're in a good mood now you're in a bad mood throughout the show

1095
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:07,140
You know, I appreciate listeners that tune into this show because you're not looking for lies

1096
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:12,180
You're looking for truth and the truth hurts sometimes but we got to admit that truth to get through the bad and you know

1097
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,740
Make it a better world. So I appreciate you all going through this

1098
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,300
just like i'm doing it and

1099
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:23,140
so many days at the end of the show i've got like the most powerful stuff we had I haven't hit yet because

1100
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:27,380
I've already looked at it two or three times and it's already got me pissed

1101
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,820
Yeah, man, the news got him pissed so he can't cover the news can't do can't convey the information

1102
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:36,180
That is the information part of the information war but he can

1103
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:42,580
Uh, take his feelings and project them onto the audience and lash out like a little baby in a way that reduce

1104
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,660
releases endorphins or gets him feeling better

1105
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:52,100
Remember when he was yelling about how he had a migraine and then he yelled he called the pope this the devil and he felt

1106
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:58,660
Better. Yep. It's just that but with the audience. He's just he just needs to get his emotions out. Yeah. Yeah this like

1107
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,620
Yeah, this is I I think any good

1108
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:06,520
Acid therapist or psychologist would be able to correctly diagnose

1109
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:12,040
The relationship alex has with his listeners as incredibly abusive parasitic

1110
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:17,720
Uh, I feel like what he just did and what we listen to of him telling me that everybody's gonna die

1111
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:24,440
And then him feeling better at the end of it and me being left alone with this feeling that is domestic violence

1112
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,400
I feel abused this is fucking bullshit. It is but it's it's

1113
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:34,600
You know, obviously it's not that bad because you and I at least know that he's full of shit

1114
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:41,080
Sure, and it doesn't affect us in any way that we're taking what he says seriously, right? But like if you did

1115
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,800
You would be

1116
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:50,520
Being taken for a ride. Yeah, alex would be trying to make you feel his emotions and leave you holding the bag

1117
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:54,680
Yes, total of the bad emotions totally and that's just uh, not cool

1118
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:00,520
I am getting my bad out emotions out of me and giving them to you because you deal with them and

1119
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:06,840
That last clip gave me a little bit of a hint that maybe he's a little bit

1120
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:14,520
subconsciously aware that that's what he does could be a little bit which is gross and it could be that rob doo has

1121
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:21,800
Told him specifically and maybe that conversation with rob doo is him trying to be like alex. Yeah, you did it again. Yep

1122
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:28,440
So wow, what a fucked up. Jesus. I listened to this episode and there's something that's kind of like well, that's a

1123
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,320
Intense psychodrama. Yeah, that's going on

1124
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:38,440
Yeah, obviously and and it's monumental that michael and elle the my pillow guy is on the show that's not happened before

1125
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,680
This is a meeting of the minds

1126
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,760
And trump's gonna be president again after a nine zero. No, I still don't think that's happening. I still don't think that's happening

1127
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:52,200
We will see we will see what yet yet. So but you know look

1128
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,760
Looking at this in especially in juxtaposition with the 2003 stuff

1129
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:02,040
Like it doesn't feel like alex is taking his moods out in 2003

1130
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:08,600
It does not feel like he's just having a kind of uh lashing out at a microphone. Yeah, no

1131
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,480
And that's kind of why it's better

1132
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:18,840
You can't I mean there's just no way to view our time with alex as anything other than watching a man descend into madness, right?

1133
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:24,200
Like we're we're doing a it's apparently lucrative madness. I mean we're doing a

1134
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,720
27-year heart of darkness situation

1135
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:36,760
We're watching colonel kurtz, that's what we're doing. Yeah, maybe oh mr. Kurtz he dead

1136
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:44,920
And uh, alex is just a mess. Um, anyway, uh, this has been our adventure on june 10th

1137
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,600
Yes, we'll be back

1138
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,240
It has been an adventure. It has been an adventure. We'll be back. But until then, uh, we have a website

1139
